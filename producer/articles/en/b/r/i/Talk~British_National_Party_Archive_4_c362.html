<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Guardian's infiltration</span></h2>
<p>I think that the Guardian article raised a number of ethical questions. The publication of workplace details of BNP members can only be seen as a form of McCarthyism, designed to incite harassment or victimisation. It's fine to scrutinise those who stand for political office but I don't see the public interest in the publication of personal details of ordinary members. I hope that they will not suffer discrimination or worse as a result. If they do then I think Ian Cobain will be directly responsible.</p>
<p>BNP weblogs are also saying that Ian Cobain signed a Data Protection Act form pledging confidentiality. Has the Guardian broken the law?</p>
<p>No one should be discriminated against on account of their political views whether they are Muslim activists, Socialists or members of the BNP. - Art of War 217.38.66.18 17:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I agree, if the bnp is wrong and bad then fine, but two wrongs dont make a right. The Guardian probably has broken the law but as is so often the case with so called 'extreme' political parties, the main 3 parties turn a blind eye (<a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 17:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>"Ian Cobain signed a Data Protection Act" As far as I know you don't sign data protection acts, since everyone in the UK (and the EU afaik) are covered by it anyway, personal information is protected under the general Data Protection Act and if the information published by the Guardian can be used to identify the individuals then they broke the law. I'm not sure what the law would be regarding the information if the Guardian had gained it by a request to a public authority however. The Guardian may have signed an NDA, Non-Disclosure Agreement which means they would be bound by contract to not release the information. (MalUK86 06:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article is horribly biased..</span></h2>
<p>Im rather annoyed by the obvious but hidden prejudice and bias against the bnp throughout the article. Throughout it is portraying the bnp as thugs and skinheads. When in reality, this is not the case. Almost all violence in bnp rallies has been caused by anti-bnp protesters, mostly drunk, looking for a fight. The bnp has a voice and has a right to it. So this article being biased against the bnp is not only against wikipedia policies, it is against everything democracy stands for. I will be changing the article in the future to allow for an unbiased opinion on the subject (not me..im biased but will not hide it, unlike narrow minded communists who attempt to hide their poltical views whilst editing articles) (<a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 15:55, 28 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>I personally would like to see reputable proof of both sides of the coin so to speak before making a judgement, but then I have yet to set in stone my views on the BNP. Oh and I've tried to find where it states anything about violence at BNP rallies in the article anyway and I'm having trouble; it merely states previous convictions of BNP members specifically to support certain aspects of the violence and criminal behaviour area. --MalUK86 05:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">'Front' group</span></h2>
<p>As a member of Solidarity who is also a Socialist I was intrigued to see the Union described as a 'BNP front'. It certainly enjoys both Third Way and BNP support. That is mainly because members of both organisations have been the subject of witch-hunts in the established Unions. Clearly their members still recognise the need for collective protection and organisation in the workplace (wasn't that why Unions were formed in the first place?). It doesn't follow a BNP agenda and is not reliant for the BNP for funds. To describe it as a 'front group' is pretty simplistic in my view. Many people are disgruntled with the cronyism and corruption in many TUC affiliated Unions. I personally am interested in many of the political issues covered in Trade Unions journals (like the people who write them) but I dare say that many ordinary workers find them irrelevant and partisan. The fact that the likes of the CWU continue to finance New Labour with a reactionary, anti-working class, warmongering policy platform is a provocation. The established unions have really failed to effectively tackle cheap non-unionised labour and offshoring. They've sold us out. I feel that Solidarity will attract far wider support than the BNP ever could.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article simply states that there is evidence that they are a front group, but that this does not necessairily make them so. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:02, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article goes a little further than that. The wording implies that Solidarity is a front group. One possible reason that they might deny being a 'front' is that they are genuinely independent! This doesn't seem to have been recognised by the user who wrote this section. The whole logic of saying that because some organisers are members of the BNP they are a front is twisted. On that basis you could condemn many independent groups as Conservative, Liberal or New Labour 'fronts'. In the building industry there is a safety campaign with many former/present Workers Revolutionary Party members involved. Is it a 'front' for the WRP? I don't think so and it does very good work! - Art of War</p>
<p>I note that in Issue 78 of the BNP newspaper 'Voice of Freedom' whilst a plug is given to Solidarity in an article stressing that it doesn't discriminate against BNP members they also urge their supporters who hold membership of other unions to opt out of the political fund and deny support to New (Cheap) Labour. The relationship between Solidarity, the BNP and TUC affiliated unions appears quite complex to me and this is not reflected in the Wikipedia article. - Dissident Voice</p>
<p>Of course it's a front group. How could it be otherweise? "Solidarity's" management team consists of John Walker (BNP Treasurer), Clive Potter (BNP candidate), Jay Lee (BNP Candidate), Lee Barnes (BNP Head of Legal Affairs). The chairman is Patrick Harrington (of Third Way rather than the BNP), but a veteran of far right politics, a former leader of the NF and close contact of BNP leader Griffin. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see that you are relying on a BNP press statement for information as to who is on the Executive of Solidarity (as does Wikipedia)! Not a good idea. Pat Harrington has a quite separate position from that of the BNP and Third Way directly recruits amongst all ethnic and religious communities. Why not say that he is a 'close contact' of veteran anti-Fascist Larry O'Hara? Or indeed any number of other people of various political persuasions. Doesn't that fit the script?</dd>
</dl>
<p>- Art of War</p>
<p>'Why not say that he is a 'close contact' of veteran anti-Fascist Larry O'Hara?' Because this article is about the BNP and the connections between it and Solidarity - nothing to do with Larry O'Hara. That's just a ridiculous divergence in an argument you cannot win.--Ketlan 06:42, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If a reader were to click the solidarity link to see the solidarity article and read they will find that citations have been included offering both sides of the argument, and therefore should be free to make up their own mind as to whether it is a front or not, however most will probably not bother checking beyond the BNP article so I added the links there too. I also removed the solidarity picture which is not required, none of the other alledged fronts have a picture so why add one for solidarity? --MalUK86 05:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Query_about_allied_companies" id="Query_about_allied_companies"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Query about allied companies</span></h2>
<p>The BNP has a number of companies attached that can't really be described as affiliated. Albion Life can because it states its affiliation clearly on its site. However, <a href="http://www.brightahomes.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.brightahomes.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Brightahomes</a> and <a href="http://www.skiphireregister.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.skiphireregister.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Skip Hire Register</a> are companies that are run by the BNP as fundraisers but do not state their connection with the party. Perhaps there ought to be another section - Fake Companies.--Ketlan 10:43, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have you any evidence that the company mentioned are BNP fronts? RichardLangford 21:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yep. The only link out from Albion Life goes to brightahomes.co.uk and the only link from that is to skiphireregister.co.uk. A WHOIS check shows that the registrant of the domain skiphireregister.co.uk is Steve Blake, also the registrant of the BNP website. Blake is also the registrant for Albion Life. Pretty clear really.--Ketlan 23:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Define fake company. According to this <a href="http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185" class="external text" title="http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185" rel="nofollow">article</a> albionlife could be a defined as a "fake company", but as for the others you mentioned... As for Steve Blake as the registrant, that article indicates he is the webmaster for the BNP so it could be assumed the other sites registered by him are BNP fronts though this is only speculative, and not hard facts. --MalUK86 06:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I can see the name has only been used twice; once following the merging of the White Defence League and the National Labour Party in 1960 or thereabouts, and in 1982 when Tyndall renamed the New National Front to the BNP (which name remains to date).

<p>As an Australian I'm not terribly familiar with British politics but I must say the entire page seems heavily slanted against the BNP. Maybe the entire article should be rewritten from a more neutral point of view. Yes I do understand the BNP touches on controversial and sensitive topics, and some feel morally obliged to protest the stance of the BNP, but wikipedia is not the place. It's very unlikely you will change someone's views by writing a biased article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Far Right Position Is Questionable</span></h2>
<p>I would like to point out that the position of the BNP on the traditional left-right political spectrum can be brought under scruntiny. It would be more accurate to refer the BNP as an Authoritarian Socialist party using a more versitile multi-dimensional ideological postioning system, as this quote from <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/extremeright" class="external free" title="http://www.politicalcompass.org/extremeright" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicalcompass.org/extremeright</a> illustrates:</p>
<p>"The difference between the BNP and the Greens in economics isn't great, but there's a huge gap on the social scale."</p>
<p>The diagram is also useful. I realize that I'm not essentially criticising the facts of the article, but more the system used. This is however true of society in general. If a group is identified as xenophobic or racist they are instantly associated with the "far right". The authoritarian left can be just as bigotted and tyrannical.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Indeed, the BNP seems to believe in largely centre-left economics(in agreement with the above quote). Labelling the party far-right does seem incredibly naive, but then so does labelling it far-left, as some pundits have. To be fair, it's neither. 'Authoritarian centre' might be more accurate, but I'm just speculating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, I'm amazed at this quote from the relevant section of the article - "Rather, the description of them as 'far-right' relates to their nationalist and collectivist policies". Surely, the 'left' can be just as nationalist and collectivist as the 'right'? For example, anarchism which is usually labelled as far-left, is the epitome of collectivism, whilst no-one can deny that figures such as Stalin and Gandhi were both strongly nationalist as well as left-wing, as it were. Consequently, any system which places these two individuals close togther on the political spectrum, considering their vastly different opinions on the state, needs a rethink.</dd>

<dd>Agreed, but most people recognise left/right easily and many sources call the BNP 'far-right'. However, to also mention something such as the political compass (which itself has its critics) to clarify for the reader could be useful. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. I think there's a certain circularity to the objections. 'Far right' is in common usage to mean the sort of politics the BNP espouses. 'Far right' does not mean and never has meant extreme economic liberalism. The political compass seems to be assuming the mantle of dogma here. It's a useful analysis but it's not [i]the[/i] analysis. <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogville_7eee.html" title="User:Dogville">Dogville</a> 22:51, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think the term far right has any factual basis and should be removed from the article. We live in a time of mass propaganda and because of this that the media and rival politicians like to use the highly inaccurate term.</p>
<p>I don't think Authoritarian Socialist would be a good description either as Authoritarian and democratic don't sit well together, The BNP is showing it's commitment to democracy by taking part in elections. RichardLangford 21:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having looked at the edits, I'm not sure why "the BNP and others argue" is less weasel-wordy than "some argue"; although it's certainly more clumsy. But the claim that the BNP's relative lack of success is simply ascribable to the FPP system is hardly obviously factual (other factors, like lack of widespread popular support for overt racism, might play a part). So I think keep "some argue" as in this case it's simply true.

The BNP is all of these to be quite honest, or at least 90% of them. An authoritarian party wouldn't be a party at all, arguably anyway. Another quote: <i>Authoritarianism describes a form of government characterized by strict obedience to the authority of the state, which often maintains and enforces social control through the use of oppressive measures. The term may also be used to describe the personality or management style of an individual or organization which seeks to dominate those within its sphere of influence and has little regard for building consensus.</i> <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 08:06, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm sorry, but the BNP is still a party, authoritarian or not, until such time that it gets into power, at which point it will cease to be a party, and become a permanent authority.

Therefore their presence in a party’s manifesto does not mean that said party is right-wing; if anything, said party is fascist. Fascism lies on the vertical scale, along with authoritarianism. They are parallel. The horizontal scale is purely about economic issues, not social ones.--<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainSurrey_9d82.html" title="User:CaptainSurrey">CaptainSurrey</a> 22:56, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. The BNP are actually slightly to the left of center on the economic axis, I think. However, they are extremely authoritarian, racist, anti-intellectual, etc - these are all social ideologies rather than economic ones. The descriptions of far-left, far-right (etc) are crude and simplistic descriptions that can often be misleading. Far-right would more accurately describe a regime like that of General <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinochet.html" title="Pinochet">Pinochet</a> who was both murderously authoritarian and way to the right on the economy. However, the political compass idea may take a while to filter through into mainstream consciousness. -<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeural_a81d.html" title="User:Neural">Neural</a> 00:07, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Left/Right - whilst limited - is an easily understood shorthand. And besides, most people would say that their economic policy is not the most interesting or notable thing about the BNP. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:03, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel that 'far right' is a deliberately misleading term. I suppose it may be being used by leftists as a way for them to attempt to dissociate themselves from the actual left-wing economic policies of the BNP. Just imagine that if every one accepted that the BNP was a left-of-centre party with authoritarian social policies, it would mean troublesome association for other leftist parties which themselves have potentially authoritarian policies. Marxists may tell you that all they want is a classless society for justice, but what would happen when such a society gets under way? It would become authoritarian, enforcing its policies upon the hapless laissez-faire libertarians.</dd>

<dd>So plenty of political scientists are calling the BNP far right, fine. But they may have something to gain from doing so, namely the unfair denouncement of the extreme policies of the BNP. But calling the BNP far right is a bit problematic, since the conservatives are closer to the far right than they are to the centre. And it's obvious that the BNP and the Conservatives have not a lot in common. -- --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainSurrey_9d82.html" title="User:CaptainSurrey">CaptainSurrey</a> 03:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The BNP are not strictly speaking a far right pary as the do not want mass economic deregulation they are infavour of renationalisation of the railways and maintaining a national health service. So in that sence they are not a far right party. the reason they may be clasified as a far right party is because of their immigration stance that is a typical policy of far right groups such as UKIP and the NF, but other policies contradict them from being steryotypically far right. This means that classifying them as either far right or xenaphobic center left is difficult if not damn near impossible.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 15:39, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's no use picking on these policy areas as being left or right - the BNP is nothing but a populist party which is why it latches onto what is dear to the hearts and minds of the British people, such as maintaining the Health Service - there is not a single party in the UK that would dare suggest otherwise. Similarly, renationalising railways: everyone agrees that the railways now are a disaster. But consider the antecedents of the BNP and the history of its founders and leading membbers - they are out and out Nazi, a taint the National Front was unable to shake off but which the BNP has made more effort with, unsuccessfully, because anyon who cares to look can see that its founders had convictions for violence, were photographed in Nazi regalia, had a long history of anti-semitism etc etc. Don't let the BNP's protestations of innocence fool you. Rather, look at the totality. To digress slightly, Gen. de Gaulle (a right winger) when in power nationalised the banks and the car industry. Does that make him left wing, or was he just punishing them for collaboration 1940-1945? As I said, you need to see the totality, not one or two isolated points. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:44, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>i see the point you are coming from and i say that your points are valid but to out and out label them as Far right just because of their predecessors is wrong. So because the labour party used to be an ultra left wing party when it was founded does that mean that still today they have to be classified as ultra left wing rather than the centrist party they have become.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 20:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Their "socialist" and "left" policies are merely a means to attract votes and do not define them as a party. They are extremely right wing, they are Nazi.

<dd>I agree totally with Joeshawuk here. From what I've just read on this party it sounds like they are a populist far right party. Most of their public policies are flexible depending on what will get them power. There are a few quotes of their party members and indeed leaders saying that they're happy to step away from Anti-semitism for example simply to get into power. However that said ... Hitler did conceal the extent of his Anti-semitism until after he had abolished elections and even to a degree began losing on the Eastern Front. Additionally ... the same people who get quoted as saying they're not anti-semites publicly also get quoted privately contradicting this. This just goes to show that this party puts on a public front that has policies which appeal to British people ONLY as a means to an end. There are many historical precedences for political parties that have done this and many were just as bad at concealing the truth as the BNP. -Senor Freebie / James Rowlands [j_hexen at yahoo dot com]</dd>

<dd>Excuse me mr im am the greatest of the great and am the only autority to talk on these matters with an opinion the counts. I am a politics student and the british national party do contain elements of extremem neo-nazi style faschism in their past with things such as forced repatriation. However the people who espoused these tendancies such as John Tindle are either dead or have been excluded from the party. Today they only espousle voulntary re-patriation so have moved even if ever so slightly to the left away from the neo-nazi past they once had. they also cannot be considered far-right on issues such as the environment and agriculture they are extremly left-wing with policies such as high ammounts of polluter pays taxation and a return to self suficency in farming rather than a free trade in food. also form an economc point of view they do not fit nicley into any catagory as they want high rates of corporation tax high VAT but no such thing as income tax. so saying they are an extreme faschist far right party is over subjected and single minded as only a few issues such as national service and immigration are being considered, for an accurate place on the scale all aspects need to be considered from the environment to public transport to taxation as well as immigration and defence. a better comparison with the nazi party is not the BNP but the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9th_Society_36b7.html" title="November 9th Society">November 9th Society</a> an analysis of them will show the diffrences betwwen modern naziism and the BNP.--134.225.177.27 23:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Far be it from me to contradict such a modest politics student. I am merely a graduate in politics, but to take just one of your points: voluntary repatriation. The fact that Tyndall and a few other founders are now dead or expelled is not relevant. That merely reflects longevity and the endemic infighting of the British far right (everyone wants to be Fuhrer!). Here's what NF members in the 1970s thought: <i>"....’We haven’t actually worked out the mechanics of repatriation,’ Mr Fairhurst said. ‘But as we become stronger over the next few years, many of the wealthier coloureds will get their money out and get themselves out too. As the NF comes to power, they will leave of their own free will. We would also pass a law saying that anyone who breaks the law will automatically be repatriated, and spongers will also be repatriated.’"</i> (Source: interview in <i>The Guardian</i> 8 October 1974) All very voluntary, but we know what they really meant. And we know that the BNP is a direct descendant of the NF. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:32, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lucy-marie has previously written on this page: <i>"the labour party used to be an ultra left wing party when it was founded".</i> This is nonsense. She has also written <i>"The BNP are not strictly speaking a far right pary as the do not want mass economic deregulation".</i> Well, partly true, but neither do the Conservatives any more. It would appear to me that Lucy-marie is at least confused over what makes a party left or right wing. It is not one policy, or even several policies in one area (such as economic deregulation or not). One must consider the <i>totality</i> of the party's policies. To be honest, the BNP's economic derelugation policies are neither well-known nor the main thrust of their propaganda, but even if they were, the rest of the BNP's policies, plans and programmes are unashamedly extreme right. This fits their background as a direct descendant of 60 years of post-war British neo-Nazi/fascist tradition. (Is anyone suggesting Nazis were left-wing because they planned part of the economy?)</p>
<p>Clearly, taking the totality of the BNP position, they are an extreme right party and I would support labelling them as such here, except that <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_right.html" title="Extreme right">extreme right</a> gets redirected to far right anyway. So keep far right and stop trying to portray them as something they are not.</p>
<p>(Out of interest, why is it only right wing groups that claim that they are not what they are, backed up by supporters and apologists? I've never heard anyone on the left claim to be anything other than a left winger. Is it because if you are or were an open or a closet Nazi, and you want to get public support, you need to pretend you are not as extreme as you are? Just a thought.) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 00:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I refer you to the Wikipedia article on th <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Council_of_Britain_7032.html" title="Christian Council of Britain">Christian Council of Britain</a> and particularly the following section (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Formation and association with the BNP</b> Taking its name directly in imitation of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Council_of_Britain_00a5.html" title="Muslim Council of Britain">Muslim Council of Britain</a>, the Christian Council of Britain was <i>set up</i> by concerned British Christians of various denominations <i>with assistance from members and supporters of the BNP in April 2006. BNP web editor Steve Blake who runs an IT consultancy registered the URL</i> christiancouncil.org.uk on behalf of the CCB <i>and provided a basic template for the fledgling organisation's website</i>. <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=444" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=444" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The Observer reported on April 16, 2006 that <i>Clive Potter, another member of the BNP was to be the president of the CCB</i>. <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1754762,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1754762,00.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <i>Rev.

</blockquote>
<p>So, the appropriate Wikipedia article backs up this article, and provides three sources. That's good enough for anyone. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a></p>
<p><br />
Qoute from the christian council of britain wiki page ...The CCB states that it is "an independent, non-political organisation autonomous of any political party in Britain", however there are frequent claims that it is connected with the British National Party</p>
<p>so which do i believe..this is confusing and hypocritical...i dont care either way if it is or is not set up by the bnp..as long as the 2 articles agree (<a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 18:07, 1 January 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>There's no contradiction and who, exactly, are you accusing of hypocisy? The CCB wiki article is quite correct in what it says and it has been carefully worded to ensure it is accurate. It says that the CCB <b>states</b> that its unaligned. So it does. The article also points out its very close links to the BNP. These are true. Understand that just because someone states something about themselves, it is not necessarily so. (To take a silly example: I can say "I am the most handsome man in the world." You can report honestly that I <i>said</i> it. It doesn't make it true, and you can also report contrary evidence that disproves or casts doubt on my statement.) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course not. There are POVs that are pro-BNP, anti-BNP, neutral-BNP. That's what POV means. But if you are taking part in a discussion about point of view in an article, and saying that there <b>is</b> bias, you ought to start by stating your own position as a supporter of one side of the argument, i.e. you have a certain point of view and are arguing from it.

<dd>Lucy-Marie, in your attempts to "neutralize" the article, you seem to be forgetting that anything asserted as fact must reflect the mainstream opinions of expert, independent secondary sources. And the assertion that the BNP is far-right satisfies that requisite. The opinion of a washed-up, virulently anti-leftist Conservative politician qualifies as neither expert nor independent, and it does nothing to invalidate the opinions of multitudes of academics and journalists who desbribe the BNP as far-right or radical right. In fact, I don't see why Tebbit's opinion is relevant at all. We're giving undue weight to the opinion of someone who is neither eminent nor prominent and who has a track record of equating leftism and fascism. If you have an expert, independent secondary source disputing that the BNP is far-right, present it, because Tebbit's opinion alone is essentially worthless, anti-leftist propaganda. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was merley stating that the article itself conradicts the label of being right wing. However the comment you make in your above statement are hardly remaining neutral and on the point. I admit that he may not be the most reliable source but most of the 'mainstream' sources are just as biased as he is, so i was just stating what reading the article it self asserted. I also do not think any source is truly indipendant when describing any political party, what next the daily mail supporting the liberal decmocrats and security issues.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 23:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, having someone as Tebbit discussing the issue could be beneficial - it represents someone vocalising the idea that they're not right wing - which some people think they are not. By adding his name to it, we provide a referent for the sort of position that thinks the BNP aren't right wing</dd>
<dd>As for the tag - that shouldn't be used to just to indicate an aritcle is controversial. Its there to indicate that an article is non-neutral. The fact is that as far as I can tell, this article only reports facts. I agree with WGee that unless there some tangiable objections to the content are provided, the tag ought to go. As seen above, I have offered plenty of opportunities to provide a few examples of non neturality. I am still happy to hold out for a few more days in the hope that some examples can be given.

<dd>My objection was more along these lines: Why should we relay the opinion of one washed-up rightist who is neither prominent nor eminent yet omit the myriad of independent (by which I mean not affiliated with a partisan organization, Lucy-Marie) academics, experts in their fields, who all agree that the BNP is far-right? It seems to me that whoever added Tebbit's comments is trying to subtly push the POV that the BNP is not far-right, since he or she chose to highlight one in a thousand sources that associates the BNP with the left. New editors to this page constantly declare that the BNP is closer to the left than to the right, but to assert such a thing is to demonstrate ignorance of the underlying philosophies of fascism and socialism and of the right and the left. We must not give legitimacy to common misapprehensions by including obscure sources that justify them; rather, it is the job of encyclopedias to <i>dispel</i> myths. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 01:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro</span></h2>
<p>In your bold restructuring of the introduction, Lucy-Marie, you have white-washed some very relevant information. First, any party that is explicitly "wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples" can and must be accurately referred to as "racist." Indeed the clause "<i>The BNP denies that it is racist, however</i>" implies that the BNP is commonly viewed as a supporter of racism, but since we also state the BNP's official position, that is within the bounds of both common sense and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Second, you seem to have had a problem with the sentence "<i>The party believes that racism is a part of human nature and describes its supporters as ‘realists’</i>". So I'll point you to the relevant quotations:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"'Racism', in other words, is not a consequence of ‘false consciousness', economics, imperialism or the work of evil agitators, it is part of human nature."</li>
<li>"it is what allows us to say with confidence and sincerity that we are not ‘racists', but realists." <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/candidates2005/manifesto/manf4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/candidates2005/manifesto/manf4.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To say that the party believes that "racial differences" are part of human nature is true, but it white-washes the fact that the party expressly considers <i><a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a></i> part of human nature. Finally, I don't quite understand your objections to the last paragraph. Before you attempt to remove perceived bias, you should tell us what that bias is so that we can <i>collaboratively</i> work to remove it. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 19:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed those from the introduction but do not have a prblem with them being re inserted furtherd down in the aricle i think it starts the article off on the wrpong foot by immedatily putting a negative about the aparty up straight away.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 19:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please also define th importance of this sentence: Anti-fascist organizations such as Searchlight and Unite Against Fascism dedicate the bulk of their efforts to denouncing the BNP. I think its like saying the daily mail and the telegraph dedicate large portions of thier papers to lampooning the labour party.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 19:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><small>Please note i didn't delete the stuff on racism my paragraphy rewording read like this:The BNP sees itself as standing up for the white British working class. Main parties such as the Conservative Party and Mayor of London Ken Livingstone distance themselves from the BNP. Politicicans from other parties accuse the BNP of being racist, an accustation that the BNP strongly denies. The party believes that racial differences are a part of human nature and describes its supporters as "realists".</small></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>As for 'racist/racism'. It seems to me that the current wording - as in the pre-rewrite version - in its use of 'however' and the term 'racism' - which carries negative connotations taht no one can deny - suggests that the policies and beliefs of the previous paragraph are something to be ashamed of and are somehow wrong. This is making a value judgement and, to be fair, is probably non-neutral. Though I advocate the retention of the UAF/Searchlight sentence, I think Lucy's intro otherwise has its merits. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence carries the connotation that the BNP advocates racism, and it does, virtually explicitly. No one, in good faith, can claim that the racial segregation that the BNP expressly advocates is not a form of racism. Even without the "however", the mere mentioning of racism in relation to the BNP implies that it is widely regarded as racist. Such a connotation is unavoidable considering the BNP's racist constitution.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, that British anti-fascist organizations dedicate the bulk of their efforts to denouncing the BNP is quite notable, as it is not the case with any other party. Perhaps no other party in recent times has created such a furor among politicians and non-governmental organizations as the BNP. It is also unique in that mainstream poltical parties have explicitly refused to collaborate with it, and they have gone out of their way to rebuke a party that only received 0.7% of the vote in the last general election.</dd>

<dd>I don't think you quite see where I'm coming from. It is not a mere "point of view" that the BNP advocates racism, but a fact that is wholly supported by logic. Like I said, it is impossible to deny in good faith, given its constitution, that the BNP does not advocate racism. We have the opinion of the overwhelming majority juxtaposed with the opinion of the party itself, and I have yet to be told how that violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 21:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of the words osrtacised and rebuked are clearly not npov words and the genral fell of the paragraph is that of the BNP being wrong and should be hated for it.

<dl>
<dd>I really don't see the current version as a white washing. Really, the only change that has been made is that we've defined more clearly who is labeling the BNP as racist. To come at it objectively, the old wording was framed to make it sounds like 'Wikipedia' believed that there was something ineherently wrong with the policies in the first paragraph. It gave the BNP's ideals, then said 'however, they don't think they're racist'. Now, we can see that 'racial segregation' is a form of racism and isn't a policy to be proud of; but we simply can't say that in the article. We can probably go as far as saying its 'racist'; but that doesn't mean we have to if we can give some tangiable critics saying that it is racist, which the new version does. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. The construction "The BNP denies that it is racist, however" (the "however" in particular) suggests that the aforementioned principles of the BNP are racist. And there is nothing wrong with either saying or implying that the BNP's advocacy of racial segregation is "racist." Something so obvious does not need to be verified by sources and is certainly not biased. It is better for Wikipedia to assert as fact that the BNP's beliefs are racist rather than do so under the guise of weasel words. Again, there is nothing biased or factually inaccurate about characterizing racial segregation as racist. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:13, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you give an example of weasel words from the other proposal? If you refer to 'The BNP is widely regarded as being <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a>' - then this could easily be re-phrased as 'These parties and politicians all view the BNP as racist'. I still feel that the current wording suggests that there is something inherently negative in the policies of the BNP. Surely the fact that the BNP denies that its policies of racial segregation are racist means that this is not 'obivous'. What is obvious to one person is almost never obvious to another. Though some people understand 'racism' to mean 'an ideology that there are inherent differences between human races', many others would understand it to mean 'an ideology that a certain race or races are superiod to others'. There is an importnat difference there. All I'm saying is surely it is better for us to have the claim that the BNP is racist attributed to a few people, so that it can be shown that this is an opinion held by the majority, and not a conclusion dervied by our own definition of racism? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 11:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"'These parties and politicians all view the BNP as racist'." I don't think that goes far enough. To take only the views of parties and politicians into account when describing another party is not sufficient; after all, they are bound to be biased or open to accusations of bias, even if they are right. I think the BNP is racist; I think certain of its policies are racist. Most people I know think it's racist, and the few BNP supporters I know also think it's racist - that's why they support it! Of course, what I and people I know think is not citeable, but with WGee's argument above, we at least get to use something of a 'common sense' justification. Another point: You say that (to paraphrase) if the opponents say something and the BNP denies it, it is not obvious. This is not entirely logical - there are numerous examples in life of where this would be a silly attitude. Have you ever seen a court case where the criminal is obviously guilty but denies it? In the interests of justice and a fair trial, the accused is allowed to plead not guilty and put their case. By analogy, in this article it should say that the BNP is racist (or considered racist, though personally I favour the former) on the grounds proposed by WGee, but that they deny it. Which is near enough waht the article says. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I see where you are coming from with your courtroom analogy but the jury itself must be impartial at the start rather than the media jumping all over it and say that a person is guilty. I think the article should take the position of the jury at the start of a trial and not the media coering the trial. I think the wording need to be as neutral as possible and avoid any negative conotation expressed in the wording. This is because having a negative tone or negative conotations in the wording are not a neutral point of view and saying thay are a racist party is a point of view and uprovable whater they are actuallly racist, with out citing what their true thoughts are, (this could only be acheived by mind reading) so lets not put strong words in the start of the page and leave that for more apropriatre sections later on.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 13:13, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, neither of those two points really get where I'm coming from. I agree with Emeraude - that's why I originally picked the wording 'are widely regarded as being', though I noted that that phrase was a bit weasily. I'd be happy to find a medium (e.g. The British media and all other political parties reflect the majority opinion that the BNP is racist). I'm afraid I don't by the "the media are biased agianst the BNP" argument - I think more that they reflect the majority of public opinion. I'm not overly fussed here - I don't think either version is too bad. I'd rather try eiditing them than reverting between the two. I think both are pretty much the same to be honest - I mildly prefer Lucy-marie's, with my couple of ammendmants. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 16:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Guardian infiltration</span></h2>
<p>the section about the guardian in my opinion is highly biased against the guardain and the BNP i would like to request a comment from other users on the best way to re-word the section to a more neutral point of view. the section surently reads as follows:<br />
On December 21, 2006 the liberal Guardian newspaper revealed that one of its journalists, Iain Cobain, had worked undercover in the organisation for seven months, and became the party's Central London organiser. The report revealed that the BNP uses clandestine rendezvous points (RVP, actually public places) for its members to gather prior to secret meetings elsewhere and the extent to which party members frequently use false names. The BNP is also succeeding in reaching beyond its white working class base to attract affluent new members in parts of London where it has previously been shunned. Cobain had access to the central London membership list (on an encrypted Excel spreadsheet) which includes "dozens of company directors, computing entrepreneurs, bankers and estate agents, and a handful of teachers".<br />
I also have a problem with use of brackets in this section as they break up the flow of the section.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 15:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with it. Accurately reports what <i>The Guardian</i> said. The <i>Guardian</i> article itself was accurate. I can't see how any of this is "highly biased", but if it were highly biased against both the BNP and the <i>The Guardian</i> then it is probably overall neutral. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 16:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my opinion i think it should read neutrally towards both of them. I think the word liberal as a description of the Guardian is bias, clandestine is also when describing BNP rv points is biased, in my opinion. I think that it should be neutral towards poth subjects in the section and not bias towards both. I think that saying one cancels out another is a valid point, but when reading, it may be more biased against one than another to certian reeaders.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 16:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The intro concluded with the words: <i>"Anti-fascist organizations such as Searchlight and Unite Against Fascism dedicate a substantial propotion of their efforts to denouncing the BNP. [8]"</i></p>
<p>I have corrected a typo in there, but have distinguished Searchligh as a magazine, not an organisation. I have also removed the reference and footnote which refers to the website. Searchlight is a <b>magazine</b> and its coverage is not (as previously suggested) mostly about denouncing the BNP, or even 'substantially' - articles cover the whole of Europe and the world. Check the Searchlight website for indexes to issues. This article is talking about Searchlight the mag, not its website. Also, I think 'devote' reads better than 'dedicate'. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 21:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I Think the Sentence should read as a follow on from the last something like: This is because of the BNP being percieved as racists by the conservatives and ken livingstone. Also why is this sentence there at dose not seam to serve a place other tan to promote anti-fascism and thus portray the BNP as fascist: The party is opposed by anti-fascist magazines such as Searchlight and organisations such as Unite Against Fascism.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 23:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, but if I edit it..im willing to bet a small fortune it will get reverted because none of the above have seen this and will think i did it on impulse. And the magazines? well..seems obvious...that communist/left wing magazines are having a swipe at a so called right wing party (go figure..the bnp isnt economically right). I mean.."accustation that the BNP strongly denies" says who? this is what annoys me..who? who accuses? where does it say the bnp denied? what did they deny exactly? when? who denied it exactly? griffin or someone else? the sentence produces so many questions because...its garbage...*sigh* <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 23:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro (2)</span></h2>
<p>Here is the introduction as I would like to see it (it is more or less the version that has been supported by the consensus for months before the arrival of Lucy-Marie):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <b>British National Party</b> (<b>BNP</b>) is the most prominent <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political party</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">2005 general election</a>, the British National Party received 0.7% of the popular vote and did not win any seats in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. According to its constitution<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, the BNP "stands for the preservation of the national and ethnic character of the British people and is wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples." It is "committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948". To achieve this aim, the BNP advocates the use of "firm but voluntary incentives" to remove <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_minorities.html" title="Ethnic minorities">ethnic minorities</a> from the UK.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Membership of the party is restricted to "Indigenous <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasians</a>."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The BNP denies that it is racist, however, stating that it is merely standing up for the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_British_d404.html" title="White British">white</a> British <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a>. The party believes that <b>racism</b> (they explicitly say "racism", not merely "racial differences"—how many times do I have to explain this? <small>For what its worth I don't recall that point being made once before. If I've missed I'm sorry, but I've not heard you or anyone else say it <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</small> ) is a part of human nature and describes its supporters as "realists".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The BNP is marginalized by the political mainstream. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> leader <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cameron_8722.html" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>, for example, has called on voters to "back anyone but the BNP,"<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> while Mayor of London <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> has criticized "the politics of race hate peddled by the BNP."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Anti-<a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> organizations such as <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight_Magazine_ecca.html" title="Searchlight Magazine">Searchlight</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_Against_Fascism_c354.html" title="Unite Against Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a> dedicate the bulk of their efforts to denouncing the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because there was never a consensus to alter the lead in the first place, this version should stay, for it is the only one to ever have been supported by the consensus. Could somebody explain the flaw in my logic?</p>
<p>Moreover, no logical argument has been made as to why the BNP's policies of racial segregation cannot be factually referred to as "racist." As both I and Emeraude have demonstrated, the BNP's opinion does not negate the truth. The word and everthing connected to it will always have negative connotations, but the term is warranted for what it <i>denotes</i>.</p>
<p>So, racial segregation (what the BNP advocates) is unassailably racist, and to conceal the fact that it is racist by using weasel phrases (e.g., "widely regarded as") amounts to white-washing. Likewise, it is not merely the "opinion" of all politicians and reporters that the BNP is racist, but a fact. I could always re-word the sentence in question to say, "Despite the fact that the BNP supports racial segregation, it denies that it is racist," but such wording conveys exactly the same message, only in a clumsier way.</p>
<p>Could you point out any other concerns with this version?</p>

<dd>Also, I would like to add somewhere in the introduction that the BNP is a "radical right-wing populist" party and is, likewise, "anti-Establishment" (cf. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+radical+right+populist&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+radical+right+populist&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+radical+right+populist&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+radical+right+populist&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+anti-establishment&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=BNP+anti-establishment&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>).

<p>Agreed with above wording, and your rationale, with two provisos. <b>1.</b> The figure of 55 councillors is no longer accurate; I have read that there have been resignations and some disqualifications of councillors on account of criminal records. I don't have the details to hand, but the figure is now certainly slightly less than 55. Perhaps reword to something like "It has had as many as 55 councillors." if the exact number can't be found. <b>2.</b> In the last sentence: Searchlight is not an organisation but a magazine. I had edited this for this version [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_National_Party&amp;oldid=99402630" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_National_Party&amp;oldid=99402630" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] and explained why above under "Hopefully minor corrections". <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 13:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never had a massive problem with the original. I think that is an acceptable introduction to the artilce. That said, in an ideal world I'd make the following changes:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>It has 55 <a href="../../../c/o/u/Councillor.html" title="Councillor">councillors</a> in local government, <b>but lacks representation in the national <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a></b>. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">2005 general election</a>, the British National Party received 0.7% of the popular vote <b>and did not win any seats in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a></b>.</i> Essentially, the two emboldened bits repeat the same point - perhaps stike the second half of that last sentence?</li>
<li>I still have a problem with the entence 'The BNP denies it is racist, however'. Here's the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Racism is a belief or doctrine which states that inherent biological differences between human races determine cultural or individual achievement — with a corollary that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others.[1]</i> (now it seems to me that this is the definition of racism that you are following. It is, in your words, 'obvious'. And you are right that if the definition were to stop there, there would be no problem. However, read on)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term racism is sometimes used to refer to preference for one's own ethnic group[2]</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is this second definition of racism that is used which makes me worreid about us stating, without qualification, that these are racist policies. I don't see any contemporay BNP policies or documents that suggest this belief (btw, I'm not saying many of its members don't think that...). I don't mind saying: 'The British national media and the majority of politicians and commentators (with two/three references providing cross-spectrum examples) describe the BNP as racist. The BNP denies this, saying that <s>racial differences</s> racism is a natural part of humanity and that their policies are merely realist'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><s>* Terms like radical are value judgements and will always be so. I don't mind 'anti-establishment'; it provides a more concrete and less value laden view.</s></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As for councillor numbers - they are very hard to monitor. Perhaps we could say "as of the 2006 local elections, the BNP has 55 councillors"?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These aren't stubborn proposals for me. I think your current proposal is broadly accurate and is as good, if not better, than I could do. I agree that whilst discussions are onngoing, we should really be showing the pre-December intro. If there were to be a vast range of objections to my comments, then clearly we have a consensus and I'm not going to start complaining. But to me, those changes (or changes of those sort) would make the artilce appear more neutral.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 14:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Okay..WGee..firstly..the article..i felt..was getting accurate and unbiased, then you came back and reverted some of peoples work. I find this rude as you did not bother to wait for any replies before making hasty changes. It seems it is impossible to attempt to work with you on this. Your edit history and discussions has thrown light on your left wing views, ultra-reverting behaviour and reverting without warning. As for robdurbar, who seems to somehow be able to keep compsure during this discussion page, i agree with most of what was said. We cant throw the word 'racist' around, most of the people i know feel George Bush is a racist..can i put that on his oage because i FEEL it is correct? can i make large and possibly controversial edits without prior warning? No..I cannot..for it is vandalism WGee..somehow your behaviour is classed otherwise. I ould like nothing more than to talk on a calm and sensible level about this. But I am shocked to see the edits made without any prior warning or discussion. This is not a personal attack by the way, for I feel you (WGee) make valuable and helpful edits to wikipedia. I hope we can have a sensible consensus about this. Rather than arguing and reverting, and throwing our own beliefs and feelings around, can we not come to some sort of a conclusion with this? Find some middle ground and attempt to give the other some leeway. I am more than happy for some things to be said, but not with some of the unpredictable behaviour which I feel almost all of us have used in the edits to this page. Can I ask that before any more major edits are made (reversions [unless from vandalism], tags, categorising, hyperlinking) that we can have a discussion about it? This will save both time and hassle in the long run. I hope we can come to a resolution. <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 15:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well I don't think Wee had been conducting "ultra-reverting" behaviour. I do hope the above post doesn't distract from some of the content issues I brought up above, because I really hope we can sought something out. Editing a page to your own version isn't vandalism (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>) and I simply hope that Wee can appreciate that definitions of racism aren't as clear cut as he understands. Remember, Fetherose, that you can always remove the extra edits Wee has made and I'm sure he will accept that until discussion is finished.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>In the meantime, then, I think its worth looking more closely at the sources for the 'radical' claim, as this is essentially the main change made by Wee from the intro that had been used for a good few months. I actually drop my opposition to this wording, so long as the google scholar searches are replaced with references to actual articles that label the BNP 'radical right' (which is easy enough). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ill have a look in the article. To be honest, id be okay if someone said 'the bnp are violent thuggish racist skinheads' if they had a reasnoble and unbiased and unlibel source for this..but it wont happen obviously. The bnp are not racist..if some of their prominent members are then so be it..but the part isnt..(innocent till proven guilty..etc) My point is..im against the use of the word racist as I believe it has conotations which are untrue, 'racist' can not be thrown around lightly, as its both wrong, rude and potentially libellous (i say potentially) I agree with your post, my point is I dont want speculation and beliefs of editors to detract from otherwise useful edits, no-one should allow their personal feelings to change their edits. (if i saw vandalism on a conservative, bnp, labour, ukip, respect or any political party..i would argue their case as it is only right) <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 15:47, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree lucy-marie, but what are the odds of others agreeing with this npov? small if anything at all. Im trying to come to a compromise, knowing that those for the term 'racist bnp' and those against it..they will never be able to fuly include it or fully omit it (as much as id like a npov article on the bnp..it wont happen..ever)&#160;:) though i understand your concern, removing a biased word is surely better than trying to soften its meaning (the word is unproven, unfairly, and unjustly attributed to the bnp in the article.

"Racist" is backed up by the BNP's own constitution, and the interpretation can be confirmed by reliable sources from across the UK media. The majority of people that say the BNP is not racist are its supporters, so it would be POV not to include it. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 18:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The BNP sees itself as standing up for the white British working class. Main parties such as the Conservative Party and Mayor of London Ken Livingstone distance themselves from the BNP. Politicicans from other parties accuse the BNP of being racist, an accustation that the BNP strongly denies. The party believes that racial differences are a part of human nature and describes its supporters as "realists".<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think it satisfies some by have that some say the BNP is racist and satisfies others by not asserting it is true. The main reason i dislike wgee version is because it needs an update and has not been updated for months, uses weasel words and make assertations about the truth with no verifiable truth. This is however just my opinion and WGee will most likly disagree with it but i am entitled to it just as Wgee is to holding an opinion--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 18:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That's from a two minute search of google and the Daily mail.</dd>
<dd>To be honest, my two problems with the racism bit are, firstly, that in the construction above, we have the BNP denying something before we mention anyone accusing them of it. It just seems the wrong way round to do things; I just think it would be much easier to say something along along the lines of my above proposal.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, as I noted and as no-one has really responded to, the word 'racism' does carry two meanings - namely that of 'an ideology that races are different' and 'an ideology that one race is better than the other'. If we use the word 'racist' unqualifyingly, we could effectively be making that second charge, even if we don't intend to be. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Robdurbar, you said, "<i>The term racism is sometimes used to refer to preference for one's own ethnic group.</i> It is this second definition of racism that is used which makes me worreid about us stating, without qualification, that these are racist policies. I don't see any contemporay BNP policies or documents that suggest this belief." I'll give you two: it wants to evict non-whites from the country and it restricts party membership to whites only. Racial segregation in general is based on ethnocentrism: it is all about keeping your ethnic group "in" and the others "out". -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 11:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do not try to alter this article based on your idiosyncratic interpretation of a word; instead, look it up in a dictionary and base your argument on what it <i>denotes</i> (academics, learned people, and, likewise, encyclopedias tend to use words that way). Also, since racism is currently an ideology of the extreme right, it is appropriate for it to evoke images of "something very extreme". Similarly, you are forgetting that the BNP is a party of the <i>extreme</i> right <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=BNP+extreme+right&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=BNP+extreme+right&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 12:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well xenophobic makes no sense, as white Europeans are fine and dandy according to the BNP. It's quite possible to be not racist but be anti-semetic, the two are totally different things. I'm not overly keen on white supremacist, for reasons I shall go into. We're quoting cited sources by saying the BNP are racist, and including the BNP's rebuttal/denial of this. The cited sources didn't say "white supremacist" to begin with, so it doesn't make sense to change anything they said. It's the same as the "racism/racial differences" discussed above. We're using the words that were originally spoken/written to avoid problems, or trying anyway.... <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 13:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A word of wisdom: if you accuse people of being "rude and nasty" to you, chances are they <i>will</i> become rude and nasty, or their rudeness and nastiness will intensify. That said, I did not notice anything uncivil about his posts: saying that something "does not make sense" is perfectly civil. In fact, he worded his critique in a way that was meant to be non-offensive—using euphemisms such as "I'm not overly keen on" rather than "I abhor".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversions</span></h2>
<p>There is no rationale for reinstating Lucy-Marie's anti-consensual introduction. I say again: her revision has no legitimacy because it has never been approved by a consensus of editors. Therefore, until this dispute is resolved, we should revert to the only introduction to have ever been supported by a consensus of editors.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of the word racist in the article</span></h2>
<p>I am still against it, but I think it might have a place in the article, after speaking with friends and family, who are generally split over the use of the word (whether its too harsh to describe the bnp [before you ask most i asked are labour supporters, most of blackpool is] or not)The word generally brings a negative conotation and has a nasty meaning and undertone, regardless if it is denied it automatically places 'oh dear, they are bad' thought in the readers head regardless of what follows. Adding the points which robdurbar has made, the word is not..in my mind..of suitable material to go into wikipedia, though a situation where the bnp has ben accused of racism by a certain party, and then a statement directly in response rejecting the acusation would almost certainly satisfy me as long as the accusation and rejection response are both to and from the same parties...hard to explain) anyway, Some of the rudeness show towards me for merely putting forward my ideas is..rather downhearting..I thought mostof us were over this. Any mature discussion (ie: not flaming me, accusing me, using sarcasm) will be greatly appreciated and will fall on [intently] listening ears <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 17:38, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If a party supports racial segregation and the repatriation of non-whites and restricts party membership to "indigenous Caucasians", then it is assumed to be racist—especially among the Americans (and, to a lesser extent, the Canadians) who comprise the bulk of the users, who have vivid memories of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_era_488c.html" title="Jim Crow era">Jim Crow era</a>. Since the BNP's policies automatically suggest that it is racist, then the BNP is on the defensive and must immediately reject racism. For those who refuse to refer to the BNP's policies as "racist," could you explain to me how they could be anything but? So far I've only been presented with specious arguments about semantics and connotations. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 11:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I'm not sure that everyone here has read the BNP's manifesto, which includes rather obvious allusions to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_racism.html" title="Scientific racism">scientific racism</a>:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>This must not be taken to mean or imply that we believe that any particular ethnic group or race is ‘superior' or ‘inferior'; we simply recognise that – as any biologist would be able to predict, and the new medical science of pharmacogenetics is now confirming – human populations which have undergone micro-evolutionary changes while being separated for many thousands of years have developed differences in many fields of endeavour, susceptibility to health problems, behavioural tendencies and such like. To deny such differences on the grounds of egalitarian dogma has always been wrong, but to continue to do so in the light of the latest medical evidence is to condemn people to unnecessary suffering on account of racially specific health problems. We therefore believe that the myth that “we are all the same under the skin” will soon be as discredited as its feminist equivalent, and that all political parties will have to drastically amend their thinking to reflect the new reality in the not too distant future. <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/candidates2005/manifesto/manf4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/candidates2005/manifesto/manf4.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Note the attempt to justify racism by making specious appeals to biology, medicine, and Darwinism: i.e., scientific racism. Says the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> article, "Racism is a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> which states that inherent biological differences between <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">races</a> determine cultural or individual achievement. . . ." Similarly, the BNP says that "biological" and "micro-evolutionay" differences account for differences in "behavioural tendencies and such like." Although the BNP disavows white supremacy, it also expressely rejects racial equality. And if races are inequal, then certain races must be superior or inferior to others—basic <a href="../../../d/e/d/Deductive_reasoning.html" title="Deductive reasoning">deductive reasoning</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 11:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the term racist is not original research as it is used by the vast majority of sources. However, they are not <i>unquestionably</i> racist as we do not know the motivation behind BNP policies i.e. there is no evidence (I believe) to back up WGee's final sentance. That does not mean we cannot use the term racist at all and I think it needs to crop up in the intro.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thus back to my suggestion that we say: 'The BNP are widely described as being racist (two/three indicative sources) though this is an accusation they deny.'

<p>Listen to what each other has to say? rather than dismissing it and being rude. Ive been trying to keep a cool head recently, I would appreciate some actual CO-OPERATING in the edits made here. any hasty edits get reverted, any hasty reverts will be reinstate and so on. Surely it makes more sense to talk about this. WGee, talking with people at my college (we did a discussion on racism and civil rights in one of my lessons so i bought the discussion up) I decided I am okay keeping the wordin as long as subsequent sources are bought it..preferbly sensible discussions (eg..are the bnp racist? article in a non bias source..rather than 'BNP RACIST THUGS') this will..make the editing easier..and wil stop things getting out of control and someone going overboard with edits/reverts/rudeness and warnings being placed. Again..I would appreciate co-operation..as much as some of you would rather get very ill than co-operate with a bnp supporter, but I am trying my best to be open minded, and I will co-operate with anyone willing to help make sensible and NPOV edits to the article. <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 16:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

However it is helpful if you try and be constructive with your comments, which you seem to be doing more of in the last 24 hours. I don't think anyone is trying to make the article scream "BNP racist thugs", as the BNP of 2007 is significantly different to say the BNP of 1991. And as said above, the page should be the one previously agreed by consensus while discussion is ongoing, that is the fair and reasonable thing to do. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 16:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks..i think i over reacted previously. I do believe the party was very racist in Tyndall's time, but now it isnt as extreme as it was (so much so..Griffin is losing supporters because of his relaxed stance). 'The BNP was considered extremely racist' or something better worded would be much better in my opinion. Especially because its toned down recently (with jewish members and whatnot) I agree with the consensus. I cant ask for everyone to agree on something if a version no-one agrees with is the current page.

Back in '91 the BNP was very much a street based organisation with MA1 wearing skinheads, but they have moved a long way from that in recent years. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 18:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True or not, the BNP are widely regarded as racists. This can be supported by direct quotes from many politicans and newspapers. As far as I'm aware (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) we're using a representative set of quotes that show that this feeling goes across all the main political parties from left to right. Simply saying "X and Y said it" doesn't show the true depth of the feeling. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 19:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well some one tried to sya in my interpritation that red Kenn and the conservatives were the same (clearly not). Can we also get rid of the UAF searchlight quote its anti-climatic and is basicaly saying the far left oppose the far right, pointless? I think so. Anyway i think the intro is marginally better now as racist is clarified as peoples opiniopn but i still think it should be in an opposition to the BNP section not the intro. Someone also put leftist next to Ken Livingstone please dont its pov like the word liberal In the guardian infi;tration section. We are trying to remove pov here not "peddle" it.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 19:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Im looking for (ideally) a Lib dem one and a labour one, covering the non far ends of the political spectrum (with daily mail sovering the right) any help well appreciated:) <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 20:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree that the information about anti-fascist organizations is unnotable. As I have already said, "that British anti-fascist organizations dedicate the bulk of their efforts to denouncing the BNP is quite notable, as it is not the case with any other party. Perhaps no other party in recent times has created such a furor among politicians and non-governmental organizations as the BNP." Thus, do not ignorantly say that the statement's notablity has not been justified, and do not presuppose that an agreement between you and Fethroesforia gives you the mandate to boldly edit the introduction. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, statements from politicians (no matter how "centrist" they are) are not appropraite sources in this case. If we are to assert something as a fact, then that assertion must be supported by <i>politically independent</i> secondary sources, perferrably essays by political scientists or reports from mainstream news agencies. Any source that would not be acceptable to use in a term paper should not be used here. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:39, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok WGee you are very opinionated but i have brought up in previuos comments the UAF statement and it has been unanswered. Also why state the far left oppose the far right what next we say spearhead magasine dedicates the bulk of its publications to supporting the BNP I doubt it so If the UAF statement stays then I could argue for adding the spearhead comment. I think you would have a go at me if i added it right now but can you see my point? Also before I had read this page i had never heard of UAF or Searchlight so outside of thier core they are hardly the most notable publications in my opinion. THe Academics are good sources of information as long as it not used to justify sweeping statements like all BNP members are racist or the BNP is Rasict and violent to the core. This is because i was reading about one academic who was a professor at leeds who said "The BNP are a bit too socalist for my liking." So not every academic opposes them this one thinks the are too liberal. So well done on finally finding them but use them apropriatly and responsibly.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 11:59, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WGee do you have something against good grammar and want concensus over ever gramtical change made to the page? Those edits were madi in good faith to ensure the article read more smootly and removed possible ambiguaties and conformed the manual of style so when the word "its" is used it a poor wordong it is like using a persons first name in a page such as Noel rather than Edmonds when talking about Noel Edmonds. This is only a small thing so why open up another can of worms by reverting good faith edits of small things such as grammar.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 12:15, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; OK, I think that was probably just lazyness on WGee's part and I'm sure he'll apologise. BTW, WGee, your first source appears to be no more than an undergraduate essay, so I suggest we shouldn't include that. The other two seem fine though if we could find a free one it would obviously be better. I still, then, propose having the intro as it is now, but with WGee's second two sources (initally; perhaps better could be found) instead of Lib Dem/Daily Mail. If we could all agree on that THEN go on to discuss that final sentence? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why not have all four as refrences? then the statment would not easily be removed or modified by anybody and would settle the major talking point so far.

<dd>Changing every instance of "its" (or similar) to "the BNP" is not necessarily good grammar. You brought up Noel Edmonds as an example, let's use a sentence from his article to demonstrate this.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In September 2006 Edmonds admitted to mens' magazine Loaded that he had travelled at up to 186 mph in the car back in the mid-1980s on the Tring Bypass in Hertfordshire and to having sex in the back of a Range Rover.</p>

<p>I did live appropriate time..and surely adding sources to a controversial statement is common sense. Though if you can add sources to it being called racist..then i will be very grateful..having a slur without sources is just plain silly if not un-encyclopedic. Im not getting involved in the other quote. Im not bothered either way that one goes. As longas the 'bnp denies it is racist' is re-worded as it sounds like half a sentence..it needs 'such and such accuse the bnp of being racist' and then some sources to back that up..I think what you were referring to earlier was to my edits..if not..i apoligise <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFethroesforia_f454.html" title="User:Fethroesforia">Fethroesforia</a> 14:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
