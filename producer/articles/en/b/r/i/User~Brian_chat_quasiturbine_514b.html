Quasiturbine with carriages</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The earliest Quasiturbine design used a three-wheeled <i>carriage</i> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> <i>chariot</i>, hence <i>avec chariots</i> or <i>AC</i> for <i>with carriages</i>) to support each vertex of the rotor. The wheels of these four carriages, making twelve wheels in total, ran around the periphery of the engine chamber.</p>
<p>A prototype of an internal combustion engine to this design was constructed, and enthusiastically reviewed in <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Automotive_Design_3a34.html" title="European Automotive Design">European Automotive Design</a> magazine September, 1999. The prototype was turned by an external engine for 40 hours.</p>
<p>However, ignition with fuel was never achieved. If it was attempted no results were ever released, and development work on this design was suspended.</p>

<li>Cylinder ports in place of valves reduce the number of moving parts, in common with the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wankel_engine.html" title="Wankel engine">Wankel engine</a> and some <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_stroke_engine.html" title="Two stroke engine">two stroke engines</a>.</li>

<li>The rotor can be designed so its <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_of_gravity.html" title="Centre of gravity">centre of gravity</a> remains stationary or nearly so, minimising vibration.</li>
<li>Sixteen <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Stroke (disambiguation)">strokes</a> per revolution of the rotor, as opposed to twelve for a single-rotor Wankel engine and two for a revolution of the crankshaft of a single-cylinder single-acting piston engine.</li>

<p>The two-port design with carriages was proposed to make possible a new and superior mode of combustion, termed <i><b>photo-detonation</b></i> by the Quasiturbine inventors. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, no research has been published supporting this claim. A related idea that <i><b>flame transfer</b></i> would be possible through special ports is similarly unsupported.</p>

Quasiturbine configured as a steam engine</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second Quasiturbine design is greatly simplified to eliminate the carriages (French <i>sans chariots</i> or <i>SC</i>). At the same time, the ports were duplicated on the opposite side of the housing, thus converting the operation from four strokes per cycle to two and doubling the number of cycles per rotor revolution. This mechanism has been demonstrated running as a <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumatic.html" title="Pneumatic">pneumatic</a> engine using stored compressed air, and also as a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_engine.html" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a>. This is also the design proposed for use as a <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pump.html" title="Pump">pump</a>, and particularly as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercharger.html" title="Supercharger">supercharger</a>.</p>
<p>This design uses redesigned blades, longer than those for a similar sized housing of the first type owing to the absence of the carriages, and lacking the distinctive crown contour. Only the basic rotor geometry is common with the earlier design.</p>
<p>A pneumatic engine of this design was demonstrated powering a go-kart in November 2004, and another powering a small car in September 2005, both vehicles using stored compressed air to power the engine. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a> a pneumatic <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_saw.html" title="Chain saw">chain saw</a> driven by an air hose from a conventional external compressor is under development.</p>
<p>With a suitably redesigned housing to allow for thermal expansion, the same rotor design has been demonstrated as a steam engine.</p>
<p>Another potential variation of this design uses the two sets of ports independently, one as an engine and the other as a pump, thus potentially integrating the functions of a pump and its driving motor in one shaftless unit. One restriction of this usage is that the two fluids must be similar; It would not be possible for example to drive an integrated air pump with hydraulic fluid, as the rotor design is significantly different. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a> no prototype of this variation has been demonstrated.</p>

<p>The Quasiturbine was conceived by a group of 4 researchers, led by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermonuclear.html" title="Thermonuclear">thermonuclear</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicist.html" title="Physicist">physicist</a>, and consisting of members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbine.html" title="Turbine">turbine</a> engine where the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_compressor.html" title="Gas compressor">compressor</a> portion and the power portion would be in the same <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plane_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Plane (mathematics)">plane</a>. In order to achieve this, they had to disconnect the blades from the main shaft, and chain them around in such a way that a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn, and as an engine the following quarter of a turn.</p>
<p>The general concept of the Quasiturbine was first patented in 1996. Small pneumatic and steam units are available from the patent holders for sale or hire for research, academic training and industrial demonstration, as is a book (largely in French) describing the concepts and development of the design. Lacking any forced lubrication system, these engines function only for short periods, a few hours at most, before requiring maintenance.</p>
<p>The patent holders have announced that they intend to make similar internal combustion prototypes available for demonstration.</p>
