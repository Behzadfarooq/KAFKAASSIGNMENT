<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Having promised, I've now put rather more effort than intended into an outline of the shared history of the islands to replace the two existing sections. It should be noted that all the links in the <i>History</i> section are now included in the template boxes and italic top line, and that the new section also supersedes the <i>Political history</i> section which wandered excessively into national histories without clearly covering shared points. While constructive improvements will be welcome, any major changes or comments should be raised here first, and <i>unexplained</i> blanket reversions <i>without discussion and consensus</i> will be treated as vandalism. It's longer than I'd hoped, but in my opinion gives a necessary overview. If the priority is felt to be keeping this article short, the section could readily form the basis of a main article on the <i>History of the British Isles</i> with brief headings only on this page. Checking points has taken a fair bit of effort, and citations have been added for items most likely to be questioned: further citations can be added if required. ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 18:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC) italicised amendment...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 19:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm very tempted to respond in terms of how treating "blanket reversions [...] as vandalism" will itself be treated. Blanket reversions, however undesirable, are <i>not</i> vandalism (well, unless one happens to be deliberately reverting to a vandalised version), and please do not describe them as such, or treat them as such, either in prospect or in practice. A desire to avoid an edit war is all very commendable, but this is being needlessly confrontational about it (if not actually <i>more likely</i> to cause it), and indeed smacks of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, I don't think that's what dave meant; he was probably just hoping that this change would HAHA SUCKERS!!!! I EDITED IT, IN YO FACE!!!!only be reverted after community discussion, rather than just out of hand. It's just an unfortunate turn of phrase I think. Let's discuss the content here; that is what everyone wants. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My main comment would be that recent history needs expanding - a pragraph about 'the troubles' would be good. I'm no historian so as a section I can't really comment that much, but it does look very sparsely cited. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm absolutely not suggesting it's what he meant; I just think it's (as you say) an unfortunate turn of phrase, that might have an (unintended) deleterious effect. I've no strong feelings on the content of the History section. What to include here is very much a judgement call: on the one hand it could be greatly reduced in size, to essentially just pointers to component articles; equally, it could be greatly expanded and possibly spun out in the way Dave mentions. I'll go with the flow either way. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:57, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough, I'm a bit tired and have seen too many unexplained reversions here to be happy about that happening to work put into the article, but welcome discussion, and if anyone wants to go back to the previous situation, that can be raised here. There's a sentence about the troubles now when there was no mention of it before: since that links to five other articles it seems enough to me, but opinions welcome. I'd just add that doing this has brought home how hard it can be to get an overview from nation based articles, and highlighted one or two areas where one nation has good coverage but more detail is needed for another. ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 19:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still have issues with the "vandalism" characterisation, which implies to me "reverting back with admin rollback, or with summary "rvv", ignoring the 3RR in making such reversion, reporting to WP:VIP", and such like, which would not be appropriate. I think you're looking for a sentiment more along the lines of "anyone blanket reverting is being rude, ignoring all Dave's hard work, winding us all up (further), and generally being a complete muppet" -- that I'd fully endorse.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I commend your work if it leads to a better article. To write a <i>shared history</i> of the islands is actually an exercise in 'point of view' in itself. There are a lot of bad parts left out. And how about the <i>un-shared history</i>, is that to be omitted? Needs to be examined very closely. Maybe they should be named <i>The Paradise Islands</i>! -MelForbes 19:21, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Trust you've noted that the sharing includes massacres, brutality and famine. Paradise? ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 19:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Going into historical headings, could cause this article to expand exponentially, with editors adding sub-headings ad nauseum Also the BI is not supposed to be political, but advancing toward a broader history destroys that myth, and in reality the BI (as regarding Ireland) became <i>de facto defunct</i> in 1922. But we have gone through all of this before, Just see problems ahead. -MelForbes
<dl>
<dd>The synthesis of history is well done (especially 16th-17thcc.), but may be out of place. I've suggested a few times that the history section be reduced to links (like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Britain_45fe.html" title="History of Britain">History of Britain</a>) - these links are now contained in a box. But then again, the term BI is essentially political. Hmmm.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 20:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are some critics of what MelForbes is calling <i>shared history</i>—and there seems to be a bit of interest here on the talk page. The approach focuses on political rather than social history, views events as they fit the outline of English history, and forces an unnatural unit of study—giving undue weight to connections among the four nations and less than due those to the continent. It seems ridiculous to apply those critisism here. The simple response is to point out the amount of space allocated, or just <a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">{{sofixit}}</a>.</dd>
<dd>The other objection, and i think what MelForbes means by <i>POV in itself</i> is that it's an attempt to assert "the unity of a past that has been rejected at the political level" and "The rejection of the British state by a majority of the Irish makes the notion of a single narrative history of the British Isles particularly problematic." (Lambert 2004, p. 222) This also seems a bit overblown when applied to a wiki section, but i think you did come down squarely on one side of the debate in your historiographic introduction. Maybe this could be expanded a bit to introduce the old Whig histories and pose <i>shared</i> vs. comparative and national as an open question? Or would this just be a distraction?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, good work, a big improvement to the article.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 21:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obivously, suggesting that there is a shared history will always be controversial as it will be seen by some as the first road down a route to suggesting that there should be a shared present. I think this page could develop well in the history section as a chronicalisation of British-Irish relations over times; as DS points out, national articles are often limited on such topics. I like the fact that the section has been summarised into one, from two, bits. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the comments: just a note to say that it's probably my background, but I find it difficult to visualise how histories are to be kept separate. Does Cromwell suddenly appear in Ireland with no mention of the Covenanters or the English civil war? To me it's annoying when English history downplays or ignores the Scottish dimension, and rather infuriating when it's claimed to be British history and does that. In researching for this some things surprised me, like Henry VIII making Ireland a kingdom because of his shift to Protestantism and falling out with the Pope. To me this is an opportunity to get each nation's history across to others, not an imposed conformity or hiding from uncomfortable truths. Thanks to all who are finding ways to improve this section, ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't understand how anyone can deny that there <i>is</i> a shared history. The <i>nature</i> of this shared history is, I suppose, disputed (although probably most English people would not deny that Ireland was treated pretty shittily), but it's simply a fact that there's a lot of common history. It seems to me that it's worth having a discussion of this here, as there's no obvious place to do it. It's useful to have a place where, for instance, we can talk about the Viking invasions <i>as they affected both islands</i>, the Norman presence in all four nations and the similarities and difference among their involvement in each place, the complex relations among the three kingdoms in the 1640s, the influence of the growth of Irish nationalism on politics in Westminster in the 19th century, and so forth. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 23:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Shared History?"</span></h2>
<p>'Shared history of the islands'. Oh please, <i>please</i> spare us that patronising shite. I mean- for the love of God. "Sharing"? We shared the dispossession, eviction, suffering, <i>institutionalised sectarianism</i>, obliteration of our traditions and culture <i>(...táim ag scriobh i mBéarla anseo</i>....) - <i>with ourselves</i>. Meanwhile, your crowd, the always <i>apolitical</i> British whose names for where we live possess no political connotations whatsoever, just tried to help us. No, nothing about the British state's presence in Ireland is political. Nope. Listen lads: You are insulting us. Not a single Paddy here accepts your <i>a</i>political potestations when you designate Ireland as part of your "British Isles". To be British was to be in power; to be Irish was to be without power. Words take on enormous meaning, <i>and there is not a point in the wide earthly world in you denying this process</i>. All of you have, to date, denied it. I can only assume it is willful. Everything- <i>every single thing</i>- about the term "British Isles" has to do with British colonial rule over us. Cut the crap. Our nations can get on great together- there are. obviously, innumerable positive connections between us- but not while you people persist in making claims over us. Give it up. Let us live together with respect for each other. For all that the Irish people have lost there remains, in their heart of hearts, a deep immovable moral sense of right and wrong about British-Irish relations. Modern political scientists might refer to it as "latent republicanism", but it goes much deeper than that. The British state, and the people who have supported their policies, have impulses over their neighbours that has a history of being frighteningly fanatic. This is the sort of issue that accentuates that history. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 18:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gringo - I'm guessing you're probably not from Tunbridge Wells, eh? Relax, man. Don't forget, the Brits have been nasty to plenty of other people - Scottish Highlanders, Welsh, Yorkshiremen after the Norman Conquest, West Country people after the Pilgrimage of Grace, English Catholics 1540-1800, Non-Conformists, Jews at various times, witches, poor people always, women, lepers etc. And thats without even mentioning slavery, the British Empire etc. So don't take it personally. And it could have been worse, you know - ask the Poles about the Germans or the Russians. I do hope in this century we can concentrate on looking forward, rather than back. Sometimes its healthy to forget. Try to remember that when most Brits use the phrase BI - in a geography project about regions of Europe where stout and porter are produced, say - they do it because it is the only term they know to describe the archipelago, and they haven't the least idea that Irish people find it offensive. As for British claims over Ireland, I rather imagine that if the UK government could by some miracle persuade the Unionists in NI to vote for a 32 county republic, the champagne would be flowing in rivers down Downing Street, and the last helicopter would lift off from Hillsborough Castle in a trice.</dd>

<dd>A bit of historical trivia re the above anonymous contribution. In the mid to late 1970s panic broke out among the leaders of the Irish government, opposition and the SDLP when some headbangers on the far left of the British Labour Party began pushing for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Irish Nationalists called it the <i>doomsday scenario</i>. The believed that British withdrawal would result in the "balkanisation of the Isles". Loyalists would massacre Nationalists on the east of Northern Ireland (where Nationalists were in a minority). Republicans would massacre Unionists in the west (where Unionists were in a minority). Hundreds of thousands would have to flee their homes (Unionists fleeing to the east, Nationalists fleeing to the west) as ethnic cleansing (a term created later) swept the North. Nationalists in the south would end up rallying to defend Nationalists in the North. Loyalists in Scotland would rally to defend Unionists. The result, Irish politicians believed, would be a civil war that would engulf much of the island of Ireland and Scotland, turning both into local Lebanons. Irish policy was aimed to stop British withdrawal at all costs because having created the mess though centuries of mis-rule, the fear was that the British were aiming to cut and run, leaving the rest to pick up the pieces in the resulting civil war. In the view of the planners, luckily the niave dreamers like Tony Benn never got a chance to put their simplistic theories into practice. The irony is, and this is openly admitted by political leaders on both side, the British would <i>love</i> to be rid of Northern Ireland, but the Republic doesn't want it. The South couldn't afford the cost of it while Britain would <i>so</i> love to be free of the accursed place. One Sinn Fein leader joked privately (I heard him say it) that if Britain turned around in the morning and said 'We are leaving. It is all yours' his response would be two words: 'oh shit.' Because suddenly he (and the other parties) would have to take responsibility rather than blaming 'the Brits' for everything. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>El Gringo, it seems to me that you are rather over-reacting here. Firstly, if I understand you correctly, what you are saying is that you "can only assume it is willful" that other posters have denied that the term "British Isles" is political. But perhaps that's simply what they believe. Anyway, the main thing I wanted to reply to was when you say "but not while you people persist in making claims over us". Who is making claims over Ireland (Republic of)?! And then you say "have impulses over their neighbours that has a history of being frighteningly fanatic". Who on earth has fanatical impulses over Ireland?! "The British Isles" is simply a geographical term. Nobody in Britain/UK has any claims to Ireland! Finally, by all means, call "The British Isles" whatever you want, but don't start being silly by talking about "impulses over their neighbours" as soon as someone else mentions that, to them, the term "British Isles" includes both the island of Great Britain, and the island of Ireland. <a href="../../../o/j/c/User%7EOjcookies_3764.html" title="User:Ojcookies">Ojcookies</a> 01:09, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's right. I just wondered why the English have been so universally hated by the other nations of the British Isles, when in fact it was we who were conquered first. Yes, okay, I can accept hatred based on the idea that we proved unable to defend the islands against the French and therefore let all of you down, but that, I feel, is not why we are disliked.

<dd>It is because, later, the English had an unfortunate habit of invading other people's countries and brutalising them. One practically universal experience Irish people have (and many Scots seem to have also) is going abroad and being treated with a rather disgusted "You are British?" comment. Once one has gotten over the "No. No. We are Irish" (usually having to throw in references to Riverdance, Mary Robinson, 1916 and a couple of other things for them to recognise where it is you are from) the smiles break out and people begin explaining their anti-British attitudes ("We hate the Breetish here too") and how any supposed enemy of Britain is a friend of their's. Trying to explain how in the post Good Friday Agreement era Britain and Ireland are all lovey-dovey, and that President McAleese thinks Queen Elizabeth a "dote" (Hiberno-English for a "really lovely person) just washes over them. More often than not, particularly in the middle east they will then say "Oh Michael Collins" and grin (he was a hero to the founders of Israel!). When they start saying "IRA" you then quickly decide to get out of there and look for the nearest British (or Breeeetish) person in a bar to sit to and chat about Coronation Street and Camilla Parker Bowles. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the English need to feel ashamed about the British Empire, any more than the Italians need to feel ashamed about the Roman Empire. Brutality certainly happened in both cases, but its perpetrators are all long dead, and for every dose of brutality their was an equal dose of spreading civilisation and prosperity (the instigators of which are all long dead as well). In short, empires happen, and are a fact of history. Taking a more long term view, they are usually considered a "good thing". <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 07:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that in Ireland at least, it is the later English presence, beginning in the late 16th century, rather than the Norman presence, which is mostly resented. The <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_English_%28Ireland%29_3a10.html" title="Old English (Ireland)">Old English</a> mostly assimilated to Irish Gaelic culture. My understanding of Norman nobility in lowland Scotland is similar.

<dd>As to the question, the answer is straightforward: the Normans assimiliated; the British didn't. The Normans became Irish and consolidated their power; the British chose not to for the same end. Norman and Gaeil became the Irish. The political system which supported Norman domination is gone as Gaeil and Normannaigh needed each other and consequently formed familial and communal unity; the <i>British</i> political system is still over 17% of Ireland precisely because it maintains the power structure for those in Ireland who describe themselves as British. Those of patrilineal Norman descent would take exception to having anything to do with the British system here. Moreover, the hostility between those of Norman and those of British descent was profound with the latter displacing the former from the second half of the sixteenth century. The former viewed the latter as uncouth, uncultured nouveau riche crooks. Those of Norman descent were the very first group in Ireland to oppose the British state, especially in religious terms. In short, it has been the political structure which has been opposed far more than it has been some nebulous ethnic identity. And the problematic political structure for the past few centuries has been the British one. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 17:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know I keep saying this, but talk pages are not for general discussion about the topic.

<p>Two things: the page needs badly to be archived. Unfortunately I am on a crap internet link right now (it took seven saves to save something last night) so I dare not try doing it. But someone needs to. Secondly, as to this general discussion — actually I disagree Rob. One of the major problems with this original page was that Irish and English (people outside England who live in the UK have a less rose-tinted viewpoint on all all-encompassing gloriousness of <i>Britishness</i>) did not understand each other's perspectives. The hysterical reaction to efforts by moderate Irish users to mention that there are some problems with the <i>British Isles</i> evidenced just how wide the gulf was. I think this sort of discussion is immensely helpful both to the people here now and to future readers of the article in helping them understand the background to the differing viewpoints and how they shape perceptions. I have no doubt but that how Wikipedia dealt with as thorny an issue as a controversial term like <i>British Isles</i> will be analysed academically in years to come. And putting on my historian's hat for a moment, it is precisely <i>these</i> sort of discussions that reveal the underlying perspectives and reasoning. I would like to hear a more cohesively argued explanation for the British perspective on Britishness, given that it is the Britishness of the term and its interpreted meaning that makes it so controversial to non-British people. Unfortunately Tharuncoll hasn't gone beyond the occasional outburst of "Brits are great . . . Brits are cool . . . Brits saved the world"-toned statements where a more detailed analysis would be useful. Normally discussions on the issues of the day aren't useful on talk pages, but here, in exploring attitudes, I think the analysis is sensible, useful and informative. All sides, here now and in the future, will benefit from the insight provided. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:52, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You <i>still</i> don't get it.

If you don't understand the differing contexts and understandings of the term <i>british</i> then you cannot understand the competing political, historical, social and cultural meanings attached by people on both sides to the term "British Isles". Considering the appallingly inadequate state of this article earlier, to talk as though its POV-pushing of a largely English perspective on the ter, was either verifiable or encyclopaediac is a joke.

Such a discussion is probably not appropriate for this article, but there is plenty of source material available.

<p>As someone who has lived in Britain (specifically England) for a few years, perhaps I could try to provide a British perspective. The first thing to say is that terminology for the archipelago, and the various political units, is a complete mess, with many similar, overlapping terms, and only a tiny percentage of people knowing what they actually mean. As for the term British Isles, here it is not used that often, but it is used in situations where a geographic description of the archipelago is needed for which political units aren't relevant eg 'climate change in the British Isles', weather reports, or in atlases. In Great Britain this usage is not controversial (apart possibly for small numbers of Scottish and Welsh Nationalists). I have not seen any evidence that use of the term represents lingering nostalgia for imperialism, or a desire to piss off the Irish - it is simply the widely accepted, conventional term. I would disagree with Jtdirl's statement that the term is controversial to non-British people. I suspect you will find that to English-speaking people outside the archipelago (American tourists, Malaysian students etc), who do after all represent 95% of English speakers, this is a complete non-issue. You only have to look at foreign tourist websites about this part of the world, with their widespread conflation of England, Britain, UK, Ireland and British Isles, to see that they do not know, and they do not care.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 09:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Unfortunately Tharuncoll hasn't gone beyond the occasional outburst of "Brits are great . . . Brits are cool . . . Brits saved the world"</i> That's rather unfair, and you have clearly not understood my arguments in any sense at all. I'll try and recap as succinctly as possible. The term British Isles has existed for at least two millennia and maybe more. It wasn't until the 17th century that the British <i>state</i> appropriated the term "British" for itself. Ireland is part of the British Isles because it always has been, and has nothing to do with its much later conquest by the self-styled British state. My comments about the British Empire earlier have no part in this argument, and were merely in response to some ridiculous anti-British statements made by ignorant posters. The fact is that the English/British may not have been the most peace-loving people in the world, but we are very far from being the worst offenders in history. One of our many usurpations, in my opinion, was our appropriation of the word "British", which originally had no political connotations whatsoever. It is interesting to note that it was the <i>Scottish</i> Stuarts who orginally coined the term in a political context, and it was for a very long time disliked by the English. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 08:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that StoneMad's summary is a reasonable one - in Great Britain, 'British Isles' is a virtual non-issue (indeed <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> has dropped right off the political radar since 1997 over here) and the vast majority of people know or care little about the terminology. As for a more general summary on attidues to 'Britain', 'British' and the 'UK'... well there's a lot more variation on that. I think its fair to say that the majority of English people sub-consciously equate the UK and England, though they really mean nothing by this. That said, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Lothian_Question_f089.html" title="West Lothian Question">West Lothian Question</a> has been bubbling under for a while now and is slowly building a head of steam (its a regular point of discussion on the BBC's Daily Politics Show). <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Brown_e90d.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> appears particularly worried by this - as a Scottish MP in a Scottish constituency, any English dissillusionment with the Union or with the role of non-English MP's would clearly damage his chances of becoming Prime Minister (one suspects that the Conservative party, the only parliamentary party who's potential next Prime Minister is from an English constituency, might quite enjoy this problem.) Another interesting thing is that some people claim that <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Murray_c640.html" title="Andy Murray">Andy Murray</a> (or any non-English sportsman) is always described by the media as 'British' when he wins and 'Scottish' when he loses.</dd>

He would probably never say that he's from the 'British' Isles. However, I do think that this is a relatively rare viewpoint. Mostly, Britain is used without thought or controversy for the UK and British Isles is not really thought about either. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Robdurbar, may I mirror what you have said. The term <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is not controversial in Ireland either. The fact is that hardly anyone uses the term. Usually it's just plain old "Britain and Ireland". As far as most Irish folk are concerned any validity for the term, as regarding Ireland, expired in 1922. Hope you don't take offence that Irish folks don't want to be called British. Well there is no offence intended and I can assure you that despite the "history", almost all Irish people have a warm and tender good wish for their 'British counterparts'.

<dd>I agree that it is not controversial per say in Ireland in the sense that few use it. Most regard the term as as outdated as the <i>Austro-Hungarian Empire</i> or the <i>Soviet Union</i>. A small minority use it. On the rare times it is used it is always controversial. I know that on slow weeks and in the silly season where there is no major news and they are struggling to generate interest newspapers used to ask me to write articles that could include the term just to cause controversy. It works every time. There are a handful of topics guaranteed to cause a row if covered in the media: "British Isles", how George Bush is a <i>Great Man of Our Time</i>, how <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> are heroes/bastards/freedom fighters/murderers/nazis etc, and other topics. I know when I submitted an article to one of the mainstream broadsheets in the UK (I won't reveal which one because their policy on the term it is not publicly stated by them yet — they are afraid of a right wing backlash) I in passing used "British Isles" they edited it out, telling me afterwards that they thought it a rather old-fashioned term they were quitely fading out from their newspaper. A number of British newspapers who have different editions for England, Scotland and Ireland use <i>British Isles</i> in the English version while (except for the jingoist Mail and Express) ensure the term does not turn up in their Scottish and Irish editions. (Both the Sun and the Sunday Times got a bit of bashing when it slipped through into their Irish editions by accident once.) One of the funniest experiences I remember was of a gang of people (some Irish, 3 Scots, a couple of Welsh guys and a member of the Young Conservatives) at a political function. They were all discussing how different their countries are. Then the young tory pipped up "but we are all the same in one way. We are all from the British Isles". The Irish had an instant 'disgusted look' but kept quiet. But Sheena from Glasgow went ballastic using language about the term I wouldn't repeat here. Her boyfriend had to tell her to calm down. Of all the people there, bar the Tory, everyone there was either (i) indifferent to the term but found it irritating; (ii) found the term rather old-fashioned and annoying, (iii) offensive and derogatory. It was actually the Scottish, rather than the Irish, who seemed to find it the most annoying. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it odd that the English want to be called British - from what I can tell the people of Wales, Scotland and Ireland are all ethnically 'Britons' (Not Celts according to recent genetic research) whereas the English are not. Why the English want to adopt the name of a subject people who lost pratically every battle they fought i'll never know. I'm all for calling the place England and the British Isles and letting the alcoholic stone age 'briton' wallow in the fact that they are histories losers.</p>

<ul>
<li>the caveat in the first sentence. This has been discussed on a number of occaisions and consensus has appeared to support it. Though I can see its problems - its a bit wishy washy and not entirely encyclopedic or clear - it also stops people reacting violently to the article from just reading the first sentence.</li>
<li>Similarly the the coments removed from the rest of the intro - I don't see what's wrong in claiming that the Irish media and government rarely use the term</li>

<dd>I rolled back both those edits however, as they were mixed up with some other stuff and i probably made too many changes w/o discussion.

If on the other hand you are trying to discount the Ahern statement that's a tougher issue, but i still feel it would be OR. We shouldn't be in the business of trying to disprove what a politician says with google searches. We need to find a secondary source addressing the issue.</dd>
<dd>If we are unlikely to find such a source, if no one would take the time to challenge the statement, then we shouldn't try to do that work ourselves.

<p>To reply to TharkunColl; I think we had decided that the half dozen or so uses that could be found were only sufficient to show that some politicians used it occiaisionally - but that is still 'rare' and the Ahern statement later in the article supports this assertion. As for EricR's comments - I see no problem in using primary sources as evidence 'However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged' --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 06:38, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The basic problem, IMO, remains that despite the separate <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> article, we evidently have a number of editors who don't think this article should exist under this name (or perhaps at all), and a seemingly inexorable drift to a state with half a dozen separate disclaimers about its inaccuracy, offensiveness, etc, and a lengthy section that's essentially duplicative of said other article. IMO a sensible application of <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a> would be to have: <i>one</i> mention of the terminology issues in the lead of this article, and <i>one</i> short section on terminology, being essentially similar to the lead of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>, and serving as a summary and cross-reference to same.

<dd>Disagree totally. Apart from anything else the very name <i>British Isles (terminology)</i> presumes there is a clear British Isles and the only issue is a dispute over names. As Irish users ad nausaum keep pointing out (and obviously will have to do continually on this page indefinitely) the dispute is much more fundamental and the name of the article carries with it a presumption that most Irish people and many other people elsewhere reject and find offensive.</dd>

<dd>As to Eric's nonsense about OR, he patently obviously doesn't know what OR means. Those of us who wrote that policy wrote it to cover academics and others who decide to place unpublished (and so unreviewed) information on Wikipedia. WP is not designed to be a primary source document, but to be a secondary one. OR does <i>not</i> mean <i>published</i> that source information cannot be used. Nor that it cannot be assembled. It means that <i>unpublished</i> source information cannot be used. If something is published then it can be used. Eric clearly doesn't know the difference. If Eric's wacky interpretation of OR was applied to WP then 98% of all history articles on WP would have to be removed as so-called OR. The entire set of articles on British history would have to be deleted. All the articles on Wikipedia about royalty would have to go. And all the political articles. It is a kooky interpretation of OR. At this stage any more of these nonsensical OR deletions will simply be reverted on sight. I am fed up having to clean up Eric's nutty interpretation of OR, and some people's screwed up spellings, mucked up footnotes, garbled sentences and the like all the time. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:54, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's first of all attempt to be slow to label others' contributions as "nonsense", etc.; there's enough inherent scope for disagreement here without unnecessarily causing people go on the defensive (or indeed, offensive). For my money, there <i>is</i> indeed a clearly-definable such archipelago, and the only disagreement <i>is</i> about terminology: and that's precisely what keeps being added to the article -- in ever-increasing numbers -- witness 'The <i>term</i> "British Isles"[...]'; 'This use of this <i>name</i> [...]'; 'Irish media rarely use the <i>term</i>[...]' (emph. mine) -- all just from the term-deleted lead section. This is the "terminology" articles, writ large (and writ often). Nowhere is it suggested that Irish people, or indeed anyone else in particular, do not refer to the islands collectively <i>at all</i> -- even those many people somewhat hindered by not having a term they actually find acceptable, that makes sense outside of any given context, seem to manage one way or another. ("These islands" and "Britain and Ireland" (or even "Ireland and England", just to keep the need for terminological accuracy in perspective) being pretty popular usages, which are at any rate not <i>intended</i> to have a different scope or definition.) I don't see much in the way of geographical argument being introduced to suggest they're not a group of islands, but just an optical illusion, or that there's some completing <i>geographical</i> definition abroad. (What political and historical material it's wise to include here is, as I commented previously, another matter.) If you want to rename the "terminology" article, or to merge it back in here, that's another matter, but not one that's sensibly addressed just by adding the same content here, and leaving the other as-is. The trouble with the alleged need to "keep pointing out ad nauseam" is that what's being pointed out isn't really speaking to how to improve the article, but is really just addressing objections to the article's existence/title by displacement, and isn't ultimately going to be especially productive. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I suggest that reality on OR lies somewhere between the positions of Jtdirl and Eric R here? OR does not just have the aim of stopping people publishing academic work here; it also acts to stop people from claiming 'I know x because I have experienced it'. Similalry, Jtdril is right that primary sources are fine to use, though 2ndary are better. When doing so, however, we have to make it clear how we are using sources.</dd>

But if the general feeling is that we need to have that much here, I won't protest (too much). Perhaps Jtdirl is correct that (to paraphrase) we need to degrade the article somewhat in order to prevent it being degraded a lot, but that's hardly ideal. Amount of material aside, it's surely the case that it should be as <i>consolidated</i> as possible, rather than drifting in and out of focus as it does at present. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. On this issue, given its sensitivity, we <i>have</i> to have a large terminology section here. If there isn't, then you will have edit wars <i>ad infinitum</i> because various users or editors will interpret the absence of a large terminology section as indicative of bias (i.e., that the views of one set of people are reflected in the article and the views of millions of others shunted into another article). The way to avoid that is for the article to contain a full discussion of the topic. That is regularly done on WP in sensitive articles <i>even</i> where there is replication with some other article somewhere.</dd>

<dd>Re OR — the central issue is whether there is independent verifiable documentary evidence or analysis available. The insistence of Eric that there must be discussion not statement is preposterous. There is no documentary discussion on the date of Elvis Presley's birthdate, just a statement of it in sources. Where things are so patiently obvious that they are not discussed, or where there is a complete consensus on something that it is not discussed, one simply refers to documents that state 'x' or 'y'.

<p>Jtdirl, you are simply mischaracterizing my statements concerning original research. When discussing the use of neologism i have indeed said that the sources we use should <i>discuss</i> the term's usage, not simply <i>use</i> the term. This is straight out of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. I have not applied this principle to the use of sources in general.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that wikipedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, not as you say a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a>. Perhaps that is the crux of our little disagreement here? If your intention is to provide commentary, analysis and criticism of other sources then you and i are definitely working at cross purposes here.</p>
<p>Isn't there maybe some way we can work together on this article? Reverting my edits on sight is, i have to admit, a very straight-forward solution. For various reasons i am currently opposed to such a course of action. Do you have any other suggestions? I am currently at a loss as to how to proceed.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 00:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would be grateful if someone could clarify exactly what the dispute is about. Is it about 1) the definition of the 'British Isles' ie whether or not they include Ireland, southern and northern. Or is 2) that the term is agreed to include Ireland, but for this reason people from Ireland find its use unacceptable, as indicating an anachronistic and inaccurate British control over the archipelago as a whole. Because 1) and 2) are incompatible - one of them must be incorrect. If the Irish people do find the term unacceptable as indicating British control over their territory, it follows logically that they accept that the term does include Ireland in its definition.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 18:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Only if your presume that all Irish people agree with each other, which is a nonesensical viewpoint regarding any group so large. Generally, though, '2)' almost deiffnately applies; for some - Jtdril and MelFobes argue many although part of the problem is that there is little proof for either side as to 'how many' - 1) applies. I don't think the two are incompatible - to someone following both points of view, those using it are both wrong in the area that they cover with it and, because they're using it for this area, are using it inaccurately.</p>
<p>As for the OR - I'm afraid I can see both sides of this argument and can't really provide you with a solution. The good news is, I think, that it now seems to just be two paragraphs over which you differ substantially. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 20:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'd go so far as to say that <i>most</i> Irish people would have objections on the grounds of 2), but it's indeed hard to quantify, or come to that to precisely describe in the grand scheme of "offence" and/or "controversy". You'd probably not want to say "Of course, Ireland <i>is</i> part of the British Isles" loudly in a north Kerry pub, though. I've also heard it framed in terms of 1) on occasion. ('If you must use that phrase, it <i>should</i> mean "British Islands"', roughly speaking.) Rather than OR or not OR, it's perhaps best to reframe this in terms of what can be backed up with reliable sources, and what can't (or at least, isn't). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:04, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Most Irish people would agree that the term British Isles does exist, but with regard to the inclusion of Ireland, most would disagree. So the second biggest island of the "British and Irish" archipelago disagree with Ireland's inclusion in that BI political term, how frightening that must be for some people. An observation to the discussion about avoidance of the term in Ireland, with citations demanded for almost all sentences. Well there is something so glaringly obvious that it is almost knocking the eyes out of my head, and that is the avoidance of the term by the United Kingdom government, so much so that Westminster had to draft a new act of parliament called The Interpretation Act 1978, to invent a new term named the British Islands in order to deal with this great dilemma. It was a stroke of good luck that the term British Islands wasn't a political term, otherwise the unbecoming term <i>British Islets</i> would have had to be invoked, thus saving the day!

<p>EricR, I wonder - what exactly do you want to 'prove' that the term is controversial to many in ireland? Would it be accpetable with one citation and changing the word 'many' to 'some'? I would support this - until we can prove percentages etc. (which we can't) then we shouldn't be using words like 'many', 'a majority' or 'a minority'. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 05:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>LOL. There is a term some copyeditors write down as HSCO, FFS or DSTBO ("Have Some Cop-On", "for Fuck sake" or "Don't state the bleeding obvious"). It refers to a case where evidence is asked for a bleeding obvious. (Some gobshite some time ago on an article on a member of the Royal Family but in a citation request for the fact that they were born!!! Another wanted evidence that a particular king was male!!! Another person put a cit request for a mention that Great Britain physically is an island, while I saw one once put onto a statement that John F. Kennedy — I think it was — was President of the United States.) FFSs or HSCOs are where the answer is so patently obvious and universally recognised that you presume that the reader has a sufficient brain in their head capable of knowing elementary facts. The <i>... the fact that the British Isles in general coincided with...</i> is a classic HSCO moment. That doesn't require a citation. Every map shows it. Everyone who has ever seen a map knows it. The British Isles is understood to consist of two big islands and a lot of small ones. The two big ones consist of the vast majority of the land mass of the BI — somewhere in the mid 90s in percentage terms. They together formed the UK of GB and I. Ipso facto the British Isles generally coincided with the former UK of GB and I. Any case where a 90%+ of the land mass belongs to something can be said to be <i>generally coinciding with</i>. <i>precisely concided with</i> would be inaccurate. The article doesn't say that. Please, Eric, don't go down the road of HSCOs. Your question <i>can we find any source which says that this is the origin of the additional meanings?</i> is classic HSCO. Geography only became understood in any mass sense in the last three centuries, if not a lot less, ie, since the appearance of primary education for ordinary people. From the early 1700s to 1800 the two states shared a same crown and Ireland was not seen anywhere as independent. (It was generally viewed as a form of colony.) From 1800 to 1922 it was formally joined at constitutional level to GB. Similarly your complaint about the meanings is another HSCO. You aren't comparing like with like. One talks about a <i>term</i> which is a <i>formal defined</i> understood concept. The others are referred to as <i>additional meanings</i> which means not formally defined but generally understood as a broad concept to mean. To use a similar case. <i>Great Britain</i> is a formal name for an island. It also has broad cultural meanings outside simple geography, being used variously to mean the whole UK (particularly for some reason in sports), sometimes even just England (often by Americans who get confused by all the different nomenclature) and other meanings. Please be careful to read how things are phrased. I think you may be missing various nuances in the text, and also innocently straying too much into HSCO territory on occasion. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 01:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To avoid that sort of problem I originally wrote the sentence in reverse, mentioning the kingdom, then saying it broke into two states one being the "Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland)". Historians generally write a text chronologically to avoid these sort of problems that arise when one writes it backwards, when changes in time with nomenclatures can be open to all sort of misunderstandings. However some users <i>insisted</i> on writing it in reverse chronology and using only current nomenclature to save space, even though it was pointed out that it would cause this sort of problem.

<dd>A very fair point made! I suggest inserting 'Great Britain and Ireland' in place of 'the two together'. With no disrespect to other editors, I have tried to make the wording flow a little more and try to make things even clearer. The result of my efforts on paragraph 2 is as follows:</dd>
<dd>'The archipelago contains two sovereign states: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The islands also include the Isle of Man, a United Kingdom crown dependency. Both states, but not the Isle of Man, are members of the European Union. Between 1801 and 1922, Great Britain and Ireland together formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland ceased to be a part of the United Kingdom and became the Republic of Ireland.'</dd>
<dd>I hope this may be acceptable; nothing fundamental has changed and only an extra 'United Kingdom' has been added. One additional note, I see the removal of the 'is rejected by some...' sentence from the first paragraph - with however the sentence above indicating the existance of a controvery, I personally am content with this. I added in 'particularly in Ireland', as I think it is important. Kind regards, <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 15:40, 12 August 2006</dd>

<p>Pytheas actually put Britain (and the name) on the map, it is rather like diminishing the role of Columbus in America. I will not be reverting, but I ask you, do you think that place names should have most of their alternative appelations included in the fist words of the opening paragraph? For instance, some place names were founded under one name, as new populations arrived, another name took over, occasionally a third; and then some of those places reverted to their original appelation. Meanwhile, neighbours speaking different tongues may call the same place by a different name. Should those names be in the opening line? (I ask because there is a debate at another corner of wikipedia over precisely that. My argument is that any other appelation should only be included further down, in the historical or etimological section - as is the case with this article - and only if historically relevant).

<dd>Hecataeus, a Greek historian in the 517 BC. How about the "Keltoi Isles", that is if Hecataeus had got his say! He didn't mention <i>islands of the Prettanike</i> either. Don't think the British Isles were ever even mentioned until 15th century, and it was Anglo-French spelling then, but it's not clear whether Ireland was to be included in the term. I presume that they weren't beckoned on the issue! <i>Islands of Britain</i> are mentioned, but also there are numerous references to <i>Islands of Ireland</i> too. Really we can draw any conclusions we like from the evidence. Columbus may not be the finest of examples, for didn't he believe that he was in India. Point I'm making is that it is a difficult subject to get full agreement on every line and comma. Adding Pytheas to the first paragraph adds argument to that paragraph, maybe the article is better served by having it in the body text. MelForbes 14:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

'British' does always mean 'of Great Britain' or 'of the UK' doesn't it?! The Falklands Islands are 'British' because they are governed/protected by the United Kingdom. I've simplified it back.

<dd>No, British is an ancient word with a complex history, and some of its uses long predate the formation of the UK. An obvious example of this is the term British Isles.

<p>The swastika is harmless; its use to denote nazism is not. In Mexico <i>El Gringo</i> derives from term given to the troops that invaded and occupied Mexico before half of its territory was forcibly annexed; by this doctrine its use is solely to approve of this. History does not consist of people in white hats and people in black hats, as the Boer War article actually makes clear. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have never suggested that the term is used "commonly" in Ireland, and have therefore made no claim that requires verification. I have merely stated that the term <i>is</i> used in Ireland, and to prove this there are numerous references to it on the Irish government's own website. I even placed these in the article, but strangely they were all edited out. On no occasion whatever have I quoted anything from the British government's website. As for people of Irish descent, just try and think for a moment what this actually means. Ireland has had people living in it for thousands of years, and due to well known processes such as migration and genetic dispersal, it is a foregone conclusion that every single one of us has at least some ancestors who lived in Ireland (and anywhere else you care to mention). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 23:11, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I would have thought the Irish government situation is quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of the Irish government have specifically said that the term is avoided</li>
<li>However, it is a phrase that many will have grown up hearing, and all will be aware of. It is rediculous to suggest that any democratic government will screen every speach or document coming from its members. Thus, 'British Isles' will sometimes get used, even by those who disagree with the term .</li>
<li>Indeed, to talk of 'the Irish government' as one monolithic organisation is rediculous.</li>
<li>This means that both the phrases 'the Irish government never uses the term' and 'the term is still used by the Irish government' mis-represent the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article has compromised adequatly on this issue for a while - the important FACTS are that 1. the term is rejected by Irish politicians but 2. occaisionally slips into use.

<dd>Yeah, unfortunately some good edits to <i>Terminology</i> may have been lost and will have to be reviewed: I've cut the sport bit as per <a href="#Removed_reference" title="">#Removed reference</a> above. The whole section needs to be gone over to make it informative rather than presenting one opinion, but I'm not rushing at it without getting better sources than the rather dodgy ones that have been found so far. A while ago I requested citations from the books that are listed at footnote 26: given questionable inferences being drawn from other sources it will be helpful if someone with access to the books can check what they actually say on the subject. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 21:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting, if you search for something, then you will surly find it. The world is actually flat, that is if you cite <i>The Flat Earth Society</i>. I thought that The Guardian used to be called the Manchester Guardian. Now, is Manchester in England, or is it in Britain. Surely it's in the British Isles somewhere. But it does not follow that Irish people use the term British Isles. The Irish Times search seems to lead to a predominance of unionist parties, which don't exist in sovereign Ireland.

<dd>Yes I did. You used phrases such as "slips into use", almost implying that the ministers and officials used the term accidentally, without realising they had done so. This is pure POV, not to mention rather insulting to the people concerned. Are you saying that members of the Irish government are so conditioned that they keep using the term without really wanting to?

<p>The sovereign state Ireland should be referred to by it's proper legal title. To refer to it by any other name is an exercise in pov. A mere 15% of the island of Ireland opted against the consensus in 1922, and now refer to themselves as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Is it correct to refer to it by Northern Ireland, or should it be referred to as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

<p>Hello, tis <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">me</a>. In general, we should refer to Ireland as such; that is its name. However, there are some cases, possibly in this article (though I havn't checked every individual use) where we should use Republic of Ireland, in order to disambiguate from the island for users who are unfamiliar with the region/subject. This could, alternatively, be something mentioned in a reference. --88.107.146.96 09:51, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the statement above that <i>"Sovereign Ireland"</i> is the proper legal title and "to refer to it by any other name is an exercise in pov" explains the recent edit where MelForbes has substituted "sovereign Ireland" for "Republic of Ireland", but conflicts with <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_the_Irish_state_1b3f.html" title="Names of the Irish state">Names of the Irish state</a> which says that "The <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_34ea.html" title="Republic of Ireland Act">Republic of Ireland Act</a>, adopted in 1949, provided that, henceforth, the <i>Republic of Ireland</i> would be the official 'description' of the state, but not its name." and that "the term <i>Republic of Ireland</i> is commonly used in ordinary speech, especially in any context in which it is necessary to distinguish between the state and the island as a whole. So, for example, one always speaks of there being a border "between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland" rather than between <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and "Ireland"." Of course the anecdote about QE2 will be true, since "As a name of the state, <i>Ireland</i> is used for almost all official purposes.... It is also used in the state's diplomatic relations with foreign nations", but this article is required to explain things to readers less versed in Court language than HM. Of course if these statements are superseded, please provide a verifiable reliable source for the change.

<p>"Sovereign Ireland," as a proper noun, seems to be something of a neologism, and also strikes as being the kind of term used by people who call Northern Ireland the "6 occupied counties".

<p>John, Mel wrote "sovereign Ireland" not "Sovereign Ireland". The former is not a proper noun. It is absolutely normal to write the word "sovereign" (lowercased) before the name of a state. Re "Republic of Ireland" there ain't no such place. There is a place called "Ireland" whose description, in Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act is "Republic". If one is writing about both the south and north, "Republic of Ireland" is a tolerable but inaccurate disambiguation vehicle. In the context of states, there is no need for disambiguation because there is no grounds for confusion between the two sovereign states, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland is not a state. It is merely a region of a state, the UK. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 17:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I wouldn't really be looking to change the content, just 'streamline' it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 16:16, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I second this. The Perspectives in Ireland section is very prolix. The point its making is essentially a simple one - that in Ireland the term is seen as offensive and defunct, and is therefore rarely used, except by NI Unionist politicians. I don't think anyone seriously contests this. An explanation and a couple of refs are all that is needed.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 23:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where did you read 'British Isles Council'? Bertie Ahern:
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British-Irish_Council_0a05.html" title="British-Irish Council">British-Irish Council</a> is the expression of a relationship that at the origin of the Anglo-Irish process in 1981 was sometimes given the name Iona, islands of the North Atlantic, and sometimes Council of the Isles,...</p>
</blockquote>
A council, not the archipelago. Is this really so unreasonable a position that i must be joking, when it's the position nearly all our sources support?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 19:00, 19 August 2006 (UTC) (added to Ahern quote<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 19:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>You are completely confused on two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What IONA is</li>
<li>What Bertie said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is not suprising. Bertie's inability to speak English is notorious (the entire Dáil has been left on occasion trying to work out what he is talking about). What he said, above, is typical Bertie bullshit. (I know some of his speechwriters and they pull their preverbial hair out with what he does to what they wrote.)</p>
<p>For the record, IONA is NOTHING to do with the British-Irish Council. IONA is a term used to refer to <b>a set of islands</b>. The British-Irish Council is an assembly made of members of <b>parliaments on the islands</b>. There is nothing else to it. IONA is simply a term coined to be used to refer to those islands at a time when a new relationship was developing. It was intended to replace the "British Isles" because "British Isles" is objectionable and offensive to millions on the archipelago. <i>Sometimes</i> people use IONA as a symbol of the new relationship (i.e., to show that that relationship is now based on understanding and sensitivity, hence it being used and the ditching of "British Isles") but they don't mean that the term IS the relationship, just that it is a symbol OF it. That is what Bertie, in his usual garbled manner, was trying to convey. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've added to the Ahern quote above to provide more context, a link to the full speech is available on the references page. I don't disagree that IONA is sometimes associated with "the totality of relationships", but in this instance Ahern is clearly listing IONA and Council of the Isles as alternate names for the council. Isn't the difficulty of trying to interpret meaning a good reason to look to secondary sources? Most of which i've seen so far clearly use IONA as the proposed name of a council.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, we've already taken up quite a bit of space with this discussion, any objection to moving everything from my 18:11 comment till now to IONA talk and get out of the way of the merge discussion?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 19:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am astonished. IONA <i>never ever ever</i> meant the Council. Never. IONA is, as the name makes clear, about <i>islands</i>. It is not, and never has been, about a political body. I am amazed you have got that so monumentally wrong. IONA is 100% about an alternative name for the islands. It has been used as shorthand for a relationship. But it never ever ever ever meant the Council. Just think about it: what dork would name a council <i>Islands of the North Atlantic</i>? Official bodies use words like Council, Body, etc. They do not simply use a term without using any of the standard language for governmental and parliamentary structures. Calling the Council the Islands of the North Atlantic would be about as silly as calling the Council the British Isles, calling the European Parliament <i>Europe</i> or calling the US Congress the <i>United States</i>! Somewhere along the line you have got your wires completely crossed and have mixed up unrelated things. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mr. Peter Luff (Mid-Worcestershire):
<blockquote>
<p>What is it that the people of this kingdom are being offered? There will be a Parliament for Scotland--quite an ambitious and wide-ranging Parliament--with significant powers. There will be an assembly for Wales, with fewer significant powers. There will be a new devolved body for Northern Ireland. I am sure that that will have its merits in the context of the Northern Ireland peace process. In the same context, there will be a council of the isles. I think that some people are calling it IONA--the islands of the north Atlantic, from which England, by definition, will be excluded.</p>

<dd>If you read the full nature of Peter's contribution you will see that he is speaking through his arse on the topic. For a start, how could the council not include England if it was made up of representatives of <i>all</i> the states? So far, as "evidence" (though it barely qualifies for the term) you have produced a typically garbled contribution by Bertie, which is so confused it goes round in circles about nothing at all, and a rambling contribution from a minor MP who is so confused he thinks that somehow a Council of the Isles can leave out England!!! Again, I repeat: your equation of IONA with the Council of the Isles is complete nonsense. They are <b>totally</b> different things. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, some using IONA are talking out their ass, others are confused and incoherent—but somehow we are able to divine which are expressing <b>The True</b> meaning of the acronym. Maybe we would do better to look to a secondary source to help with the confusion:
<blockquote>
<p>The UUP had long been interested in such an overarching Council of the British Isles and it had also been an idea that inspired British Conservatives like Sir John Biggs-Davison who had earlier coined the acronym IONA, Isles of the North Atlantic, for a similar vision.</p>

<p>Zeech. No. But anyone who has done even the slightest bit of research knows how to read context, and knows the difference between '<b>context</b>, <b>definition</b> and <b>structure</b>. You don't seem able to and mix up all three over and over. You've just done it yet again by misunderstanding Aughey. Sir John had a vision of a <b>relationship</b>. He proposed to get away from the bitternesses of the past by using new terminology for that <b>relationship</b> across the archipelago. He proposed as a neutral <b>name</b> for the parts, IONA, as an alternative to the existing controversial name, British Isles. The UUP had a similar vision for a new <b>relationship</b> and used Sir John's concept of the IONA <b>relationship</b> as the basis for it. Central to their proposed <b>structure</b> for the <b>relationship</b> was to be a consultative parliamentary <b>body</b> called the <b>British Isles Council</b>. Denis Canavan, as shown in the article, argued that they should drop the <i>British Isles</i> bit because it was potentially offensive to Irish Nationalists, given their experience of what "British" in the governmental sense had done to them. The name chosen for that <b>body</b> was the British-Irish Council.</p>
<p>How many more times does it have to be explained to you?</p>
<ul>
<li>relationship = archipelago (British Isles / IONA)</li>
<li>structure = parliamentary body (Council for the Isles/British Isles Council).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>They are TWO different things</b>. The very names makes that clear. One is a <b>council</b> (i.e., a formal body made up of politicians). One is a <b>geographical/cultural/historic relationship</b> on an archipelago, known variously as the <i>British Isles</i>, <i>British Isles and Ireland</i>, the <i>Anglo-Celtic Isles</i> or the <i>Islands of the North Atlantic</i>. An <i>island</i> and a consultative parliamentary body are <b>two different things</b>.

<dd>And now, not only must we selectively ignore usage of IONA, but also disregard the plain text meaning of secondary sources by authors which actually discuss the acronym. I have not misunderstood Aughey, but have simply read the passage without attempting to impose a preexisting bias on it's meaning. Perhaps the quote provided was too lean and you were guessing at the pre and post text? I have added to the quote on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_References_9738.html#Islands_of_the_North_Atlantic" title="Talk:British Isles/References">references page</a> to show that Aughey was clearly discussing the British-Irish Council.</dd>
<dd>Your desire to read extra meaning into source text is noted, the use of the (Davies 1999, p. xxii) citation is in a similar vein. I've added the relevant quote to the references page—a quote which does not support the article text to which it has been variously attached.</dd>
<dd>Article text which is not supported by a reputable source seems to have been accepted by most of this article's editors, despite the verifiability policy.

<p>Hi Blisco, You're a brave person. I think you are completely right about the first point: explicit POV fork, no information there which is not found here, and potentially confusing; however, the redirect could go to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> and give the reader the opportunity to work out which bit of the archipelago they want or all of it.</p>
<p>With respect to your second point, the article is not well written, but <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islands_of_the_North_Atlantic_9a9d.html" title="Islands of the North Atlantic">Islands of the North Atlantic</a> has a life of its own owing to its role within the Northern Ireland peace process and so does justify a separate article.

<p>And "British Isles" is not "explicitly pov"? Get a grip. Have you people ever read even the basics of Irish history? Do you people really think the British state sauntered in here and we ran out with flowers and cups of tea and gave you all our land, power, customs, language, legal system and said 'yes, keep us under your sectarian <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_laws_%28Ireland%29_a5f5.html" title="Penal laws (Ireland)">Penal laws</a> for centuries'. You profoundly insulting individuals. The term "British Isles" is nothing if it is not reflective of British tribal prejudices and political aspirations regarding Ireland. A more political pov term I cannot imagine. But it is astounding how non-pov it is just because it is a name which your tribe invented.

<dd>That is an unfair attack, Gringo. Most of the users here have struggled to grasp the problems the name "British Isles" causes in Ireland. Thar is in complete denial, but as the editing history shows a broad range of users have come to understand something of the complexity and have shown a willingness to take it on board. And just because the British and English states and their oligarchies many years ago made horrendous mistakes does not mean that today's British and English people cannot be held responsible for those actions. The people here are not "profoundly insulting individuals". One or two have acted that way. But the vast majority on all sides of the argument are trying to get to grips with a complex topic and take on board all the aspects of it, including Irish experiences of British (mis)rule and how it colours any reference to the <i>"British" Isles. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear</b></span><b>ÉIREANN</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

We should have one article on <b>the island group</b>, call it what you will, with all terms which unequivocally refer to that group redirecting to it. If the terms are disputed, explain the dispute. If there is a lot of explanation to be done, have <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">an article</a> dedicated to the purpose.

If so, would you be happy with the consequence that good-faith editors would create links to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> thinking they were providing readers with more information about said islands, when in fact they were landing them with a debate over terminology? --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 23:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, has kikced off here again. I've always held the belief that there should be one article on the archipalego, and that that should be held at 'a' page, to which all the others redirect. Mel Frobes' proposal, whilst interesting in a way, goes against the idea of Wikipedia having articles on 'things' rather than on 'words'. Furthermore, Stonemad's point about not having multiple articles for each point of view is important. Personally, I would rather see how the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anglo-Celtic_Isles_b117.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anglo-Celtic Isles">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anglo-Celtic Isles</a> ends first, and use that as a precedent for the other term articles. I think 'IONA' has the advantage of being well sourced and gives a detalied and interesting article and is 'just and so' acceptable. I agree that I see little point in having an article called Britain and Ireland - as discussed previously, its debatable as to whether this is even a phrase or not. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 20:06, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rob, the problem with that theory, like Javert, it doesn't flex. Then the constant hearing of the mantra, "Wikipedia is not a dictionary", like some hollow looped digital recording telling us not to, is actually quite meaningless. If one reads the relevant WP pages dealing with these issues, they are not cut and dried like some would like to claim. This analysis, if forced to it's conclusion would redirect many WP articles. Just in the space of 15 minutes I have thought of 9 articles that would redirect under <i>the theory</i>.

<dd>OK, I was over-general with my selective quoting of Wikipedia guidelines. Terms that are clearly pejorative or non-standard, if notable enough, certainly shouldn't be merged into the standard term (though any article with a link to Wictionary prominently at the top, such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Jap.html" title="Jap">Jap</a>, is likely to be of questionable utility IMHO). I take back my semi-serious suggestion of merging IONA, which I made out of a personal preference for long and comprehensive articles over short and insubstantial ones. "Britain and Ireland", however, is not pejorative or non-standard but a standard term that refers to the same entity that is generally known outside Ireland as the British Isles (give or take the IoM). More to the point, the entity and issues it describes are dealt with adequately by both <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>.

<dd>Mel - <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is not a theory - its an official policy. The fact that there may be some articles on Wiki that do not comply with it is not a good reason to have others. And your examples are not quite as clear-cut as they seem on closer inspection. There is no exact alternative term for Geordie or Gringo, for example, so any redirect would be inaccurate. Kraut, being strongly perjorative, is not simply an alternative name for German. Yankee has at least two meanings - Americans in general, and Americans from States that supported the Republic in the US Civil War. Again, any redirect would be inaccurate. I could go on.</dd>
<dd>Nobody doubts that Britain and Ireland is commonly used - it would be hard not to use it when talking about relations between Ireland and Britain! This is not a good reason for it to have its own entry though - we already have an entry for the archipelago, and one for each of its constituent parts.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 22:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> you must be a lawyer, you <i>forgot</i> the Big Apple. Firstly, the article <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is far to long. The length of the article alone is a gross indulgence in POV. It was a political term for 2 islands period, and became legally redundant in 1922. But through custom, and the status of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and sovereign Ireland being in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">British Commonwealth</a> until 1949, the waters got muddied, and some usage carried on, particularly in Britain.

<p>Once again I apologise if this is going over old ground, but would this work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_naming_dispute_9e6a.html" title="British Isles naming dispute">British Isles naming dispute</a>, along the lines of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_naming_dispute_7a99.html" title="Sea of Japan naming dispute">Sea of Japan naming dispute</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_naming_dispute_532d.html" title="Persian Gulf naming dispute">Persian Gulf naming dispute</a>. (The latter especially is no shining example of NPOV, but at least the precedent for an article is there.) Move most of the "terminology" section of this article there, leaving a decent summary.</li>
<li>Start directing readers there in preference to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> when the issue of the name dispute comes up. The latter page is not ideal for this purpose as it tries to do too many other things, first and foremost of which is to explain to foreigners the difference between England, Scotland, Great Britain, the UK etc. The terminology section of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> in fact devotes a lot more space to the dispute than <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>.</li>
<li>Pare <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain and Ireland</a> down to something akin to a disambiguation page, with links to: a) <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>; b) <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>; c) <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> with reference to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_naming_dispute_9e6a.html" title="British Isles naming dispute">British Isles naming dispute</a>.

<p>edit conflict: On the creation of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_naming_dispute_9e6a.html" title="British Isles naming dispute">British Isles naming dispute</a>, you haven't really made your reasons for doing so clear. Is it to save article space? We have some good material going to show that usage of <i>British Isles</i> is problematic. A respected historian pointed this out in a famous essay, and others have since taken up his challenge and attempted other names and descriptions for the archipelago. That should by itself be enough for a <i>prominent</i> section in <i>this</i> article explaining the situation. If we stick to the sources and avoid the hyperbole of one side and denial of the other brought on by the edit war, and give the issue space in accordance with it's notability (a straightforward paragraph in the intro? and a section not shuttled to the bottom as it becomes overly long and off-topic?) would there be any need for a separate article? The name is variously rejected/disputed/problematic and in ceartain instances avoided or replaced. That information, and the explanation as to why should stay in this article. Doing otherwise seems more an admission of failure than what's best for the encyclopedia.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 20:17, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of the central problems with this article is a reflection of a difficulty in a lot of academic discourse: what is more important, an object or an event or its name and political and cultural context? Among other things it is a reason why scientists (who nearly all study the former) and historians of science and social scientists (many who only see the latter) barely interact. What I like about Blisco's proposal is that it separates out these two things. The archipelago really does have a shared geography, geology, and natural history which don't break at national borders, and several aspects of its history can only be understood properly at the level of the archipelago (as this discussion generally demonstrates). The most popular collective name in English is very probably <i>British Isles</i>. There is also a valid, extensive, and interesting debate on the name and the alternatives with more than enough material for a good article. The benefit of Blisco's proposal is to provide clarity for the reader by stopping the overloading of an article with several jobs, and I would hope would allow for a more constuctive atmosphere to build good articles. It would be much clearer for the reader and allow him or her to actually find what they want. It would also be a consistent approach with similar disputes in the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:37, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does the article have a banner at the top of the page pointing out the controversy? Such things are used to point the reader in the right direction when they don't get the article they expect not for pushing editors agendas on to the reader. The problem is further compounded by restating there is a controversy in the first paragraph. All this does is make it clear that the editors are more interested in airing their grievences about the term than discussing the subject itself and makes the article look amuturish.

<p>Completely agreed - I restored the old Banner which gave USEFUL navigational and disambiguation information, whilst still allowing a 2nd modified banner to redirect to discuss any uses of the terminology.

<p>Having the banner as it was makes the article look totally unprofessional, and elevates the discussion of Irish "objection" to a much greater place of importance than it deserves - hence giving the article a PoV.</p>

<dd>Jonto, you have reverted <i>five</i> times today (and Fear Eirann <i>four</i> times.) Please don't forget that the three-revert rule exists to ensure that either other editors join in, or the topic comes to the talk page, or that it is merely given 24 hours to cool down. I am not sure why you say in your edit summary that Fear Eirann is outnumbered - it is not about numbers. This article is open to anonymous editors from around the world who will accidentally disrupt the article if they do not immediately see the controversy. There are two types of reader for whom the banner prevalent earlier this month would be especially useful:
<ol>
<li>the reader who dislikes that some people infer British ownership of Ireland from the term, and wants to warn others about it</li>
<li>the general reader who is likely to misuse the words in a term paper, blog or newspaper article</li>

<dd><i>The term "British Isles" can be confusing and is objectionable to some people, particularly in Ireland. See the <a href="#Terminology" title="">Terminology</a> section below for details of the controversy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And this is the banner that Jonto puts in its place:
<dl>
<dd><i>For an explanation of often confusing terms like (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great</a>) <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> see also <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>.</i></dd>
<dd><i>For details of usage of the term "British Isles" and attitudes to its usage see the <a href="#Terminology" title="">terminology section</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I propose this, which leans heavily towards being unabashed that Wikipedia editors, and the world in general, is currently in disagreement about the name. I propose this because I my personal POV is that the dispute is just as notable encyclopedic contect as the geography and history.

<p>Actually I didn't revert 4 times today. I reverted <i>three</i> times.

<p>I actually reverted twice if you looked in detail. jtdirl reverted 3 times. The comment about "numbers" was in response to jtdirl's "unilateral" comment. The exact reason I placed the link from months ago is because the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28Terminology%29_87da.html" title="British Isles (Terminology)">British Isles (Terminology)</a> article explains quite well what the various terms mean (not only "British Isles"),especially the venn diagram. The newer banner does nothing of the sort, and implies more that the term "British Isles" is somehow not correct terminology. The fact that the word "controversy" is used in the banner seems PoV, also implying that it should not be used, just because some people (who need a good history and geography lesson) choose to interpret the term incorrectly. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonto_238a.html" title="User:Jonto">Jonto</a> 22:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People have miscounted reverts - including me. <b>Sorry</b>. Both parties have reached at least three (one has four but that is not interesting.) No-one is being chastised or wiki-prosecuted here, and both have stopped.</dd>
<dd>MelForbes has since reverted the word <i>controversy</i>. I think that is over the top - because it reinforces the word <i>objectionable</i>.</dd>
<dd>MelForbes also reverted the link to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html#Terminology" title="British Isles">British Isles#Terminology</a>. He is probably right, because, summary style or not, it makes it easier to make the version 0.5 Wikipedia CD.</dd>
<dd>The deeper issue is whether or not to draw attention to the naming issue in a banner and in the lead section. I have already explained my preference for doing so, and now it is time for others to have their say (again.) --<a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_e9d7.html" title="User:Hroðulf">Hroðulf</a> (or Hrothulf) (<a href="../../../h/r/o/User_talk%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_0e3a.html" title="User talk:Hroðulf">Talk</a>) 05:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason to have an explicit banner is simple: if it isn't there, users will start adding in stuff to the opening of the page that is already there later on. To avoid that, it was agreed to have a banner drawing attention to the terminology section on the page, so as to say — 'see it is covered. You don't have to add in more stuff.' Two banners is messy and unnecessary. There is already a link to the British Isles terminology page in the text.</p>
<p>Re the reverts: Neither of us did more than three in a twenty-four hour period. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 05:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Neither to I have the time to start lobbying campaigns, including petty attempts at character assassination like the editor in question.(Refs: <a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelForbes_ea5d.html#.27British_Isles.27.28again.29_redirect_vote" title="User talk:MelForbes">1</a> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Gringo_600f.html#Northern_Ireland" title="User talk:El Gringo">2</a> <a href="../../../d/j/e/User_talk%7EDjegan_6ccb.html#Northern_Ireland" title="User talk:Djegan">3</a> <a href="../../../p/c/o/User_talk%7EPconlon_f292.html#Aris" title="User talk:Pconlon">4</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScolaire_eafe.html#Aris" title="User talk:Scolaire">5</a>) I also see it pointless in wasting my time in trying to debate with administrators who instantly describe you as a "vandal" if you happen to disagree with their PoV.</dd>

<dd>Back to the point - Yes, I said that people need a good geography lesson. What wikipedia needs to do is to educate people as to what exactly the term means and what the other terms that may be confused with "British Isles" mean. The perfect article for doing this is <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28Terminology%29_87da.html" title="British Isles (Terminology)">British Isles (Terminology)</a> with its excellent venn diagram, map, and diagram explaining the histories of the states in the British Isles. Therefore <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28Terminology%29_87da.html" title="British Isles (Terminology)">British Isles (Terminology)</a> needs a prominent link at the top of the page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is happening on this article, however, has nothing to do with educating people in terms of geography and history. Using "British Isles" in its correct geographical sense should NOT cause any offense to any reasonably minded Irish person (and I'm Irish too). Here is a story from personal experience:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have a good Irish friend from <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Meath_b9e2.html" title="County Meath">County Meath</a> (gaelic football wacthing, quite proud to be Irish andquite nationalistic) - he and I were in France and were talking to a person from Russia - the Russian asked him if he was British. My friend replied "I am not British as from the UK, but I am from the British Isles".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is happening in this article is that there is one highly vocal and nationalistic contributor from the RoI who seems to have an agenda that he is trying to push. HE personally has a strong dislike of the term "British Isles" (dispite it widely and verifyibly being used throughout the world an as being the standard term for the archipeligo). This same editor tried to stop someone saying that "Lough Neagh is the largest lake in the British Isles" despite this also being undeniable fact. He has also stated in glee on a talk page that he sees the term "British Isles" as fading out of use in the future, with his preferred alternative being "British Isles and Ireland" (a term which I could also object to as being offensive as it could imply Northern Ireland is not British).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not Wikipedia's policy to try and change the meaning and usage of words in the English language, but merely to report the facts as they are. "British Isles" is a standard and highly verifyable geographical term. If anyone tries to interpret it in any other way then they are simply ignorant of the facts. Wikipedia should not be used to try and undermine standard English terminology by marking it as "controversial"/"objectionable", and therefore promoting the editor in question's agenda to try and discourage the use of a particular term. Yes, any Irish dislike should be contained further down within the article, but to display this objection in such prominence as at present is to promote the PoV of a vocal minority, rather than sticking to global standards and pure verifiable fact.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unfair Voting System</span></h2>
<p>It's apparent that most if not all of the editors have adhered to WP rules when it has come to casting votes on these British/Irish <i>affairs</i>. But one big problem persists, and that is the relative ratio of populations between Britain and Ireland. Britain has 60,000,000 people and sovereign Ireland has just 4,000,000. That is a 15 to 1 ratio. That means that British orientated Wikipedians will always super-outnumber their Irish Wikipedian counterparts. Really is this a fair system of voting?MelForbes 19:59, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well that depends if you believe two things:
<dl>
<dd>1. That all British and Irish editors are blind enough to vote in a certain way just because of their country of origin.</dd>
<dd>2. WP things are votes. If this refers to A-C isles, then I seriously suggest going to Deletion Review... my opinions aside (and I've never closed an AfD, nor looked that cloesly at it), I'd have been sorely tempted to close it as a non consensus - I'm not sure, though, its not my field of expertise.</dd>

<dd>I do believe that most editors believe themselves to be pov-free, but as student of human nature and all that stuff, sadly I do believe that the state of being pov-free is a trait held by a minority of people. If that view is correct, it follows that the system is unfair. That is why a degree of mutual respect is so important for these issues to be correctly resolved.

<p>If this refers to the Anglo-Celtic Isles article, then there were Irish ppl voting for delete/redirect aswell as British.

<p>Perhaps your edits tonight, and the text you installed, were a product of being pissed. If so, it might be wise not to edit while drunk (we all have done so — I once discovered that after a night out partying, and blind drunk, I wrote one of my best articles on here.

<dd>Yes, okay - sorry about the intemperate use of language. And yes, I was indeed on the sherry last night. But I <b>must</b> state my objection to being called a "racist" and "anti-Irish" - not once on these talk pages (until last night) have I descended to personal abuse, which is more than can be said for some of my opponents in this debate, who have not only criticised me personally but also said some rather unpleasant things about the British (which is okay, of course, because being anti-British is not only non-racist but apparently <i>de rigeur</i> in some quarters). It may surprise you to learn that I actually rather like the Irish, every single one of whom I've ever spoken to in real life has never been anything but friendly. Perhaps some of those who have accused me of opinions that I do not hold might wish to retract them now.</dd>

<dd>MelForbes I am Northern Irish. I am Northern Irish by virtue of the fact that I live in, grew up in, and was born in Northern Ireland. I am also Irish.

<dd>However, you <i><b>did</b></i> imply that I wasn't Irish: <i>"Mal: you are as much an Irishman as a Pied-noir was an Algerian."</i> You also went on to say that if me and people of my <i>mentality</i> <i>"ever became Irish like the rest of us your entire self-definition as part of a "superior race" would be over."</i> My people are Irish. My people are also British. Unlike you, I believe that the two are not mutually exclusive. But that is merely a difference of opinion - it doesn't make me any less Irish.</dd>

<dd>I am not Irish only in the sense that I am not a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, and "Irish" is that country's national description - its nationality. With the utmost respect, I really do think that nationalists (which I presume you are) have a considerable lack of understanding of unionists. I'm 100% sure that this goes both ways of course.

<dd>I want to add that my standpoint regarding this particular disagreement over the terminology of the British Isles has nothing whatsoever to do with my being unionist. My perspective is one from which I can see a shared heritage between all the peoples of these islands - back when the term British Isles was invented, we were all labelled as 'British' (<i>Pretani</i>), and all shared a similar way of life, or culture, which was essentially Celtic. There is an argument that the bulk of the people in the islands were pre-Celtic.. but that, if true, doesn't negate the fact that we were engulfed by that culture. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 01:00, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Glad to see that all can accept each other's self-description, and hopefully think of Mal as Irish AND British. The <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm" class="external text" title="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm" rel="nofollow">cited article</a> I referred to above makes it clear that identity in some of Ireland at least is complex and very much tied up with sectarianism. I'd cited a "nationalist" as saying he lived in the '"British Isles": this was changed to give his name and job but not allegiance. The article has him giving the nationalist perspective, but doesn't say he is that: it does say he's Catholic, and as the section already mentioned the point in the article that "Since the nation extended to the whole of the island, nearly all Catholics, including those who did not classify themselves as supporters of SF, expressed difficulty in understanding unionist descriptions of Britishness." it seemed a useful way of making it clear he wasn't a unionist. I didn't bother reinstating a point which is a bit obscure, and is less significant than other references to the article.</dd>
<dd>MelForbes, if you edited out another point you thought sectarian, I've forgotten it. And I didn't call you "racist", the term was "rascist" which seemed to be a neologism meaning "taking excessive note of perceived nationality". If it's an Irish spelling of racist, that wassn't intended. However, it brings up the point that some editors here seem to have a "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">no true Irishman</a>" perception that Irish people all detest the label "British"; if someone says they're British they can't truly be Irish; therefore the first point is true. As the cited article makes clear it's much more complex than that, and the aim of our article should be NPOV in showing the various perceptions rather than trying to change the language by propagandising the "Irish" case against the term "British Isles" and denigrating other perceptions. Anyway, must pull together some more useful work now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro para 1 "internationally"</span></h2>
<p>The introduction has been amended slightly to add "internationally": <i>The term is objected to by many, especially in Ireland, because of the common confusion internationally between the islands themselves and the British state.</i> I don't understand why the word has been added. Is the confusion international only? And is it between the islands and the UK or what? And <i>common</i> doesn't help either - are more people confused than not? Perhaps a rewording is in order: <i>The term is objected to by many, especially in Ireland, because some people assume it means all the islands are part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British state</a>.</i> <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 13:20, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at the history, it's already been that at least once ... that sentence has gone through a lot of revisions. The problem with "some people think" is that we immediately hit weasel wording and need to source the claim that some people think that or mention some people who think it. Woez. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 14:20, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Same applies to the current wording.

<p>Because then the sentence is open to two meanings, one of them implying that it is the Irish people mentioned directly before in the sentence who make the error. In fact, as Irish people find whenever they go abroad, or as a twenty second google search shows clearly, it is internationally <i>away</i> from the archipelago that that mistake is made. Americans make it. People in Africa make it. Irish people hear it all the time: "you're from the British Isles. I like your queen" or "You're from the British Isles. I didn't know Ireland was still run by Britain" etc etc etc. The word "international" is needed to add clarity to the sentence. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 16:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So presumably, if the putative international confusion (such as it is) could be cleared up, then you would have no objection to the term British Isles? That certainly seems to be what you're saying, anyway. It's a good job we've got Wikipedia then, so as to be able to educate people. It's a pity, therefore, that the article has been overburdened with objections from a vocal and politicised minority.

<p>I followed some of the links of websites that claim 'British Isles' is used synonymously with the UK. The <i>Utah British Isles Association</i>, which our articles says does this, clearly says it is for people with a heritage from 'United Kingdom and Ireland'. (Admittedly it does refer to those people as having 'British Heritage', which I guess is a simple mistake - I can see them saying 'if you come from the British Isles you must have British heritage'. I wonder if they have any Irish people in their organisation?).</p>
<p>britannia.com does seem to get it wrong, but frankly only once in their header.</p>

<p>I'm afraid you miss the point. Firstly Utah is just one example of a far wider phenomenon. Irish people who go abroad can have the mistake made <i>daily</i> to them. It is extraodinarily common. Secondly while they <i>mention</i> Ireland, they then culturally define the British Isles is a way in which Ireland doesn't exist and in which they equate British Isles = Britain. (Queen, crown, etc etc.) That equation is worldwide. Even TIME magazine has done it. There are numerous examples. The Utah one was used simply because it is so clearcut in terms of the list of things it thinks symbolise the British Isles. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 05:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

If it is then Irish people have it. But it is not a heritage worth having, and one Britain should be ashamed of. Not every aspect of British involvement in Ireland is negative.

The term "British" is as ambiguous as "Irish" and can mean "of the British Isles" as well as "of the United Kingdom" and "of Great Britain", and therefore "British Heritage" certainly is correct in the first context. Believe it or not, there IS today (you hear that jtdirl - TODAY - I could go on and list many of the past atrocities carried out in name of the "Irish", but will not go there) a common shared heritage covering the entire British Isles. There are also may differences within the BIs, but that does not deny the fact that there are definite commonalities. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonto_238a.html" title="User:Jonto">Jonto</a> 17:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The argument that "PDS" documents should be excluded as sources is patently absurd: it would mean that we can't use a <i>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, SEANAD E´IREANN, TUAIRISC OIFIGIU´ IL—Neamhcheartaithe (OFFICIAL REPORT—Unrevised)</i> because the Irish government chooses to distribute them in the open document pdf format. As a courtesy I always put (pdf) after such links to warn it's a download, but if someone finds it causes a crash, they need their computer sorted. That said, the sources should be properly examined and presented for what they are: they appear to be evidence that <i>British Isles</i> can be used in Irish government debates without the sky falling in, and as such are just as valid as a Utah website being cited to show international usage: both tend towards original research in showing "evidence" for the editor's opinion rather than showing a source of the opinion.. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 18:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apologies for trying to break up the edit war fun, but I have tried to include these references properly. The truth about them, as far as I can see is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the references are the official parliamentary record i.e. verifiable and reliable;</li>
<li>"British Isles" has been used several times, all by different people, so it is not just usage solely by an odd bod;</li>
<li>from the debate records the use of the term does not appear to have been commented on, so at most its use is seen as a solecism, not offensive;</li>
<li>none of the people who have used it are a government minister, so it is not governmental usage (which seems to favour <i>Britain and Ireland</i>);</li>
<li>the debates are a few years old.</li>

</dl>
<p>In Ireland the use of the name "British Isles" is highly controversial, because of the perception that its use implies a continued constitutional relationship between the sovereign states of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which is not the case.[27][28]</p>
<p>As a result the term "British Isles" is not generally used by either the Irish government or the Irish media; both normally use alternative terms. [29]</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland nationalists reject the term British Isles and use the awkward and ambiguous description these islands as an alternative, whereas unionists, keen to stress the Britishness of the whole archipelago, do call it the British Isles.[30]</p>

<dd>Sorry, I really can't just sit back and let a comment like that given above pass uncorrected. It is well documented that the Irish government avoids use of the term 'British Isles' - this is well verified. We can't say none, not ever, but usages of the term officially by the Irish government are extremely rare. Ulster unionists, as Stonemad GB rightly says, use the term for exactly the same reason as the Irish government avoids it!! TharkunColl, please recognise and accept this. Stonemad GB, I agree in principle about the 'Perspectives in Ireland Section' being over-long. I object to 'use the awkward and ambiguous description' bit though - those who avoid use of the 'British Isles' term usually do not refer collectively to the island grouping at all, or use terms like 'Britain &amp; Ireland' or 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' instead. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 17:18, 25 August 2006 (PT)</dd>

<dd>Whilst <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Nationalists</a> and their sympathisers might avoid this term, the government has to be seen to be anti-UK to a point, and so certain politicians will avoid using it at times. However, a good percentage of Irish politicians, and <b>all the rest of the world</b>, consider Ireland to be part of the British Archipilaego. I'm not British - I'm English, a citizen of the UK, and although the term does deserve a paragraph or so to explain that in Ireland it can be misunderstood, we can't assume that too many people avoid the term at all. I don't know where I'm going with this, or what I'm arguing for, but yes.

The para I wrote is not unevidenced: it includes 4 references, as you will see if you look at the version of the page with it on, and more references could be added without adding a word to the text. Any discussion of Irish perspectives to the term is bound to be a summary, unless you include the views of every single Irish person in the para (which is the way it was evolving). The question is: what is the appropriate level of detail? I would submit that the para above gives all the main perspectives in Ireland, with references. The para on the page at the moment is hopelessly confusing, duplicated, badly written, and prolix, and is pretty useless to the ordinary reader. For example, why is a long (paraphrased) quote from a Scottish MP included in the prespectives in Ireland section? Jtdirl's comment "This is not an option" is both untrue (it obviously is an option, depending on consensus) and offensive: it implies a sense of proprietorship over the page.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 09:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>British Isles is rarely used in Ireland. That does not mean it is never ever used. When one does hear the term being used, it's usually a moment of <i>"did I hear that term being spoken in Ireland episodes"</i>. People in Ireland associate it with pre 1922 politics, age of empire etc, a time when Britain ruled Ireland with a merciless marshal law against the old Gaelic and their language and culture. I am referring to a time when bagpipers and harpers were hung <i>in situ</i> and without any question of trial, just for being bagpipers and harpers. A time when Gaels were hunted and killed by British colonists on horseback (see Carty's history 1946), for weekend recreational sport. The term is generally avoided.

Only the most dishonest could deny that British rule in 2006 is based on mass murder of the Irish and threatening terror and violence on them for many centuries should they not accept British occupation. Your state breathes through the lungs of Bingham, Spenser, Gilbert, Devereaux, Cromwell and all the rest. Without this mass violence, there would be no British rule here today in 2006. Were the British state truly ashamed, it would complete the contraction of its state from Ireland. Its actions speak. The current situation is akin to your rapist living in one of your four bedrooms. The past is not forgotten in such a circumstance.</dd>

<dd>Thar, the B state committed those crimes, for it was B law and policy that perpetrated the events, and it's still alive and well. So the B state must, like other regimes take their responsibility. Although, admit, it's different lately. Try as an RC living in NI in 1960's. That period is in many a Wikipedians lifetime.

<dd>So the general population of the modern UK must take responsibility for crimes committed by a tiny minority hundreds of years ago? I don't think so. As for NI in the 60s, at that time NI had its own devolved government which the UK government did not interfere with. When it was finally forced to so at the end of that decade it was as much to protect the Catholics as anything else. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:24, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah no! it's passé now. Merely I was stressing a point why the term <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is not adoringly and passionately loved and embraced by Irish people in general. It wasn't a tiny minority, it was British government policy of the time. Get it, it was British, it wasn't a bunch of renegades. BTW, some of the perpetrators of <i>the system</i> were also of Ireland, in the pay of the British machine. So my point is not to say Ireland is good, Britain is bad. Ireland turned it's back on this imperialism in 1922, and likes to keep it there. That's why they don't like association with BI. MelForbes 16:41, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another reason why Ireland would generally not like to be associated with the term British, is <i>British foreign policy</i> and all of it's ramifications. British involvement in the <i>illegal</i> invasion of Iraq (120,000 dead), and their support of the pulverization of Lebanon are only 2 examples. Ireland would distance itself from these sorts of conflicts, and usually end up as peace-keepers after the big-boy war-games have ceased. MelForbes 16:56, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well 2 weeks ago a protester was facing a court in Ireland with causing $5,000,000 worth of damage to an American military jet at Shannon, with a hatchet. He probably would have got 5 years in the slammer if found guilty. Yes, he admitted causing the damage to the military airplane. He pleaded innocence on the grounds that he was trying to save lives. What did the Irish jury do, they found the accused unanimously <b>not-guilty</b>. The American embassy went ballistic! MelForbes 23:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's an example of the cowardice of Irish juries. If the guy's guilty, then declare him so - there's everything right with making people take the consequences of their protests: it lets us know where we stand, and if the verdict is unpopular then the politicians will feel the heat. Letting this guy off was just feeble. How many true criminals in Ireland walk free from court because the jury thought, <i>Ah, sure, he's some mother's son ..</i>?

Or, actually, no, I happen to be Irish and Dublin born-and-bred, who no longer has a chip on his shoulder about 800 years of history and has both eyes open. Please the <i>ad hominem</i> attacks just because someone has the temerity to challenge you. Re-read your paragraph again. "American military jet at Shannon." Do you know just how much the use of Shannon has contributed to "the <i>illegal</i> invasion of Iraq (120,000 dead)"? Ireland is fully complicit, like it or not, even though a hugely significant number of people are opposed to its use by the U.S. military (myself included). But despite that hugely significant number in the rest of the country, many of the locals are well aware of the benefit to the local economy in terms of jobs, etc. (as <i>vox pops</i> on RTÉ Radio 1 demonstrated), and the Government seem quite happy with the income, too. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 10:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I see you still call sovereign Ireland by the term <i>Irish Republic</i>, a term that ceased to exist some 80 odd years ago. Ireland has agreements with the USA going back to the 1950's, per the use of Shannon airport, nobody at that time imagined that people like Bush could occupy the White House. These agreements carry strict rules about arms and the carrying of prisoners of war etc, which you conveniently choose to ignore. I note you abject and total lack of sympathy for the victims of war. I didn't say it was right for the Irish govt to allow Shannon's use, but the Irish govt didn't decide to kill so many people. That was a British and American decision.

<dd>Stone is correct. However as the issue of English usage on the archipelago was raised, it needs correction. "Virtually everyone in the archipelago speakings <i>British English</i> " is wrong. English people, particularly in the south of the country, speak what is known as <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_English_545c.html" title="English English">English English</a> which is different in idiomatic structure to British English. Irish people use <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-English_4eb6.html" title="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a>. Welsh people speak a version of Welsh English that is closer to Hiberno-English than British English. In the north-east of England people speak another variant on English that is also closer to Hiberno-English than classic British English. (HE uses some of the linguistic structure inherited from Old English and Elizabethan English. The same is also true of Yorkshire English.) Scottish English (sometimes called Scots English) is also different to what is known as British English. And English speakers internationally do not use British English they use International English. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/75/Ireland-up.png/15px-Ireland-up.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-up.png_0c5b.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 01:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
