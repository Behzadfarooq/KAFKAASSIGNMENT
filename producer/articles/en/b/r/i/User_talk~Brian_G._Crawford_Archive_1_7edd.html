<p>It would be a kindness to discuss major changes, even to a minor article, before you carry them out. The question of what Chimeras to include has been discussed at some length, and, for the moment, we are including references to chimaeras which are notable enough to be mentioned elsewhere in WP, with a link; especially (as some of these are) uses of <i>Chimera/Chimaera</i> in a unique sense, or as a proper name - some readers will be looking for them.</p>
<p>All editors are of course free to reopen that discussion; but experience has shown that cruft shows up less rapidly, and is removed more smoothly, if we have explicit sections, and standards (as comments) stated on the page.

<p>Dude what do you have against Gundam? It's been around for thirty years, and there is a much larger population of fans then a small population, we are talking about thousands if not more Gundam fans, and you know, if you're gonna delete all fictional worlds, delete Star wars, Star trek, I'd really like to see you get THAT done, who are YOU to delete this stuff, many people come online to learn about Gundam on wikipedia, and you act as if your opinions are God. Get a job. Volnixshin</p>
<p><br />
"huge anthropomorphic robots resembling samurai wearing different colors of car fenders" made me actually laugh. However, something of this size probably should be discussed somewhere. I don't know of a specific Gundamn wikiproject, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_Manga_7d56.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and Manga">Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and Manga</a> maybe? I don't think the main contributors to any of the articles are active in WP: space though =/ Kotepho 01:02, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it is <i>really'</i> crufty, at least the articles on all of the mass produced suits. It would be a shame to see their hard work deleted improperly though, and I am a bit of a stickler for copyright issues. Kotepho 01:20, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it really necessary to be so insulting when nominating the articles for deletion? "huge anthropomorphic robots resembling samurai wearing different colors of car fenders" is obviously intended to provoke people and makes it seem like this is done more out of personal bias than feeling it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. But hey, if that's how you roll, that's how you roll. Calaschysm 03:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be a whatever, but you've admitted you consider the articles you nominate to be <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html#Marduk_incident" title="User talk:Crzrussian">garbage</a>. Isn't that a rather bad way to put things? It doesn't show you in a positive light, no personal offense intended. Calaschysm 20:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By using the term "Cruft", you admit you dislike the series. That is alright. But by no means does that give you the right to delete it! Others do use the Wiki for data on the series and machines. A lot of people put in the effort to put these up here for the masses to view. By what right do you have to delete a lot of hard work? If you don't like the series fine, but don't try to push your personal opinions on other people. Revan Vrake</p>
<p>Judging by your statement, it's obvious that you have never even seen the series. Please, know what you're talking about before you randomly start deleting things. Mobile Suit Gundam is one of, if not the, best shows that I have ever seen, and I've seen alot of good shows. So, for all of our sake, keep your childish ideas of deleting everything to yourself.</p>
<p>Wow. First of all thank you all my fellow fans. And second of all YOU. Yes you Mr. Brian G. Crawford. Who put a beam saber up your rear? If you dont like a series fine but dont bash it and say that the show just boils down to samurai robots with swords. I mean seriously a) know what your talking about when you start to bash things (cause its obvious you have never watched a single gundam series and actually thought about it) and b)personally lets hear what things you like on Wikipedia, then all of us fans <b>will</b> get those topics off Wiki. Oh and by the way if you don't believe what i'm saying, and what others are, Mr. Crawford then just follow the link <a href="http://www.mahq.net/rants/editorials/crusader.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mahq.net/rants/editorials/crusader.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahq.net/rants/editorials/crusader.htm</a></p>
<p>I think that just trying to delete something that isn't something you like is plain dumb. I'm also wondering why the "cruft" is only from the SEED universe not any of the others. The wikicity's not that great and isn't going anywhere soon because the articles are already here. This series is a part of popular fiction that has been around since 1979. Your reasoning is that it goes into detail about things and if it's too detailed it's cruft? That's a load of bull! If you wanna do something good that wouln't make anyone angry, how about asking that someone who knows something about the said show and asking them to see what should be combined and what should stay by itself. And, don't turn your beautiful "Cruft" excuse for AfD into flame bait. I'm also wondering why do you care that any of this stuff is on here when you don't like it? I'll make sure that if you delete anything, I'll help make it again.</p>

<p>Once again with the insults! If you want to be respected, respect others yourself! See here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks</a> And this is the business of the fans of the series. And your targeting on Earth Alliance "colored fenders" that have been on the EA's side or were made by the EA. CONSPIRACY. Rappapa</p>
<p>Brian G. Crawford your blatant disregard for Popular Culture discusts me. You are a small minded bigot who should be banned from wikipedia. If you have a problem then go cry to YOUR mom about it and leave us to our own devices. no one forces you to read Gundam related articles so if you want to delete something, go delete the contents of your own hard drive. Gundam his huge and deserves it's place on wikipedia. It's a hell of a lot less childish than you are. - Wookieman (Fight the power!)</p>
<p>Brian G. Crawford, it seems your little crusade has failed. Pity, for you that is. This is <i>Wikipedia</i>! This is a free dictionary open to all topics! I mean, did the government try to remove the Taliban from it since they disagree with it and consider it evil? Or in the actual dictionary, did Atheists try to remove religious topics since it disagreed with them? The answer, my friend is no, so is the same with your little quest to remove Gundam from this Encyclopedia Wikipedia. Fortunatly, it isn't gonna happen. Nice Try. - Taan Ey-</p>

<p>Myself, I have a particular dislike for vanity, promotional, and fancruft articles, but it's a bit self-defeating <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Special_School_%28comic%29_731a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Special School (comic)">to make absolute claims like "delete all webcomics"</a>, when there exist webcomics that most reasonable people would take to be clearly notable. An example of a notable webcomic is <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29_7eef.html" title="Penny Arcade (comic)">Penny Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, since the AFD thing is not actually a vote, citing an absolute position like "delete all webcomics" which is against the wider consensus is only going to make the person closing the deletion request ignore your input. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 04:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey -- I voted on two of your Gundam cruft AfDs, but I'm concerned about this idea of nominating them for deletion in groups. If you nominate a group of articles, it encourages people to not care much about individual articles, but look at the big picture. This is just as true when you nominate 10 at a time as when you nominate 100; in fact, doing it in small groups is worse, because the articles don't get the individual attention they should probably get, and yet essentially the same debate on groups of articles is occurring on a wide variety of pages. I'd say, you should either combine them all into one, or nominate the articles individually. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:03, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see you ignored me and continued to nominate in small groups. Is it too much work to nominate articles individually? Well, most of these articles have been edited by lots of editors, and it took them a lot of work to make these articles; if it were me, I think the least the community can do is to consider them individually. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 05:42, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it's not too much to ask (indeed, I should have formaly asked here earlier.) What exactly is the criteria by which you are dividing these articles into such small groups? While I admit that the articles in question require some work (for example, organizing the entries based on the develeopment projects underwhich they were designed.) In my ignorance, I'm unable to determine just how nessesarily different the Duel and Strike articles are that they require separate nominations.--KefkaTheClown 18:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have looked through the AfD votes and the talk page of the relevant article and have not been able to find the particular points on which you dispute its factual accuracy or sourcing. I do not doubt that they exist, but it would be helpful if you were to list them clearly on the talk page under "factual disputes" so we could get on our way to sorting them out and stop fighting over this stupid little article.

<p>Brian, of the last 50 edits you have made, at least 49 have been either nominations for AfD, or in some way connected to deleting articles. Of course, it's up to you how you spend your time and energy, but can you explain why you feel it appropriate to spend so much of your time attempting to delete stuff? Do you not like actually editing articles? I have to say, some (although not all) of your nominations seem to be simply because certain articles do not meet your own ideas of what is suitable for retention in the encyclopaedia. You might have more success if you can find specific passages from policy that back up your assertions as to notability etc., or otherwise, try and get the policy changed. If you can't, shrug it off and just get on with improving what we have. Wouldn't that be better than constantly nominating to AfD? The fact is, whether they are to your taste or not, the majority are happy to see these kinds of articles in Wikipedia. The important point is not to argue over whether or not they should exist, but rather to work together to try and improve them. Please don't take this as any kind of attack on you or your opinions, it is not meant to be. I just dont quite understand your position.

<li>Wholeheartedly agree. I just skip the cruftycruft, unless superbalatant, and concentrate on <i>my</i> areas - geography, judaism, russia, stubsorting. Wanna join me on a stubsorting mission?

<li>I think these comments are unfair. Someone has to try and keep irrelevancies out of Wikipedia. The Encyclepaedia Brittanica doesn't have a seperate entry for each individual Smurf, and Wikipedia shouldn't either. It would be one thing if he was a delet-tator, and no one else got to have any input. But that's the nice thing about Wiki. He can delete, you can re-add, until we find a happy balance and move on to another article to fight about. &#160;:-) Thank you for your efforts, Brian. -<a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 18:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>It's usually considered very impolite (not to mention very unproductive to producing an encyclopedia) to remove whole sections from established articles without discussing the removal first on the talk page.

<dd>I refer you to guidelines such as <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. The fact that there are no definitive statements about the relative worth of cultural references (and we're not just talking about pop culture, but also references such as significant cultural issues around animals - the bear in religious contexts being a prime example) implies that there is no consensus on whether they should be included or not. Rather than making such a decision yourself, surely it would be more productive to propose a change to policy and see what other people think? Wikipedia does urge ruthless editing, but it also urges dialogue in making such major changes, and the fact that so many of these references already exist indicates that there's a fairly strong amount of <i>de facto</i> consensus against such a unilateral activity. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 23:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd prefer it if you didn't insult me, as you know very little about me and my activities. Thanks. I understand your position, and I disagree, and for both of the edits I changed I offered my opinion on the relevant talk page, which is more than you did in either circumstance. Nor is it "my way" to include all such trivia (I personally find a lot of it irrelevant), I just believe that significant changes demand significant justification as per <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, and I attempted to engage in such a consensus. I'm not talking about trivia specifically, I'm talking about how to go about editing any article. A good way of dealing with trivia would be to propose a policy such as "remove all trivia", or "reduce trivia to most significant examples", and seeing what other people think. A bad way is to start removing it all yourself, and then insulting people when they suggest an alternative method of achieving your aims. I'm trying to suggest better ways to edit, and you're assuming I'm trying to stop you from doing any editing. I don't know anything about any supposed persecution that you may have received in the past, but please don't assume that I'm part of it simply because I disagree with you. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:10, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm making a suggestion on how best to put forth "your way". I'm trying to explain to you about how to edit harmoniously rather than confrontationally, and I don't believe it's only a matter of personal preference ("my way") - the guidelines above demonstrate that it is more than that. If you wish to ascribe me other motives then go ahead, but I believe that you would be misguided to do so. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:27, 26 April 2006 (UTC) (Incidentally, I was not on RC Patrol when I noticed your edits.

<p>Brian, would you consider not prodding anything that is notable, but may have original research, and instead tagging them as needing sources? Too often, it seems that you're prodding/AfDing based on issues that could be dealt with by dealing with sources FIRST before going the deletion route. Please consider it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 23:27, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I note you placed a speedy tag on the above article.

<p>Hi. I've been asked by <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinnwood_736d.html" title="User:Linnwood">User:Linnwood</a> to try to mediate some disputes about articles, including <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">Donkey punch</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a>. I know that things have gotten somewhat heated. I've asked him to stop referring to your edits as "vandalism"; I've explained to him that you're trying to improve Wikipedia by removing unverifiable material. Personally, I don't like the articles in question very much either.</p>
<p>But there are people who care a lot about the material they've written in these articles, and want to try to improve them. Without knowing a lot about the subject, it can be very difficult to tell the difference between "material that can never be sourced adequately" and "material that doesn't have an adequate source in the article". Removing material from the article completely can lose otherwise-salvagable material in the depths of the edit history.</p>
<p>That's why I'd like to ask that when you remove substantive material from an article, you move it to the talk page, so that a discussion can start about it. That way, the people who care about the article have a chance to find sources, to show that they're not performing Original Research. It would also help a lot if you tried to avoid words like "fancruft" and other loaded words; people who aren't experienced in AFD can see those as a lot more serious.</p>
<p>I hope that I can help you with any disagreements you have about this. Please leave messages on <a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECreidieki_ab28.html" title="User talk:Creidieki">User talk:Creidieki</a> if there's anything I can do to try and mediate this, and thank you. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 20:28, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
