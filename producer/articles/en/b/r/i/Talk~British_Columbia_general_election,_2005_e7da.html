<p>MEDIA ADVISORY FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Vancouver, BC, January 17, 2005</p>
<p>BC HAS A NEW POLITICAL PARTY</p>
<p>Tom Morino, Leader Democratic Reform BC; and Simon Moses, Leader All Nations Party of BC yesterday announced at a founding convention in White Rock that they have reached an agreement to unite the two parties under the name Democratic Reform British Columbia.</p>
<p>Shirley Abraham, President Reform BC; stepped down as party president, along with other board members, to join Democratic Reform British Columbia and Ron Gamble was elected president to replace her. Gerry Rehwald and Walter Hayden will remain on the Reform BC board. Gamble stated that Reform BC remains as a registered political party.</p>

<p>For further information please call: Reform BC President: Ron Gamble (604) 980-7779</p>

<dd>I e-mailed Mr. Gamble as I was unclear as to what was going on exactly... here is the email back and forth:</dd>

<p>Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2005 11:48:28 -0800 From: Ron Gamble &lt;rongamble@shaw.ca&gt; To: Jordan O Brien &lt;jord@jord.ca&gt; Subject: RE: From www.reformbc.net All headers</p>
<p>Mr. O Brian,</p>
<p>Four members of our board who were working to have the Democratic Party and All Nations Party come over to Reform BC did not materialize. Instead the Democratic Party, through Elections BC changed their name to Democratic Reform BC. The result of that had a profound effect in that Reform BC would not have been able to change its name to Democratic Reform BC as there was one already registered.</p>
<p>Although section 5.1 and 5.2, Article 2 and 3 are unalterable, the party name was not and could have been changed but no resolution was brought forward to our Annual General Meeting to do so.</p>
<p>Our bylaws do not permit membership in two provincial parties. As a result the four board members, who supported and joined the new party, could no longer belong to Reform BC. As to the rest of the Members of Reform BC it will be up to them to decide what party they want to join or support.</p>
<p>Reform BC at this moment is not ready, nor may be ready, to run candidates in this coming provincial election.</p>

<p>Mr. Gamble:</p>
<p>I have a question about the current status of Reform BC.</p>
<p>&gt;From what I have pieced together of have assumed the following:</p>
<p>At Reform's Jan. 15, 2005 AGM a vote was held to disband the party and join the new DRBC but this vote did not pass. As a result most of the executive left the party to join DRBC. Please let me know if that is correct.</p>
<p>What is very unclear, though, is do you and the new leadership of Reform BC intend to run candidates in the 2005 election? I am assuming by the positive news release re: DRBC on the Reform website that though a majority of Reform BC members support the DRBC - including yourself and the executive they elected Jan. 15 - there was not the 75% support required to amend the constitution?</p>
<p>Alternatively, I wonder if, perhaps, someone ruled that due to section 5.1 and 5.2 of your constitution stating that Sections 2 and 3 are unalterable it was ruled that, legally, Reform BC could not disband?</p>
<p>Could you please help me to shed some light on the above? Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks, Jordan O'Brien</p>

<dd>Just FYI, I think that clarifies at least what happened w.r.t. Reform BC, they thought they were going to be taking the lead on it and when they didn't they took their toys and went home. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 21:10, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why has the BC Conservative Party been moved to minor parties from the "also rans" area? There are other parties still in existence that ran more candidates in 2001 and the Conservatives are not registering in any polls. Please advise. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 19:07, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I'd picked a 3% cutoff between minor parties and also-rans, which demarcates a pretty substantial gap between Marijuana and, uh, the People's Front, I think, which was sub-0.5%. I'll move them back for the time being. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Tom_5b57.html" title="User:The Tom">The Tom</a> 20:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nettleton is listed as running in a different riding that the one he currently represents. Was this an error?

<dd>Hmm, good eye. I managed to confirm with a better source, I got the following off of the CP wire.</dd>

<p>The Canadian Press Western News, Friday, January 21, 2005 Former Liberal Nettleton switches ridings to take on deputy premier</p>
<p>The Canadian Press</p>
<p>PRINCE GEORGE, B.C. (CP) - Former B.C. Liberal MLA Paul Nettleton says he's switching to a neighbouring riding so he can take on the deputy premier.</p>
<p>Nettleton, who was thrown out of the Liberal caucus after he accused his government of attempting to privatize B.C. Hydro, told the Prince George Citizen on Thursday he will run in Prince George-Mount Robson in the May 17 provincial election because he believes Deputy Premier Shirley Bond and the Liberals are ripe for the picking.</p>
<p>"I do think she is vulnerable," Nettleton said. "There will certainly be some high-profile losses for the Liberals in May, and one of them is Shirley Bond, I believe."</p>
<p>Nettleton said he decided to make the switch partially because he was told an internal B.C. Liberal Party poll placed him ahead of incumbents Bond and Prince George North MLA Pat Bell in overall local popularity.</p>
<p>He did not have a copy of the poll.</p>
<p>He said he is also running in Prince George-Mount Robson because his family moved to a home in the riding this past summer, so that is where he will be on the ballot.</p>
<p>Bond was recently named health minister.</p>
<p>Nettleton said he bears no ill will with Bond and his relationship with her remains "cordial."</p>
<p>Nettleton's decision leaves his current riding, Prince George-Omineca, wide open for a right-left battle between the Liberals and the NDP.</p>

<p>While helping over at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_general_election%2C_2004.html" title="Alberta general election, 2004">Alberta general election, 2004</a>, we seemed to have an unwritten policy of not including external links to candidates within the candidates' table. I never removed them myself but I noticed them all vanishing shortly after they appeared and I could sympathize with both sides of the argument. No one ever complained so I assumed an unwritten consensus had developed&#160;;) I am wondering what our stand should be on this as a link has appeared. -- <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 15:27, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was simply following the Alberta precedent myself of non-wikilinking anyone who wasn't an incumbent, although a few "star candidates" were arbitarily redlinked in the hope that there may be an article on them someday. I can't recall external links ever appearing on the federal list at all. Like you say, there are two sides to the issue—personally, I'm not one of those people who compulsively wishes all biographical substubs to be deleted, so the abstract hope that every candidate might one day have an article make me lean towards wikilinking everyone. If there's a link to be shared, the candidate can get a quick and dirty substub with the link on that page. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Tom_5b57.html" title="User:The Tom">The Tom</a> 17:14, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you follow what I was getting at. I am not talking about the candidate names being wikilinked (I think they should be because I feel that wikipedia should aim to contain limitless knowledge, not just standard encyclopedic knowledge) I've conceeded with the consensus in Alberta that only incumbents and notables ought to be linked. I was referring to whether or not external links to campaign websites should be included ... see Robert Broughton in the eastern suburbs. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 18:29, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think external candidate sites should be linked at all on this page. If the candidate has a wikipage, then a link in the External Links section on that page would be alright.

<p>I am hesitant to move DRBC to the third column instead of the Green Party. Though DRBC now has one member in the legislature to Green's zero, this would not be the first time a party has been formed (in part) by a disgruntled independent and gone on to fair poorly at the polls and win no seats. The Greens consistantly lead DRBC in the polls and are beating DRBC in nominations.

<dd>The em-dash federally has to do with the different use of the hyphen in French grammar (hyphens connect compound nouns there, so in order to keep something like <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Hyacinthe%E2%80%94Bagot_372a.html" title="Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</a> straight the em-dash has to be brought into play).

<dd>Indeed, the em dashes are a federal thing not a Canadian-wide thing. Even New Brunswick, which is bilingual, uses regular dashes creating rather confusing ridings such as <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalhousie-Restigouche_East_ecbf.html" title="Dalhousie-Restigouche East">Dalhousie-Resitigouche-est</a> - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 20:03, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It can indeed make riding names confusing. IMO, hyphens should be used as part of a name not in connecting names but if this is the consensus and Elections BC uses them, I'll go along too.

<p>In the last parliamentary elections in BC the result was 77-2, an absurdly lopsided result.</p>
<p>The 2005 elections are described as "Early election results show the current government to retain power, with a smaller <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majority</a>."</p>
<p>Could this be rephrased to something like "Early election results show the current government to retain power, with a lopsided 77-2 majority reduced to a comfortable 50-37 (or whatever) <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majority</a>"?</p>

<p>I agree that 77-2 isn't something that's going to come again, but words like 'lopsided' and 'comfortable' seem to violate NPOV (indeed, I don't find 46-33 to be 'comfortable'). The current wording is perfectly fine and accurate.</p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe there needs to be an article on the Descriptions for Size of Majority to thrash this one out. To fail to mention 77-2 is understatement, not NPOV, while 46-33 is less than an overwhealming victory, closer to a comfortable majority but more than a close result. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabletop_b4b4.html" title="User:Tabletop">Tabletop</a></p>
