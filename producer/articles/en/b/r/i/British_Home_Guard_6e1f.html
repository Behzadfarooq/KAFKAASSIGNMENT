<p>The <b>British Home Guard</b> started off as the brain child of the Commander-in-Chief <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mervyn_St_George_Kirke_ddeb.html" title="Walter Mervyn St George Kirke">Walter Kirke</a>. Witness to the destruction of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> in September <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, Kirke knew that it was but a matter of time before the tanks and warplanes of the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> came to England's doorstep. Kirke also knew that, in such an event, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> would be woefully underprepared.</p>
<p>As early as <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, following the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedoing</a> of <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Royal_Oak_%281914%29_757b.html" title="HMS Royal Oak (1914)">HMS <i>Royal Oak</i></a> at anchor in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, Scotland, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> wrote a letter to his Chiefs of Staff asking, "What would happen if 20,000 enemy troops were to land on the east coast of England?"</p>
<p>General Kirke founded the Local Defence Volunteers in February <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. Initially devised as a means to defend the critical port of <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover.html" title="Dover">Dover</a>, the ranks swelled quickly with local volunteers, too old to enlist but eager to fight. Though not yet acknowledged by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_government.html" title="British government">British government</a>, they began training to operate the batteries of four-, six-, and nine-inch artillery pieces which defended the port. Trained seaward to repel naval bombardment, these gun emplacements doubled in number with emergency positions which were being assembled even as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> left for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. While the coastal guns and the LDV stayed behind, the BEF marched to the borders of France and into battle.</p>

<dd><i>We want large numbers of such men in Great Britain who are British subjects, between the ages of seventeen and sixty-five, to come forward now and offer their services in order to make assurance [that any invasion would fail] doubly sure. The name of the new force which is now to be raised will be the Local Defence Volunteers. This name describes its duties in three words. You will not be paid, but you will receive uniforms and will be armed. In order to volunteer, what you have to do is give your name at your local police station, and then, when we want you, we will let you know...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The announcement met with near-universal enthusiasm and over a quarter of a million men tried to sign up within the next 24 hours. The government had expected 150,000 men to volunteer in total, but by the end of the first month 750,000 men had volunteered. By the end of June 1940, there were nearly 1.5 million volunteers and the number never fell below a million for the rest of the organisation's existence although the peak was 1.8 million in March <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">17 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, the <i>Defence (Local Defence Volunteers) Regulations 1940</i> was passed, which officially brought the LDV into existence. Within ten days, the BEF had been pushed back and surrounded at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk%2C_France_b430.html" title="Dunkirk, France">Dunkirk</a>.</p>
<p>The Home Guard also served as a cover for the <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_Units_6c14.html" title="Auxiliary Units">Auxiliary Units</a>, a force of more highly trained volunteer troops that would function as guerilla units if the UK was invaded.</p>
<p>The Home Guard did not, initially, admit women to its ranks. Some women formed their own Amazon Defence Corps.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the rushed evacuation from Europe, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> left much of its heavy equipment behind on or around the beaches of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk.html" title="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>. Included among this were 40,000 assorted vehicles (including tanks), 400 anti-tank guns and most of its artillery pieces. Lighter equipment was also lost and many troops returned even without their <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a>. One soldier wrote in his diary, "we arrived armed only with shoulders, we didn't even have cigarettes."</p>
<p>Thirty days after the surrender of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, Hitler issued <i>Fuhrer directive no. 16</i>. This order laid out the plans and preparations for the invasion of Britain, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Sealion_782a.html" title="Operation Sealion">Operation Sealion (Unternehmen Seelöwe)</a>. Although the details were not known to the British, it proposed that the invasion would proceed not as a concentrated thrust, but as a 40 mile wide landing, starting at <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsgate.html" title="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> and extending to the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_ca39.html" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Moreover, in order to mount such an operation, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> would have to be destroyed, which in turn required that the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> obliterate the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coastal_artillery.html" title="Coastal artillery">Coastal artillery</a> from <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cap_Gris_Nez_77cc.html" title="Cap Gris Nez">Cap Gris Nez</a> would punch a hole through anticipated coastal defences to ensure a safe landing zone for 160,000 German troops. Finally, it must all be done by August to avoid winter storms.</p>
<p>The British were on the defensive, and for this they were largely unprepared. The Belgian front, an English network of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenches.html" title="Trenches">trenches</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillboxes.html" title="Pillboxes">pillboxes</a>, had quickly collapsed in the face of enemy tanks and artillery. In fact, the only defences capable of stopping the German advance were, ironically, French. The <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_line.html" title="Maginot line">Maginot line</a> alone remained defiant, lasting a full month after the rest of the nation capitulated, largely due to the fact that they had been almost completely bypassed by the German armies. However, at one hundred and sixty miles long, the Line had taken five years to build and consisted of over one hundred forts connected by a massive tunnel network and manned by over eighty divisions of French troops. Britain had fifteen <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">divisions</a> of unequipped infantry to defend four hundred miles of beach, and at most, six months do it.</p>
<p>The British had been able to observe the invasions of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and later <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and experience fighting in France had provided advanced warning of their own inadequacy in battle. Finally, and most important of all, they had witnessed the full range of German tactics. In Poland, the Axis had shown themselves capable of mounting a swift and effective surprise attack. In <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Germans revealed their methods for urban combat. In <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paratroopers.html" title="Paratroopers">paratroopers</a> landed ahead of the invasion to cause chaos well beyond what became the front lines. In France, the German <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzer.html" title="Panzer">Panzer</a> divisions simply went around the Maginot line and operated a sickle shaped charge towards Paris. The lessons of Europe would prove critical in the summer of 1940.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Guard_6e1f.html" title="Edit section: Weapons and training">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons and training</span></h2>
<p>Initially the LDV were very poorly armed, since the regular forces had priority for the weapons and equipment available. Their original role had largely been to observe and report enemy movements but it swiftly changed to a more aggressive role. Nevertheless they would have been expected to fight well-trained and equipped troops with negligible training and weapons such as <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitchfork.html" title="Pitchfork">pitchforks</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun.html" title="Shotgun">shotguns</a> or firearms that belonged in a museum. Patrols were carried out <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">on foot</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_infantry.html" title="Bicycle infantry">by bicycle</a>, even <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_in_warfare.html" title="Horses in warfare">on horseback</a>, and often without uniforms - although all volunteers wore an armband that said "LDV". Many officers from the First World War used their <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webley.html" title="Webley">Webley</a> Mk VI .455 revolvers.</p>
<p>Ex-Communist and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> veteran <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Wintringham_4153.html" title="Tom Wintringham">Tom Wintringham</a>, a journalist and key advocate of the LDV and later Home Guard, opened a private training camp for the LDV at <a href="../../../o/s/t/Osterley_Park_31fc.html" title="Osterley Park">Osterley Park</a>, outside London, in early July 1940. Wintringham's training methods were mainly based on his experience in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Brigades_5c52.html" title="International Brigades">International Brigades</a> in Spain. Those who had fought alongside him in Spain trained volunteers in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-tank.html" title="Anti-tank">anti-tank</a> warfare and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demolitions.html" title="Demolitions">demolitions</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> 1940, the LDV was renamed the "Home Guard", a name suggested by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Within a few months they started to be issued with proper uniforms and equipment as the immediate needs of the regular forces were satisfied. After September 1940 the army began to take charge of the Home Guard training in Osterley, and Wintringham and his associates were gradually sidelined. Wintringham resigned in April 1941. Ironically, despite his activities in support of the Home Guard, Wintringham was never allowed to join the organisation himself because of a policy barring membership to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communists.html" title="Communists">communists</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascists.html" title="Fascists">fascists</a>.</p>
<p>It was not until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> that they were a properly trained and equipped force. They were frequently equipped with improvised weapons, or non-standard ones purchased by the government from abroad. As an example large numbers of <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1917_Enfield_rifle_3ca3.html" title="M1917 Enfield rifle">P17 rifles</a> were purchased for the use of the Home Guard. These used the (<a href="../../../3/0/-/30-06.html" title="30-06">30-06</a>) cartridge - an American 0.30 inch round which was a totally different <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> from the <a href="../../../2E/3/0/.303_British_dd08.html" title=".303 British">0.303 round</a> used by the British <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Enfield_503f.html" title="Lee Enfield">Lee Enfield</a> rifle. A 2-inch wide red band was painted around the fore end of the stock as a warning since a 0.303 round would load but jam the rifle. That the similar in appearance <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pattern_14_rifle.html" title="Pattern 14 rifle">P14 rifle</a> was supplied to the Home Guard in 0.303 calibre that took the British round only added to the confusion.</p>
<p>The Home Guard inherited weapons that the regular Army no longer required - such as the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacker_Bombard_3020.html" title="Blacker Bombard">Blacker Bombard</a> anti-tank weapon - or desired - such as the <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sticky_bomb.html" title="Sticky bomb">Sticky bomb</a>. Their arsenal also included weapons that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units - such as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northover_Projector_2f38.html" title="Northover Projector">Northover Projector</a> - a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpowder.html" title="Blackpowder">blackpowder</a> powered mortar, the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_76_Special_Incendiary_Grenade_972c.html" title="No 76 Special Incendiary Grenade">No 76 Special Incendiary Grenade</a> - a glass bottle filled with highly inflammable material, and the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_Gun_f188.html" title="Smith Gun">Smith Gun</a> - a small artillery gun that could be towed by a private motorcar.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Guard_6e1f.html" title="Edit section: Paratrooper defence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Paratrooper defence</span></h3>
<p>The use of German Paratroopers in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, where <i>Fallschirmjäger</i> landed in a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium.html" title="Stadium">stadium</a> and then hijacked private transport to make their way to the city center, demonstrated that nowhere was safe. Worse still, the airborne abduction attempt of the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_monarchy.html" title="Dutch monarchy">Dutch Royal family</a> had failed only because the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> had possessed detailed plans of the operation well in advance. To counter the threat of an airborne assault, the Home Guard manned observation posts where soldiers spent every night until almost the end of the war continuously watching the skies, and initially armed with a shotgun.</p>
<p>To spread word in the event of an invasion, the Home Guard set up a relatively simple code to warn their compatriots. For instance, the word '<a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell</a>' indicated that a paratrooper invasion was imminent, and 'Oliver' meant that said invasion had commenced. Additionally, the Home Guard arranged to use <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> bells as a call-to-arms for the rest of the LDV. This inevitably led to a series of complex rules governing who had keys to belltowers, also the ringing of church bells was forbidden at all other times. The British defence relied heavily on improvisation and ingenuity.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Guard_6e1f.html" title="Edit section: Anti-aircraft defences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-aircraft defences</span></h3>
<p>The first line of defence against the Luftwaffe was detecting incoming raids. Even before the war, Britain had invested much time and resources into the construction of the CH, or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_Home_3058.html" title="Chain Home">Chain Home</a> radar line. The CH system which dotted the English coastline operated on a twenty four hour schedule, and could detect incoming aircraft from well over seventy miles away. Moreover, to find low-flying planes, which could avoid detection at less than five hundred feet, the British also operated the narrow wavelength Chain-Home: Low system, which detected planes traveling low yet still over five hundred feet. These gave the British sufficient warning to allow their fighters to reach the necessary altitude before the arrival of the bombers.</p>
<p>Once inland, the movements of German aircraft were visually tracked and reported by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Observer_Corps_8082.html" title="Royal Observer Corps">Royal Observer Corps</a>, a unit formed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> and not strictly speaking part of the Home Guard although also manned by volunteers. It eventually grew to over 40,000 men and women and 1,500 observation posts nationwide, their work allowing the RAF to know the strength as well as location and direction of their enemy, and therefore permitted them to predict the target and defend it with the minimum fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Aircraft proved to be a menace throughout the war. Operating in both day and night raids, the defence against the Luftwaffe required huge amounts of anti-aircraft construction. For the British, heavy anti-aircraft weaponry was in no short supply. With over a thousand HAA guns divided across seven divisions, the British troops had guns in a quantity rivalled only by variety. In the early months of the war Great Britain still used Great War surplus armaments in the form of a truck-mounted 3 inch gun which provided more enthusiasm than firepower. The next largest was the <a href="../../../q/f/_/QF_3.75_inch_AA_e294.html" title="QF 3.75 inch AA">QF 3.7 inch</a> gun, which shared some of the anti-armour capabilities of the legendary German <a href="../../../8/8/_/88_mm_gun.html" title="88 mm gun">88 mm gun</a>. The largest guns were the 4.5-inch and the enormous 5.25 inch similar to guns used aboard some Royal Navy Warships which were mounted in two different types of turret, one identical to the naval mount. Though the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> handled most of the shells physically, the men of the Home Guard often filled in as adequate replacements. From April 1942, Home Guard Anti-Aircraft units were formed and by 1944 these units had taken over many anti-aircraft batteries, operating artillery from the light to heavy guns and also the semi-secret rocket batteries (also known as "Z-batteries").</p>
<p>The aiming and management of communication, however, was the sole domain of women of the <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service_e266.html" title="Auxiliary Territorial Service">Auxiliary Territorial Service</a> (ATS). Indeed on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wirral_Peninsula_9430.html" title="The Wirral Peninsula">Wirral</a>, Cheshire, the physical shortage of men, who were guarding the beaches, required women to operate the town's single AA battery alone.</p>
<p>The HAA stations could stop a high flying bomber but not the fast moving escort fighters and the dreaded <a href="../../../j/u/_/Ju_87.html" title="Ju 87">Ju 87</a> Stuka dive bombers which came with them. The Light Anti Aircraft was in dire shortage thanks to a lack of direction and planning. In the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, the British had expected to use their own <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers.html" title="Vickers">Vickers</a> <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pom-Pom_%28gun%29_94ba.html" title="Pom-Pom (gun)">2 pounder "pom-pom"</a>, but with complex multiple gun mounts weighing 800 lb it was limited to <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> use. Therefore they turned to foreign sources.</p>
<p>In 1937, the British Army had ordered one hundred of the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors_40_mm_gun.html" title="Bofors 40 mm gun">Bofors 40 mm gun</a>. The Bofors had attracted immediate international attention as a weapon of quality. Britain had evaluated the gun and arranged licensed UK production. With engineering revision and reduction, the British produced it twice as fast at half the cost. Yet even so, in March 1940, even the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Saratoga_99b9.html" title="USS Saratoga">USS <i>Saratoga</i></a> had more of these guns than the United Kingdom. Production steadily increased at 200 or more per month by mid 1940 but production was not expected to match requirements until 1942.</p>
<p>In 1939, the only other supply of LAA was a hastily conceived plan to purchase <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breda_Meccanica_Bresciana_009d.html" title="Breda Meccanica Bresciana">Breda</a> 20 mm guns from <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. However, the Tripartite Pact ended that possibility.</p>
<p>Yet even with the impressive series of anti-aircraft defences which spread across the island over the next four years, emergency precautions were taken to reduce the danger to civilians. The ARP (Air Raid Precautions) <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Defence_Service_9f20.html" title="Civil Defence Service">Civil Defence Service</a> was independent of the Home Guard and was controlled by the Home Office. Men and women alike offered their services as fire fighters in the Auxiliary Fire Service, but 'fire watching' (reporting of fires in commercial buildings and dealing with individual incendiary bombs) was compulsory for all civilians in towns. Early warning observers were used during the V-1 campaign. All of these jobs served to relieve the local population.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Guard_6e1f.html" title="Edit section: Coastal defence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coastal defence</span></h3>
<p>Despite a history of coastal defences stretching back to the days of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, the British had not extensively fortified their coast, but had concentrated on what were considered 'vulnerable points'. The result was a series of ports guarded by 6 inch and 9 inch guns; a number of 9.2, 13.5 and 18 inch railway guns and howitzers (the 18 inch howitzer being nicknamed "Bosch Buster") were deployed to various parts of the coast immediately after Dunkirk; surrounded by open undefended beach with nothing but the sand to block a landing army.</p>
<p>To remedy this, the Home Guard was charged with guarding the beaches as well. The Home Guard produced a coastline peppered with unarmoured gun emplacements, armed with old <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> naval guns. Worse still, some of the LDV manning these positions were untrained and armed with little more than shotguns. Others, such as Robert Neal, had rifles dating from the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>, and wrote in his diary, "I don't know what they expect me to do, I can't even use my own gun, much less this enormous contraption next to me." In the event of an invasion at that time, the beaches would almost certainly have fallen to German forces.</p>
<p>It was, however, never the intention for coastal defences to halt an invasion such as the planned <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Sealion_782a.html" title="Operation Sealion">Operation Sealion</a>. The coastal defences were only intended to delay an invasion of this type, and combined with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_Lines_93cd.html" title="Stop Lines">Stop Lines</a>, slow down an attack in order that <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy.html" title="Navy">Naval Forces</a> could be deployed to cut off supply lines, and troops moved into appropriate locations. This strategy was borne out in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wargames.html" title="Wargames">wargames</a> conducted at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst_dc3d.html" title="Royal Military Academy Sandhurst">Royal Military Academy Sandhurst</a>, in which a combination of the Coastal Defences, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_anti-invasion_preparations_of_World_War_II_1bb2.html" title="British anti-invasion preparations of World War II">Stop lines</a> and a naval deployment to halt Axis naval forces from <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a> effected a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrender_%28military%29.html" title="Surrender (military)">surrender</a> of the Invading Forces. The Home Guard would most likely have taken heavy casualties, but their role in such a conflict was a brave and significant one, and should not be underrated.</p>

<p>Even once the threat of invasion had passed, the Home Guard remained in existence manning guard posts and performing other duties to free up regular troops for duties overseas. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> the National Service Act allowed for compulsory enrollment where units were below strength. At this time, the lowest rank within the Home Guard, 'volunteer', was renamed to 'private' to match the regular army usage.</p>
<p>However following the successful invasion of France and the drive towards Germany by allied armies, the Home Guard were formally stood down on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">3 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> and finally disbanded on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.</p>
<p>A modernised version of the Home Guard was briefly re-established in December 1951. Although units in coastal areas were authorised to recruit to full strength, it fell foul of a complete reassessment of Britain's defence posture following the advent of the H-bomb and was disbanded in July 1957. In the 1980s, the Home Service Force was established, consisting of older ex-servicemen who could not meet TA training requirements; it was envisaged that this force, a company in every Territorial battalion, would be used to guard strategic points in the event of an emergency so as to free up the better-trained Territorial forces for more important roles. The Force was disbanded in 1993.</p>

<p>The Home Guard was immortalised in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> comedy, <i><a href="../../../d/a/d/Dad%27s_Army_b681.html" title="Dad's Army">Dad's Army</a></i> (1968-1977), which followed the formation and running of a platoon in the fictional south coast town of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walmington-on-Sea_b208.html" title="Walmington-on-Sea">Walmington-on-Sea</a>, and is widely regarded to have kept the efforts of the Home Guard in the public consciousness. The Home Guard also played a significant part in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Powell_%28director%29_bfcd.html" title="Michael Powell (director)">Michael Powell</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emeric_Pressburger_f701.html" title="Emeric Pressburger">Emeric Pressburger's</a> 1943 film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Life_and_Death_of_Colonel_Blimp_4dc2.html" title="The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</a></i>. In it, the lead character, a career soldier who's been retired from the active list, joins the Home Guard and rises to a leadership position in it.</p>
<p>The Home Guard also featured in the 1971 <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_Pictures_4561.html" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Disney</a> film <i><a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedknobs_and_Broomsticks_1a6e.html" title="Bedknobs and Broomsticks">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a></i>, and in the 2003 "War Games" episode of the British detective series <i><a href="../../../f/o/y/Foyle%27s_War_47b8.html" title="Foyle's War">Foyle's War</a></i>, which is set in <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings.html" title="Hastings">Hastings</a> in World War II.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Coward_4bd9.html" title="Noel Coward">Noel Coward</a> wrote a song in 1943, "<a href="../../../w/o/n/Won%27t_you_please_oblige_us_with_a_Bren_Gun__af2e.html" title="Won't you please oblige us with a Bren Gun?">Won't you please oblige us with a Bren Gun?</a>" that pokes fun at the disorder and shortage of supplies and equipment that were common in the Home Guard, and indeed all of Britain, during the war.</p>
