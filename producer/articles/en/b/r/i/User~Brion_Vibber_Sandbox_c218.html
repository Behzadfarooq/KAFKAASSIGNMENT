<p>This may be stop-words stopping 'took', but I would <i>expect</i> the search routine to at least check, for a search of the form 'x y z', whether there was an article with the <b>exact title</b> 'x y z' (<a href="../../../u/p/_/Up_to.html" title="Up to">up to</a> case, and possibly accents) in the Wikipedia, regardless of any stop words. Otherwise naive users will miss articles that actually exist. I think I've seen more examples of this, but this is one I can demonstrate. This needs to be fixed, not documented.</p>
<p>A search for 'FORTH' or 'forth' returns nothing, though there is a article named 'FORTH'. Rather weird.</p>

I obviously have cookies set and working, since it does notice. I use Mozilla 0.9.9 and Galeon 1.2 on Linux.

<p>I created a new user with username novalis. I can log in, but whenever I follow any link from the login page, I am not logged in. I get the following cookies when I log on:</p>
<p>WikiUserID=939</p>
<p>WikiLoggedIn=yes</p>
<p>Neither seem to have domain or path information (So, I'm using konqeror to test this, and I don't trust its reporting). They appear to expire in about ten minutes, but that's not what's causing the bug. I get the same bug in Galeon and Konqueror and Lynx and Links, so it's probably not client-side.</p>

<p><b>Log in doesn't set cookie path</b></p>
<p>(2002/1/25) The Set-Cookie header returned from the log in page doesn't include a path= variable.

<p>(2002/02/20) Actually, it looks like Mozilla defaults to the path <i>to</i> the page. When I wrote the report above, this was "" (for /wiki.phtml); now it's "/wiki". This means that <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserLogout_9afc.html" title="Special:UserLogout">special:userLogout</a> doesn't work for anyone who logged in before the path was changed, because it doesn't touch the cookie with path "". --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarey_Evans_25de.html" title="User:Carey Evans">Carey Evans</a></p>

<p><b>"Go back to edit some more" doesn't work</b></p>
<ul>
<li>9 Nov - I cannot simply hit the back button in my browser, after I have saved a page, and make another change to the page. I do that all the time in UseModWiki, but I can't do it on PediaWiki because I get into an edit conflict with myself.
<ul>
<li>Now you can, but after "back", you'll have to hit "reload" to correct the timestamp embedded in the HTML of the editing page. --<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnus_Manske_14b5.html" title="User:Magnus Manske">Magnus Manske</a></li>
<li>This is still a problem. I still get into edit conflicts w/myself. And the timestamp should come from the serverside (e.g. the script), not the browserside (i.e. the HTML).</li>

<p>Similarly, if an otherwise emply line contains some white space, the previous parser took that as a paragraph break, while the new parser treats it as a block of indented nothing, resulting in too much space between the paragraphs.</p>

<p><b>Character entities in links</b></p>
<p>Sat Feb 2 00:23:40 UTC 2002: On <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_food_additives.html" title="List of food additives">list of food additives</a>, I have additives like &amp;amp;amp;beta;-cyclodextrine. When I click on the question mark to create an article about it, I get the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> displayed for edit instead. Note that since &amp;amp;amp; is a safe character in URI path segments, escaping it as %26 has no effect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is due to a bug in the code putting too many HTML escapes into the title; if it were working correctly, the %26 escape would indeed have an effect. My recommendation until this is resolved: use &amp;amp;amp;beta;-cyclodextrine ([[beta-cyclodextrine|&amp;amp;amp;beta;-cyclodextrine]]). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion Vibber</a></dd>

<dd>There's probably good arguments for actually writing "beta-cyclodextrine" in the article. However, my point about the % escape is that according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396">RFC 2396</a>, there is <i>no difference</i> between %26 and just &amp;amp;amp; in the path of the URL. --Carey</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there's the RFC and then there's the actual behavior of the software... PHP does not seem to consider %26 to be an ampersand for the purposes of extracting variables from the URL's *query* bit. At least my reading of the RFC agrees with it: <i>?3.4 Query Component ... Within a query component, the characters ..."@", "&amp;amp;amp;", "="... are reserved.?</i> It's not a problem in the path, only in the query when you're e.g. editing the page. --BV</dd>

There's no question mark in the URL for this edit page, so Apache is probably justified in converting %26 to &amp;amp;amp; internally, before processing the Alias or RewriteRule directive, or <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/%77%69%6B%69/" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/%77%69%6B%69/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com/%77%69%6B%69/</a> wouldn't work. --Carey</dd>

<dd>I thought of that, but I doubt it. First, I'd expect the problem to happen with *all* pages, since the broken HTML is on *all* edit pages. Second, any problem caused thereby would be likely to be with rendering, not with submitting the form. Unfortunately I can't reproduce the problem on my test server, with or without fixing the HTML.

<p>This is more a semantic bug than software bug. The software renders every page with the the title "[page name]: encyclopedia article from Wikipedia". The problem is not every page is actually an encyclopedia article. I recommend that the title remain for pages in the article space (except for the front page), and change it for all other namespaces. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>

<dd>How about saying 'X: from Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia' for the other pages?</dd>

<p><b>Diff colors</b></p>
<p>Diff pages speak of green and yellow being the colors of respectively the changed text and the old text. This is useless to those who set their own text colours and not very nice to visually impaired people working on wikipedia. It would be handier if the main way to recognize which is which would be a text (such as: "The new text:" and "The old text:"). Of course, colours could still be used complementary, but they should not be the primary way of distinguishing the two atoms of a diff.--branko</p>

<p><b>Need more whitespace</b></p>
<p>(2002/1/25) The general layout of Wikipedia looks cluttered. It needs more whitespace to be remotely readable. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamian_Yerrick_2a18.html" title="User:Damian Yerrick">Damian Yerrick</a></p>

<dd>I agree, especially at the top it's <i>very</i> busy.

<p><b>Link underlining</b></p>
<p>(2002/1/25) External links and different namespaces should still be underlined, or there's nothing to indicate to new users that they are actually clickable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarey_Evans_25de.html" title="User:Carey Evans">Carey Evans</a></p>
<p>(2002-02-09) Now all 'normal' links are forced to be underlined (with the following):</p>
<pre>
 a { text-decoration: underline; }
</pre>
<p>This is overriding my browser's configured default, which is to display links without underlines. Can't this line just be omitted? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Woodcraft_0030.html" title="User:Matthew Woodcraft">Matthew Woodcraft</a></p>

<p><b>"Stub articles"</b></p>
<p>I've run into a couple of odd problems while browsing through the stub articles pages. Firstly, there's an article with bold tags in its title that is messing up the table on</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=241&amp;showLinksThere=0" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=241&amp;showLinksThere=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=241&amp;showLinksThere=0</a></p>
<p>The article in question is displayed as 241(16 chars) [[<b>devotchka</b>|Bdevotchka/b]], if people have been cleaning up stub articles since I posted this it may be earlier in the listing. Its row in the table appears to be mixed in with the subsequent row in the table, and afterward the columns of the table are misaligned. It also destroys the link at the bottom of the table leading to the next larger set of short articles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Found another example: 385(27 chars) [[Upload/loa1[1].jpg|Upload/loa11.jpg]] also screws up the table, and doesn't appear to exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have deleted the articles in question (relics of long-fixed search page and title bugs), so it should be gone from the list now. The table screwup problem is due to a more recent bug (see top of this page) with links with bad titles, which has been fixed in the code but not yet installed. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, there are a whole bunch of articles listed as having a length of 27 characters which don't appear to exist at all. For some examples, see here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=321&amp;showLinksThere=0" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=321&amp;showLinksThere=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3AShortPages&amp;startat=321&amp;showLinksThere=0</a></p>
<p>When I click on these links, I go straight into edit mode as if they were new. I believe that the 27 characters the stub finder claims these articles to have are "Describe the new page here." <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That seems to be a feature: a page that somebody saved without actually editing anything (and thus containing only the new-page message) comes up in edit mode. On the other hand, we probably shouldn't actually save a page that contains only the new-page message. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, Saturday, April 6, 2002</dd>

<p><b>"Upload files"</b></p>
<p>The upload files page doesn't have a image uploading policy or something like that: We should not use formats like <a href="../../../g/i/f/GIF_95a6.html" title="GIF">GIF</a>, with can cause patent problems, or like <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_bitmap.html" title="Windows bitmap">BMP</a>. with are not optimal.

<p>Also, we probably have no need for .exe or .mp3 files--do we?</p>

<p><b>"Orphans" page isn't completely correct</b></p>
<p>For instance, Godfrey_Reggio is not and never has been an orphan page; it was created long after the article for his documentary <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>. Similar issue with other articles listed.</p>
<p>I've noticed that "Orphans" gets confused by whether a title contains spaces or underscores between its words.</p>
<p>If an article is created with underscores, but all the links to it have spaces, then it is listed as an orphan. I've noticed that in the URLs, the strings "%20", "_", and "+" can be used interchangably. "Orphans" should be updated to treat all three the same.</p>
<p>Also, pages that could be usefully listed as Orphans are not, e.g., "Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication" is not listed, presumably becaused "SWIFT" redirects to it. However nothing links to SWIFT and it looks like redirections are not counted as Orphans.</p>
<p><b>"Most wanted" articles with trailing spaces</b> (2002/02/04)</p>
<p>A link of the form <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">Israel</a> (note the spaces in the link source) causes the Most Wanted page to think that an article called Kingdom_of_Israel_ (note the trainling underscore) is required. I have created a redirect to Kingdom_of_Israel to fix this particular case.</p>

<p>The Recent Change page has many design flaws.</p>
<p>When I want to list all the new changes since my last visit to the site, I can only see the most recent 100 changes. Given all the minor changes are always included, one exceeds the 100 entries limit in a few hours, if you are away for more than a day, you have serious trouble seeing the complete list. It may not be problem for the wikipediaholics who check the Recent Change page every 30 seconds, but it simply does not work for the regular users.</p>
<p>I tried using the max count and the age link, they also have design flaws and do not work intuitively. When I click last seven days, it shows only 100 entries that cover only half a day, (same problem as above). When I click last 2500 entries, it either fails to return anything or it covers only the last 3 days. i.e. There is no way to ask for last seven day without count limit, or a count limit but no age limit.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>workaround</b>: Since the 100 count limit can be easily reached, it becomes the limiting factor. In effect, all the links, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 14 days all give the same 100 result. To workaround this problem, you can right click on these links and copy its URL iinto the address field of the browser, change the count limit and hit ENTER.</dd>

<dd>Yes, there's a bug in the time zone handling code.

<p><b>minor edits showing up even if turned off</b> (2002/03/05)</p>
<p>And with bad links and dates?</p>
<p><b>minor edits hide the major edits</b> (2002/04/12)</p>
<p>When I turn off the minor edits in the preference, I would expect the most recent major edit would take its place.</p>
<p>For example, the history shows that an article was edited (major) at 1pm, and the same article was edited again (minor) at 1:02pm. In the Recent Change page, both the 1pm and 1:02pm edits become invisible if the preference is set to hide minor edits.</p>

<p><b>Table based layout</b></p>
<p>More generally, though, the new layout leaves me nonplussed (sorry guys - I know it was probably a lot of work), and worse, putting it into tables creates several varieties of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It renders *much* slower, esp. on big pages. (This with an Athlon 900!)</li>
<li>In my experience, tables won't render in Netscape 4 unless the whole page loads - so no cancelling partway through a long page.</li>
<li>Tables make it harder to do things like select text and parse page structure with a script.</li>
</ul>
<p>-J</p>
<p>It should be relatively easy to change the thing to use CSS instead of tables. For an example of CSS and markup that produces a layout similar to this (content area + right side navbar) and works on IE 4-6 and Mozilla, look at <a href="http://pineight.com/" class="external free" title="http://pineight.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pineight.com/</a> --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamian_Yerrick_2a18.html" title="User:Damian Yerrick">DY</a></p>
<p>Each page should have a separator between the article and the bottom navbar. Currently, the article is flowing right into the navbar, which is very difficult to read.</p>
<p>There appears to be neat separation with bars all over the place when I view things with IE. But at home, with Mozilla, everything flows together, and is very difficult to get a grip on. <a href="../../../g/a/y/User%7EGayCommunist_2877.html" title="User:GayCommunist">GayCommunist</a> P.S.

<dl>
<dd>You can't use colons (:) in regular page titles; if you try to create that page, it will not be allowed. Colons are reserved for separating a namespace (talk:, wikipedia:, log:, user: etc) from a page name. It is a little odd that the link is being shown in the article with changed capitalisation, however. But really, the link should not even be recognised as a link if it's an invalid page (as "e. coli 157" is not a valid namespace), this should be fixed. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a> 2002/03/14</dd>

<p>2002/04/12 - while editing <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-order_desire.html" title="Second-order desire">second-order desire</a>, I normally started form the recent changes page that linked a version of 03:43, but when I had the page edited, I casually went to that page's history and I realised that there was another version (03:51), later than the one I had modified, that was not the one linked in recent changes and which text was not in the editbox. Probably, the database had a delay (half an hour?) in recording the latest version (03:51), even if my version was immediately recorded at 04:20. --<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGianfranco_7271.html" title="User:Gianfranco">Gianfranco</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Most likely, the 3:51 change occurred after you loaded RecentChanges and before you loaded the edit page -- your 4:20 change includes everything from the 3:51 change, so it was definitely the 3:51 version that you modified, not the 3:43 version. When exactly did you load the RecentChanges page? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, Friday, April 12, 2002
<dl>
<dd>The main fact is that I certainly opened the RecentChanges page and the edit page after 03:51, because I modified the article in no more than 10 minutes, let's say a quarter of an hour for all the process - certainly it wasn't half an hour. Ordinarily, the 03:51 edit should have already been recorded when I opened (really, refreshed) the RecentChanges page.</dd>
<dd>In the 03:51 version, you can see a link to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a> (first paragraph after the numbered list) that I had never seen until I realised of this version and opened it: for sure it wasn't in the editbox' text, I would have edited that text too. So, actually, I edited the 03:43 version at least a quarter of an hour after the other user had edited the 03:51 version.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, if you look at the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Second-order_desire&amp;diff=yes" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Second-order_desire&amp;diff=yes" rel="nofollow">diff for last version</a> (mine), there is no evidence of that link, that disappears after the previous diff page (03:51 from 03:43).</dd>
<dd>I can only add that that both 03:43 and 03:51 versions are from the same author; could this fact having interfered? --<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGianfranco_7271.html" title="User:Gianfranco">Gianfranco</a></dd>
