Hi, I'm Gunnar Eberlein from German Wikipedia. I've just read your articles on Country History and I'm am impressed. That's really a lot of valuable information (I even started to import them into the German Country-Musik pages). I think I found a minor problem in the Grammy Awards paragraphs. It must be distinguished between the year of the Grammy nomination and the year of the presentation. The presentation takes place in February the following year, but the years normally refer to the nomination. That means your Grammy Awards texts are always one year shifted (You can verify this by comparing the information from various awards. They should be similar).</p>
<p>By the way, I have complete lists of all Grammy Awards (Country Music) and all Academy of Country Music in Wikipedia format. You can find these lists in the German Wikipedia under "Country-Musik" or I can mail them to you (send a mail to gunnar5499@hotmail.com) Regards, Gunnar 213.70.140.10 21:12, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where in the world does a cleveland steamer refer to a school dinner? I ask only because there is no mention of a cleveland steamer in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_dinner.html" title="School dinner">school dinner</a> article. Then again, it was just today that I learned there is an actual company (Cleveland Range) that manufacturers a wide variety of steaming products known generically as "cleveland steamers". <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 21:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I have NO FRIGGIN' IDEA (sorry for the caps, but ...), except that "hot lunch" is a synonym for school dinner and apparently also – to my horrifed surprise – synonymous for the sexual slang term. Honestly, you may want to contact the author of the "Cleveland steamer" article for a further explanation. All I know is when I typed "hot lunch" (a synonym for school dinner) in the search box, I get directed to this article on the sex act, not an article about school lunches. It sounds like an expert on the steaming product colloqually known as a "Cleveland steamer" may want to create an article on said product.

<dl>
<dd>Following the original reply, I have placed a comment on the Cleveland steamer talk page explaining the change. And not to worry; there is definitely no link to the "Cleveland steamer" article on the "school dinner" page.

<dl>
<dd>Update No. 2 — I have also placed a comment at the top of the page stating how "hot lunch" is used on this page, and that people wanting to go to the page about the school meal need to click on school dinner.

<p>Hi buddy. You mentioned me on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome</a> . Gee I never thought we had had any disputes? Maybe on <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">jumping the shark</a> where we discussed a few things, but I thought we were agreeing on stuff? I comented on something you added, questioning it, but I didn't delete or edit any of it. Anyway sorry if you thought I had any problems with your edits because I didn't; on that page at least I saw some of your comments and edits and agreed with many of them straight away. The one I had a query with I brought up on the talk page. Anyway no hassles. The Chuck Cunningham article got protected because a few days after the AfD, someone started a new article in its place. I initially liked that article and edited it a few times, but it quickly got out of hand, and with little in the way of reliable sources, ultimately I had to stand up and say it should be deleted if refs couldn't be provided. I don't think I actually voted <i>delete</i> on the AfD though, just stuck in a comment. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 23:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize if there was any confusion with the CCS debate article, and that's my fault. Just thought it was a little odd. You make a valid point about verifying items by external sources; perhaps we ALL - editors old and new - could use a little refresher on how to verify facts through external sources.&#160;:-) [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 00:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)]] (BTW - I also apologize if I thought you disagreed with my edits; I see now that you don't, so no problems).</dd>

<dd>Actually, I just noticed them and have added them to the "<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle_While_Your_Wife_Works_ac33.html" title="Whistle While Your Wife Works">Whistle While Your Wife Works</a>" pages. I just thought that the situation involving reverts was growing into an edit war (not a participant in, although I had done some cleanup and added several references before the edit war began) and thought temporary protection might be the appropriate solution (it's already been done to "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell_Comes_to_Quahog_8029.html" title="Hell Comes to Quahog">Hell Comes to Quahog</a>").

<dd>Hopefully they can remain in some form, because that is basically what makes up the whole page and the only reason I visit this guide. Its one of the best around to find obscure references that are used, and you can easily click links to understand the true joke behind the idea <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrande13_3d48.html" title="User:Grande13">Grande13</a> 23:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Things seems to be fine now, as its acceptable now to put cultural references as long as its not just a retelling of the joke, so we probably should just let things be and see how they play out now, as there seems to be at least a temporary agreement to allow edits <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrande13_3d48.html" title="User:Grande13">Grande13</a> 00:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your wonderful edit on Jamie Hunter Cartwright. May I just ask one question about the <i>Matter of Faith</i> episode? Had Jamie's father come before hand to help the people and failed? Then, Jamie tries later and fails. Ben then offers a helping hand and it works. The people are then happy with him? Am I getting this right? Just checking before I edit the article. Keep up your edits. If you are seriously enjoying creating pages about the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonanza.html" title="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>, you might want to consider creating a page for Sheriff Coffee; Virginia City, Nevada (a page where you might describe what the set looked like during the show); a page for the Ponderosa Ranch (Bonanza set) (there is one about the theme park...) and my list goes on. Again, thanks for the edits. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabygator23_4c15.html" title="User:Babygator23"><font color="#00FF00">~Babygator23~</font></a></p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../c/o/l/Image%7EColumbiaCtryClassics5.jpg_c48a.html" title="Image:ColumbiaCtryClassics5.jpg">Image:ColumbiaCtryClassics5.jpg</a></b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
