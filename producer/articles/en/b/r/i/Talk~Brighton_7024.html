<dd>More to the point, that insures that no one will see them. I&#160;just tried to do my occasional bit for Wickedpedia and add a link to this (excellent) page on Brighton that I&#160;bumbled across while doing something else â€” and got some kind of automated message saying that the entire server was "spam". Thinking to point out that there must be some kind of error, maybe somebody had temporarily hijacked the domain or something but now clearly there's no problem, I&#160;come here and find that (a)&#160;I'm told to bury any discussion of the site where it wont be seen; (b)&#160;apparently some loon out there has decided that it's the actual Brighton page! that is "spam". Since the page doesn't advertise for anything, doesn't try to rent me apartments, isn't concealing a porn site, etc.; but, instead, is a very informative and balanced page on the city of Brighton, I&#160;gotta conclude that the first guy to come up with the idea of labelling it as spam has either got a screw loose or some kind of personal vendetta for reasons unrelated to the webpage. Considering all the junk on Wikipedia (long articles on porn operators and Pokemon cards), and the frequent solicitations for money on Wikipedia, it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black. No wonder Wikipedia has such a bad reputation, as a place not to be taken seriously.... <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 21:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Poppycock. That's not the page being marked as "spam". The page on Brighton (regardless of anything else the author may have done (and other people's opinion of him), is a good solid page with a lot of information. Tossing out a link to a page useful to the readers of Wikipedia because some other page related to it is irrelevant or contentious is much like saying Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_physics.html" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a> is bad because Wikipedia frequently prefaces it with an appeal for funds, and because Wikipedia also has bad or stupid articles on many other unrelated subjects. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 21:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

It is clear these pages are not objective and to block stuff like that you block the whole domain. The block would not have been necessary except this author insists on replcing these web pages back into wikipedia against consensus. Clearly he is using wikipedia to promote his web site. Worse, he is trying to edit his POV on to the wikipedia pages too. Long ago he lost the trust and goodwill of editors here, hence the spam block. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bill - the right thing to do is integrate any missing information into the Brighton article on Wikipedia. There is absolutely no reason to link to this guy's home page on Brighton or any other town. For starters, who has validated the content of his site? Other Wikipedia editors have no control over it. And, in what capacity is he being linked to? Not because he's an official body or anything like that. He's just some geezer who's written a webpage, and a geezer bent on self-promotion at that. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 23:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no European Parliamentary Seat corresponding to Brighton &amp; Hove. It is part of the multiple-member South East England seat. One of the ten MEPs for the seat, elected by PR, is a green. The phrase&#160;: "<i>They</i> (The Green Party) <i>also hold the European Parliament seat</i>." is completely without basis. If were arguing that most of the Green Party's votes in that election came from Brighton, well that might be true, but the sentance will need to be completely re-phrased and backed up with a citation of some kind. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndisciplined_4971.html" title="User:Indisciplined">Indisciplined</a> 22:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Pleased to see the glaring error on Green seat for Brighton has been corrected. The Green MEP is Caroline Lucas, and maybe that she be added. She is a very hard working MEP.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any good sources to provide some evidence of the number of English language schools and their students?

<p>If People want to look up a referance to Brighton, they would want to see pictures. I do. Not a load of boring old drivel, which is what it is now. Brighton was and IS a sea side resort, born about by holiday makers. Lets see some examples of it. Also while I'm at it, lets see and read some more info on the pier, the marina, the queer pride (or whatever it is), info on the many car/bike rallies to Brighton - Links with Hove, references to the filming of 'Carry on' films, sea life centre, the famous chip shop, the arches, the going rate for deck chairs, the brilliant state of the art nightclubs and all the other stuff that SHOULD be there. Not just the boring 'factualk' text.</p>

<dd>Hi, and thanks for joining the effort to improve the article. In fact there are quite a lot of pictures available; look at the external links section to see some sources, and also the link to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Wikimedia commons</a> which has a lot of pictures which have been uploaded with a usable license.</dd>
<dd>As for the items you mention like the pier â€“ many of them actually have their own articles because the Brighton one became too long. That's not just a "style" decision â€“ there are technical problems with Wikipedia articles over a certain length which can cause data to be lost (when the article is edited by certain browsers.)</dd>

<p>I agree with KT, there are good pictures on all external links, this would appear to be suitable grounds for retaining link to</p>
<p>"www.heureka.clara.net/sussex/brighton.htm"</p>
<p>whatever name KT decides the page should be eventually called.</p>
<p>There used to be a good picture of the beach scene on the Wikipedia Brighton page, but one of the the two guardians/owners (either KT or Seaweed) of the Brighton page removed the picture, because if you scrutinised the picture closely you could just about see a girl in a thong. However, is this not a typical beach scene in Brighton? Therefore, should this picture not be reinstated, as being typical of the Brighton Beach scene, as the photo was actually taken there? Are KT and Seaweed censoring what is to be be found in Brighton?</p>
<p><br />
Pleased to see the Brighton Beach picture is back.</p>

<p>Uh-oh, external links again... hopefully we won't revisit the recent spam-link debacle. In fact, in general it's the opposite which is happening just now, as user David D. is cleaning up some "personal blogs" and spam and suchlike. However, there's one link which I believe is thoroughly useful, which was removed earlier, then I returned to the page and then recently David removed it again. I'd like to sound people out about this one (and offer a case for the link.)</p>
<p>In the edit summary (hopefully he'll join the discussion here), David D. asks "how is free advertising for flickr not spam?" The reason is simple; spam isn't defined by what website gets "free advertising" but by the relevance and usefulness of the content provided. Otherwise, we might as well say that links to WikiMedia were advertising for the WikiMedia organisation, and references in discussion pages to Google hits were free advertising for Google.</p>
<p>The link to flickr (which I vaguely recall I added) is carefully chosen to point to the Brighton images "group", rather than any particular user, and additionally, many flickr images (the majority, in my judgement, but I can't back that up) are licensed using creative commons licenses, very much in the spirit of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>External links are generally discouraged by various Wikipedia policies, but one has to be sensible and some are just plain useful to readers.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to read other people's opinions on this, but in the absence of strong objections, I'm minded to put the link back again. â€“ <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 16:54, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if I was being a little wanton in my editing. I don't know too much about flickr but I have a sense we may need to be careful linking to such content.

<p>Sorry but i'm new to Wikipedia and it's aims/objectives - I placed the link to <a href="http://brightondailyphoto.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://brightondailyphoto.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://brightondailyphoto.blogspot.com/</a> some time ago. It's not a website advertising anything or selling anything - it's just a photo of Brighton/Hove every day - fresh. Judging by the amount of traffic it received from the Wiki other users found it useful too. Would it be reincluded?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In general blogs are not viewed as a good source. Wikipedia should not be used as a tool to drive traffic to a blog or personal web site. Also I'm not sure that one picture a day is really worth an external link. Sorry. A compromise would be to upload your photos to wikipedia and form a gallery page fopr Brighton.

<dd>I hate to be the one to say it, but the solution might be to say "one is enough" â€“ and in that case the existing (flickr) one is arguably more use because (a) it takes the viewer immediately to a large pool of photos and (b) links to blogspot may be too much trouble to maintain anyway, since they can tend to get nuked from time to time by people patrolling for them (looking out for text blogs). â€“ <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 19:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From an original idea conceived in 2005 by Eric Tenin of Paris Daily Photo, the identifying features of these blogs are that they:</p>
<p>Are location centered; Are posted to regularly each day; Each has a photo and brief text.

<dd>My argument is consistent with the idea that we do not want to be inundated with links to people blogs with photos. One is enough. Blogs and such also get caught up in the vanity policies too. As i said, you are free to upload your pictures to wikipedia. That is the whole point of the project. Is there a reason why you wish to maintain control of the pictures? If so they are probably not what wikipedia is looking for. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As of 10 November 2006, per <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">WP:WIAGA</a>, here's my assessment to this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(1.a)</b> - This is my <i>major concern</i> of this article. There are a lot of orphaned paragraphs, which either should be merged or expanded. The prose is not written as an encyclopaedic way, but rather as a directory page.</li>
<li><b>(1.b)</b> - There are too many stubby sections with only 1-2 paragraphs per (sub)section. Please expand more.</li>
<li><b>(3.a)</b> - The article is not broad enough. Please expand more the sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: this article has a promise for GA, but currently is not yet ready. The article looks like unfinish to me. Briefly, the article looks like a page in a lonely planet guide book. Please make a comparison with other similar GA articles. When the above issues are resolved, editors may <a href="../../../g/a/c/WP%7EGAC_00ed.html" title="WP:GAC">renominate</a> this article again.

<p>How come no twin towns are listed? I sure Brighton has some (but can't think of any at the moment). Anyone have any idea how to get such a list?

<p>Brighton has probably the highest concentration of architecturally outstanding churches outside London: why is there no mention of them? I have some good photos of St. Bartholomew's, St. Paul's and St. Peter's, which may be of some use, but I lack the historical knowledge required to construct good articles about them.--<a href="../../../v/o/x/User%7EVox_Humana_8%27_4f64.html" title="User:Vox Humana 8'">Vox Humana 8'</a> 15:31, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be some conflict. Associated in the sentences regarding the "Domesday Book", in the title the name is given as "Brighthelmston" and in the history section "Bristelmestune". I am aware of the name changes, but at present both names are associated - atleast tacitly - with the 11th century. I would clear it up myself, but I don't know the answer. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_122.19.21.168_756a.html" title="Special:Contributions/122.19.21.168">122.19.21.168</a> (talk) 01:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>It's "Brighthelmstone" sometimes too. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeaweed_8015.html" title="User:Seaweed">User:Seaweed</a> (if I remember the name rightly) did a considerable amount of research on this, and the versions of the name given at the time of his (or her) last edit were spelled precisely correctly based on the given sources. I'll trawl through to check they've not been corrupted, but basically the variations you've spotted are intentional. Whether they were ever <i>accepted</i> spellings is unclear, but we can only (and must) go with what the verifiable sources say. â€“ <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 00:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The mention of "Hove, actually" has been deleted as "highly dubious". Not sure what the editor means by that (it's undoubtedly a common phrase) but they're quite right to call it dubious if they meant that in the sense that its presence in the article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, <i>i.e.</i> unreferenced. It had one semi-reference, but only a link to a film in which it was used. Does anybody have a reference to its popular use, which would allow us to return it?
