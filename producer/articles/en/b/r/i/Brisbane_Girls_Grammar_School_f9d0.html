<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The opening of Brisbane Girls Grammar School in March 1875 signified its development as a successful academic secondary school for girls in the colony of Queensland. This was six years before women were admitted to universities in Sydney and Melbourne and before similar schools appeared elsewhere in the country. It is therefore not surprising that there were inordinate pressures on those responsible for the development of the school.</p>
<p>Within six months of opening, the school outgrew its premises and relocated to Wickham Terrace. In July 1882, the school made the decision to separate from the Brisbane Grammar School and operate independently under the Grammar Schools Act.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Lilley's vision to provide girls with the same educational opportunities as their brothers, was far ahead of its time. In the following years, the traditions established for the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_of_young_women.html" title="Education of young women">education of young women</a> not only were maintained, but also greatly strengthened.</p>
<p>By July 1882, the School was well established and the decision was made to separate from Brisbane Grammar School and to operate independently under the Grammar Schools Act . Plans were also made that year to move the School to its present site on Gregory Terrace and in 1884, the Main Building, designed by architect Richard Gailey, was opened to one hundred students.</p>
<p>The school's motto is 'Nil Sine Labore', Latin for 'Nothing Without Work'. It was adopted from the Brisbane Grammar School, which in turn borrowed it from Horace's Second Book of Satires. The school badge is an open book on a shield with the school motto on a ribbon underneath. The open book was also borrowed from Oxford University, where over half of the original staff of Brisbane Grammar School were originally secured.</p>
<p>Brisbane Girls Grammar School produced professional women at a time in when education for women was virtually unheard of. Among the school's alumni are distinguished professionals, artists, musicians, actors, scientists, educators, doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>In 2002, Ms. Amanda Bell became Principal of Brisbane Girls Grammar School.</p>

<p>The school uniform consists of a white blouse, long navy blue skirt, and royal blue tie. In winter the girls are required to wear black stockings and the school blazer outside of school. The summer uniform substitutes socks for stockings, and does not require the blazer. The school badge and respective house badge are required to be worn on the tie. Officially, the girl's are required to wear a royal blue ribbon in their hair throughout the whole year. The school's hat is the unofficial 'mascot', it is navy blue felt with a band running around the crown. The school colour, royal blue, was adopted from Brisbane Grammar School, as a result of a tradeoff between the Oxford and Cambridge colours, light blue and dark blue</p>

<p>Nil Sine Labore! Set your goals and strive (x2);<br />
Dare to let your dreams take wing and soar.<br />
Inspired by those who showed the way, we keep our hopes alive,<br />

<p>There are now nine houses which exist in the school. These houses are: Beanland (Pink), England (Blue), Gibson (Purple), Griffith (Red), Hirschfeld (Orange), Lilley (Green), Mackay (White), O'Connor (Maroon), Woolcock (Yellow).</p>
<p>The houses are named after past principals and teachers of the school as well as previous board of trustees members.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Beanland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beanland</span></h3>
<p>Beanland House is named after Miss Sophia Beanland, the former Head Mistress of the School from 1882 to 1889. The House was first established in 1964 when the School had ten Houses, each with approximately fifty students. The inaugural House Captain was Susan Baker. Beanland House was the first House to win the Lilley Cup and joint winners of the Lilley Cup with Mackay House in 1965. Beanland House and four other Houses were discontinued in 1966, as the system of ten Houses was not manageable.</p>
<p>Beanland House was reintroduced in 1994. Girls elected to take up the challenge of a new House and proudly donned Beanland's distinctive hot pink colour. Since then, the House has surpassed all expectations. Beanland has been successful in swimming, artistic gymnastics, drama, triathlon, beep test, basketball, volleyball, athletics (individual events and relays) and choral competitions over the years. Recently, it has had noted success in Interhouse Athletics Competitions in winning the individual events, relays and overall trophy. In all areas, Beanlanders have shown tremendous House spirit.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Lilley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lilley</span></h3>
<p>The proud tradition of Lilley House began when it was one of ten houses established in 1964. Lilley House was named after Sir Charles Lilley, the former Premier and Chief Justice of Queensland, and the founder of Brisbane Girls Grammar School. Particularly influential in the educational arena, Sir Charles Lilley had a substantial influence on the Education Act 1875, and was responsible for the introduction of free education in Queensland in 1870.</p>
<p><a name="Gibson" id="Gibson"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Gibson">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gibson</span></h3>
<p>Gibson House was originally formed in 1964 and lasted until 1973 when the House System was discontinued in favour of a horizontal division based on year groups. Gibson House was officially re-constituted in February 1980 after a gap of seven years and is named in honour of Major John Lockhart Gibson, M.D. one of Brisbane’s most brilliant and best known doctors.</p>
<p>His association with Brisbane Girls Grammar School was a long and happy one as he was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1906. From 1929 until his resignation in 1940 he served as Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p><a name="England" id="England"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: England">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">England</span></h3>
<p>England House was named after Mr John Edwyn England, who was one of the longest serving Trustees of the School. He was a Member of the Trust for 20 years and was Chairman of the Board from 1952 to 1961. Ted, as he was affectionately known as, led a busy life as a senior State Public Servant. Aside from these duties, he was a Founding Member of the Hamilton Bowling Club, an excellent bass singer and a father of three.</p>
<p><a name="Mackay" id="Mackay"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Mackay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mackay</span></h3>
<p>Mackay House was formed in 1998. Girls elected to take up the challenge of a new House and proudly donned Mackay’s distinctive wings and halo to create the Mackay Angel.</p>
<p>Mackay House was named after Margaret Annie Mackay. She was a pupil at the School in its early days. She then became a teacher at Brisbane Girls Grammar School and finally was appointed Head Mistress in 1916. She retired in 1924. Miss Mackay exemplified the following maxim, “courage, truth and the beauty of simplicity” and we have tried to follow her lead ever since.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: O'Connor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">O'Connor</span></h3>
<p>O’Connor House was named after Brisbane Girls’ Grammar School’s first Headmistress, Mrs Janet O’Connor.</p>
<p>Mrs Janet O’Connor (daughter of Andrew Dodds and Eleanor Pattison) was born in Truro, Cornwall and was educated at Military College, Bath. In 1851, she married Mr Daniel O’Connor. The couple had four children: Alice, Thomas, Janet and Catherine. Australia in the 1850s was a very different place to the Australia of today and it must have been a monumental decision for the mother of four to leave England and start a new life in the colony.</p>
<p>From 1875 to 1877, Mrs O’Connor led the fledgling School which was then located in George Street. Her personal integrity and high academic standards laid the foundation of excellence for which the School would later become renowned.</p>
<p>O’Connor House was established in 1964 and was discontinued in 1966. In 1990, it was re-established and adopted maroon as it signature colour. In the same year, O’Connor House began a sponsorship programme with Year One students from Inala State School. Since then, the House has supported the Variety Club and has more recently adopted The East Timor Scholarship Fund as it official charity.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Griffith">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Griffith</span></h3>
<p>Griffith House was originally established in 1964 and combined with Mackinlay House in 1966 to form a larger Griffith house. It continued in this form until 1973 when the house system was discontinued in favour of a horizontal division based on year groups. Griffith House was officially re-constituted in February 1980 after a gap of seven years and is named in honour of Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, former Chairman of Trustees, Premier of the Colony of Queensland, Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Woolcock">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Woolcock</span></h3>
<p>Woolcock House was first established at Brisbane Girls Grammar School in 1964. It was named after John Laskey Woolcock in recognition of his contribution to the School and to education in general. The first House Captain was Helen McAulay. In 1966 Woolcock and O’Connor Houses combined keeping the name Woolcock. In 1973 the House was discontinued, but it was re-established in 1980.</p>
<p><a name="Hirschfeld" id="Hirschfeld"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_f9d0.html" title="Edit section: Hirschfeld">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hirschfeld</span></h3>

Dr. Hirschfeld was involved in many aspects of the medical profession and also had an enduring passion and commitment to education. Hirschfeld House was formed in 1980 in recognition of his services to education and the School.</p>
