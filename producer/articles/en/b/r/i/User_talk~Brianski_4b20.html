<p>I see you changed the map in the EU article to one that is focused on Europe.

<dd>I assume you are referring to my change on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Image%7EIsrael_and_Arab_states_map_k.png_2757.html" title="Image:Israel and Arab states map k.png">Image:Israel_and_Arab_states_map_k.png</a>. The map in question is *NOT* a map of the Arab League - if it were it would include the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comoros.html" title="Comoros">Comoros</a> as in <a href="../../../m/a/p/Image%7EMap_of_League_of_Arab_States_countries.png_bb78.html" title="Image:Map of League of Arab States countries.png">Image:Map_of_League_of_Arab_States_countries.png</a>, which would further skew the focus of the map and make the critical region harder to see. Djibouti and Somalia both have less than 15% Arab minorities. Furthermore, there has never been significant bad will between Israel and these nations, so including them is misleading on two levels. If you want to change the map's description to say "members of the Arab League and Israel" fine, go for it. In sum, the version of the map with Djibouti and Somalia excluded is more accurate. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 05:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You'll see that it was I who proposed to include Iran and then agreed not to. You'll find some info on Somalia there also.

<dd>Somalia: A failed state, warlords dominate the country, political violence and banditry have been endemic since 1991, no national judicial system, 80 to 90% of the school-age population don't attend school, virtually all females genitally mutilated during childhood <a href="http://www.middle-east-info.org/league/somalia/somalia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.middle-east-info.org/league/somalia/somalia.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but this is what Somalia proclaims at the UN: <i>"...There are those who violate these lofty principles with impunity. Israel is an example in this regard. The continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands, seized by war, denying the Palestinian people their dignity, daily killings of Palestinian children, siege of the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people and calls by Israeli officials for his killing, the suffering and daily humiliations inflicted on the Palestinian people are of great concern to the international community."</i> <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/somaeng031002.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/somaeng031002.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>I'm not sure what Somalia's internal struggles have to do with your argument, but for the sake of discussion: many countries including many Western European states have condemned Israel for its bombing of civilians in the recent conflict in Lebanon. Does that mean that those states are "Arab" as well? Clearly, to express support for countries at war with Israel does not an Arab country make. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 17:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really don't agree with your reasoning for the removal of these two countries from the map. These kinds of maps always include Somalia and Djibouti since they are members of the Arab league. While Israel probably has never been too concerned with them, there has long been signifigant ill will towards the Israelis. While the population only includes about 15% of people who identify themselves as Arabic like you stated, the fact is that Arab culture is more dominant and mainstream than any other culture in either of the nations.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 15:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To claim that Arab culture is more dominant than others is quite offensive and flat out wrong. Still there has been no response to my question: if Djibouti and Somalia are included for being members of the Arab league, why not Comoros? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 16:58, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) Both these countries are members of the Arab League. 2) Both these countries participate in all anti-Israel initiatives of the Arab League.

<p>I saw you removed the cute (POV) math reference in the trigamy section. While I agree it's not critical, if it is in fact correct I'd vote for inclusion. That being said you also mention it was incorrect but I don't see an explaination in the Talk page. Could you explain why you feel it is incorrect? Thanks --Acq3 08:35, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is incorrect because, while there are 3 bonds in this union, only two of them involve the man. The third bond, that between the wives (if indded they have a relationship), could be prosecuted as well, but not against the husband. Think of the relationship as the shape of the letter V, not a triangle. Even if the women have a relationship / are considered to be married as well, any single individual in this triangle still has only two marriages. Or in more mathematical terms, if there are P people (nodes) in a relationship, and every member of the relationship is considered to have a relationship with every other member, there are P*(P-1) two person relationships (edges). However, each individual has only P-1 relationships (each node has only P-1 edges / touches only P-1 other nodes). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 08:53, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with you but it seems the analysis you enumerate is for bigamy but I was referring to the Trigamy section which involves three wives, not two as in your example. I would view the issue more like this: Three bonds Man (M) to Wife 1 (A), Man to Wife 2 (B) and Man to wife 3 (C). Thus the man could be charged with three counts of bigamy: MAB, MBC, and MCA. your thoughts? -- Acq3 15:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your input - the effort I put in to the maps was mostly programming - stripping the data we didn't need out of other sources and combining that with other data we needed. I put very little effort into trying to ensure the data was up to date and NPOV, however, <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanuckguy_6038.html" title="User:Canuckguy">User:Canuckguy</a> did, and has addressed this particular problem as of about 2 weeks ago. You can see his version at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Image%7EBlankMap-World6.svg_9b5b.html" title="Image:BlankMap-World6.svg">Image:BlankMap-World6.svg</a>, and please do use it! <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 10:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the reply, I've posted a note on his talk mentioning the need for an update. As soon as that is done, and a stable filename is created, I'll get to using it for various articles. Any chance of getting svg locator maps for the country infoboxes too?

<dd>I've initially awarded a star to Canuckguy for the map, but now I see a massive portion of that map was yours, so here's some recognition for your work. Canuckguy gets to keep his star as his edits finally made the map usable, but he couldn't have done it without your foundations. So, thanks! And keep them vector maps coming! +<a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexagon1_7aa4.html" title="User:Hexagon1">Hexagon1</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/x/User_talk%7EHexagon1_8a7c.html" title="User talk:Hexagon1">t</a>)</sup> 06:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks! I'll admit part of me was annoyed for a moment on seeing someone else getting accolades&#160;;) But Canuckguy did some great work too, and I'm happy to share credit, especially if it helps others use <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVG_cd15.html" title="SVG">SVG</a>!

<p>Hi, Brianski! I posted a comment about your recently added disambiguation in the Slovenia article.

<p>Hello, I am quite sorry to bother you with this -- but the Kaszub ethnic group of Poland is most certainly <i>not</i> located in the "northeast" of the country. Their historic and (more or less) current area is to the northwest and west of Gdansk/Gdynia, two cities in the northern middle of Poland, on the Baltic.

<dd>Well I made my change based on what I saw in the map, which clearly shows the Kassubs in NE Poland. Perhaps that map (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Slavic_languages.jpg" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Slavic_languages.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Slavic_languages.jpg</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>is wrong? If you think so please let me know, and I'll be happy to make an appropriate changes... <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 15:08, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
