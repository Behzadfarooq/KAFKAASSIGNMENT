<p>Please see my comments on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Columbia_general_election%2C_1952_8e9b.html" title="Talk:British Columbia general election, 1952">Talk:British Columbia general election, 1952</a>, which is a related situation. These two are the lengthiest of the electoral-data footnotes, but the footnote material is provided for reasons of historical context and accuracy; it is not, to my knowledge, governed by or restricted under Crown Copyright.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC) <b>The tables on both these pages were complex to build (in no small part because of the elimination ballot) and would take a LOT OF WORK to re-create.</b> If thine eye offend thee, smite it out: rather than deleting the electoral data, if the footnotes upset you that much as "possibly copyvios" then by all means feel free to rewrite them; their contents are a matter of public record in BC and important to the electoral history of the province. NOT explaining them seems to me to be worse.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Further to previous, please note the end of footnote 1 on the Elections BC page: "See British Columbia, Chief Electoral Officer. <i>Alternative Voting: An Explanation of the Procedure...</i>, Victoria, 1952." In other words, a government-circulated pamphlet meant to educate the public as to how to use the elimination ballot...is such a best public domain, or copyright-protected? In any case, I've made a subpage with the un-copyvio disputed material to save the tables, and will do the same for 1953; it would have been simple enough to revise the questionable paragraph rather than install the delete-the-whole-thing template IMO.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, re the template, note that <a href="http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/23ge1952-1.html#1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/23ge1952-1.html#1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> here refers to the 1952 election, NOT the 1953 election. In a court of law, this would be the submission of the wrong evidence and would result in a mistrial....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:58, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously the problem is not the tables, which are not copyrightable, but the footnote which was copied and pasted. I don't think it's safe to simply assume that the text is not under Crown copyright simply because there isn't a copyright symbol at the bottom of the page. I'm not an expert in copyright laws, but as far as I know everything produced by a provincial or federal government in Canada is automatically under Crown copyright unless the copyright has expired or it is explicitly stated otherwise, and I think you would need explicit confirmation that it is indeed republishable for any purpose without permission. The electoral system that was used can very easily be explained without copy/pasting the footnote directly&#160;; obviously, if it is rewritten in other language, there would no longer be any problem. (As for your comment about wrong evidence, it is irrelevant&#160;; text was copied from a website, which is a violation regardless of where it was copied to.) <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigging.holes_592d.html" title="User:Digging.holes">dh</a> ▪ <a href="../../../d/i/g/User_talk%7EDigging.holes_06d9.html" title="User talk:Digging.holes">2¢</a> ▪ 01:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said above somewhere, or on the other talkpage, I was "on the fly" when creating these pages because of the massive data inputting and table formatting involved, and was too brain-dead to try and reconfigure the language; because it was official material I thought also pehaps it was OK to quote it directly, as with a police blotter or report of a Crown Commission, which should be quoted intact...OK, with quote marks granted, and in this case I could have footnoted it into the table like the Premier-Elect etc. But hold off on the deletion until I fix the rewording. All BC election pages also need a lot of political-situation/issues and "notable races/candidates" sections fleshed out; especially these two...among many. I've just come back from a short block (undeserved and now revoked) and have a lot of catching up to do, so it may not be today that these changes get made...<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while ago, before other things caught me up and I couldn't come back, I made a temp page with the non-infringement contents on it, as instructed by the template; it may not be necessary if this one isn't deleted, as what could be done here is either a rewrite of the disputed section, or it could be cited as a quotation from Elections BC records; note that the Elections BC footnotes themselves are often pastiches/infringements of coverage in local papers; all in the public domain by now I suppose....but originally copyrighted....anyway, a rewrite or a cited quote would solve the problem, here as well as at 1952, wouldn't it? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> (<a href="../../../s/k/o/User_talk%7ESkookum1_940d.html" title="User talk:Skookum1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skookum1_a134.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skookum1">contribs</a>) 19:48, 13 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
