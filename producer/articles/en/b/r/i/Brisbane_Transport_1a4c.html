Double deck horse tram at the northern end of the first permanent Victoria Bridge, Brisbane Australia c. 1890</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Brisbane Transport's origins can be traced back to the Metropolitan Tramways and Investment Company, which established a small horse tramway under franchise from the Queensland government in Brisbane in August 1885. This company was purchased by the Brisbane Tramways Company, which electrified and expanded the tram system from 1897. Brisbane's tram system remained in private hands until 1922, at which time the Queensland government established the Brisbane Tramways Trust, which compulsorily acquired the tram network and supporting infrastructure. In 1925 the state government created the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a> and transferred responsibility for the tram network from the trust to the council.</p>
<p>The Brisbane Tramways Trust experimented with providing bus services in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> but these proved impractical due to mechanical unreliability and very poor road surface quality throughout Brisbane. The first permanent bus services were introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> as a supplement to Brisbane's excellent and frequent tram services.</p>

<p>In 1948 the City Council "municipalised" a number of privately run bus operators and expanded its own fleet of buses.</p>
<p>The first tram lines to close were the Lower Edward Street - Gardens route and the Upper Edward Street - Gregory Terrace route in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> the latter due to the very steep grades on that line. Initially <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">diesel</a> engined buses replaced tram services on these lines, however these were replaced by <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolleybus.html" title="Trolleybus">Trolleybuses</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>.</p>
<p>The City Council had also intended to introduce a trolley-bus service to the new <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Queensland_95f7.html" title="University of Queensland">University of Queensland</a> campus at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Lucia%2C_Queensland_a529.html" title="St Lucia, Queensland">St Lucia</a> and purchased enough trolley-bus chasses from the United Kingdom for the Gardens route and this project. However, it was vigorously opposed by residents and the St Lucia plan was abandoned. The City Council found itself with surplus trolley-buses but no route on which to run them. The Council decided to run the trolley-buses from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herston%2C_Queensland_6451.html" title="Herston, Queensland">Herston</a> to Stanley Bridge, <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Brisbane%2C_Queensland_8e13.html" title="East Brisbane, Queensland">East Brisbane</a>, with this service commencing in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>.</p>
<p>Several other trolley-bus routes were subsequently established in the eastern suburbs. The first of these replaced a tram route, along Cavendish Road, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>. Other trolley-bus routes to Seven Hills and Carina did not involve tram route closures.</p>

<li>8C - City to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carina%2C_Queensland_aa83.html" title="Carina, Queensland">Carina</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Trolley-bus depot and workshops were located on Milton Road, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton%2C_Queensland_b2f6.html" title="Milton, Queensland">Milton</a>, between Hale and Castlemaine Streets. The former depot was demolished to make way for the redeveloped <a href="../../../s/u/n/Suncorp_Stadium_068c.html" title="Suncorp Stadium">Suncorp Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>The tramway closure was notable for the speed with which it was carried out. Several hundred replacement buses were purchased from British vehicle manufacturer Leyland, at the time the largest single bus purchase in the world. The sudden acquisition of so many buses was to have repercussions in later years. Initially the Leyland Panther buses proved unreliable and as a result older, front-engined mounted buses, such as the Leyland Mk III Regals dating from the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> were retained well past their normal replacement date. Once the problems with the Panthers were ironed out, overall fleet numbers and maintenance requirements were reduced. Nevertheless the fleet retained many older buses from the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> the Australian Federal Government led by <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> made $80 million available to the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> state government which was intended to be passed to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a> for the purchase of replacement buses. The Queensland Government refused to transfer the funds to the City Council and instead used the money to construct the Parliamentary Annexe Building and to restore Parliament House.</p>
<p>As the replacement bus fleet aged, their maintenance requirements steadily increased, at a time when labour and spare parts costs had risen sharply. Further, as the tram replacement buses started to wear out at about the same time and needed replacement, the council was faced with another large capital outlay. Subsequently in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> the City Council was able to negotiate some federal funding, enabling them to purchase Volvo B-59M buses, the first fleet acquisistions in seven years.</p>
<p>Patronage on the buses continued to decline, despite the best efforts of the Transport Department, hampered by rising fuel and labour costs, together with tightening budgets which led to further cuts in services. An ageing bus fleet, some of which had been in service since the 1940s, made the service increasingly unattractive.</p>
<p>A further hindrance was the City Council's own aggressively pro-car 1964 city plan, which required all developments to include car parking, but did not require the provision of any facilities that might advantage public transport.</p>
<p>By the 1980s bus patronage had dropped to approximately 40,000,000 passenger journeys per annum.</p>
<p>However, this was not to say that the City Council completely failed to invest in public transport. New depots were constructed at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carina%2C_Queensland_aa83.html" title="Carina, Queensland">Carina</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toowong%2C_Queensland_1540.html" title="Toowong, Queensland">Toowong</a>. Modern workshops were also constructed at Toowong and the former tram workshops at Milton decommissioned. A network of express routes, called "cityxpress", using buses with comfortable, high-backed seating bolstered patronage, particularly in outer suburbs. The underground Queen Street bus station, opened in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, facilitated passenger movement. The Transport department's administration was relocated to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Administration_Centre_562c.html" title="Brisbane Administration Centre">Brisbane Administration Centre</a> (BAC) along with most of the City Council's other administrative units. Slowly the decline in patronage was halted, although costs continued to outstrip ticket revenue.</p>

The construction of grade-separated <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busway.html" title="Busway">busways</a> and the introduction of several high-frequency express routes known as <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_upgrade_zone.html" title="Bus upgrade zone">bus upgrade zones</a> (BUZ) has also seen patronage rise substantially for the first time in decades. The rise in the cost of petrol is also making public transport a financially more attractive option for many commuters.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">14 November</a> 2005, Queensland authorities shutdown bus and train services whilst a bomb-related security alert was investigated. Premier <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Beattie_96de.html" title="Peter Beattie">Peter Beattie</a> told the public that authorities were being cautious in light of terror raids in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> the week prior. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to a press release on the 3rd of July 2006, Patronage on bus services has risen by 24% in a 2 year period - from 46 million in the year prior to the introduction of TransLink to more than 57 million in the second year of operation. This is leading to problems of overcrowding of buses, particularly during morning and afternoon peak hours.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Currently Brisbane Transport operates its service from 6 different depots. Each depot has its own symbol consisting of a letter of the alphabet. Generally each bus allocated to a particular depot displays the symbol for that depot on its body. There are instances of buses not displaying symbols, or where a bus is reallocated to a new depot and the symbol is not immediately changed. Many of the depots share routes with other Depots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bowen Hills (Symbol - A) - Serves some northern routes and operates all routes between New Farm and West End.</li>
<li>Toowong (Symbol - T) - Serves South Western and North West Routes from Brookside and The Gap to Inala and Forest Lake.</li>
<li>Richlands (Symbol - R) - Is a satellite depot of Toowong (T), it shares services on western routes and does some services to Parkinson and Browns Plains.</li>
<li>Virginia (Symbol - V) - Serves the majority of northern routes from Nudgee Beach and Brighton to Brookside and the Gap.</li>
<li>Carina (Symbol - C) - Serves all eastern routes and some south eastern routes from Garden City to Wynnum and Bulimba.</li>
<li>Garden City (Symbol - G) - Serves the South Eastern Routes from Browns Plains and Sunnybank to Wishart and Coorparoo Areas. This depot is also the location for the Brisbane Transport Head Office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Garden City, Toowong &amp; Virginia depots are also CNG (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Compressed_Natural_Gas_cd20.html" title="Compressed Natural Gas">Compressed Natural Gas</a>) depots, which enables the operation of CNG-powered buses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bracken Ridge (Former Symbol - B) - Was only ever considered a "short term" depot by Brisbane Transport and it was closed with the opening of the Virginia Depot.</li>
<li>Cribb Street, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton%2C_Queensland_b2f6.html" title="Milton, Queensland">Milton</a> - Although never a formal depot, this area of land was occasionally used by the Brisbane City Council as temporary storage for buses, owing to its proximity to the Milton bus and tram workshops. Last used in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>.</li>
<li>Ipswich Road, Buranda (closed prior to the adoption of depot symbols) - The depot was shared with trams, with buses parked in the depot forecourt and at the rear (eastern end) of the tram sheds.

Until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> the depot was shared with trams with buses parked along the western (Wickham Street) frontage and north of the tram shed.
