<li>I have tried <a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUBeR_dff9.html#Block_warning" title="User talk:UBeR">reasoning with him</a> when he was trolling William's talk page, without luck (all I got for my troubles was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110687672" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=110687672" rel="nofollow">this</a>, where he seems to be saying that he is following my advice, while doing just the opposite). He doesn't seem interested in behaving like a member of the community - I'm not sure if the community's patience is exhausted, but <i>my</i> patience certainly is. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:08, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>His behavior amazes me. I worked with him on another article and saw his ability to do good work.

<li>To address to the first claim, I have not pushed any particular POV at Wikipedia other than that of consensus, if any at all (notwithstanding talk page discussions, of course). An overwhelming of my edits to that article have been to address sloppiness, style, grammar, spelling, etcetera. My mission here is for the betterment of Wikipedia articles. Let it be known that I support the consensus view on global warming, as presented by the IPCC. In fact, despite what might appear as undue support for the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_variation.html" title="Solar variation">solar variation theory</a>, my purpose is an attempt to bring balance and a NPOV to the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> article, where a number of POV-pushers patrol and police the article.</li>

<li>To address the second claim, modeling doesn't constitute expertise. Second, there is a colossal difference in "accusation" and "suspicion," hence the name "suspected sock puppets." And it is true that I have a suspicion. How can you say it is wrong for me to have a suspicion? That's nonsensical. So, on behalf of <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a>, an abettor of mine, I filed that suspicion, "so as to retire any further suspicion of sockpuppetry of this user." Third, I will keep in mind now to keep comments that specifically relate to an issue (in terms of previous occurrences), but may be considered "trolling" by Raul654 and his cronies, to the talk page of the originator. My apologies. Fourth, my notice of 3RR was merited on the basis of his three reversion on that particular page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=110687672&amp;oldid=110657890" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=110687672&amp;oldid=110657890" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I felt it necessary to advise him, because he often reverts content on that particular article, as well as related articles. There's isn't much to that. Fifth, my template of notability on that particular article was well merited. I've attempted to discuss the issue, but users, along with Raul654, digressed terribly from the issue. The particular <i>ad hominem</i> attacks/arguments abound when such issues arise.</li>

<li>To address the third claim, it would be wholly inappropriate to label this as a "hit list." It serves as a notice board that "will serve as a notice board that will be updated when necessary. The evidence gathering process is ongoing and, along with other users, I have begun this process." I've been consumed with the vexation of particular administrators who consider themselves above Wikipedia's policies. This is the sort of desecration up with which I will not put. It serves as a watch list, as it is titled, to my abettors and other users who wish to be cautious and watchful of such activities that I have observed and begun to document. It serves to no other purpose. Banefully, it is without proper evidence/references at the current moment, for which I apologize (and quite frankly, may abet in the appearance of personal attacks). Real life activities detract my availability on Wikipedia, but my "watchdog" activities will continue, and, with further aid, the notice board shall be complete with references, etcetera. The goal is not to detract the editor, but rather the particular edits by that user that have been contrary to Wikipedia policies.

<li>I can speak for at least the first claim and say that from what I've seen of <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a>'s contribution to global warming-related articles, they are not trolling, nor POV pushing. These articles are highly controversial and continuously raise heated debates. It's easy to come here like <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> just did and throw accusations of trolling or POV pushing, but it seems to me that this has little or no merit. Besides, I have seen many users complain of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_M._Connolley_4511.html" title="William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>'s POV or behaviour regarding climate articles, and I have witnessed myself at least one disregard of WP policies by him so far. I guess it is legitimate to keep a file with regard to his actions. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 23:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It should be noted that Childhoodsend (along with a few others - Roncram, Rameses, and the above-mentioned Brittainia) are, like Uber, POV pushers attempting to weaken or otherwise degrade the global warming and related articles. Their opinion of Uber's biased edits should not be taken as accurately representing the content of those edits. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 01:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I will not respond to this POV pusher accusation. I'm trying to bring balance and as far as I know, my contributions have been appreciated so far. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 01:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Raul654, please remove yourself from this discussion; we are trying to have a serious discussion. You are not. You may sit here all day, with your <i>ad hominen</i> attacks, trying to discredit those who see the injustices of yours and WMC and others.

<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy has an "undue weight" provision, but the sceptics keep pushing for equal coverage of the GW sceptic position. We attract an awful lot of sceptics, so we hear the same complaints over and over. But this isn't about the sceptic POV-pushing, this is about Uber's (and Brittainia's) disruptive activities - laughable accusations of sockpuppetry, trolling William's talk page, trolling <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_Connolley_b14c.html" title="Talk:William Connolley">Talk:William Connolley</a>, setting up attack pages, etc. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 02:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Guettarda, you are not representing my actions fairly. If nothing else, the solar variation theory is probably the most debated topic <b>within</b> the scientific community. This theory holds water. Many scientists have researched the effects solar variation has the Earth, and there shouldn't be anything stopping these substantiated scientists' research from being discussed in relationship to how it affects Earth's climate. I've added nothing to the global warming article that was either against the consensus or POV in nature. For all intents and purposes, your claims are unfounded. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 03:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry if my comment wasn't quite clear. Brittainia talked about "all the other people" who have had similar problems with William. Not only is that a misrepresentation (since, after all, it isnt just William), it's also expected, since there's always been a movement to give equal weight to a minority position. As I said, <i>this isn't about...POV-pushing</i>, this is about behaviour. I think I've represented your <i>behaviour</i> fairly - your continued repost of a 3RR warning, your sockpuppetry accusations, etc., your creation of attack pages...this behaviour is unacceptable. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry then, I misunderstood. But I still disagree with your assessment. The overwhelming amount of dissent is that in the direct of William M. Connolley. This isn't about skepticism. You have misunderstood that idea. Second, how am I supposed to address my concerns with this particular user? Shall I go to to his user page? Of course not, that's trolling! Well then, shall I go to some committee or report it to some official noticeboard? Of course not, that's silly and nonsense! Forgive me for not <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">assuming the assumption of good faith</a>, but what else can I do when there is a particular administrator who has been elected to be given a large amount of power, who, based on his personal feelings that he hasn't been able to subdue, can only categorize my every action as unwarranted, when, in fact, this is solely biased and unfounded! If anything, this is nonsensical. I've made by rebuttal above, and the author of these claims continuously avoids the facts, but rather simply attacks some unrelated point of view, and has yet to substantiate anything he has said. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 18:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Raul654 has labeled me a "contrarian POV pusher trying to put bias into the article". But all I was doing was defending the words: <b>"However, there remain respected scientists who hold differing opinions."</b> which had been deleted from the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> article. Surely these words do not constitute <i>pushing a biased POV</i>, as alleged? The control group will not even tolerate this tiny amount of NPOV in this important article. UBeR is a good person who has been the subject of these bully tactics for too long. Please seriously review whether <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William M.

<li>This is a <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_hunt.html" title="Witch hunt">witch hunt</a>. Most of the edits UBeR has made have been reasonable as far as I have seen. He's been fighting what many of us believe to be a systemic <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias</a> on many global warming related articles to shut down and revert edits that are anti-GW.

<li>This situation is extremely complicated and something that anyone who is not a regular participant in global warming related articles will be hard pressed to untangle. In terms of disclosure I should state that I am a climate scientist, and am taken by some as one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSolar_system_warming&amp;diff=111339859&amp;oldid=111336653" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSolar_system_warming&amp;diff=111339859&amp;oldid=111336653" rel="nofollow">villains</a> in the affair. Discussions on the topic sometimes get heated, and even those who are acting in good faith sometimes make remarks that could have been put more tactfully -- certainly I have. Consider all this however you will.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The global change articles see a steady stream of editors who wish to promote a point of view that gives undue weight to the skeptical viewpoint. Some simply make gratuitously provocative edits in order to stir up trouble; others have an agenda and are fact-averse. Representatives of each of those groups already have responded here. But I don't think UBeR belongs in those categories. He genuinely believes that the skeptical side is not being given fair play. In other words, while I think he wrong on the facts, I think his position is held in good faith. He also is an excellent copyeditor. The problem is, the same single-mindedness and persistence (some might say obsessiveness) that well serves a copyeditor is less helpful when dealing with other individuals. One has to learn to be flexible and that some battles are not worth fighting. I have tried to warn UBeR against personalizing the situation but unfortunately to no avail. To make a long story short, if any sanctions are meted out they should recognize that unlike some others, UBeR can make and has made constructive contributions to the articles themselves. The problems mostly lie in his actions outside article space as outlined in Rau654's point 2. I hope that the situation can be resolved in such a way that he can continue to make constructive contributions.</dd>

<dd>Raul, this is getting absurd. Until that last post, I thought you were doing this is good faith, but that's obviously not the case. You're right. I came to this page because of a notice placed on my talk page. Have you thought (*gasp*) that maybe not everyone checks the administrators' noticeboard on a regular basis? So because Uber or one of his supporters solicited my opionion, I'm immediately non-credible? I think I've contributed enough to WP at this point that I'm obviously not a troll. My opinion should be worth just as much as the opinions of people that disagree with you. Can I discount anyone that's posted on your or WMC's talk page as "non-credible" as well? Give me a break. You're just trying to discount 8 editors' opinions because they disagree with you.

<p>Raul654, in a perfect world the next step would be an investigation into why Uber is behaving in this manner (because I think there is fault on "both" sides). Unfortunately, this is not a perfect world, most people are here because they are willingly contributing their time. This is a really difficult call, you ought to enforce the rules, but by enforcing the rules you probably are doing an injustice because some are using the rules to bully others. You ought to investigate the bullying but that would take too much time (as I found out) and I'm sure there is fault on both sides. Probably the best solution would be to ban anyone who has contributed to this debate from editing any of the various global warming/climate change/mars heating up/etc. articles again! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Raul654 - I think the next step is to thank those administrators who do give up their own time to read all this argy-bargy. To do a good job moderating these disputes must take an awful lot of time and effort. Well done and thanks. Having read the israel-palestian and global warming, perhaps it might be worth considering creating new pages which can only be edited by one "side" which are linked to the main page (the main should not be edited by those taking a "side"). By asking people to decide whether they wish to be "neutral", "pro" or "anti" it would allow them to contribute to the article which best suits their own background. But more importantly it would allow the articles to include contentious information often repressed by one group. The "pro" group would be balanced by the "anti" group obtaining an overall NPOV within wikipedia (but not within those articles). Just an idea! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 15:44, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stephan, this post by William M. Connolley on a user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raul654#Where_next.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Raul654#Where_next.3F" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, is clearly designed to appear innocent and is a pointer to the next post on another user talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC.3F" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, where the actual conspiring and planning of your group's next move is clearly discussed. WMC was obviously attempting to hide this discussion otherwise why would he say <i>"Where next? - I have (reluctantly) started a discussion of this at User_talk:Stephan_Schulz#RFC? William M. Connolley 09:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)"</i> and give a pointer to another user talk page before starting the actual planning session? The "where next" comment makes me question "where was it before?". Your self-serving mischaracterization of user talk pages as "public" is false as the public rarely (or never) visits them for "general browsing". Now that your group has been exposed, I hope that the Wikipedia community takes this seriously and considers permanently banning your control and POV pushing on all GW pages. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a> 06:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although a conspiracy is not proved only by the discussions that Brittainia unearted, circumstances are of concern. I was perhaphs naive, but I must say that until now, I did not understand how it could be that these three editors are on the same line 99% of the time in GW related articles and always backing up each other. I mean, in normal circumstances, the odds are that they will disagree here and there on occasion no? This being said, the "monkey-off-your-back" post by Raul654 as well as the one where WMC gives an awkward pointer to his friends do not seem to be within normal Wikipedia behaviour. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 18:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um...maybe our usual (though by no means universal) agreement has something to do with the fact that all of us can recognize and read scientific papers, and distinguish them from political pseudo-science. Moreover, 99% of the time, Raul is not even there. As of the end of January 2007, he has <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Global+warming&amp;namespace=Talk&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Global+warming&amp;namespace=Talk&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">8</a> edits on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_warming_d6c7.html" title="Talk:Global warming">talk:global warming</a> (as opposed to William's about 700 and my 400). And, of course, the secret conspiracy on our talk pages is open for all to see. My <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephan_Schulz_91b9.html" title="User talk:Stephan Schulz">talk page</a> has never been archived. According to the article contribution counter, William has 11 edits there, Raul has 1 (and that is the official notification about the closing of William's ArbCom case that I reopened). Given that <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">User:Brittainia</a> herself has indeed widely canvased support (even on pages of users who have been inactive for a long time), this conspiracy theory is laughable.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 20:34, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stephan, you sound like the accused in the accused box who is yelling that the accusations against him are laughable. Although you can of course have your say in this new affair, you should stick to facts, not rant. Let the discussion go and see how the case unfolds. As a party to the "conspiracy theory", your testimony (since you chose to testify) must be flawless. It is true that your talk pages are public, but you also know just like us that they're not widely read, far from that.</dd>
<dd>Besides, we can all read scientific papers. It's just that we can also elect to be critical rather than elect for blind belief. Try reading <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hume_69a6.html" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> (who proved that no <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certainty.html" title="Certainty">certainty</a> exists in science), whose work had a huge influence on <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, among others. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 14:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is so much nonsense in this that I probably miss some of it...
<ol>
<li>I'm not an <s>accused</s> accused in any way that remotely resembles the situation in a court of law and warrants such a comparison.</li>
<li>There is no "new affair".</li>
<li>I'm not yelling (but admit to some ranting, which seems like an adequate tool in this situation).</li>
<li>I'm sticking to the facts.</li>
<li>I'm not a party to any conspiracy theory, neither with not without quotes.</li>
<li>My testimony certainly does not have to be "flawless" (why should it have to be?) and, in fact, I'm not giving "testimony". At most I'm presenting evidence.</li>
<li>In fact, I have no idea about how many people read my talk pages. Certainly most people I have interacted with have my talk page on their watch list.</li>
<li>I have no idea if you are able to read (as in "read and understand") scientific papers. Certainly, "we all" cannot read scientific papers - its extremely hard to read and <i>understand</i> a scientific paper that is not in your field of expertise. Most people (and most Wikipedians) have no approriate scientific training at all. William and Raymond are actually specialists in the field.</li>
<li>Indeed, there is no absolute certainty in science. None of us has ever claimed there is. But that does not stop us from using scientific results to calculate the statics of a bridge, to determine the ballistics of a weapon to put someone into jail (or, in more barbaric countries, onto death row), to develop a new vaccine, or for thousands of other tasks daily. Demanding "absolute proof" is at best a self-serving delaying tactic.</li>

I don't really have a problem with the ongoing pattern of new editors arriving on these pages etc. I agree that UBer seems to be trying to improve Wikipedia in good faith. However, I find the pattern of personalising discussion on this topic by attacking other longer standing editors totally unacceptable, both on and off wiki. It violates <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a> and a pile of other policies. If those who seek feel NPOV is in a different place (however good faith they are) throw tantrums and engage in personal attacks on other editors than we should warn and ultimately reluctantly exclude them. We have enough to do to stem the rising tide of outright vandalism without wasting time on petty squabbles.

As a pretty straightforward demonstration of this I was recently elected as an Administrator here by a very marginal majority (76% versus the 75% required) but none of the editors with whom I am assumed to be "grouped" voted for me. What better demonstration is there of a lack of conspiracy? As for this radio show ("race to the right"?), as far as I can tell it is a couple of guys who have a very strong POV and are trying to make a story about people not accepting their views. But they are both contributing to Wikipedia and writing a website apparently attacking editors here alleging conspiracy just because anyone with a reasonable scientific background is reverting low quality contributions.

But they aren't the only people complaining about a conspiracy - there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who have been complaining about the cabal controlling (and pushing their POV on) the global warming articles. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_M._Connolley_4511.html" title="William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> has already had three complaints against him - which two members of his group have admitted that they helped him to get out of (their admissions are right here on this page). After this latest complaint, he and his group conspired to launch this diversionary complaint which we are now involved in against UBeR (I am not sure why, if they had nothing to hide?). It is now time to begin a formal investigation of their tactics and the allegations against them from so many sources (including the bored DJ's). -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittainia_dceb.html" title="User:Brittainia">Brittainia</a> 04:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, this looks like an unfounded allegation. Personally I have complained several times on AN/I about UBer and others engaged in personal attacks ref the content of the page. This seems to me to be the substance of the current complaint: if he and the 3-4 others in the "conspiracy theory" gang were a bit more civil we would not be here (and that group have a lot of cross comments planning on each others talk pages, and abusing other editors). This is not in appearance a diversionary complaint AFAICT and unless "having a monkey on your back" has a vastly different meaning in other countries there is nothing I have read above to make this claim substantial. I think it is time to go to the ArbCom and ask for a community ban for the disruptive editors. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 08:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Though this is pointless to respond to, I'll say it anyway for brevity's sake. Where is the breach of privacy? Raul654 has been entrusted with checkuser access to identify socks, meatpuppetts, and other uses of contributions to evade bans/blocks or misuse Wikipedia content or process. We are not all entrusted with such access for the very privacy reasons you are concerned with. Raul654 confirmed the IPs, and not a single shred of personal identity was posted. Only checkusers can view their logs. I don't know your gender, location either city or continent, editing patterns that aren't public or marital/tax/health status from the checkuser confirmation. So what exactly is your beef with a checkuser that would invite such a riled defense?

<dd>Ryulong and all of you others, I must say that I am also truly disappointed by your continually dragging a child into this unseemly character assassination (it reminds me of Shakespeare's "the stabbing of Julius Caesar" scene). Persianne has certainly not <i>"pushed the same point of view disruptively"</i> (apart from one vote to save her dad's article from a similar assassination) and if you can show any evidence at all - do so.

<p>I have had the misfortune to try and edit the various global warming articles. Although I do not personally agree with Uber's point of view, I am firmly convinced that the faction that opposes Uber's views try is ganging up on contributors they don't like in an attempt to silent contributions informing readers of alternative &amp; notable view points to the pro global warming lobbyists. I really do feal sorry for people who are trying to document the alternative view to the pro global warming lobby because they are up against some very nasty characters who quite clearly want to stop people like Uber using any means possible. This whole situation doesn't do Wikipedia's reputation any good. There is unquestionably a majority (of scientists) who are of the view that the minority should not be heard at all. The majority appear to be able to edit Wikipedia at all times of day and night, the minority seems to be "normal" people with an interest as they edit intermittently.</p>
<p>From what I have seen this is not at all a fair fight, this is the Wikipedia equivalent of the overwhelming force of the Nazis attacking the minority jews (with the same vicious belief they are right). The "Nazis" may be technically operating within the law, and the "jews" may be behaving in ways that in other cases would be acceptable, but until Wikipedia finds a way to redress the balance and in particular starts to enforce NPOV, I'm with the underdogs and would urge you to see their actions as extremely restrained given the intolerable position they are under. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 11:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been away dealing with my own server issues lately. I have had the horrid experience of attempting to edit/balance the Global Warming pages. My own research of edit histories, etc. has shown some extremely disturbing things about Wikipedia, its administrators and its policies. The short of the whole issue is this: there are a number of admins (the group being discussed here are not the only ones) who flex their power over any other editor that dare disagree with them. The tactics used are vague references to policies to 'prove' the other editors are out-of-line; carefully crafted cheap shots in the article edits summaries &amp; talk pages to 'push buttons' of the 'bad editors'; talk down to them as being too inexperienced to understand how to properly edit Wikipedia; revert edits wholesale and in tandem (when one's rv is undone another will re-revert for the admin. The harder the resistance to the will of the abusive admins the more destructive the admins use/abuse of policies become. People talk about the blue veil of protection for police officers and a perfect example of that in Wikipedia can be found in reading the past 2 years of action, complaints, activity, etc from the admins and their colleagues in this particular complaint.</dd>

<dd>This entire RfC is a part of the constant efforts to chase away editors who do not comply with the viewpoints of various admins. To some degree it worked with me personally...I have chosen to not edit Wikipedia until I talk with certain key people in Wikipedia about this problem. Their actions are so intrusive I have recently received messages from some of these people attempting to dictate content on my own personal webspaces. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 18:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
