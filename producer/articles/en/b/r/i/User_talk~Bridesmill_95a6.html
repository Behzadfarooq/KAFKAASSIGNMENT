<p>The stuff that wasn't in the French article was part of the original English article on Rachel; I just merged the two. (So I'm not actually sure about the veracity of the raschel knitting machine and the colour.)

<p>Thanks for your work on my basic translation of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Poiret_e689.html" title="Jean Poiret">Jean Poiret</a>. Seeing that you didn't have to change that much of it fairly warmed the cockles of my heart, and made me think that my French language skills aren't as pathetic as I thought. Hope to see you around for my next attempt! --Ddsilver 15:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've done some impressive work translating from French to English! Good luck with that massive article about slavery in Ancient Greece--it looks really interesting, but <i>man</i> is it <i>looong</i>! Thanks so much for doing so much, it's really appreciated.

<p>Thanks for the heads up. The Kalendar Koffee House page probably isn't a speedy candidate since the duplicate has gone up on AFD. The user has been spamming and trying to use the 'pedia for advertising for a couple of weeks - you seem to have seen the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffeehouse.html" title="Coffeehouse">Coffeehouse</a> page already - and though the 'company' page could probably be construed as a speedy candidate itself (a different version was already speedied), I wanted to make sure that there was a consensus behind deleting in the hope of preventing further reposting. There is a means for posting similar pages under a single AFD vote, which I would've tried to do had I known of the duplicate at the time the first went up. Given that it's been a couple of days, though, I'd rather put it up for a separate vote just to be on the safe side. --<a href="../../../d/m/g/User%7EDMG413_758c.html" title="User:DMG413">DMG413</a> 16:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Deleting Kalendar from the coffee house category is wrong. To claim that Kalendar is advertising is also incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kalendar article lists date of opening and location with interior photo. The so called "vanity" aspects have been removed from the article. Kalendar may not be as "noteable" as the larger chains, but that should not preclude it from listing in the coffee house category. To call this article spam would be to call all listings in this category spam. The previous AFD article was edited down to be considered for inclusion - tis all. No harm intended. This on the other hand is the opening paragraphs of the Starbucks listing. I imagine that all listings in this category are similar to this.</p>
<p>Starbucks NASDAQ: SBUX (SEHK: 4337), is a large multinational chain of coffee shops, often serving pastries, popular in the US especially among students and young urban professionals. The corporate headquarters are in Seattle, Washington. The company was in part named after Starbuck, a character in Moby-Dick, and its insignia is a stylized cartoon Siren. According to the company's fact sheet, as of February 2006, Starbucks had 6,216 company-operated outlets worldwide: 5,028 of them in the United States and 1,188 in other countries and U.S. territories. In addition, the company has 4,585 joint-venture and licensed outlets, 2,633 of them in the United States and 1,952 in other countries and U.S. territories.</p>
<p>By definition most of the listings in the coffee house category are "non-notable". In fact the majority of the listings are not known outside the constituency where they are established. Being "non-notable" has always been a difficult area for editors. In this instance for example, the band Pursuit of Happiness wrote a song and video about Kalendar (1996 Kalendar/Gretzky Rocks/In Praise Of (T.W.A.-The World's Address). This by definition makes Kalendar a noteable entity by Wikipedia standards see Wikipedia:Notability "A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact".

<li>Unfortunately, now the articles are BAI - one liners only. Bridesmill can read, and yes, there are other coffeshops out there that prob don't belong. Starbucks &amp; Tim's *&amp; Cafe du monde etc are notable - Kalendar is not. The fact that the user who put it up does nothing significant on Wiki besides promote the business they own makles it in Wiki's view &amp; mine spam &amp; self-promotion. One of the reasons Bridesmill Studio doesn't have a page (although hopefully someone will put it up&#160;;-)I'm an inclusionist, but I cannot stand disengenuous behaviour. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 04:51, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The image should stay in the article. There is not another interior photo of a "French Style Cafe" in the article, therefore this a highly relevant image. Claiming that the image is vanity/spam/corp is nonsense and an invalid arguement. The image adheres to WP:NPOV standards. Separately the Kalendar Koffee House article has been RFD. I agreed with the arguement made regarding Chains, and have removed the listing on the Coffee House Chains page. The RFD outcome should not reflect on this page. As editors you must not allow your emotions to influence your choices. If you allow the image to be removed then must reflect on the reasons why. None of the reason given for removal of the image are sound or reasonable ones.EllisCHanna 12:44, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As Ellis' partner in Kalendar I wanted to add my part to this discussion. I completely understand the arguements made for the references and articles in the coffee house chains page Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kalendar Koffee House. I can see how Wikipedia could become full of advertising style information weakening the references made available in this valuable living encycodedia. I expressed concerns to my partner about that section from the start. But I also saw the possibility of a fit because ultimately it is a section listing businesses with their styles and descriptions. Now the pages that offer descriptions of cafes and coffee houses have excellent written references describing very accurately in words what these are. But the pictures are obviously less effective. It was this section that we were first drawn to. Each section, with the exception of section 2, has one or two picture references as I have reviewed:</li>
</ul>
<p>Intro Coffee House - One photo simple image reference. 1. History - two great reference images</p>
<p>2. Contemporary coffeehouses -no images as references (actually I think a Starbucks image would work well here - being an icon of the coffee movement of the 21 century- creating a whole new direction in coffeehouses again)</p>
<p>3. Contemporary cafés</p>
<p>The article on contemporary cafes is then highlighted with one image identified as: "A coffee shop in Ireland. There is no outside seating due to unsuitable weather." I assume this was used originally due to lack of any usable cafe images. The photograph could be depicting a bike repair shop or pub or any number of retail stores from its appearance, and lends no further descriptive relevance to this section. We are just suggesting, that as it appears, each catagory under Coffee Houses has a picture reference (with the acception of section 2), the triptych we have added offers a much stronger contibution to the contemporary cafe article, versus the ubiquitous corner coffee sandwich joint that appears to be represented (I appologize if this is actually a famous Irish quirky cafe that I do not know about.)</p>
<p>4. Cannabis coffee shops. The Bull Dog image is perfect. This is very well known coffee house for this section.</p>
<p>I hope this helps define our arguement for keeping this image in this section.I do not see how the Kalendar image is seen as any more or less of an advertising image than any others. For ultimately, we do believe it enhances the article. It was accepted at one point (it had been placed in a picture box like all the others). We hope this inclusion can be made again.

<p>Hi!

<p>I hate pestering people's talk pages about AFD votes (or votes at all... it's <i>very</i> bad form really) but I've just done a huge amount of work on this article, and it is probably 80% different from when you voted. I have found a large number of English language references, and I have used &lt;cite&gt; so any reader or editor can identify where each individual statement in the article came from. That ought to deal with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<p>Thank you for your fairness re Demiurge, who is a known censor (domestic terrorism in the US, Ante Pavelic, Eamon de Valera, Irish-Scots, etc., etc.).</p>
<p>The truth re de Valera's government during WWII and refugees is as follows (please see my last edit, which undoubtedly has already been rv, for citations):</p>
<p>Virtually no refugees allowed into Eire. De Valera's government even rejected a Vatican request that several hundred scientists who had "converted" to Christianity be allowed to enter Eire. It is approximated that 30 Jews found haven in Eire, and that number only due to human trafficking. This did not prevent Roman Catholic Irish-American politicians from awarding the Free State $133,000,000 USD in Marshall Plan monies (mostly in the form of low-interest loans which were never repaid).</p>

<p>Please see comment on your talk page - I wasn't amused <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 02:21, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bridesmill - I am sorry to have disappointed you earlier. I was not being "disingenuous"; I was genuinely grateful to have what I thought was an ally against a clear collusive effort by several individuals (all from Ireland) to pre-emptively censor me and to clearly be acting in collusion using boilerplate nonsense to preemptively rv anything I wrote. If I had written the Declaration of Independence Demiurge would label it "sockpuppetry". And I am not a Marshall Plan expert but according to the Marshall Plan wikipage the Plan was "to rebuild Europe".</p>
<p>So why would a neutral country which suffered no damage during the war, and which worse yet, had allowed the German embassy (in violation of the Free State's own neutrality) to possess potentially anti-Allied communications equipment until 1943(!!), and which, worse still, refused to accept more than a handful of refugees during the entire Holocaust, have been eligible for $133,000,000 worth of Marshall Plan loans, which it could never afford to repay, w/o friendly congressmen as I suggested?? I guess you know better.</p>
<p>I would like to have added (since the page is protected) to <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_de_Valera_90a6.html" title="Eamon de Valera">Eamon de Valera</a>'s page re "characteristics of Irish neutrality":</p>

<dd>You responded "I'm implying that the possibility of Hannibal=Marduk is definitely there, based on Hannibal's language, and if you WHOIS the Marduk related IPs, they are from all over the US, with some emphasis on AOL - so the different IP, though normally an indicator, in this case mean little. If that's how you read what I wrote, OK - or did my other entry totally confuse? This guy's weird, esp as he also appears to have a yahoo.fr email"</dd>

<dd>I think you should have written the above in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarthage_c7c3.html" title="Talk:Carthage">Talk:Carthage</a> page because your original text was confusing. However, I also agree that Marduk is weird and he is a bit of a troll although he does raise some valid points. My guess is that he is a Tunisian who either lives in or used to live in France. I would propose that you and Vedexent not push the Hannibal/IP issue much. Let's just get a vote in and see if we can get a consensus on a "reasonable" resolution to this issue.

<p>Well think about it, in the first sentence the article basically is stating that Frye is towering above all the other central asian scholars as unequical fact, seeing as how some people have taken issue with Frye's work I don't see how there could be consensus about this, it kinda seems both erroneus annd POV, so what is the problem with just "well known"? Why not add the comment that he is "eminent" as an opinion later in the article.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:00, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well why don't replace it with another word. I know what you mean but according to this dectionary I am looking at the first definition of "eminent" is almost the same as "pre-eminent" and "eminence". Can we change it to "widely respected" or "distinguished"?- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:20, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes my first language is English.

<p>Bro, why are you deleting the page without discussing it on the talk page? I am reverting it, and please do not make any changes without discussing it in the talk page. This article is not straight copied from the website that u are talking about but some information can be similar since there are not a lot of articles about Bibi Sakina binte Hussain on the net. Please before making any changes discuss it on the talk page like the rule says, and then if other users believe the same thing that I will not have any obligations on taking the whole article away from the wikipedia.org.</p>
<p>I am really sorry man. This user Zora is confusing me bro. I am very sorry.</p>
<p>Your rigth about the two articles for Bibi Sakina (AS). Do you know how we can merge the two articles because i don't know the process, ask striver too and where is he these day.</p>
<p>No bro, being killed and being martyred are two totally different things in Islam. That's the main reason why i don't like the word killed in the Shi’as section, that's why i keep on replacing the word killed with martyred. The word Martyred means more then what the dictionaries say about it. You’re a Muslim bro you should know the difference between being martyred and being killed.</p>
<p>In Quran, my Allah has said that people that achieve martyrdom never die. They will remain alive till the Day of Judgment but living people can not see them. Imam Hussain was, is, and will always be referred as a Martyred. Bro, I am not telling you that you can not edit in the Bibi Sakina’s (AS) article, but don’t try to change what Shi’a people believe about Hazrat Imam Hussain (AS).</p>
<p>Listen brother i don't care about what other people believe. Others can right whatever they want in the article but as far as the Shi’a section is concerned there will be things written from the point of view of the Shi'as. I mean if others won’t know what Shi’as think about Imam Hussain (AS), then what is the purpose of having a Shi'a section in the article. You know what i am trying to say. I am a Shi’a and as far as my knowledge goes Imam Hussain was, is, and will always be remembered and referred as a martyred not killed or dead person. How many times i have to say that in Islam the difference between being killed and being martyred is so different, that i cannot even tell. If you read the Holy Quran's Surah Al-Bakarah then you are going to understand the difference, where Allah has told the difference between being killed and being martyred.</p>
<p>Bro i don't understand if Shi'as believes that Imam Hussain (AS) was martyred then why are others having problem with it. I mean the Islamic history proves that too. Forget about the Shia point of view, even Sunnis believe that Imam Hussain (AS) was martyred. Bro i swear if u read the surah Al-Bakarah then you are going to understand the difference between being killed and being martyred and after that you are going to tell me that Imam Hussain (AS) and his companions were martyred at the Battle of Karbala not killed. Seriously i am just trying to say what shi'a people believe. We just don't say things about our Mola Imam Hussain (AS) just like that. And the shia section in the article is only for "what shia people think about Hazrat Imam Hussain (AS).</p>
<p>Bro i don't know why you are making a big deal out of it. I am the Shi’a section should only say what Shi’a people believe, right. I am a Shi’a and i know what we believe. We believe that Imam Hussain (AS) and his companions were martyred not killed. I mean i can even get a notice from the mosque saying that. And then if i do that and show it to the WIKIPEDIA officials then they are going to lock the editing section and no one is going to be allowed to making any addition or subtraction. I mean bro i did not change anything accept the Shi’a section in the article. Thank You <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">Salman</a></p>

<p>While I do think that Darkred has been behaving badly, you have to be careful about suggesting that he "get some help". That could be construed as a personal attack.

<p>Someday, if I ever get a job and have money, I would like to buy Indian jewelry to go with my saris. BUT ... I can't afford gold and I'm not sure I want to buy gold any longer, after all the revelations about the horrible environmental impact of goldmining.</p>
<p>What I would really like is traditional Indian jewelry re-imagined with ecologically sound metals (anodized stainless steel? aluminum?) in bright colors and complicated shapes, where the value comes from craftsmanship and imagination rather than precious metals. Is that anything you would be interested in doing? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that Indian jewelry article is terrible. But I don't know anything about Indian jewelry, really. I go to online jewelry stores and fantasize, but that's about it. I've got a lot of gorgeous, expensive jewelry books on my wish lists at Powell's and Amazon, but no prospect in the near future of being able to afford them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I make jewelry occasionally, but it's only at the stringing beads level. I do it for myself because the affordable store-boughten stuff is usually so ugly. I look at it and say, "I could do that". So I have some nice necklaces for dress-up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also buy "Ornament" magazine occasionally, and drool. Which is funny, because ordinarily I wear a plain T-shirt, plain shorts, and a pair of gold hoops that I haven't taken out in ten years or so. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:06, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I'm very sorry I'm answering you so late. The <i>rachel</i> colour, according to <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, is "a light, tannish colour (used orig. and chiefly of face-powder)" which is named after Rachel, the stage-name of Elisa Félix. I don't know exactly why, this all the information the dictionary is giving. According to the same dictionary <i>raschel</i> is "a kind of knitting-machine", from German <i>Raschelmaschine</i>, from the name of the same French actress, reportedly because she wore a garment made with this machine. That's about it. Best wishes! <a href="../../../t/a/v/User%7ETavilis_4b00.html" title="User:Tavilis">Tavilis</a> 21:54, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

It seems that s/he assumed they were the same person (see <a href="../../../h/e/n/Talk%7EHenri_Bernstein_b336.html" title="Talk:Henri Bernstein">Talk:Henri Bernstein</a>) and made it into a redirect. I should have noticed--but they were both incredibly short articles and all that needed to be translated was the bio (the original English Henri/Henry Bernstein article just listed him as being "A French person"!). Do you know of any way I can undo the redirect? I'll try for a bit but I'm not yet fluent in Wikiese.</p>

<p>Yes, the wording is much better now. However, this was an incredibly unpopular move, widely panned and dispised. Hellyer was a near pariah to anyone connected to, or supportive of, the forces. Pearson was prime minister when Hellyer produced his white paper and when the legislation was introduced in the House of Commons. But it seemed to stick to Hellyer more than anyone else. I'm not even sure it would be correct to say "the government and Hellyer." As I recall, it was just Hellyer. It would be nice to have a citation. If it is from a good source, we might even want to make the wording stronger. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 21:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, that article is unreferenced, and so full of extraneous detail as to be nigh unreadable. I did some pruning. I did it over the course of the day, based on the morning's version. There was an edit conflict and I forced my version. Sorry, but I had just done too much work to start over again. Tomorrow I'll go back and see about incorporating your newer edits. Also, I haven't done any research, really. Instead I've been working on Islamic historiography and the history of Khorezm.

<p>Hi! The reference is <i>On the Seed/Nature of the child</i> (<i>De semine/natura pueri</i>), a treatise of the <i>Hippocratic Corpus</i>. It was translated in English by Iain M. Lonie. As I found this quotation in Halperin's <i>One Hundred Years of Homosexuality</i>, I can provide you with the English translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A kinswoman of mine owned a very valuable singer, who used to go with men. It was important that this girl should not become pregnant and thereby lose her value. Now this girl had heard the sort of thing women say to each others–that when a woman is going to conceive, the seed remains inside her and does not fall out. She digested this information, and kept a watch. one day she noticed that the seed had not come out again. She told her mistress, and the story came to me. When I heard it, I told her to jump up and down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap. After she had done this no more than seven times, there was a noise, the seed fell out on the ground, and the girl looked at it in great surprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi Bridesmill! I'm not familiar with English chronology and I'm not sure I understand the issues there. I gather the problem is, French historians do not usually consider Minoan and Mycenaean Greece to be a part of "Ancient Greece", while Anglo-Saxon historians do. Am I correct? What does the expression "Classical Greece" refer to in English? <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJastrow_1ec4.html" title="User:Jastrow">Jastrow</a> 08:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hopefully this explains the issue better - we differ in descritpion of start-stop dates for the periods.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 16:14, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are some difficulties with this timeline. Traditionally, the "époque classique" begins ca. 480 (some historians do prefer 508 because of Clisthenes' reforms). Before that date, the term "Grèce préclassique" is favored: it encompasses the Cycladic civilization, Minoan Greece, Mycenaean Greece, Dark Ages (we do know about them), the "époque archaïque" (8th-6th centuries)—followed by "époque classique", "époque hellénistique" and "Grèce romaine", as mentioned on the chart. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJastrow_1ec4.html" title="User:Jastrow">Jastrow</a> 17:06, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop you nonsense on Rotary - I am not sure whether your cat got run over by a Rotarian while you where younger or what got you on this bent, but your comments a. do not make sense, as discussed - I have still to figure out why Rotarians would want to use masonry as a facade - to hide from <i>what</i>? (as but one example) b. are grammatically illegible in many cases - nobody knows what you are trying to say and you refuse to even change a single word of the gibberish. c. you do not seem to be interested in logical discussion; whenever anuyone disagrees with you, you accuse them of being Rotarian puppets and ignore them - that is not the way to move ahead. Please act reasonably; when discussed, dismissed, inaccurate, out of context, and incorrect material is repeatedly restored, <i>that</i> is vandalism and abuse.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 22:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're discussing and COMING NOW, but AFTER blanking large subparts of Rotary wiki. You should do it BEFORE blanking. Second, if you need to change or discuss, you PROPOSE. You pal AndyJones did.You did not propose anything, just insulting me or saying that I had an agenda. So do you up this : give me a personal mail please. Mine is "pierre.larcin@ifrance.com". What does my cat have with that ? You attacked my grammar. Enhance it, do not blank.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You just blanked the part about Rotary contestation of women as members. On which reason please ? You said in the RV comment "as discussed". You blanked WITHOUT discussion.</p>
<p>That's the reason why I will put a claim on wiki against you. Everyone following the history of your changes does understand what you do. You clean what you allow not to exist. It is typical of a faith syndrome. Problem : facts exist : Rotary excluded jews, Rotary members were racists and Rotary was agains women membership UNTIL A SUPREME COURT DECISION. Waow. Excuse me but what is YOUR problem. All these are facts. And you do not know what is the most evident about the Rotarian Internet proselytism (yes, being a Rotarian activist is of course relative to faith as you work more on belief than on facts). Rotary did ANOTHER big and obvious Internet wiki fiddling. Discover that in my claim.. and go back to your Rotarian friends saying: using Wikipedia as a showroom is not more possible.</p>
<p>Best regards, I wait for your mail [if you have any courage] <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 22:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly, can the personal insults. Second, read the ongoing discussion of which I have been part for quite some time. I am not about to edit every single little word you post; if you slip in a little new stuff with the large chunks of rubbish, it is going to get trashed. Your logic is fatally flawed; Almost every oganization in the world excluded women util laws changed, so why pick on Rotary. and in WWII the Nazis did not allow jews anywhere, not like Rotary could do anything about it; if anything yourwords imply they actually tried to counter the Nazi rulings. By your logic, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> page should boldly underscore that all frenchmen are Nazis and Anti-semites because of collusion in WWII. That is also a fact. Yes, I know that it was only a very small number of Frenchmen that fit that bill, but that is exactly the logic you use. If you have the courage to put that <i>fact</i> on the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> page, I will stop arguing that your Rotary posts are silly. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 22:41, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All your above text shows that you are against French. There were collusions in France, and I will CERTAINLY do it tomorrow. BUT Rotarians collaborated with Nazis, and the proof of that, is that the founder was in Germany in 1938. He planted a tree. What he did after... mystery. BUT Rotarians excluded women UNTIL the court, as they were not obliged to : they could allow women BEFORE the court judgment. Why didn't they. BUT you laugh with my poor grammar. Ok. I may not be an English-driven real man, I am some under-mensch ? I am SOME FRENCH TRAITOR OR BITCH, aren't. All your say is about hate. I do not. What you did is simply censorship, because you simply blanked BEFORE TALKING.</p>
<p>AND YOU BLANKED A SIMPLE COPY PASTE OF A ROTARIAN HIGH LEVEL MEMBER. I just copied-pasted. Didn't you notice? And I am not silly.</p>
<p>Now stop harassing me. I am not French, I am Belgian, I do not hate Americans as you hate French, I do not hate Muslims as you (probably) hate, etc.</p>
<p>a last word : All the foundation of your hate comes from your communalism. You belong to a community which relies on faith, belief in a particular way of life etc. This spirit is against the Republic. This spirit sends boys to die in another country for values that are not respected in their own country, but in reality for a Rotarian value : money. Your hate is communalist and Rotarian : it destroys the Republic and it is done for money, or the representation you have of money.</p>
<p>These are facts : Rotarian excluded jews. Rotarian use the polio program to promote themselves. Rotarians use Internet and wiki to promote themselves. They did not allow women before late 1990's. AND ALL the politicians they support are ALL conservative, like Pinochet or Dianne Feinstein. SOME of these politicians are event racists.</p>
<p>Do not blame me. I did not mention that 90% of US and Canadian Rotarian executives are white. In a country of non-segregation, this is ... strange. How much women in Rotary executives ? In a country were 55% of the people are women ? Do you know why I did not mention that ? I have no fiable source. But just see pictures. The RI Governor of Botwana was a women... but white. Strange, not ?</p>
<p>I wait for your mail. You know mine. Pierre Larcin</p>

<p>I changed the France page and added most of my knowledge, including antisemitic behaviors. SO WHAT ? I still wait for your eMail. Be courageous. By the way I liked the supern trio you made with the Copenhagen IP, AndyJones and you. Do you think we are stupid on Wikipedia ? <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 18:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I stated " the France page should boldly underscore that all frenchmen are Nazis and Anti-semites because of collusion in WWII. ". You did not do that, nor do I expect you to be that silly; proof of the pudding that your logic for Rotary is fundamentally flawed. Who is "Copenhagen IP?" And Andy and I only ever met here at this article.... When you say 'do you think we are stupid on Wiki", I am very curious here, most of us are active broadly - the only thing you do here is disturb Rotary pages. I'm also not sure what you mean by 'still wait for your email' - I answered you on your page, as you know, in fact, I tried to email you, but you don't have an email registered on wiki - curious. I am <i>not</i> waiting for a response, as this trolling is getting tedious. Just leave WP alone please, unless you are willing to engage in normal wiki behaviour.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 19:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You just avoid to mail me normally (you prefer to use wiki anonymous facilities) because there is some danger to link you to rotary. By the Way Dianne Feinstein IS conservative, DESPITE she is registered at the Democratic Party. So what ? Is democratic party on the left ? Serious ? You're kidding ! A last word : remember : I promissed you a claim on wiki : an RfC and an arbitration. So... everyone will be judge about Rotarian activity on wiki ! A last example : the copenhagen IP added something about a communication at the actual RI convention 2006 in Copenhagen, about the virus polio. Did you blank it ? No ! And there is noWhere a justification of tha communication. Did I censure it ? No... Did I blank positive assertions on Rotary ? No... but you blanked negative things. You are... partial and communalist. I hope that wikipedians will give you a serious warning. so... Bye and stop harassing me. It is difficult for me to manage all your changes, and you know it perfectly. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 19:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's the problem with communalism : the communalist adapt reality to its vision, and he/she does not see the reality anymore. This way, I explain the violence of communalists, -like you-, who want to force people to adopt their "visions", using violence if necessary. So the violence of religious wars, as the war in Irak, both sides. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 22:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well the problem is that you ACT as a Rotarian. You next add is "an example of successfull change of the inside". What does it mean for a text if you are NOT a Rotarian ? Which success ? The Rotarian lawyer said '"…[the decision] threatens to force us to take in everyone, like a motel'. Do you think it is an elegant inside success, specially associating women with a motel ? After about three full blanks on my chapters, you are now enhancing them ! And ---'I'---- am violent ? You say ABOVE that I speak of a wacko conspiracy. How can you say that after about ONE MONTH OF SUPPLEMENTARY TEDIOUS WORK that you gave us ? May I know what you did that ? Because of our poor English grammar, we stupid French traitors ? That's it ? And you accused us between the lines, and specially me -mu friend being translator- to hide that French were hiding antisemistic crimes in their history ?</dd>

<p>WHY SHOULD WE HIDE THAT A TRIAL WAS NECESSARY FOR WOMEN, THAT SOME FAMOUS ROTARIANS ARE PINOCHET OR HELMS, THAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN IS A REAL CONSERVATIVE, DEEP RIGHT POLITICIAN, AND THAT THE ROTARY USE THE HELP TO SICKNESS IN THE THIRLD WORLD TO PROMOTE CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS...

<p>Hiya, I noticed you deleted the majority of the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinafore_eroticism.html" title="Pinafore eroticism">Pinafore eroticism</a> article in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinafore_eroticism&amp;diff=58273066&amp;oldid=58259402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinafore_eroticism&amp;diff=58273066&amp;oldid=58259402" rel="nofollow">series of edits</a> all marked as minor. I took a look at your contributions and get the feeling you have a "mark all edits as minor" default set in your preferences. You might want to unset that, or take the time to de-select "mark as minor" when making large scale deletions.

<p>About wiki, you know, I am not really afraid they will take your arguments as relevant... Another fact ? We do not know what did the founder, Paul Harris, between 1938 and 1946. Why ? Strange.</p>
<p>Another thing is : You do not use the same system for "positive" thing on wiki. Many things are not verifiable, but you leave them. You are partial and you give me pain. You give us pain because you do not respect the truth.</p>
<p>You give us pain You give us pain You give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us painYou give us pain.</p>

<p>Stop wikipedia fiddling. If females are just members like others in the Rotary, there is no reason to add a distinct paragraph for women. An equilibrated way ? If you place a section "female membership" then you should place a section "male membership". But you can't :-) It is simply impossible : all Famous Rotarians are men !(exept Dianne Feinstein, but... ;-)</p>
<p><br />
Plus you completely fade to grey the aspect of Inner Wheel . We have things to add about Innner Wheel and what you do is to impeach that by continuous reverts. Let us do our work, which is just mention of facts, and stop your Wikipedia fiddling : women WERE NOT welcome in Rotary until years 1970. Strange for a "serving community" club. But you do not answer to that, do you ? With a "profile of Mensanean"....</p>
<p>You are CERTAINLY rotarian or pro-rotarian. And your duo with SuperNova is interesting. Just interesting for our community.</p>
<p>Why don't you admit ? We are her both against-Rotary, WE SAY IT, BUT I DO NOT BLANK OR ALTER POSITIVE FACTS ABOUT ROTARY. 84.102.229.124 07:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 07:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And above all : you are racist against French. You said that in your above critics. That's the first step to war. You should be ashamed to speak about Mensa in your profile You GIVE US PAIN. Stop continous reverts.</p>

<p>What does "despite for example, there were allowed to vote in France in Belgium in 1921 only" mean? and why was it placed in there with a {fact} tag? I am assuming you invented that after my comment on suffrage in Belgium, which has nothing to do with RI. And why do you insist on re-inserting bogus quotes? And why are we talking about cultural habits in other parts of the world that RI (may) happen to follow there, without mentioning that this is a cultural norm? And once again, what do you have against RI?<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 19:01, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We work here on an International movement Bridesmill. And a movement which defines itself as philanthropic. All facts show that is a public-relations club who supports only conservative actions. The proximity of extreme-right or racism, whose Rotary sustained notable members by its program of "Honorary Rotarians" shows it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Plus what they DID about the Famous Rotarians... that they changed AFTER the wiki sourcing of the URL where all Famous Rotarians were, included Pinochet. As you did : you moved Pinochet in the alphabetical list, they removed Pinochet from the URL and they placed a second page with only the Honorary Famous.</p>
<p>It was humor Bridesmill. You placed <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> tag on our edits immediately, asking for sources but never sourced positive addings (the International Congress by Bruce?? speech on Polio these days) but always put on ourse, and you and Supernova (you never restaured what she illegally withdrawed) ever withdrawed what was not IMMEDIATELY sourced.</p>
<p>We know perfectly that all that fiddling is justified by this International Congress held in june 12-14 ? in Copenhagen. Of course Internet was a subject there, no doubt. And of course, as Rotary goes to schools, as year ends, of course scholars need to read "soften" wiki on Rotary, isn't it ?</p>
<p>Now it is over Bridesmill. We just put a Wiki Request for Comments about all this, a few minutes ago. We spent more that 30 minutes today to find out what you Bridesmill and SuperNova blanked since one day. We have no time for that AND it is difficult for both of us to retrieve info, take care of what was added [we do not censure], and replace what you faded, truncated or changed, smoothed. We have plenty of source facts, questions, etc, and we hope that the community will help us to put light onto this. The official claim for arbitration against Rotary wiki fiddling will be put in a few hours.

<p>Specially we DO NOT appreciate that you modified OUR text WITHOUT warning us.</p>
<p>Thank you also for the "Rotarian plot parano" image glued onto our face. We love. Two remarks - related to the recent RI congress in Copenhagen-Malmo, what does the Sweden flag onto the part "must go to" on your spouse personal page ? So you're not pro-Rotarian hé ? - ... because YOU BridesMill spoke about a plot when altering our RfC : we have a very bizarre idea of what a "organized official information agency" can make with such a HUGE amount of pictures and professional bios of Rotarian people registered around the world. Rotarians fill personal forms no ? Some rotarians should maybe be amazed that they have an "alias" doing dirty trick elsewhere in the world, no ? You do not see ? With all the langages you speak, including russian, you never read spy stories ?

<p>Hi Bridesmill.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am one of the pioneers of this subject and actually invented and sell anal bleaching products. So it is real and I would like to discuss with you the best way to update information on this site without being classified as spamming. I wrote the original article on Crappers Quarterly. There is important information on this topic that needs to be understood. Your information on hydroquinone is dangerous. Nobody should use hydroquinone on their anus or genital areas. I think my company information and the other information I posted is very relevant to this topic but I want to conform to the rules of the site.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me offline at info@southbeachskinsolutions.com. Thank you.</p>

<p>Sigh. This has been a dispute going on for a while. Basically, for the first three years of the project, internal links to articles on individual years were linked from other articles where that year was mentioned. They were useful for placing events in the context of their broader society, and were often used in browsing by myself and many others. Then one obsessive user with a bot decided he hated them, and proceeded to spend every single day expunging as many as possible, and a couple more jumped on the bandwagon. We then had a lengthy discussion about it, with the ultimate result being that a) there really isn't much consensus on the topic, and b) automated date removal is bad. Everyone else who was delinking thus stopped - except for the user at the heart of all of this, who didn't even bother to participate at all, but just fired up his bot again after it was all over. And that's basically where we are today. Every couple of months, he thinks people will have forgotten about the issue, fires up his bot, gets reverted and yelled at, and stops again. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:16, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry; I didn't mean to be condescending. I am trying to be accurate, to the best of my ability. As for "mixing metaphors," I can only say that the major sources (Apel, Hiley, the Grove) all refer to "B-flat" despite its anachronism. I certainly don't think it's "my" article; Antandrus, Makemi, and MarkBuckles have all contributed to it. Please don't let my personal failings get in the way of improving the article, which I hope we can achieve by discussion rather than hostility. If I've been rude, I apologize. I wouldn't worry about FA status, though, since it's pretty obvious it's going to fail.

<p>I am flummoxed by this anon editor who keeps reverting to a version of the article that has a {{fact}} tag after practically every sentence. I would like to find a way to resolve this issue peaceably and in an Esperanza-like way. Unfortunately, I've been busy and all I've had time to do is to revert the anon editor's reverts. Other editors (registered and anon) have also done the same which has helped me to avoid a revert war with this anon editor.

<p>I am maybe blind, but I do not SEE where and how you (so-called?) "explained there why it is not". Would you ve so kind to re-explain them ?? :-) My arguments are simple : these guys are placed on Internet as people who gave conferences in front of Rotary clubs in the world. You said "have no grounds for disagreeing with me." Well I DISAGREE with you blanked four times that as for the moment 1/ you gave no reasons to blank that 2/ that's info on people giving conferences in front and of course with the agreement of the Rotary.

<p>- Dear BridesMill - - 01:42, 15 July 2006 you have edited the Rotary wiki to add - this - - *** Minority membership **** - - While formerly a "bastion...of the straight male world". Rotary and other service clubs in the last decade of the 20th century became open to gay and lesbian membership.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Other minorities, in the face of general changes in demographics and declining membership, are also encouraged to join, but these demographics show little interest in spite of efforts to reach out to minority communities; such as Oakland California's $10,000 scholarships for students in inner-city schools<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. There have been some individual exceptins; as early as 1963 a Hindu Bengali, Nitish Chandra Laharry, served as Rotary International's first Asian president<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The past tendency to favor the "old boys club" has also passed; so it is no longer just legislation or membership pressures driving these trends; according to Fost, only 2% of middle aged men interested in joning a club were interested in joining exclusive male-only clubs. - ********************************** - You Bridesmill based these clues on the following bibliography references - - # ^ Quittner, Jeremy. "Join the Club." Advocate, 4/16/2002, Issue 861 - # ^ Fost Dan. "Farewell to the Lodge." American Demographics January 1996, Vol. 18, Issue 18 (NOTE THAT YOU DO NOT GIVE THE PAGE REFERENCE) - # ^ Bird,, John "The Wonderful, Wide, Backslapping World Of Rotary." Saturday Evening Post 2/9/1963, Vol. 236 Issue 5, p59 - ********************************** - My problem is that I have a speech of Pinochet at the Santiago Rotary Club, - plus a scientific reading here of 800 pages, which show that Rotary is not EXACTLY - open to gays. - - As I do not find any clue of these readings on my Google, I have a few questions : - * 1/ what tool did you use to find these references - * 2/ where on Internet may we check these references - * 3/ if possible, I would like you to send me a copy of these articles and will pay for that. - * 4/ it is precised, reference by reference, that the author is a Rotarian, or not. - As you may read above, the problem is that only Rotary speaks over Rotary so we have a deep risk of Wikipedia fiddling ! - - If you do not answer within two days, I will suppress the references and addings you did, as not sourced. - * And of course we will discuss that in front of the Arbitration Committee ;-) - I suppose that you have the same interest as me that Wikipedia is not a showroom for the Rotary. - - Thank you, - best regards, - <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 08:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC) - - == Famous Conferencemakers in the Rotary - Blanking by Bridesmill == - - Bridesmill, you have four times blanked the following list -that we built and made after reserarches on Internet - and you did it without any explanations. You did that on : - * 14 JUN 16:19 - * 15 JUL 16:00 - * 15 JUL 16:10 - * 15 JUL 16:33 - - Famous conferencemakers at the Rotary - * Augusto Pinochet, member of the Rotary club of Santiago, Chile - * Joseph Davidovits, Docteur es Science, "father of the theory of false stones" about building of the egyption ancient pyramids (Rotary Club Liège, BE) - * Louis Michel, Belgian European Commissary (Rotary Club Wezembeek-Kraainem, BE) - * Charles Pasqua, former French Minister of Police, involved in weapons and Saddam iraki petrol scandals (Rotary Club Neuilly, FR) - * Ron Hubbard, founder of the Scientology (Rotary ex-Rhodésia, Zimbabwe) - * Wernher von Braun, ex-major of the nazi SS, father of V1, V2, Titan II missile and Saturn rockets for the NASA (Rotary Club Huntsville, Alabama, USA) - - Please would you clarify hereunder why you blanked that list - Without valid reason of your behavior within 24 hours, I will restore that for the FIFTH time on the - wiki on Rotary. - <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 10:55, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>PL, Please READ what I have written. The sources are pointed out, as is the logic and the flaws in your logic. Respond to this, discuss it, but please don't ignore it.

<p>And erhaps you could share with us the source of this 800 page academic work, as I have not been able to locate any academic works approaching that size about any service clubs. The point on Pinochet's speech has been made above; politicians make speeches everywhere, sometimes those speeches do not reflect their party, or the group they are speeaking to. And this speech was made some time ago, no? I noted " formerly a <i>"bastion...of the straight male world". "</i> as well as <i>past tendency to favor the "old boys club"</i> - I believe that properly provides context for where this club came from? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 14:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My source are verifiable. Yours are not as I and others may not access to that. I want that wiki community be able to check if these pro-rotarian texts were, or not, written by Rotarians. We may not admit that Rotary writes on Rotary on wiki. Again, this is not a showroom</dd>

<p>The main problem is Rotary fiddling over Rotary wiki. Or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, you do not answer to the question : why did you blanked the conferencemakers list ?</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not translate "dictablanda", you speak of bias and non-sourced (despite all my adding are sourced and verifiable), but you leave non-sources facts (speech by Rotarian over polio) when they are pro-Rotary. And you use a bia : now again, you ask to block me. On which base ? I did not blank anything.... So, again, BE SO KIND TO ANSWER TO THIS SIMPLE QUESTION : why did you blanked four times the Famous Conferencemakers (with Ron Hubbard, now Pinochet and Wernher von Braun). I checked this whole mess you did (usually you "derive" the conversation... we come from grammar to contexts; from segregation to controversy, you change the order of phrases to smooth Rotary past.., here we come to a simple args request to a bia for blocking...) Do not hesitate to use copy paste : I really want to know your justifcations for blanking this list. Be kind ! Waste time ! Say us WHY ! Answer simply !

<p>I don't know how many times and in how many ways I have explained that such a list is cherry-picking, wholly inapropriate, and in many cases logically flawed (attributional bias etc). One reason, one solid reason is all it needs not to be there. Now who is talking about blanking and modifying Talk pages? You, Sir, need to go away for a few days.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 14:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not blank any TalkPage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1/ On Rotary International, I placed another way, a bit at the right side, to keep your "blocking request against me" apart and keep the thread : my question : give your args for blanking the list of Rotary conferencemakers. Indeed you bia "we speak about the blanking, I do not answer to the question, I ask you to block that guy".</li>
<li>About the main question (four times you blanked the list of conferencemakers), you still do not answer. Inappropriate is not an argument. It is your POV. Where do you see bias ? Conference is done by invitation so of course that Rotarian knows who is giving the conference. "it needs not to be there", again, is POV and not an argument.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2/ On YOUR talk page, I RESTORED MY QUESTION ABOUT YOUR SOURCE ON SO CALLED TOLERANCE ON GAY MINORITIES AND "COLOUR" (read "non white") IN THE ROTARY. you blanked that also, as this question was a problem for you. Please keep it : it is a question I need an answer : I would like you to say un where we can check</li>
<li>1 what you placed : Rotary should recognize sexual or race minorities? Is is true ? May we check the text ?</li>
<li>2 that these pro-rotary texts are, whether or not, written by Rotarians.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main point is again, that Rotary or pro-Rotary do not write things on Rotary and give themselves the role of judges on what MAY or not BE WRITTEN on the Rotary wiki. As indeed Rotarians come on the Rotary wiki. Of course. We are not a propaganda media. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">PierreLarcin2</a> 15:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Stop modifying this page to hide remarks and requests. You have not even told us what this verifiable source is.

<p>You did it and you alone, hiding my question on your talk page as I want to know if 1/ 2/ we may check your source saying 'Rotary is gay tolerant' 3/ we may check your source saying "Rotary speaking women changed life of women in these countries". You still not say what it change, where, who spoke and if the source was Rotarian. As usual, you play with our feet.</p>
<p>I and only I remarked that a reference of yours, was not paged. Again you play with our feet. Second you claim that you are first to document, but it has been THREE MONTHES THAT YOU EDIT-WAR, without any source, and all my addings were sourced, and Interned checkable sourced. YOUR documents MAY not be checked. I ASK YOU THE WAY TO CHECK THAT. WERE DID YOU FIND THAT. HOW CAN WIKIPEDIANS CHECK THAT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Last, I do not have to give my source, as I still not used that on wiki. AGAIN, you play with my feet, playing like an boy in a school ('well I am first') just to bring that on the personal ground and claim "hey he attacks me personnally".</li>
</ul>
<p>Again your addings on so-called gay tolerance and asian tolerance in Rotary are still not verifiable and sourced.

<dd>OKay, let's stop your game. First, your last chapter will be removed by me and splitted</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<p>by me into the appropriate chapters : Phrase on Evening post in sourcing, phrase on MAnn in Mann chapter, TRY ALSO NOT TO INSULT ME like "shut up" "or put up". Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/ You use personal attacks [saying that I do not original research and that Mann is a token for me], and as usual you do not answer to the question : how by Christ can we verigy ONLINE your sources ? And you mix that with questions of Thomas mann, My academic document. This whole messy approach is completely opposite to what I can wait from a self called Mensanean. Be scientific.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>2/ We will stop your way to mix all. So I warn you : you transformed this Talk in a whole mess with your war. The above Bridesmill chapter will be removed by me. You place your comments into the appropriate chapters. For example you have a chapter above for Mann. Place your comments into this. and I will open a chapter for sourcing, including mine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3/ please answer clearly to the question of blanking conferencemakers. You still did not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4/ I want to request a mediation for introducting the following chapters : Internet activities of Rotarians, support from Rotary to conservative politicians, the perception of Pinochet in an out the Rotary, the segregation (or not) of women by the Rotary, segregation of minorities in the Rotarian executives, a list of persons who gave and give conferences to the Rotary, the use of Thomas mann as a token for Rotary [I do not understand the word token but you used it, so I place that word].</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to have a mediation also on the checkable sources about the Rotary, including my doctoral these and yourse, of course. This verifiability is a condition for the Arbitration we try plan here to ask on the use of Wikipedia by the Rotary.</p>
<ul>
<li>DO YOU AGREE ON THAT MEDIATION Bridesmill ?</li>
<li>Without clear answer "yes I accept a mediation", we consider here you say "no"</li>

I think you're in for the long haul on that one.

<p>I just wanted to thank extremely for all your valuable work on the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery.html" title="Jewellery">Jewellery</a> article. In my absence of editing on the article, you have made leaps &amp; bounds towards getting it to FAC. My nomination to get it into Version 0.5 went through &amp; it is now an A-class. Without your help it would still be only half complete. In response to all this, I have now nominated the article again, as I think with I can deal with any further objections unlike last time. Hope you can support. :) Thanks a bunch! <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 11:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
