	    <p><b>Britain's Real Monarch</b> was an historical documentary presented by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Robinson_f690.html" title="Tony Robinson">Tony Robinson</a> shown on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and again on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.<a href="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/monarch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/monarch.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This documentary presented evidence that the present monarch, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>, does not have a valid claim to the throne that she has occupied since 1952. This theory is based on the assumption that a legitimate claimant to the English throne must be descended from <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> (1154-1189) in an unbroken line of descent in which all members were born legitimately, that is, their parents were married at the time of their birth. If a line of descent passes through someone who was born out of wedlock then no descendant of that person has a legitimate claim to the throne.</p>
<p>The program based its claim on the theory that <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_IV_of_England_a1fe.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV</a> was illegitimate, and therefore as his direct heir, Elizabeth has no rightful claim either.</p>

<p>Although she was later known for her piety as well as her pride, it was rumoured at the time that, in the summer of 1441, Edward's mother, <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecily_Neville_9bdc.html" title="Cecily Neville">Cecily Neville</a> had an affair with an English archer named Blaybourne based in the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a> garrison in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> while her husband was elsewhere in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> fighting.</p>
<p>In the documentary, Dr Michael Jones revealed previously overlooked evidence from <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen_Cathedral_7190.html" title="Rouen Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>, discovered while researching the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years%27_War_fd8c.html" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a>. In the cathedral register, an entry in 1441 records that the clergy were paid for a sermon for the safety of the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Plantagenet%2C_3rd_Duke_of_York_4dc1.html" title="Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York">Duke of York</a>, going to <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontoise.html" title="Pontoise">Pontoise</a> (near <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>) on campaign. He would have been on campaign from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/4/1441.html" title="1441">1441</a>, several days' march from Rouen.</p>
<p>If a child with a claim to the throne was born small or sickly it would normally have been recorded, and there is apparently no such record; consequently, proponents of the theory of illegitimacy claim it is likely that Edward was not born prematurely. By calculating back from Edward's birth on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">April 28</a>, it seems apparent that Richard was not present at the time of Edward's conception around the first week of August 1441.</p>
<p>Edward was tall and (unlike his younger brother <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard of Gloucester</a>) did not resemble his father, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Plantagenet%2C_3rd_Duke_of_York_4dc1.html" title="Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York">Richard of York</a>, in physical appearance.</p>
<p>According to research by Dr Michael Jones based on documents in <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen_Cathedral_7190.html" title="Rouen Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>, there was a 5-week period when Richard was 100 miles away from his wife, leading a military campaign against the French, during which Edward was conceived Thus, Richard could not have been Edward's father, and so Edward's parents were not married at the time of his birth. Therefore, Edward IV had no legitimate claim to the English throne, and so none of his descendants, including the present Queen, have had either. Additionally, the cathedral records reveal that Edward's <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christening.html" title="Christening">christening</a> took place in private in a side chapel, whereas for the christening of Richard's second son the whole cathedral was used for a huge celebration, again suggesting to proponents of the theory that Edward was indeed illegitimate, although in spite of this, the Duke never disclaimed his paternity of his wife's eldest son.</p>
<p>Some historians have raised the criticism that it is logistically possible for Richard Duke of York to have returned briefly from battle to Rouen because often military leaders led their forces from the rear.</p>
<p>According to Dominic Mancini, an Italian visitor to London in 1464, Cecily Neville 'fell into a frenzy' at the news of the marriage of her eldest surviving son Edward to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Woodville_044e.html" title="Elizabeth Woodville">Elizabeth Woodville</a> and, in her rage, made the astounding accusation that he was a bastard, adding that she would be prepared to testify before a public enquiry that this was indeed the case.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain%27s_Real_Monarch_65ea.html" title="Edit section: An alternative heir?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">An alternative heir?</span></h2>
<p>Dr Jones argues that, if it were true that Edward IV was illegitimate, this would have invalidated his claim to the throne of England thus rendering the existing royal family path as illegitimate. Tony Robinson asked the question: if the succession of kings and queens from Edward IV to Elizabeth II is illegitimate, is there an alternative, legitimate line of descent? And if so, has it persisted to the present day?</p>
<p>He traced the descendants of Richard and Cecily's second son, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Plantagenet%2C_1st_Duke_of_Clarence_b9d4.html" title="George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence">George, Duke of Clarence</a>, down to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Abney-Hastings%2C_14th_Earl_of_Loudoun_99d4.html" title="Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun">Michael Hastings</a> (born 1942), who emigrated to Australia in 1960, married, fathered five children, and currently lives in Jerilderie, New South Wales. Since the line of descent from Henry II to Hastings is <a href="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/monarchtree.html" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/monarchtree.html" rel="nofollow">legitimate</a>, and the line of descent from Henry II to Elizabeth II is not, Robinson claims that it follows that Hastings is Britain's legitimate king, and the present occupant of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> has no valid claim to be Queen.</p>
<p><a name="Problems_with_the_theory" id="Problems_with_the_theory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain%27s_Real_Monarch_65ea.html" title="Edit section: Problems with the theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Problems with the theory</span></h2>
<p>Though an interesting exercise in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_history.html" title="Alternative history">alternative history</a>, there are many problems with the theory. The question of whether Edward was illegitimate had been widespread in historical circles for many years before the documentary aired, and no decisive conclusion has ever been reached. Furthermore, under English law, the child of a married woman is automatically considered the child of her husband unless he is disclaimed at birth. Since Richard did not do this, Edward remained his legal son and heir, whether or not he was actually Richard's biological son.</p>
<p>It has also been pointed out that George, Duke of Clarence and his heirs could not have succeeded to the throne of England, principally as they were barred from the throne by Parliament under a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_Attainder_269a.html" title="Bill of Attainder">Bill of Attainder</a>, and only another Act of Parliament could ever rescind this. Indeed, it was only this exclusion of George's descendants that allowed Richard III to ascend the throne, and after the death of his son <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_of_Middleham%2C_Prince_of_Wales_85a5.html" title="Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales">Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales</a>, Richard considered his nephew <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_de_la_Pole%2C_Earl_of_Lincoln_84a8.html" title="John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln">John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln</a>, to be his heir, again excluding the Clarence branch. In the absence of an Act reversing the attainder, the Plantagenet-Hastings line were in the same situation as the male Stuart line after the overthrow of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James II of England</a> with no legal avenue to the throne short of conquest. Supporters of the Hastings claim counter-argue that as Edward IV was not the legitimate king, the attainder passed by his Parliament and given the Royal Assent by him had no legal validity.</p>
<p>Moreover, though the theory is that the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_the_British_Throne_02e1.html" title="Succession to the British Throne">line of succession</a> should be linear and unbroken, the historical reality is that the 'rightful' heir to the throne tends to be the person who is crowned and has the strength to hold on to it. The succession to the English crown has been muddied many times over the years, and quite often, the next in succession was not the one crowned king. One might just as well argue that no monarch has been legitimate since <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Godwinson_e9f3.html" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a> was usurped by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a>, in which case Hastings would have no better claim to the throne than Elizabeth. Other examples of the rightful next in line not taking the throne include <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_IV_of_England_6f6d.html" title="Henry IV of England">Henry Bolingbroke</a> (usurping the rightful <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_II_of_England_5f00.html" title="Richard II of England">Richard II</a>); <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry Tudor</a> (usurping Richard III, who in turn had usurped <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_V_of_England_99e4.html" title="Edward V of England">Edward V</a>); <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_and_Mary_edbe.html" title="William and Mary">William of Orange</a>, who took the crown in the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_of_1688.html" title="Revolution of 1688">Glorious Revolution</a>; or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_Great_Britain_5447.html" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a>, who was about fortieth in line to the crown, but was invited to become king since the 1701 <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Settlement_1701_8dbd.html" title="Act of Settlement 1701">Act of Settlement</a> decreed that no Catholics could take the throne.</p>
