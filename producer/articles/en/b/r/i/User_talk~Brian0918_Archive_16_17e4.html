<p>I was just about to leave a message at Raul's talk page to thank him for the work he did in closing my recent RfA. Having read your comments at Raul's, I thought it only appropriate to come here first, and thank you for showing such strong support for my nomination. I wish to assure you that anything I do in my capacity as an administrator, will be for the benifit of the Wikipedia, rather than myself. I agree fully with your assesment that WP is a reference work first, community second. The resource must be protected. If I can help do that, then I will have fully met the mandate I set myself as an admin. Thank you for your support, I will do what I can to live up to the high standards I have come to expect from the majority of WP administration! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 02:45, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you are back to tagging articles. <b>Thank you for compromising and agreeing to place them at the bottom of articles.</b> One idea, is that perhaps before bugging others to reference their contributions you could go through your own articles and bring them up to standard. A quick check of the first ten items at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_Articles_created_a14f.html" title="User:Brian0918/Articles created">User:Brian0918/Articles created</a> found that only one of them had a references section. If every major contributor simply went through their own contributions and added any references they remembered using, we would be a great deal closer to our goal of a well referenced encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:29, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So who or what is going to motivate you to add references to your articles? What needs to be done to get <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zork_Timeline_ab14.html" title="Zork Timeline">Zork Timeline</a> referenced? Also what about <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Malling_and_Larkfield_d521.html" title="East Malling and Larkfield">East Malling and Larkfield</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowdeswell.html" title="Dowdeswell">Dowdeswell</a>, and <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cess%2C_Norfolk_a61d.html" title="Cess, Norfolk">Cess, Norfolk</a>?

<p>You have <b>repeatedly</b> been asked by users to stop adding the unsourced link to articles and place it on talk pages. You have ignored everyone else and bulldozed ahead. If you don't stop I'll simply revert every one.

<p>I've got to echo these other editors, there is no method to your add cites madness.

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but "everyone else" is not against me. Of the people who were against what I was originally doing, the majority were against my specifically placing it at the top of pages, going against what it says at {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}. In accordance with their concerns, I have stopped this activity. Others were against my placing it on pages that had external links. In accordance with their concerns, I have stopped that as well. Instead, I have created custom block of text, shown at the top of <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_Sandbox_b2f3.html" title="User:Brian0918/Sandbox">User:Brian0918/Sandbox</a>, which will go at the bottom of the page, exactly in accordance with the guidelines at {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a>}}. Since I have started following these guidelines, <i>you</i> are the only who has complained. As for reverting my edits, there must be something more productive that you could do for the encyclopedia. If you would like to discuss it further, let me know. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-4 02:47</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Brian, how many people are going to have to complain before you listen? I agree 100% with the need for citations. But as everyone has told you, the way you are doing it is counterproductive. Even those agreeing with the aim of what you are doing disapprove of <i>how</i> you are doing. If you place the link on the talk pages then it will be seen by contributors and each article will be linked in a category so people can go around fixing it. But putting that template on the article simply is not on. You may have misinterpreted people's criticism of you placing it on the top of the page as meaning it was the location on the page that was the problem. The problem is the <i>page</i> you are putting it on. If you really wish to put a template on each page then design a new template that casts less implications than the one you are using now, which basically says "this article is not trustworthy". <i>That</i> is what is annoying people. Again I stress I <b>agree</b> with getting proper citing. But how you are doing is an own goal. It is heavy handed and turns what should be a simple issue of the need for citations into an appearance that you are leaving a message on articles saying "this article is could well be bullshit because the fucking ejjits who wrote it never put their citations in." Please stop it before you create a complete backlash that so annoys people they deliberately won't put in citations because they think you are trying to bully them into it. There are two ways of doing this, and you have chosen the route that is more likely to create resistence, not compliance. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 03:00, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no consensus yet about where it should be placed. According to the straw poll, though, more people are in favor of it being on the article page, not on the talk page. In any case, "no consensus" means "no preferred method", so either method is acceptable. Using the rollback button to revert non-vandalism is not acceptable. Reverting my work is also not acceptable, unless you then proceed to move my content to the talk page, which is fine. But it seems like quite a waste of your time. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-4 03:04</small></li>
<li>It's simple. Which of the following guidelines am I breaking? Please tell me, and I will change my ways.
<ul>
<li>This template will categorise tagged articles into <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_lacking_sources_5f50.html" title="Category:Articles lacking sources">Category:Articles lacking sources</a>.</li>
<li>This <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_4fbd.html" title="Wikipedia:Template">template</a> is a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">self-reference</a>.</li>

<li>I also disagree completely with your knee-jerk reaction; I don't think this backlash will occur, and indeed I've seen the opposite. In the three articles I've checked where I had placed this template, their contributors have since added references. So, it would seem the opposite is happening. Do you have any evidence that this template will cause people to purposely violate policies and guidelines, or that I am using a hostile tone in the articles I add it to? — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-4 03:13</small></li>

<p>Hi Brian, I would very much appreciate your input in the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Canberra#Image_additions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Canberra#Image_additions" rel="nofollow">argument</a>. There seems to be a gang of users unwilling to allow anyone to interfere with there Canberra project without invitation. It was risky to take my camera on our school excursion to Canberra, but I did for the sake of the photos I could upload to Wiki. Needless to say, I'm deeply distressed over the reaction that has taken place. In particular, I would like to ask if the removal of <i>all</i> my photos off the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Burley_Griffin_3466.html" title="Lake Burley Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a> article was a step forward in the usefullness of the page.

<p>Just as a heads up, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazil4Linux_1d12.html" title="User:Brazil4Linux">Brazil4Linux</a> seems to be just as guilty of pushing POV as he claims <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldDragon_0042.html" title="User:GoldDragon">GoldDragon</a> is. One of the comments Brazil4Linux takes issue with is this:</p>
<p><i>With Kutaragi, Sony Computer Entertainment loss $25 million in Q4 of 2004. During that same year, Sony’s game sales fell to $7.5 billion from $8.2 billion, and its operating income slid to $650 million from $1 billion</i></p>
<p>Not only is that quote sourced in the original <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Kutagari_78db.html" title="Ken Kutagari">Ken Kutagari</a> article, it's an exact quote from the source. Source is <a href="http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14543&amp;hed=Xbox+360+Heads+New+Console+War" class="external text" title="http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14543&amp;hed=Xbox+360+Heads+New+Console+War" rel="nofollow">here.</a> The quote comes from the 11th paragraph (the 3rd pargraph under the "Gaming 101" section). Source looks reliable, but Brazil4Linux keeps removing it saying it's bogus.</p>

<p>Sorted. I have been adding extlinks to the source for all these, and seems to have missed one. Do you think that "according to the 2001 census" is sufficient for parish population counts or do I need to provide greater detail?</p>

<p>I think the really hard bit (not just hectoring people to include sources as they should), will be to provide sources for articles that are long and comprehensive. Encouraging people to do this is somewhat harder and probably requires leading by example. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morwen.html" title="Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 20:20, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assume by now that you are aware that a full blown civil war is being (verbally) fought over when to put Christmas and the Omnipotence Pardox on the main page. I lew of this I suggest that we as a community adopt some sort policy about the timing of articles so as to aviod such a problem in the future.

<dd>Just because a discussion is long doesn't mean it is a "war" and people are "fighting", so please don't characterize it as such. You have only replied once to the discussion, so I am in doubt that you have read any of it, since your only comment was to compare it to featuring <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> on Hannukah, thus fulfilling <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>.

<p>You are right. This is not a war, it is more of a debate. In a broad sense, a debate or war is merely several people disagreeing on a course of action to take. You are also correct in assuming that I, having left only one comment, have not read much of the preceeding discussion. Naturally, a discision of what to feature on the main page for December 25 must be made; when that happens we will see what Raul654 has decided to go with. At that time, I am suggesting that his descion and the rational behind it become a factor in choosing the article for the main page. On that note I apologize for having upset you. I will refrain from commenting on the either of the articles' main page nominations; this should allow more capable Users (such as youself) to to focus on the issue without having interference from annoying idiots like me.

<p>In reply to your "Brilliant work! You fooled the community twice over! We are way too trusting&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, maybe too trusting. But in my defence I did ask for these articles to be put up on AfD the proper way. I guess Redwolf24 was too hasty in believing me. And I wasn't meaning to fool the community twice over (once over, yeah, ok, I'll admit that). I was trying to do the "right thing". --<a href="../../../w/o/n/User%7EWonderfool_9100.html" title="User:Wonderfool">Wonderfool</a> 22:23, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
