<p>In 1951, a group led by Ken Stauffer and Tiny Radar were inspired by <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Sun_f28c.html" title="Vancouver Sun">Vancouver Sun</a> columnist Andy Lyle's article to start a football team in Vancouver. The ownership group sent their representatives to the off-season <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Interprovincial Football Union</a> (WIFU) meetings to initiate Vancouver’s bid for a team. The representatives (Radar and Orville Burke) were told to return to the meetings the following year with a $25,000 good-faith bond if they could generate sufficient interest in the Vancouver area. The first meetings were held at the Arctic Club in November and a committee headed by Burke and Harry Spring set out to sell memberships at $20 each.</p>
<p>Even though Burke, Vic Spencer and John Davidson offered the good-faith bond to the WIFU in 1952, the idea of having a Vancouver team was rejected when both Winnipeg and Regina voted against the idea of a fifth team. The group in Vancouver, however, did not give up their efforts to have a franchise in the WIFU.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, the first annual meeting of the club was held. In that meeting, Arthur E. Mercer was hired as the first team President of the Vancouver franchise. Later in the year Mercer, Bill Morgan, Bill Ralston and Whit Matthews went back to the WlFU meetings. This time they sold the idea of a fifth team on the Canadian west coast, and Vancouver was granted a conditional franchise, on the requirements that they would provide a 15,000 seat stadium, sell at least 6,500 season tickets, and guarantee travel expenses for the visiting teams.</p>
<p>All the pieces began to fall into place when it was announced that Vancouver would host the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_British_Empire_and_Commonwealth_Games_43e4.html" title="1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games">1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a>, and that it would mean the building of a new stadium – <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver_b162.html" title="Empire Stadium, Vancouver">Empire Stadium</a>. By <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a> of 1953, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annis_Stukus_c24d.html" title="Annis Stukus">Annis Stukus</a> was then lured away from the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a>, to return to the West to become the first Public Relations Manager, General Manager and Head Coach of the franchise.</p>
<p>During the rest of 1953, a fan contest was held by all of the local media to pick the new nickname of the football franchise. In this contest, a new nickname was chosen because it represented a local landmark and legend of the area. The nickname of the team was based on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lions_%28Peaks%29_5a70.html" title="The Lions (Peaks)">The Lions</a>, a twin mountain peak that can be seen toward the north of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The twin mountain peaks name was based on legend that the mountains looked exactly like two lions and that they were guarding the city. Through this landmark and legend, alone, the "Lions" nickname became the ultimate winner in the fan contest to become the new name of the franchise.</p>
<p>After the fan contest, it was revealed that the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> label would not be part of the team name. Even though the franchise is based in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and the "Lions" name was based on a local landmark and legend, Annis Stukus decided to reject the idea of naming the team as the Vancouver Lions. Instead, Stukus decided that the team name should represent and embrace the entire Province of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>. In the end, Stukus introduced the team to the entire Canadian football world as the British Columbia Lions.</p>

<p>In their <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_in_Canadian_football_a597.html" title="1954 in Canadian football">1954 inaugural season</a>, Stukus sold football fever on the streets of Vancouver and put together a team that made history when they stepped on the field of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver_b162.html" title="Empire Stadium, Vancouver">Empire Stadium</a> for their first ever home game against the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a> on Saturday, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_in_Canadian_football_a597.html" title="1954 in Canadian football">1954</a>. In that game, <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fullback.html" title="Fullback">fullback</a> <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Bailey_9757.html" title="Byron Bailey">Byron (By) Bailey</a> scored the first ever touchdown in B.C. Lions history in an 8-6 loss to the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Blue Bombers</a>. The Lions were only able to manage a 1-15-0 regular season record in their 1954 inaugural season. The team recorded their first franchise win against the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_in_Canadian_football_a597.html" title="1954 in Canadian football">1954</a> at <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver_b162.html" title="Empire Stadium, Vancouver">Empire Stadium</a>, with By Bailey scoring the winning touchdown, in a 9-4 Lions' victory. On that night, the win caused the B.C. faithful to celebrate in the streets, however, celebrations were not common for Lions' fans during the 1950's.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955_in_Canadian_football_1f06.html" title="1955 in Canadian football">1955</a>, during their second year as a franchise, the B.C. Lions were not able to make the playoffs, but were still able to show signs of improvement, finishing with a 5-11-0 regular season record. Even with the improvements, B.C. Lions fans were surprised at the move of the team directors to ask Annis Stukus to step down as the team's Head Coach in October of 1955. While, fan reaction to his dismissal was loud and divided, Stukus still asked the fans to continue their support of the B.C. Lions. Annis Stukus' assistant <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clem_Crowe_f46a.html" title="Clem Crowe">Clem Crowe</a>, was later named as the new Head Coach of the B.C. Lions for the upcoming 1956 season.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956_in_Canadian_football_4384.html" title="1956 in Canadian football">1956 season</a>, the Lions would finish fourth in the West, posting a 6-10-0 regular season record, with Clem Crowe as their Head Coach. Although this was a one game improvement from the 1955 season, they were still not able to make their first playoff appearance in franchise history.</p>
<p>After the 1956 season, Bill McMahan became the new team President of the B.C. Lions. As the new team President, McMahan was able to bring back <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelowna.html" title="Kelowna">Kelowna</a> native, Herb Capozzi from the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a>, and hire him as the new General Manager. However, the B.C. Lions continued to struggle on the field, finishing the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957_in_Canadian_football_52a6.html" title="1957 in Canadian football">1957 regular season</a> with a 4-11-1 record, missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year.</p>
<p>A year later, the on-field performance went from bad to worse for the Lions as they opened the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958_CFL_season_dc18.html" title="1958 CFL season">1958 season</a>, with five straight losses. The team's on-field struggles caused Capozzi to fire Clem Crowe as the Head Coach and replace him with interim Head Coach, Danny Edwards, who returned after playing with the club during the 1957 season. The team was only able to manage three wins during the year, causing them to miss the playoffs, once again. Although it was a season to forget, rookies, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hinton_c225.html" title="Tom Hinton">Tom Hinton</a> and Sonny Homer, showed promising signs of being future football stars.</p>
<p>During the off-season, General Manager, Herb Capozzi improved the team for the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_CFL_season_72ef.html" title="1959 CFL season">1959 season</a> in the following ways: hired Wayne Robinson from the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a> to become the new Head Coach of the Lions; brought in a corps of veteran players to add more experience to the team; signed rookie running back, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Fleming_b8d9.html" title="Willie Fleming">Willie "The Wisp" Fleming</a> to the team, adding more youth to play alongside Hinton and Homer. Capozzi's moves proved successful in the end. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_CFL_season_72ef.html" title="1959 CFL season">1959</a>, the Leos managed their first winning season with a 9-7-0 regular season record and were able to make their first playoff appearance with a final game triumph over the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a> at <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver_b162.html" title="Empire Stadium, Vancouver">Empire Stadium</a>. The Lions first playoff appearance ended with two straight losses to the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton Eskimos</a>. However, the team's future looked bright heading into the 1960's.</p>

<p>The high hopes of the Lions heading into the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960_CFL_season_8e5c.html" title="1960 CFL season">1960 season</a> faded when the team finished with a disappointing 5-9-2 record, which again eliminated them from play-off contention. It was disappointing considering that the team added rookie talents Steve Cotter, Lonnie Dennis, Jim Catphin and Neal Beaumont to the team that had a strong core of veteran and young players from the previous season. The only positive for the Lions happened at the end of the season when Beaumont won <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Beattie_Martin_Trophy_4617.html" title="Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy">WIFU Outstanding Rookie of the Year honors</a>, becoming the first Lions player to win a major <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">Canadian Football League</a> award.</p>
<p>The Lions started the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961_CFL_season_54c6.html" title="1961 CFL season">1961</a> season by signing former <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Viking_51ba.html" title="Minnesota Viking">Minnesota Viking</a> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brown_%28football_player%29_bd9a.html" title="Tom Brown (football player)">Tom Brown</a> to a contract, but the team continued performing poorly on the field. In September, the team made a major trade with the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a>, which was considered to be a major gamble by the Lions. In the trade, the Lions got quarterback <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kapp_c02f.html" title="Joe Kapp">Joe Kapp</a> in the deal in exchange for four of their players to be sent to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeders</a>. A week later, Wayne Robinson was fired from his job as Head Coach and was replaced by Assistant Coach, Dave Skrien. The year ended with a dismal 1-13-2 record.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_CFL_season_cf1c.html" title="1962 CFL season">1962</a>, Dave Skrien made an immediate impact as Head Coach of the Lions. Even though the Lions finished the season with a 7-9 record, there were noticeable improvements. After eight years of hard work, the Leos were on the verge of success for the first time.</p>
<p>Before the start of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_CFL_season_2e5b.html" title="1963 CFL season">1963 season</a>, new optimism was voiced at the chances that the Lions could be a strong contender for the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a>, which was to be played at <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Stadium%2C_Vancouver_b162.html" title="Empire Stadium, Vancouver">Empire Stadium</a>. Through a veteran roster that was headlined by Joe Kapp and Willie Fleming, the Lions would end up finishing the season in first place (for the first time) with a 12-4 record. After a 2-1 series victory over the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan Roughriders</a> in the Western Finals, the Lions would play in the <a href="../../../5/1/s/51st_Grey_Cup_2b00.html" title="51st Grey Cup">51st Grey Cup</a> game against the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a>. However, the Lions momentum would be sidelined as a series of injuries along the way that effected the team's performance in the championship game. In the Grey Cup game, star running back <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Fleming_b8d9.html" title="Willie Fleming">Willie Fleming</a> was injured after he received a late, out of bounds hit by <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Ti-Cat</a> defensive tackle <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelo_Mosca_39e6.html" title="Angelo Mosca">Angelo Mosca</a>, which was a big blow to the Lions' Grey Cup chances. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a> won the <a href="../../../5/1/s/51st_Grey_Cup_2b00.html" title="51st Grey Cup">51st Grey Cup</a> with a 21-10 victory, but the following year, the Lions would get their revenge. After the season, Joe Kapp became the first B.C. Lion to receive the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Nicklin_Memorial_Trophy_ba1a.html" title="Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy">Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy</a> as the Most Valuable Player of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Conference</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brown_%28football_player%29_bd9a.html" title="Tom Brown (football player)">Tom Brown</a> became the first Lion to win the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Most_Outstanding_Defensive_Player_Award_8a2e.html" title="CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award">CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award</a>.

<p>After achieving an 11-2-3 regular season record in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_CFL_season_2d03.html" title="1964 CFL season">1964</a>, and defeating the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a> in a three-game series in the Western Conference Finals, the Lions would advance to meet the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a> in a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> rematch at <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>'s <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibition_Stadium_8a33.html" title="Exhibition Stadium">Exhibition Stadium</a>. In the rematch, the Lions would get their revenge as <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kapp_c02f.html" title="Joe Kapp">Kapp</a>, Ken Appleby, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Fleming_b8d9.html" title="Willie Fleming">Willie Fleming</a>, and Bill Munsey, who gave a two-touchdown, two-way starring effort, helped the Lions to their <a href="../../../5/2/n/52nd_Grey_Cup_29d4.html" title="52nd Grey Cup">first Grey Cup victory</a>. With the addition of two field goals and an extra touchdown by the field goal unit, the Lions won the Grey Cup for the first time in franchise history with a 34-24 victory. The win would end 11 years of waiting for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> faithful. At the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_CFL_season_2d03.html" title="1964 CFL season">1964 season</a>, linebacker <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brown_%28football_player%29_bd9a.html" title="Tom Brown (football player)">Tom Brown</a> was named a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_CFL_season_2d03.html#1964_CFL_All-Stars" title="1964 CFL season">CFL All-Star</a>, a back-to-back Schenley award winner as <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Most_Outstanding_Defensive_Player_Award_8a2e.html" title="CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award">CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award</a>, and won the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Nicklin_Memorial_Trophy_ba1a.html" title="Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy">Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy</a> as the Most Valuable Player in the Western Conference. Joining Brown as All-Stars on defence were Mike Cacic, Dick Fouts, and Munsey. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kapp_c02f.html" title="Joe Kapp">Joe Kapp</a> and tackle Lonnie Dennis were named CFL All-Stars on offence.</p>
<p>Any hopes of the B.C. Lions becoming a dynasty team after their Grey Cup championship season, quickly disappeared in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_CFL_season_0824.html" title="1965 CFL season">1965 season</a> as the team started to recede back to the basement of the Western Conference. Before the beginning of the season, By Bailey left the team and the entire roster was starting to age as the Lions finished the season with a 6-9-1 regular season record, which caused the franchise to miss the play-offs. It was clear that Head Coach, Dave Skrien would never again experience the same success as he achieved the previous two seasons.</p>
<p>The situation for the Lions went from bad to worse in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_CFL_season_bde3.html" title="1966 CFL season">1966 season</a>, as the team would win only one game for the first time since the 1961 season. Due to the dreadful team performance, Herb Capozzi was fired as the Lions' General Manager, just two years after he took the franchise to consecutive Grey Cup appearances; Capozzi was Lions' G.M. for nine seasons. In addition, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Fleming_b8d9.html" title="Willie Fleming">Willie Fleming</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hinton_c225.html" title="Tom Hinton">Tom Hinton</a> decided to retire, and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kapp_c02f.html" title="Joe Kapp">Joe Kapp</a> left the team to continue his playing career in the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_CFL_season_b0e1.html" title="1967 CFL season">1967 season</a>, Denny Vietch became the new General Manager of the club. Denny Veitch's first move as General Manager was to fire Dave Skrien as the club's Head Coach, after the Lions lost their first three games of the season. In the fourth game of the season, Veitch named Jim Champion as the team's new Head Coach, but the Lions would end up finishing the season with a 3-12-1 record. The only two positives for the club were rookies <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Young_719e.html" title="Jim Young">Jim Young</a> and kicker, Ted Gerela, who would end up winning the <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Beattie_Martin_Trophy_4617.html" title="Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy">Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy</a> as the Western Conference's Rookie of the Year.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_CFL_season_5b98.html" title="1968 CFL season">1968 season</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> legend, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_3355.html" title="Jackie Parker">Jackie Parker</a> was hired as an Assistant Coach for the B.C. Lions and even came out of retirement to suit up in a Lions uniform for eight games as the quarterback. However, the Lions finished the season with a 4-11-1 record; seven of those games were lost by less than a touchdown, showing some indication that the team was improving.</p>
<p>Eleven games into the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_CFL_season_7edf.html" title="1969 CFL season">1969 season</a>, after stumbling to a 1-10 record, Head Coach Jim Champion was fired and replaced by assistant Jackie Parker. The Lions responded by winning four of their last five games, and with a 5-11 record took third place in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Division</a>. The Lions made the playoffs, but lost to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> 21-35 in the semi-finals. Individually, Dave Easley won CFL and <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Beattie_Martin_Trophy_4617.html" title="Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy">Western Division Rookie of the Year</a> honours, and wide receiver <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Young_719e.html" title="Jim Young">Jim Young</a> was a Schenley Finalist.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_CFL_season_e755.html" title="1971 CFL season">1971 season</a> began with a major off-season restructuring that saw Head Coach Jackie Parker elevated to General Manager, and replaced by former <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a> coach Eagle Keys. Don Moorhead was recruited at quarterback, and a total of fifty-three different players put on a Lions uniform in a year of change, including movie/TV personality <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Weathers_973d.html" title="Carl Weathers">Carl Weathers</a>, at linebacker. Running back Jim Evenson finished the season with 1,237 yards to lead the Western Division in rushing, and won the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_James_Memorial_Trophy_eae5.html" title="Eddie James Memorial Trophy">Eddie James Memorial Trophy</a>. The Lions again finished the season at fourth place in the West Division with a 6-9-1 record, missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_CFL_season_80a0.html" title="1972 CFL season">1972</a>, the Lions added new players such as defensive back <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Long_1ac9.html" title="Rocky Long">Rocky Long</a>, running back Johnny Musso, linebacker Ray Nettles and centre <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wilson_%28CFL_football_player%29_9115.html" title="Al Wilson (CFL football player)">Al Wilson</a>, but finished fifth in their division with a 5-11 record. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Young_719e.html" title="Jim Young">Jim Young</a> won his second Schenley Award as <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Canadian_Award_2b82.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Canadian Award">Outstanding Canadian</a>.</p>
<p>The Lions' fortunes improved during the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_CFL_season_2a10.html" title="1973 CFL season">1973 season</a>, as the Lions posted a 5-9-2 record, good enough for a third place finish in the Western Division and a playoff berth, the first in four years. Unfortunately, the Lions lost in the semi-finals to the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan Roughriders</a> 33-13. Linebacker Ray Nettles won the CFL's Outstanding Defensive Player award.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_CFL_season_0044.html" title="1974 CFL season">1974</a>, the Lions showed continued improvement in posting an 8-8 record, and again returned to the playoffs for the second straight year. The Lions faced familiar foe <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a> in the semi-finals, where they lost again, 24-14. Second-year running back Lou Harris replaced injured Johnny Musso to lead the Lions in both rushing and receiving, winning CFL All-Star honours in the process. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annis_Stukus_c24d.html" title="Annis Stukus">Annis Stukus</a> became the first Lion inducted into the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_24ba.html" title="Canadian Football Hall of Fame">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a> as a builder.</p>
<p>The Lions began the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_CFL_season_c082.html" title="1975 CFL season">1975 season</a> with a change at quarterback, as Eric Guthrie and Peter Liske platooned at the position, replacing Don Moorhead. The Lions lost five of their first six games before a major change was announced in August. General Manager Jackie Parker and Head Coach Eagle Keys were both dismissed, with Bob Ackles moving up from his assistant General Manager post and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Murphy_7e50.html" title="Cal Murphy">Cal Murphy</a> elevated to Head Coach. The Lions played .500 football the rest of the season, but finished in fifth place in their division with a 6-10 record.</p>
<p>The Lions' <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_CFL_season_728a.html" title="1976 CFL season">1976 season</a> concluded with a 5-9-2 fourth place finish. Individually, John Sciarra became the second Lion to win the Schenley award as the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie, while Bill Baker won the Schenley Defensive Player award. Harry Spring became the second Lion inducted into the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_24ba.html" title="Canadian Football Hall of Fame">Hall of Fame</a> as a builder.

<p>A complete off-season overhaul in the coaching staff brought <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> assistant Vic Rapp in as the 10th Head Coach of the Lions as they opened their <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_CFL_season_3ffb.html" title="1977 CFL season">1977 season</a>. A revamped Lions lineup included rookies Leon Bright, John Blain, Ken Hinton, and quarterback <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Tagge_1e22.html" title="Jerry Tagge">Jerry Tagge</a>, as well as several newly acquired veterans. The Lions last-minute heroics earned them the nickname "the Cardiac Kids." The Lions finished with a 10-6 record, good enough for second place in the Western Division (the first time the Lions finished higher than third place since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_CFL_season_2d03.html" title="1964 CFL season">1964</a>). The Lions opened the playoffs with a 33-32 upset of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> before losing to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> finalist <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> in the Western Division Finals.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_CFL_season_5489.html" title="1978 CFL season">1978</a>, the Lions finished the season at 7-7-2 and in fourth place in their division. Rookie running backs John Henry White and Larry Key provided a much improved rushing game, but depth was still the missing ingredient, as the Lions missed the playoffs. <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_CFL_season_5489.html" title="1978 CFL season">1978</a> also saw the emergence of rookie quarterback <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paopao_06a0.html" title="Joe Paopao">Joe Paopao</a>, the "Throwin' Samoan."</p>

Rising costs and an aging Empire Stadium cast a shadow over future prospects. To head off a crisis, the directors, led by past-President Jack Farley, developed a plan to sell stock and seek a strong partnership with a major corporate sponsor to keep operations viable while waiting for the construction of a new stadium in downtown Vancouver.</p>

<p>The Lions failed to make a consecutive playoff appearance in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_CFL_season_d75c.html" title="1980 CFL season">1980</a>, despite a winning 8-7-1 finish. Off the field, the decision was made to begin construction of a new indoor stadium in downtown Vancouver.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_CFL_season_5cad.html" title="1981 CFL season">1981</a>, the Lions returned to the playoffs with a third place divisional finish and a 10-6 record. The Lions again upset <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> in the semi-finals, 15-11, before losing a 22-16 heart breaker in the Western Division Finals to eventual <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> champion <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>. Paopao and second-year quarterback <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Dewalt_d308.html" title="Roy Dewalt">Roy Dewalt</a>, had wide-out Ty Grey as their deep-threat receiver, while rookie defensive back Larry Crawford led the CFL in interceptions. The <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labatt_Brewing_Company_a4cc.html" title="Labatt Brewing Company">Labatt Brewing Company</a> became the Lions' major sponsor in a marketing agreement that brought much needed financial stability to the team.</p>
<p>Standout wide receiver <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mervyn_Fernandez_bca0.html" title="Mervyn Fernandez">Mervyn "Swervin' Mervyn" Fernandez</a> was among the rookies who joined the Lions in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_CFL_season_1a04.html" title="1982 CFL season">1982</a>, winning the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Jackie Parker Trophy</a> as the Western Division's most outstanding rookie. Despite a winning 9-7 record, the Lions finished fourth in their division, but did not reach the playoffs. The end of the season saw the dismissal of Head Coach Vic Rapp and his coaching staff. Lions' running back great <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Fleming_b8d9.html" title="Willie Fleming">Willie "The Whisp" Fleming</a> was inducted into the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame_24ba.html" title="Canadian Football Hall of Fame">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_CFL_season_ef86.html" title="1983 CFL season">1983</a>, former <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> defensive coordinator <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Matthews_f95a.html" title="Don Matthews">Don Matthews</a> was named the Lions' new Head Coach. The quarterback-receiver combination of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Dewalt_d308.html" title="Roy Dewalt">Dewalt</a> to Fernandez led the Lions' attack, while the defence set a new CFL record of 42 interceptions. The Lions finished 11-5 for the second-best record in team history and returned to first place for the first time since the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_CFL_season_2d03.html" title="1964 CFL season">1964 season</a>. <a href="../../../b/2E/c/B.C._Place_Stadium_1f25.html" title="B.C. Place Stadium">B.C. Place Stadium</a>, the new home of the Lions, opened in June, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_CFL_season_ef86.html" title="1983 CFL season">1983</a>. The Lions stormed into the playoffs, defeating <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> in the Western Division finals, 39-21. The Western Division champions hosted the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> in the <a href="../../../7/1/s/71st_Grey_Cup_0b3b.html" title="71st Grey Cup">71st Grey Cup</a>, ending a 19-year absence from the classic. Unfortunately, B.C. Place fans watched the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Argonauts</a> defeat their hometown team in a taught, 18-17 contest.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_CFL_season_7c4d.html" title="1984 CFL season">1984</a>, the Lions' biggest trade since the Joe Kapp deal brought CFL All-Star <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Parker_%28football_player%29_173d.html" title="James Parker (football player)">James "Quick" Parker</a> to the Lions' defence from <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>. The Lions again finished first in the Western Division with a league leading 12-3-1 record, but the second straight first place finish was dampened by the late season loss of quarterback Roy Dewalt to injury. In a repeat Western Finals matchup at B.C. Place, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> triumphed 31-14 and went on to win the <a href="../../../7/2/n/72nd_Grey_Cup_eeeb.html" title="72nd Grey Cup">72nd Grey Cup</a>. Average crowds in excess of 40,000 in each of the first two years at B.C. Place reversed the team's financial fortunes, with stockholders receiving early repayment.

<p>The Lions' <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_CFL_season_eb11.html" title="1985 CFL season">1985 season</a> began with much promise. Mervyn Fernandez shattered several team receiving records and second year receiver Jim Sandusky broke the 1,000 yard mark. Rookie defensive tackle Mike Gray was the most visible of several rookies. With depth and few injuries, the final season record of 13-3 was the best in team history, bringing the Lions their third consecutive first place divisional finish. The Lions avenged their prior year's playoff defeat by handling <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> 42-22, despite that fact that the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Blue Bombers</a> had won both regular season meetings and wide receiver Fernandez was out with a leg injury. One week later, the same Lions line-up met <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a> at the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Stadium_%28Montreal%29_d551.html" title="Olympic Stadium (Montreal)">Olympic Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>. 21 years of waiting ended with a 37-24 <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> championship victory over the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Tiger-Cats</a> in the <a href="../../../7/3/r/73rd_Grey_Cup_ea3e.html" title="73rd Grey Cup">73rd Grey Cup</a>.

Linebacker Tyrone Crews won the first of two consecutive <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Pate_Memorial_Award_c0f8.html" title="Tom Pate Memorial Award">CFL Players Association Outstanding Community Service Awards</a>. The CFL champions returned to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia_9a31.html" title="Vancouver, British Columbia">Vancouver</a> for a victory celebration that swept across the entire <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">province</a>.</p>
<p>Defending their championship in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_CFL_season_b272.html" title="1986 CFL season">1986</a> proved even harder than winning it the year before, as the Lions battled the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Blue Bombers</a>, injuries, and the CFL's newly extended 18 game regular season. The Lions reached the halfway mark at 7-2 losing at <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>, and at home to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a>. The Lions then ran their record to 9-2 before hitting a four game losing streak, started by back to back losses to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>. The Lions rebounded to win back to back games against <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> to finish the season 12-6, and second in the Western Division. Under the new playoff format, the Lions met the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Bombers</a> for a third straight week, winning the Semi-Finals 21-14, before travelling to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> for the Lions' first Western Final road game in four years. The Lions lost their fourth game of the year to the Eskimos 41-5, ending the Lions' hopes of defending their title in front of a home crowd at <a href="../../../b/2E/c/B.C._Place_Stadium_1f25.html" title="B.C. Place Stadium">B.C.Place</a>. Off the field, the big news of the year was the departure of General Manager Bob Ackles to the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>'s <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, ending Ackles' 33 year association with the Lions (he would return in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_CFL_season_9f62.html" title="2002 CFL season">2002</a>). Ackles was replaced by former <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal</a> General Manager Joe Galat in August, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_CFL_season_b272.html" title="1986 CFL season">1986</a>.</p>
<p>The Lions began their <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_CFL_season_71aa.html" title="1987 CFL season">1987</a> campaign without the services of stand out wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez, who left during the offseason to join the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Los Angeles Raiders</a>. The season began with a four game winning streak, but the team seemed to lose focus through the middle of the season, looking invincible in one game and lethargic the next. Entering the last half of the year, the Lions were still in contention for first place but not playing like a team driving for a title. When the team suffered a three-game losing streak, General Manager Joe Galat fired Don Matthews, the winningest coach in Lions history with just four games to go. The Lions instantly responded to new Coach Larry Donovan, winning the final four games including a thrilling come-from-behind 33-32 victory over <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Stadium_%28Edmonton%29_1ae7.html" title="Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)">Commonwealth Stadium</a> that many observers called the CFL's greatest comeback ever. The win gave the Lions first place in the Western Division for the fourth time in five years with a 12-6 record. Home field advantage at B.C. Place in the Western Finals wasn't enough however, as the Lions fell to the eventual <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> champion <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a>, 31-7.</p>
<p>The CFL's competition cap forced the Lions to start the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_CFL_season_51a1.html" title="1988 CFL season">1988 season</a> with 22 new faces in their lineup, one of which was star quarterback <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Dunigan_c8f7.html" title="Matt Dunigan">Matt Dunigan</a>, acquired in a trade with <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>. Despite the large number of new players, the Lions jelled and finished the regular season with a 10-8 record. The Lions entered the playoffs with momentum and were touted as Grey Cup favourites. The <a href="../../../b/2E/c/B.C._Lions_8ccc.html" title="B.C. Lions">Leos</a> managed hard-earned playoff victories on the road at <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a>, beating the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Roughriders</a>, 42-18 in the Semi-Finals, before defeating the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a> in the Western Division Finals at Commonwealth Stadium, 37-19. That set the stage for the 76th Annual Grey Cup Game against the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Blue Bombers</a>, in front of a crowd in excess of 50,000 in unseasonably mild but windy conditions at <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. The lead changed hands several times during the hard fought contest. The Leos drove to the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> seven-yard line in the final minutes only to have Matt Dunigan's pass deflected by two defenders and intercepted to snuff out the drive. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Bombers</a> went on to win the Cup, 22-21.</p>
<p>Buoyed by their <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> appearance the previous season, the Lions entered the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_CFL_season_7eda.html" title="1989 CFL season">1989 season</a> with much optimism. However, the team opened the campaign with a loss to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> in Commonwealth Stadium, followed by three more losses before Coach Larry Donovan was fired and replaced by General Manager Joe Galat. After dropping their fifth straight game to the Eskimos, the Lions put together a four-game winning streak, fuelling playoff hopes. Unfortunately, the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a> shattered those hopes in back to back games, rolling over the Leos 53-34 in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg.html" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, and then edging the Lions 24-20 in an overtime contest in Vancouver. The Lions never did get back on track, finishing the year with a disappointing 7-11 record, and missing the playoffs for the first time since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_CFL_season_1a04.html" title="1982 CFL season">1982</a>. Bright spots included running back Darrell Wallace, who won the Western Division's <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Jackie Parker Trophy</a> as Most Outstanding Rookie (Wallace was second in the CFL in total offensive yardage), and quarterback Matt Dunigan who won the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Pate_Memorial_Award_c0f8.html" title="Tom Pate Memorial Award">CFL Players Association Outstanding Community Service Award</a>.</p>

<p>Under new Head Coach Lary Kuharich and General Manager <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kapp_c02f.html" title="Joe Kapp">Joe Kapp</a>, the Lions generated a good deal of preseason hype in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_CFL_season_4c2d.html" title="1990 CFL season">1990</a> with the signings of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_University_4ec7.html" title="West Virginia University">West Virginia University</a> quarterback <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Harris_cd8e.html" title="Major Harris">Major Harris</a>, who was fourth in 1989 <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> balloting, former <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> star <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Gastineau_3b3c.html" title="Mark Gastineau">Mark Gastineau</a>, and quarterback <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>. However, the publicity did not translate into on-field victories and turmoil plagued the team. Two coaches left early in the season amid controversy. The Lions tied their first game against <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in the dying seconds of the contest as Doug Flutie tossed a "Hail Mary" pass to Ray Alexander in the end zone. The Lions kept close in every game, winning a tight one against <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> at home on a last-second Passaglia field goal, while losing to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a> in the final seconds in the next contest. The eastern road trip to <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto</a>, during which the Lions lost both games, spelled the beginning of the end for the new coach and general manager. The following week, the Leos dropped another one to the Argos, 49-19, and one week after that, another former Lions great, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Young_719e.html" title="Jim Young">Jim "Dirty Thirty" Young</a>, was behind the bench as interim head coach. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_O%27Billovich_b7cb.html" title="Bob O'Billovich">Bob O'Billovich</a> took over as Vice President of Football Operations and Head Coach on September 14, 1990 and promptly guided the team to a strong 34-4 victory over <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a>. The Lions gained stability as the season wore on, and although they missed the playoffs, "Obie's" charges went 4-3 over the last seven games of the season, and their strong finish fuelled hopes for a much brighter <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_CFL_season_1ae7.html" title="1991 CFL season">1991 season</a>. Highlights of the year included <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a>'s new professional football scoring record, as he booted his 2,238th point, finishing the year with 2,312 points. Lui also became the longest-playing Lion in history, appearing in a total of 236 games, overtaking Al Wilson's previous mark of 233 games.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_CFL_season_1ae7.html" title="1991 CFL season">1991 season</a> opened with promise. Although the team dropped a 39-34 decision to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> at B.C. Place, the game was tight and the Lions were in the contest to the very end. It was a harbinger of things to come as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_O%27Billovich_b7cb.html" title="Bob O'Billovich">Bob O'Billovich</a>'s young team with 12 rookies in the lineup, turned virtually every contest into a nail biter, playing in a CFL record six overtime contests, winning three and losing three. Behind the outstanding quarterbacking of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>, the powerful running of rookie Jon Volpe, the receiving of rookie Matt Clark and veteran Ray Alexander, the Lions were capable of beating any team in the CFL. On August 1, 1991, the 2-1 Lions faced the undefeated <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> featuring <a href="../../../r/a/g/Raghib_Ismail_ea4b.html" title="Raghib Ismail">Raghib "the Rocket" Ismail</a>, at <a href="../../../b/2E/c/B.C._Place_Stadium_1f25.html" title="B.C. Place Stadium">B.C. Place Stadium</a>. A huge crowd of 53,527 was on hand. After falling behind 21-3 in the first quarter, the Lions battled back and took control of the game in the final quarter. Toronto managed to tie the game but in overtime, but an electrifying kickoff return for a touchdown by Raymond Ethridge and terrific play by the Lions' special teams spelled the difference. The Lions triumphed 52-41 in overtime. Unfortunately, the following week, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> stopped the Leos, 34-30 in overtime. The Lions offence led the CFL in 11 different categories and the team was in a battle for first place in the Western Division, right down to the end of the season. Entering the playoffs against the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeders</a> in third place with an 11-7 record (for the best Lions win-loss record in four years), the Leos took a commanding 31-15 lead by the end of the first half. Although the Lions had never lost a game all year when leading at the half, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> stormed back with an incredible third quarter, scoring four touchdowns, and holding off the Lions to win, 43-41. The disappointing loss was at least partially offset by the awarding of three Lions with outstanding player awards. Doug Flutie was named the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Player_Award_b82e.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Player Award">CFL's Outstanding Player</a>, Jon Volpe won the CFL's Outstanding Rookie award as well as the West Division's <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Jackie Parker Trophy</a> and the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_James_Memorial_Trophy_eae5.html" title="Eddie James Memorial Trophy">Eddie James Memorial Trophy</a> for leading the division in rushing. Offensive tackle <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Mills_da1f.html" title="Jim Mills">Jim Mills</a> became the CFL's Outstanding Offensive Lineman and the West Division's <a href="../../../d/e/m/DeMarco-Becket_Memorial_Trophy_9c1f.html" title="DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy">DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy</a> award winner for the second consecutive year. Although quarterback <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a> signed as a free agent with the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeders</a> in the post-season, the acquisition of his replacement from <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Barrett_3d1a.html" title="Danny Barrett">Danny Barrett</a>, prior to training camp, brought hope of good things to come in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_CFL_season_260f.html" title="1992 CFL season">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The Lions entered training camp in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_CFL_season_260f.html" title="1992 CFL season">1992</a> with high expectations. Despite the loss of Doug Flutie, Grey Cup winning quarterback <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Barrett_3d1a.html" title="Danny Barrett">Danny Barrett</a> was counted on to be an able replacement. In the season opener against <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>, however, Barrett struggled, eventually giving way to back-up Tony Kimbrough in the second half. The <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a> went on to win, 37-26. The following week, the Lions' fortunes continued to spiral downward, this time, on the road, as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> crushed the Leos, 61-20. In the third game of the year against Doug Flutie and the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a>, Barrett, who had regained his starting job at quarterback, went down in the third quarter with a separated shoulder. Flutie then guided <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> to a 37-19 win, and the Lions slid further downhill from there. The team lost eight straight before finally edging out <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a> 33-27 on September 3, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_CFL_season_260f.html" title="1992 CFL season">1992</a>, with Danny Barrett back at the helm. To add insult to injury, off-season and off-field problems emerged to swing focus from football to ownership, as Lions' owner Murray Pezim declared bankruptcy, and the CFL was forced to take over the team. Three weeks later, a new owner was found, as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brick_28c8.html" title="The Brick">The Brick Furniture Store</a> owner Bill Comrie purchased the Lions from the CFL on September 23, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_CFL_season_260f.html" title="1992 CFL season">1992</a>. Unfortunately, the team on the field didn't respond to the new found ownership stability, losing the final seven games of the year to finish the season with a disappointing 3-15 record. Head Coach O'Billovich and his staff were fired at season's end, and on December 12, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_CFL_season_260f.html" title="1992 CFL season">1992</a>, new General Manager Eric Tillman announced the hiring of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a> defensive coordinator <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Ritchie_%28football%29_8387.html" title="Dave Ritchie (football)">Dave Ritchie</a>, as the new Head Coach of the Lions.</p>
<p>The "new", <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_CFL_season_4c42.html" title="1993 CFL season">1993</a> edition of the B.C. Lions, under the guidance of Head Coach Dave Ritchie and General Manager Eric Tillman signed a number of proven CFL veterans, including <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_McManus_796a.html" title="Danny McManus">Danny McManus</a>, James "Wild" West, Rob Smith, Less Browne, Tyrone Jones, and Sean Foudy. The team also added promising rookies, such as running back <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cory_Philpot_83de.html" title="Cory Philpot">Cory Philpot</a>, draft pick Tom Europe, and Derek Grier. A contract dispute with Jon Volpe kept him from training camp, but he was back in the fold by the second game of the season. The Lions struck quickly with wins over <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto</a> before grinding to a halt in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> after only three days rest between road games. However, the Leos would only lose two more games through July, August, and mid-September, cruising to an 8-3 record, the Lions' best start since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_CFL_season_71aa.html" title="1987 CFL season">1987</a>. Quarterback <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Barrett_3d1a.html" title="Danny Barrett">Danny Barrett</a> broke the CFL's single-game passing yard record, completing 30 passes for 601 yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 586 yards set back in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954_in_Canadian_football_a597.html" title="1954 in Canadian football">1954</a> by <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Alouettes</a> legend, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Etcheverry_328b.html" title="Sam Etcheverry">Sam "The Rifle" Etcheverry</a>. The Lions entered the September 18, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_CFL_season_4c42.html" title="1993 CFL season">1993</a> game against <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in a battle for first place in the Western Division. However, Doug Flutie and the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stamps</a> prevailed, 40-21. The Lions would go on to win only two of the next seven games, sliding to a 64-27 pounding against <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento_Gold_Miners_1ab9.html" title="Sacramento Gold Miners">Sacramento</a> in the regular season finale, for a 10-8 finish. Nevertheless, the Lions made the playoffs after a 1 year absence, facing <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in the Western Division's Semi-Finals on November 14, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_CFL_season_4c42.html" title="1993 CFL season">1993</a>. Despite generating twice as much offence as the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stamps</a>, the Leos could not score a touchdown and fell 17-9.</p>

<p>The Lions entered the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_CFL_season_d767.html" title="1994 CFL season">1994</a> campaign with a new quarterback, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_Austin_5067.html" title="Kent Austin">Kent Austin</a>, at the helm. Off-season trades with <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a> provided offensive guard Denny Chronopoulos, defensive lineman Andrew Stewart, and rush linebacker Angelo Snipes. A group of young, unknown, and aggressive linebackers emerged at training camp, Henry Newby, Tyrone Chatman, and Virgil Robertson, while the secondary was strengthened with the additions of Charles Gordon and Enis Jackson. The Lions opened the season at B.C.Place and gave the fans a taste of things to come with a hard-fought 24-20 victory over <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a>. The Lions offensive power was amply demonstrated the following week with a 57-18 thumping of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa Rough Riders</a>. By the end of August, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_CFL_season_d767.html" title="1994 CFL season">1994</a>, the Lions were 7-1-0, and had broken several single-game offensive records, including a 67-15 point record win over <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport_Pirates_357e.html" title="Shreveport Pirates">Shreveport</a>. The Leos' secondary was further bolstered by the signing of former <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> stars James Jefferson and Barry Wilburn. The team endured a dry spell at the season's mid-point, losing close games to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a>. A late season win over <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Posse_06eb.html" title="Las Vegas Posse">Las Vegas</a> (45-7) and a close 24-23 loss to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a>, gave the Lions new hope heading into the playoffs, as well as an 11-6-1 regular season finish. The team travelled to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> for the Western Division Semi-Finals, where the Lions had only managed one playoff victory at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Stadium_%28Edmonton%29_1ae7.html" title="Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)">Commonwealth Stadium</a>. With just over four minutes left in the game, defensive back Charles Gordon's miraculous end-zone interception stopped the Eskimos in their tracks and gave new life to the Lions. Quarterback Kent Austin, replacing an injured <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_McManus_796a.html" title="Danny McManus">Danny McManus</a> who had started the game, mounted a Lions' drive which ate up the clock and the field. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a> kicked the winning field goal with 30 seconds left to give the Lions a tough 24-23 come-from-behind victory. The following week, in one of the most memorable Western Finals ever, the Lions and the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a> led <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeders</a> traded touchdowns and field goals all night at <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMahon_Stadium_6bfc.html" title="McMahon Stadium">McMahon Stadium</a>. In the swirling snow with two minutes left in the game, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> set up to kick a game winning field goal. Lions' linebacker Ray Alexander leapt up and made an amazing block, giving the Lions renewed hope. Danny McManus, who had replaced Kent Austin in the second half after Austin re-injured a separated shoulder, staged a furious last-minute drive, hitting receivers all the way down the field to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeder</a>'s four yard line. With <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> leading 36-31, with four seconds left in the game, McManus found receiver <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Flutie_b27f.html" title="Darren Flutie">Darren Flutie</a> alone in the end zone to give the Lions their first playoff victory over <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in 30 years, and a berth in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> against <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a> at B.C. Place. The dramatics continued the following week in the <a href="../../../8/2/n/82nd_Grey_Cup_e053.html" title="82nd Grey Cup">82nd Grey Cup</a>. With 55,097 cheering fans looking on, the Lions and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Stallions</a> staged another thriller with both teams playing great football. <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a> took a 17-10 lead at halftime, and extended their lead to 20-10 early in the third quarter. Lions' quarterback Danny McManus entered the game and staged a second-half rally. Seemingly stalled at the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a> 30 yard line, <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Flutie_b27f.html" title="Darren Flutie">Darren Flutie</a> staged a fake field goal to gain a big first down, which changed the momentum of the game. McManus ran in from the two-yard line to score to tie the game was at 20-20. After the teams traded field goals to make the score 23-23, McManus engineered another late-game drive to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a> 37 yard line. Passaglia missed the field goal with just over one minute remaining, but the Lions' defence rose up to deny <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore</a> and stop them cold within their own five-yard line. After a punt and a couple of runs to set up another field goal try, Passaglia converted a field goal with no time remaining on the clock to give the Lions an incredible 26-23 victory, the third <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> championship in the team's history. Passaglia went on to win a well deserved <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_Most_Valuable_Canadian_746c.html" title="Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian">Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian</a> award for his heroics.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_CFL_season_f07f.html" title="1995 CFL season">1995 season</a> began with Grey Cup hero <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_McManus_796a.html" title="Danny McManus">Danny McManus</a> named as starting quarterback, replacing Kent Austin, who was traded to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelton_Quarles_af81.html" title="Shelton Quarles">Shelton Quarles</a> was added to a strong linebacker corps. The season started with an exciting, late come-from-behind 37-34 victory over the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Stallions_43eb.html" title="Baltimore Stallions">Baltimore Stallions</a> at B.C. Place. The Lions won their first three games before suffering a set back in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a>. The Leos got back on track with a strong performance over <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a>, and went on to a 7-1 record, challenging the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stampeders</a> in the North Division. Injuries to key players during a three game, 10 day road trip resulted in a late season swoon that the Lions couldn't recover from. A victory over <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a> at B.C. Place in the regular season finale solidified 3rd place in the rugged Northern Division with a 10-8 record and a trip to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> for the playoffs. The Lions' <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_CFL_season_f07f.html" title="1995 CFL season">1995 season</a> came to an end with a 26-15 loss to the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a> in the semi-finals. Individually, Lions' running back Cory Philpot broke the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> record for touchdowns in a season with 22, and won the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_James_Memorial_Trophy_eae5.html" title="Eddie James Memorial Trophy">Eddie James Memorial Trophy</a> for the second year in a row as the Northern Division's leading rusher. Lui Passaglia ended the season with 3,160 career points. <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Taras_d553.html" title="Jamie Taras">Jamie Taras</a> won the <a href="../../../d/e/m/DeMarco-Becket_Memorial_Trophy_9c1f.html" title="DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy">DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy</a> as the Northern Division's Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_CFL_season_faf7.html" title="1996 CFL season">1996</a> was a season of turmoil for the Lions, both on and off the field. Former Lions' quarterback and fan favourite <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paopao_06a0.html" title="Joe Paopao">Joe Paopao</a> returned to the team from the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton Eskimos</a> as the new Head Coach, replacing Dave Ritchie. On March 11, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_CFL_season_faf7.html" title="1996 CFL season">1996</a>, Lions' owner Bill Comrie announced that the club had been sold to a group of 10 local businessmen headed by <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Skalbania_f47c.html" title="Nelson Skalbania">Nelson Skalbania</a> and Michael Jensen. The Lions held training camp at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_British_Columbia_eb6a.html" title="University of British Columbia">UBC</a> with over a hundred players invited. Mike McCarthy arrived in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> to become the new Lions' President. On the field, the Lions started the season with 18 new faces in the line-up, including heralded <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Ware_307c.html" title="Andre Ware">Andre Ware</a> at quarterback. Unfortunately, the Lions started the season at 0-4, and quarterback <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Allen_5d67.html" title="Damon Allen">Damon Allen</a> was signed to replace <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Ware_307c.html" title="Andre Ware">Ware</a>. Stability in the front office proved short lived, as <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Skalbania_f47c.html" title="Nelson Skalbania">Skalbania</a> and his ownership group lost control of the team, and the Lions (again) went into receivership. The bright spot of the season was an exciting and improbable, 35-11 victory over <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Flutie_a740.html" title="Doug Flutie">Doug Flutie</a> and the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a>, in September, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_CFL_season_faf7.html" title="1996 CFL season">1996</a>. On October 31, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_CFL_season_faf7.html" title="1996 CFL season">1996</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a> businessman David Braley announced his intention to buy the team. November 2, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_CFL_season_faf7.html" title="1996 CFL season">1996</a> marked the end of the season as the Lions defeated <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa</a> 35-24 in what was the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Rough Riders</a>' final game in club history.</p>
<p>David Braley's ownership and a coaching change brought the Lions much needed stability as they entered the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_CFL_season_c64c.html" title="1997 CFL season">1997 season</a>, and some of that stability seemed to have translated to success on the field. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paopao_06a0.html" title="Joe Paopao">Joe Paopao</a> resigned prior to the season's start, and was replaced as Head Coach by <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Rita_8b3f.html" title="Adam Rita">Adam Rita</a>. The Lions made the playoffs for the 20th time in their 43 year club history, despite an 8-10, 4th place divisional finish. The Leos' <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_CFL_season_c64c.html" title="1997 CFL season">1997</a> playoff appearance marked the first time in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> history that a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Conference</a> team participated in an <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_East_Division_399b.html" title="Canadian Football League East Division">Eastern Conference</a> Semi-Final, under a then in force, "cross-over rule" (where the 4th place team from one division qualified for the playoffs, as long as the team earned more points than the 3rd place team from the opposing division. Once so qualified, the 4th place team would then "cross-over" to the other division to play the 2nd place team in the opposing division). The Lions thus faced <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal</a> in the Eastern semi-finals, eventually losing to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Alouettes</a>, 45-35, in a spirited contest. Fullback Sean Millington was awarded the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Canadian_Award_2b82.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Canadian Award">CFL's Outstanding Canadian Award</a> at season's end, while linebacker B.J. Gallis won the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Jackie Parker Trophy</a> as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Division</a>'s top rookie.</p>
<p>The Lions started the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_CFL_season_13ac.html" title="1998 CFL season">1998 season</a> off on the wrong foot, losing their first three games, before finally beating <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a> in Week 4. The defence held their own, but the offence struggled. The low point of the year occurred on August 9, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_CFL_season_13ac.html" title="1998 CFL season">1998</a>, when the eventual <a href="../../../8/6/t/86th_Grey_Cup_e3e8.html" title="86th Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> champion <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a> came into B.C. Place and beat the hometown Leos 55-9. With a record of 3-6-0, Head Coach <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Rita_8b3f.html" title="Adam Rita">Adam Rita</a> resigned, and was replaced by Greg Mohns. The no nonsense approach of Mohns seemed to spark the team, as the Lions embarked on a memorable, six game winning streak (which the team had not done since 1986) heading into the playoffs. The Lions, who finished 9-9 on the year, lost in the semi-finals to <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> in heartbreaking fashion, but showed promise for the upcoming season. Kicker Lui Passaglia won the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Dryburgh_Memorial_Trophy_759f.html" title="Dave Dryburgh Memorial Trophy">Dave Dryburgh Memorial Trophy</a> as the top scorer in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_West_Division_2b14.html" title="Canadian Football League West Division">Western Division</a>.</p>
<p>Expectations for the Lions were high as the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_CFL_season_0ab1.html" title="1999 CFL season">1999 season</a> began, following the team's promising finish a year earlier, and with the announcement that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> game would be played in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. Quality free agents such as slotback Don Blair and cornerback Eric Carter were brought in to add depth to an already impressive lineup, and with the likes of Robert Drummond and Jimmy “The Jet” Cunningham back in form following injury-plagued <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_CFL_season_13ac.html" title="1998 CFL season">1998 seasons</a>, the Lions were primed for a successful season. The Lions started fast out of the gate, winning their first three games to set a new club record with nine straight regular season wins. The Lions either held sole possession of first place or were tied with <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> throughout the season. The Lions ended the regular season with two straight wins, finishing first in the division with a 13-5 record, the Lions' best record since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_CFL_season_eb11.html" title="1985 CFL season">1985</a>, and the first divisional championship since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_CFL_season_71aa.html" title="1987 CFL season">1987</a>. Unfortunately, the Lions' dream season came to a premature and heartbreaking end, as the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Stamps</a> beat the Lions 26-24 in the Lions' first home playoff game in 12 years. The Lions fielded three CFL All-Stars in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_CFL_season_0ab1.html" title="1999 CFL season">1999</a>: slotback Jimmy Cunningham, centre Jamie Taras, and defensive tackle Johnny Scott.

<p>The Lions began the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_CFL_season_6c55.html" title="2000 CFL season">2000</a> campaign with only one goal in mind: win the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a>. Six months later, the Lions would fulfill that destiny, but the path to the 88th Grey Cup was one of the most adventurous, unpredictable, and memorable ever in CFL history. The year started well enough, with victories over <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a>, but a 35-2 loss to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> began a four-game losing streak and a lot of finger-pointing. A win over the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> halted the slide, but following the game, Head Coach Greg Mohns resigned to join the <a href="../../../x/f/l/XFL_352c.html" title="XFL">XFL</a>. Long-time CFL coach Steve Buratto, who joined the club only two weeks earlier as a receivers coach, was promoted to the top job, and got instant results with a huge 51-4 win over the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Argos</a> in the second of back-to-back games. Despite a promising start, the Lions only won one of their next five games to sit at 5-9 on Thanksgiving. Nevertheless, the Lions came together when it counted the most, winning three of their last four heading into the playoffs, and the offence jelling to become the best in the CFL that season. Quarterback <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Allen_5d67.html" title="Damon Allen">Damon Allen</a> broke <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Lancaster_6b85.html" title="Ron Lancaster">Ron Lancaster</a>'s CFL record for career passing yardage. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a> played in a memorable, “Luv Ya Lui” night at his final game at <a href="../../../b/2E/c/B.C._Place_Stadium_1f25.html" title="B.C. Place Stadium">B.C. Place</a>, and also set a CFL record for single season field goal percentage. The Lions finished the year 8-10 and in third place in the Western Division, but were the team other teams did not want to face in the playoffs. A snarly defence started to show its grit, and the Lions roared confidently into <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton</a> and emerged with a 34-32 Western Semi-Final victory. The Lions next faced <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in the Western Finals, and the Lions steamrolled to a decisive 37-23 win. The Leos' Cinderella season came to a close on November 26, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_CFL_season_6c55.html" title="2000 CFL season">2000</a> in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> at <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMahon_Stadium_6bfc.html" title="McMahon Stadium">McMahon Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary%2C_Alberta_79e8.html" title="Calgary, Alberta">Calgary</a>, as the Lions won their fourth championship in team history with a nail biting 28-26 victory over the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a>. Running back Robert Drummond won the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup%27s_Most_Valuable_Player_3365.html" title="Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player">Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player</a> award, while backfield teammate <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Millington_4b87.html" title="Sean Millington">Sean Millington</a> took home the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup%27s_Most_Valuable_Canadian_6c7f.html" title="Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian">Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian</a> trophy. The Lions' triumph marked the only time a sub-.500 regular season team won the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a>, and it signalled a marvellous end to <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a>'s outstanding, 25-year CFL career.</p>
<p>Expectations were high for the CFL champion Lions in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_CFL_season_ab9c.html" title="2001 CFL season">2001</a>, but the team ultimately never seemed to gel. Quarterback <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Allen_5d67.html" title="Damon Allen">Damon Allen</a> struggled, and the team hovered around the .500 mark all season. Finishing at 8-10, the Lions did make the playoffs, but were immediately bounced by <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary</a> in the Western Division Semi-Finals, 28-19. Matt Kellett became only the second full-time field goal kicker in 26 years, as he replaced the legendary Lui Passaglia. Rookie middle linebacker <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrin_Simpson_b918.html" title="Barrin Simpson">Barrin Simpson</a> led the team in tackles and was named a first-team <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_CFL_season_ab9c.html#2001_CFL_All-Stars" title="2001 CFL season">CFL All-Star</a>, as well as the CFL's Rookie of the Year and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Jackie Parker Trophy</a> winner.

<p>Bob Ackles returned to the Lions as President &amp; CEO before the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_CFL_season_9f62.html" title="2002 CFL season">2002 season</a>, which saw the Lions finish at 10-8 for a 3rd place finish in the Western Division, and the return of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Rita_8b3f.html" title="Adam Rita">Adam Rita</a> as Head Coach. The Lions faced <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> in the Western Semi-Finals, eventually falling, 30-3 to the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Bombers</a>.

<p><a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_CFL_season_29f3.html" title="2003 CFL season">2003</a> saw the Lions again change coaches, as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_Buono_ccbd.html" title="Wally Buono">Wally Buono</a> replaced <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Rita_8b3f.html" title="Adam Rita">Adam Rita</a> as Head Coach &amp; GM. The Lions also acquired former Stampeders and NFL QB <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Dickenson_13f8.html" title="Dave Dickenson">Dave Dickenson</a> through free agency, which prompted Lions QB Damon Allen to leave for the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a>. The Lions finished in a 3-way, 2nd place tie at 11-7 with Western Division foes, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers_6ce1.html" title="Winnipeg Blue Bombers">Winnipeg</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan</a>, and faced the Eastern Division's <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> by way of the CFL's "cross-over rule." The Lions closed out the season with a 28-7 loss to the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Argos</a> in the Eastern Division semi-finals. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrin_Simpson_b918.html" title="Barrin Simpson">Barrin Simpson</a> appeared as a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_CFL_season_29f3.html#2003_CFL_All-Stars" title="2003 CFL season">CFL All-Star</a> for the 3rd year in a row, joined by newcomers Ray Jacobs on defence, and electrifying slotback <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geroy_Simon_fc4a.html" title="Geroy Simon">Geroy Simon</a> on offence. Wide receiver Frank Cutolo won the CFL and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Parker_Trophy_1805.html" title="Jackie Parker Trophy">Western Division rookie of the year</a> awards. Offensive tackle Steve Hardin won the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Pate_Memorial_Award_c0f8.html" title="Tom Pate Memorial Award">CFL Player's Association Outstanding Community Service Award</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_CFL_season_8950.html" title="2004 CFL season">2004 season</a> marked one of the Lions' best regular season records in club history. Going 13-5 and finishing 1st in the division, the Lions set a team record of 8 consecutive wins in a single season. In addition to club records, the season brought an array of individual performances to the forefront. Quarterback <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Printers_81a7.html" title="Casey Printers">Casey Printers</a> set a CFL record for highest single game completion average of 90.9% (completing 20 of 22 passing attempts) during an August, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_CFL_season_8950.html" title="2004 CFL season">2004</a> game against <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_48c3.html" title="Hamilton Tiger-Cats">Hamilton</a>. Outstanding slot back <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geroy_Simon_fc4a.html" title="Geroy Simon">Geroy Simon</a> tied three team records by catching four touchdown passes in the same game. After the conclusion of the regular season, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Printers_81a7.html" title="Casey Printers">Printers</a> was named the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Player_Award_b82e.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Player Award">CFL's Most Outstanding Player</a>, while <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Clermont_0e55.html" title="Jason Clermont">Jason Clermont</a> won the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Canadian_Award_2b82.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Canadian Award">Most Outstanding Canadian</a> award. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Printers_81a7.html" title="Casey Printers">Printers</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geroy_Simon_fc4a.html" title="Geroy Simon">Simon</a> joined 4 time All-Star linebacker <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrin_Simpson_b918.html" title="Barrin Simpson">Barrin Simpson</a> as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_CFL_season_8950.html#2004_CFL_All-Stars" title="2004 CFL season">2004 CFL All-Stars</a>. The Lions, receiving a bye in the first round of the playoffs by virtue of their first place divisional finish, faced one of their biggest rivals, the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Saskatchewan Roughriders</a>. In a nail biting finish, the Lions defeated the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Roughriders_fed6.html" title="Saskatchewan Roughriders">Roughriders</a> 27-25, in overtime. The Lions were then pitted against the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Argonauts_d960.html" title="Toronto Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> in the <a href="../../../9/2/n/92nd_Grey_Cup_5dc2.html" title="92nd Grey Cup">92nd Grey Cup Championship</a>, a rematch of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_CFL_season_29f3.html" title="2003 CFL season">2003</a> semi-finals. The Lions would not exact their revenge, losing 27-19. <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Clermont_0e55.html" title="Jason Clermont">Jason Clermont</a> won the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_Most_Valuable_Canadian_746c.html" title="Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian">Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian</a> award in the effort.</p>
<p>Before and during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_CFL_season_42b3.html" title="2005 CFL season">2005 season</a> there was controversy as to which quarterback should be the starter, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Printers_81a7.html" title="Casey Printers">Casey Printers</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Dickenson_13f8.html" title="Dave Dickenson">Dave Dickenson</a>. Printers was the <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL%27s_Outstanding_Player_Award_b82e.html" title="CFL's Outstanding Player Award">CFL's 2004 season Most Outstanding Player</a>, but Dickenson was a veteran star destined for the CFL Hall of Fame. Many felt that both were deserving. In any event, the team ultimately chose to go with Dickenson, despite his having been somewhat injury prone. The Lions came out of the gate roaring. Led by Dickenson and an outstanding receiving corps, the team strung together 11 consecutive wins. The final game of the win streak came on September 17, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_CFL_season_42b3.html" title="2005 CFL season">2005</a>, when the Leos pulled off a stunning, fourth-quarter drive to beat the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a>, 27-26. The Lions bid for an undefeated season came to a halt the very next week on September 24, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_CFL_season_42b3.html" title="2005 CFL season">2005</a>, when the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Edmonton Eskimos</a> defeated the Lions 37-20 at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Stadium_%28Edmonton%29_1ae7.html" title="Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)">Commonwealth Stadium</a>. Dickenson sustained a season-ending concussion and Printers took over as starting QB. The Lions won only one of their remaining seven games of the regular season. On November 20th, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_CFL_season_42b3.html" title="2005 CFL season">2005</a>, the Lions lost in the Western Finals to the eventual <a href="../../../9/3/r/93rd_Grey_Cup_46a4.html" title="93rd Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> champion <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimos</a> at B.C. Place. The game ended with a controversial "non-call" on the last play of the game; as what would have been Printers' game winning pass to slotback <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geroy_Simon_fc4a.html" title="Geroy Simon">Geroy Simon</a> appeared to have been interfered with by a defending <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_2d4f.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos">Eskimo</a>, and was ruled incomplete.

<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_CFL_season_e9e1.html" title="2006 CFL season">2006 season</a> saw <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Printers_81a7.html" title="Casey Printers">Casey Printers</a> go off to the NFL's <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, however a new quarterback controversy of sorts threatened to develop. During the off-season 2005's third stringer, <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Pierce_9e5d.html" title="Buck Pierce">Buck Pierce</a> won the back-up role and early season injuries to <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Dickenson_13f8.html" title="Dave Dickenson">Dave Dickenson</a> forced him into action. Pierce's best game as the starter was on October 6 against the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Stampeders_dea9.html" title="Calgary Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a>, where he threw 25 for 31 for 297 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception. He began the game with one incomplete pass, and then hit his next 14. The Lions in the off-season also acquired former Roughrider <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCallum_bbc7.html" title="Paul McCallum">Paul McCallum</a> to stabilize the kicking game which had not recovered from <a href="../../../l/u/i/Lui_Passaglia_7fd6.html" title="Lui Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a>'s retirement in 2000. After a sluggish 2-3 start in 2006, Coach <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_Buono_ccbd.html" title="Wally Buono">Buono</a> signalled that no starting job was safe by releasing runningback <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Warren_1690.html" title="Antonio Warren">Antonio Warren</a> and defensive back <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Young_c39d.html" title="Sam Young">Sam Young</a>. The team responded by winning the next six games. New running back <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Smith_%28football_player%29_5d3b.html" title="Joe Smith (football player)">Joe Smith</a> ran for over 100 yards in his first game. <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Johnson_%28football_player%29_cb9d.html" title="Brent Johnson (football player)">Brent Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barron_Miles_0861.html" title="Barron Miles">Barron Miles</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Washington_138a.html" title="Mark Washington">Mark Washington</a> led a dominant defence, which itself saw 10 different defenders score touchdowns on turnovers. They also held opposition offences to 17 points or less on 6 occasions. Receiver <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geroy_Simon_fc4a.html" title="Geroy Simon">Geroy Simon</a> dominated opposing defensive backs not seen since <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mervyn_Fernandez_bca0.html" title="Mervyn Fernandez">Mervyn Fernandez</a> in the 1980s. The Lions clinched first place on October 6, earning a third straight bye into the Western Final at home, and tied a team record with a 13-5 mark for the season. 50,084 (league best for 2006) saw BC crush the Roughriders 45-18 in the West final. Looking fully recovered from earlier concussions, Dickenson went 27 for 37 with 3 TDs and no INTs. <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Jackson_88d5.html" title="Paris Jackson">Paris Jackson</a> made two circus catches for TDs, Jason Claremont bulled his way to 98 yards on 6 catches, Joe Smith scored twice and ran for 116 yards, McCallum was 5 for 5 in field goals, and the BC defence dominated Saskatchewan all afternoon.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19th</a>, the BC Lions captured their first <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_8cbb.html" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a> Championship since 2000 by defeating the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Alouettes_883e.html" title="Montreal Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a> 25-14 at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canad_Inns_Stadium_78c4.html" title="Canad Inns Stadium">Canad Inns Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg.html" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>. Dave Dickenson was named the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_Most_Valuable_Player_5499.html" title="Grey Cup Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a> of the game, while <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCallum_bbc7.html" title="Paul McCallum">Paul McCallum</a> was named the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Cup_Most_Valuable_Canadian_746c.html" title="Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian">Most Valuable Canadian</a>. In the post-game exuberence, the team snapped the Grey Cup off the lower base with the engraved names. The game is noted for kicker Paul McCallum going 6 for 6 in field goals, making him a perfect 11 for 11 in post season. Coach Buono also platooned the three quarterbacks: Dickenson, Pierce and third-string <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarious_Jackson_bf9c.html" title="Jarious Jackson">Jarious Jackson</a>.</p>
