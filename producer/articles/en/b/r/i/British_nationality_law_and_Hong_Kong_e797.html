<p><b>British nationality law</b> as it pertains to <b><a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a></b> have been a unique situation for ever since it was created a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_colony.html" title="British colony">British colony</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>. With its beginning as a trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial center, the territory has attracted <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugees.html" title="Refugees">refugees</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrants.html" title="Immigrants">immigrants</a> to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expatriate.html" title="Expatriate">expatriate</a> alike searching for a new life and making a new living.</p>
<p>Citizenship matters were further complicated by the fact that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British nationality law</a> had always considered those born in Hong Kong were <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> subjects (to use the term loosely), while the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> -- since its creation in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> -- has never recognised any type of British citizenship for those of Chinese descent. First, recognising British citizenships would imply the PRC and her predecessor <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qing.html" title="Qing">Qing</a> China validating the series of <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unequal_Treaties_26c2.html" title="Unequal Treaties">Unequal Treaties</a> that ceded Hong Kong. Secondly, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_6421.html" title="Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China">PRC nationality law</a> adopted in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> does not allow dual nationality.</p>
<p>With the sovereignty transfer to the PRC imminent in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, both the British and the Chinese governments had involved over a decade of negotiations trying to bring about a smooth transition in the government, the economy, and of course, determining citizenship status for almost 6 million people -- of Chinese descent and/or otherwise.</p>

<p><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_common_law.html" title="English common law">English common law</a> has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, that which was acquired because British-born subjects would have a "natural allegiance" to the crown as a "debt of gratitude" to the crown for protecting them through infancy. In the spirit of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Jus_soli.html" title="Jus soli">jus soli</a>, natural-born subjects were born within the dominion of the crown which included self-governing dominions and colonies. As the dominion of the crown expanded, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_subject.html" title="British subject">British subjects</a> included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the British Empire. However, the reverse reasoning would mean that no <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalisation.html" title="Naturalisation">naturalisation</a> was possible until the introduction of Naturalisation Acts of <a href="../../../1/8/4/1844.html" title="1844">1844</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1847.html" title="1847">1847</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>.</p>
<p>By this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong since <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a> was a British subject. That of course, depended where and when one was born in the territory because the British jurisdiction of Hong Kong did not expand to its current size until <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a> with the leasing of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Territories_e5a9.html" title="New Territories">New Territories</a>.</p>
<p><i>Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847</i> validated what had been covered in <i>Naturalisation Act 1844</i> (applied only to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>) to the rest of the dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing acquring British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a British subject man.</p>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Commonwealth_fe44.html" title="The Commonwealth">The Commonwealth</a> heads of government decided in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the self-governing <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominions.html" title="Dominions">dominions</a> would each adopt separate national citizenships, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. <i>British Nationality Act 1948</i> provided for a new status of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC), consisting of all those British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title Commonwealth citizen.</p>
<p>The Act came into force on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> and stipulated that anyone born in "United Kingdom or a colony" ie: Hong Kong on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British Subjects on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> was entitled to acquire CUKC by declaration. The deadline for this was originally <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, but was extended to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> by the <i>British Nationality Act 1958</i>.</p>
<p>British Nationality Acts were passed in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, which mainly fine tuned special provisions about CUKC acquisition.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law_and_Hong_Kong_e797.html" title="Edit section: Commonwealth Immigrants Acts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commonwealth Immigrants Acts</span></h3>
<p>Until the <i><a href="http://www.britishcitizen.info/CIA1962.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.britishcitizen.info/CIA1962.pdf" rel="nofollow">Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962</a></i>, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the <i>Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962</i> and <i><a href="http://www.britishcitizen.info/CIA1968.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.britishcitizen.info/CIA1968.pdf" rel="nofollow">Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968</a></i> tightened immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom and Islands (the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).</p>
<p>Finally in the <i><a href="http://www.britishcitizen.info/IA1971.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.britishcitizen.info/IA1971.pdf" rel="nofollow">Immigration Act 1971</a></i>, the concept of patriality or <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_abode.html" title="Right of abode">right of abode</a> was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected to the United Kingdom and Islands. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was recognised as only a temporary solution to halt sudden wave of migration. The British government embarked on a major reform of the law, resulting in the <i>British Nationality Act 1981</i>.</p>
<p>These Acts shaped the already increasing restrictive immigration policies into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration_605f.html" title="Sino-British Joint Declaration">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>

<p><i>British Nationality Act 1981</i> was monumental in not only did it created new categories of British citizenship, but also effectively renamed British colonial territories. The Act implied that all British colonial possessions were to be known as British Dependent Territories.</p>
<p>The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of citizenship on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>British citizenship,</li>
<li>British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC), and</li>
<li>British Overseas citizenship (BOC).</li>
</ul>
<p>The law implied that those who have CUKC in connection with Hong Kong or those born in Hong Kong in or after <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> has BDTC. The law also stated that citizens by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Dependent Territories. BDTCs could not generally be passed on to a child.</p>

<p>Negotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong had started in the late 1970s between Britain and the PRC as the lease on New Territories would end in about 20 years. With the signing of the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration_605f.html" title="Sino-British Joint Declaration">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the future of Hong Kong was set, when the PRC would assume sovereignty of the entire ceded territory of Hong Kong on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>.</p>
<p>The Declaration set in motion a series of negotiations between the British and Chinese governments to ensure a smooth transition. Nevertheless, the future of Hong Kong under <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">PRC</a> rule had continued to create uncertainties for Hong Kong residents. It also prompted a series of British Nationality Acts passed specically for Hong Kong starting in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to control what would be significant migration from the territory to the United Kingdom and elsewhere as well as putting confidence in the people.</p>
<p>There were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong. Another 2 million other were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. Upon handover, they would have lost this status and became solely <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationality_law.html" title="Chinese nationality law">PRC citizens</a>. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants, many of whom were well-educated, financially resourceful, and with family connections all over the world. This created possibilities that allowed hundreds of thousands people to emigrate in the 80s and 90s even with the new British nationality law restrictions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the PRC had and still considers that anyone of Chinese descent born in Hong Kong has always been solely a Chinese citizen.</p>

<p>The 1985 Act was brought into effect by the <a href="http://www.britishcitizen.info/HKBNO1986.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.britishcitizen.info/HKBNO1986.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986</a>. Article 4(1) of the Order provided that on and after <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, there would be a new form of British nationality, the holders of which would be known as British Nationals (Overseas). Article 4(2) of the Order provided that adults and minors who had a connection to Hong Kong were entitled to make an application to become British Nationals (Overseas) by <i>registration</i>.</p>
<p>Becoming a British National (Overseas) was therefore not an automatic nor an involuntary process and indeed many eligible people who had the requisite connection with Hong Kong never applied to become British Nationals (Overseas). Acquisition of the new status had to be voluntary and therefore a conscious act. To make it involuntary or automatic would have been contrary to the assurances given to the PRC government which led to the words "eligible to" being used in paragraph (a) of the <a href="http://www.info.gov.hk/trans/jd/jd6.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.info.gov.hk/trans/jd/jd6.htm" rel="nofollow">United Kingdom Memorandum</a> to the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration_605f.html" title="Sino-British Joint Declaration">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a>. Any person who failed to register as a British Nationals (Overseas) by <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and would thereby be rendered stateless, automatically became a British Overseas citizen under <a href="http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf" rel="nofollow">article 6(1) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986</a>.</p>
<p>No person could become a British National (Overseas) automatically by being born in Hong Kong, by descent or by any involuntary means. A person was required to make an application on the prescribed form to the British authorities, and applicants only became a British National (Overseas) when their application was approved and duly registered under the authority of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a>. The deadline for applications passed in 1997.</p>
<p>British Nationals (Overseas) are <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_citizen.html" title="Commonwealth citizen">Commonwealth citizens</a> so they enjoy most civic rights in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. They are also eligible for a free-of-charge Residence Permit if they wish to study in the UK <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1065717801153" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1065717801153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the PRC Government does not recognise British National (Overseas) or British citizen passports issued to former Hong Kong British Dependent Territories citizens that are <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalities_of_China_1eb0.html" title="Nationalities of China">ethnically Chinese</a> (or possess Chinese nationality), who must obtain a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Return_Permit_3f25.html" title="Home Return Permit">Home Return Permit</a> to enter mainland China. The <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China (Taiwan)</a> only fully recognises British citizens but does not recognise British Nationals (Overseas) (who are ethnic Chinese). BN(O)s (and <a href="../../../h/k/s/HKSAR_passport_ce95.html" title="HKSAR passport">HKSAR passport</a> holders) need a landing visa specific for them to enter <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> but British Citizens are eligible for the full visa free access programme. (See <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entry_Permit_of_HK_and_Macao_Residents_%28Republic_of_China_on_Taiwan%29_eb45.html" title="Entry Permit of HK and Macao Residents (Republic of China on Taiwan)">Entry Permit of HK and Macao Residents (Republic of China on Taiwan)</a>) Taiwan also does not fully recognise the British nationality of naturalised British citizens who were born in China (the PRC). They have additional hurdles to clear under Taiwanese law before being granted residence visas for Taiwan. British Nationals (Overseas) are not eligible to participate in the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visa_Waiver_Program_c3c9.html" title="Visa Waiver Program">Visa Waiver Program</a> of the United States. But this passport is eligible for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Travel_Authority_f457.html" title="Electronic Travel Authority">Electronic Travel Authority</a> of Australia, with the restriction that BN(O)s cannot apply online.</p>

Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British Government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs — but this request was never accepted. However, in view of Britain's special obligation to Hong Kong as the one dependent territory whose people were unable to exercise the fundamental right of self-determination, it was considered necessary to devise a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Nationality_Selection_Scheme_94bc.html" title="British Nationality Selection Scheme">British Nationality Selection Scheme</a> to enable some of the population to obtain British citizenship to maintain confidence in Hong Kong and to counteract the effects of the emigration of many of its most talented residents. The United Kingdom made provision to grant citizenship to 50,000 families whose presence was important to the future of Hong Kong under the <a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900034_en_1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900034_en_1.htm" rel="nofollow">British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990</a>.

<p><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationality_law.html" title="Chinese nationality law">Chinese nationality law</a> has applied in Hong Kong since the handover on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. Hong Kong BDTC status had ceased to exist and could not be retained. The PRC nationality law was adopted for Hong Kong at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">15 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). In other words, Hong Kong residents of Chinese nationality do not lose their citizenship upon acquiring foreign one(s) in contrast to Article 9 of the law.</p>
<p>Officially, the PRC continues to recognise only Chinese citizenship for its Chinese nationals. Any type of the British and foreign citizenships owned by Chinese nationals are not recognised by the Chinese government and no foreign consular service would be enjoyed by Chinese nationals in Chinese territory. That being said, many Chinese nationals have gained entry into China holding foreign travel documents with proper entry visas without encountering any problem or having to denounce one nationality or the other.</p>
<p>Dual nationality does not constitute a concern for the British government.</p>

<p>In February 2006, British authorities announced that six hundred <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf" rel="nofollow">British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused</a>.

Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request. No additional fee will be payable by the applicant in such cases.
