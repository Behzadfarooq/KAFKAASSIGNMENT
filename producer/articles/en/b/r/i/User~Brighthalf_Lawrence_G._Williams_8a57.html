<p>Williams was born on September 15, 1913 in Pittsburgh, Pa., moved into Philadelphia in 1922 and settled in Springfield in 1939. After serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Corp during World War II, he served as chairman of the fundraising committee for the Springfield ambulance corps. He quickly showed his organizing and financial skills by raising $8,600, exceeding the goal of $6,500. Under his direction, not only was an ambulance purchased, but the entire ambulance corps was organized. He then became involved with the formation of the Springfield Betterment Association and organized several civic groups into the Council of Civic Associations in 1949, serving as its first president. He attended Drexel University and was employed by Curtis Publishing Company from 1936 to 1966, having attained the position of assistant to the vice president for manufacturing. Elected township commissioner from the First Ward as an independent Republican in 1951, he was re-elected in 1955 (877 to 359), 1959 (1,115 to 377) and 1963 (1,374 to 384). In 1958, he was elected chairman of the Springfield Republican Party and, three years later, was elected president of the township board of commissioners. He was appointed a member of the Delaware County Board of Republican Supervisors (War Board) in 1958 by John McClure, the undisputed GOP county boss since the 1920's. By 1959, he was controversial enough to be referred to by the Springfield Democratic chairman as "Mr. Republican No. 2 in the county". In 1960, when Vice President Richard Nixon visited Springfield during a campaign swing for president, Williams shook hands with the local residents, with one commenting: "He's almost as famous as Nixon". In 1959, as head of the Springfield GOP, his press release stated that the Board of Commissioners "steered the township through a period of phenomenal growth, protected the fine residential character of the community (and) provided outstanding municipal service...with only modest tax increases for needed improvements..." Williams also cited Springfield's successful opposition in 1956 and 1957 to the proposed Yellow Route, the predecessor to the Blue Route. (The latter was finally opened in 1991 as Interstate I-476, after decades of lawsuits, hearings and delays.) The route that Williams opposed would have brought the expressway through the center of Springfield and other populated towns. The alternative path that the state finally chose had the highway, for the most part, skirting major population and town centers. He also pushed for the large volume of parkland acquisition by the township in the 1950's, which gave Springfield "an unusually high ratio of 10 acres of parks for each 1000 persons". Other accomplishments were the acquisition of the land, as well as the building of the Township municipal building and library. In 1956, he helped plan and support the township acquisition of the Springfield Country Club complex, consisting of a golf course, clubhouse, ice skating rink and swimming facilities. He also played a major role in rewriting and updating the township zoning and building codes. Reflecting his interest in regional affairs, he served as the Delaware County representative on the policy committee of the Penn-Jersey Transportation Study from 1959 to 1966 and also on the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.</p>
<p><b>1959 - 1963: The Al Swing Insurgency</b></p>
<p>The late fifties and early sixties saw a growing political restiveness in Delaware County, as John McClure's declining health took its toll on his leadership abilities. In 1959, Sheriff Bob Watkins and Radnor Tax Collector Albert W. Swing were elected county commissioners, along with Democrat William A. Welsh. Not long after he took office, Swing found himself in opposition to fellow commissioner Watkins, as well as a group of fellow War Board members, composed of Williams, Fred Duke, Mayor Eyre, and Congressman Milliken, as well as Sam Dickey, GOP chairman of populous Upper Darby Township, who was not yet an official member of the Board. Williams' leadership abilities came into play, as he became the "spokesman" for the "Big Five". As the feud escalated, Swing was criticized by the "Big Five" and other opponents for keeping the lucrative tax collector's position, while holding county office. During this critical period of party disunity, the following major events occurred:</p>
<p>1961 - In March, Swing was sued by the "Big Five" to force his removal from the tax collector's position. In May, Swing retaliated against Williams by voting with Democrat Welsh to rescind previously approved county funding for a drainage project on the street where Williams' home was located. Springfield Township then filed suit against the county.</p>
<p>1962 - In March, at the same War Board meeting where Milliken was endorsed for a third term in Congress, the "voluntary" decision of Swing not to run again for state committeeman was reported. Broadmeadows Prison Warden John I. Gable of Newtown was endorsed for the largely honorary position. At a caucus meeting of the county commissioners, Watkins charged that Swing physically assaulted him and stated: "For two years and three months I've tried to get along with him. But now I'm just going to go along the road alone as a commissioner." In September, Swing and Welsh voted over Watkins' objections to remove Williams as the county representative on the Penn-Jersey Transportation Study Group. Williams, a Blue Route supporter, was replaced by an opponent of the highway. In October, The commissioners voted two to one to remove Watkins as board chairman, replacing him with Swing. Watkins unsuccessfully sued to recover his position. A month later, the State Supreme Court upheld Swing's right to hold both elected positions of county commissioner and tax collector. The county commissioners vote to go on record opposing the Blue Route. Both Swing and Welsh's hometowns had strong opposition to the highway. Welsh accused the administration of the county's home for the aged, Fair Acres, of admitting those not genuinely indigent.</p>
<p>1963 - In March, The War Board dumps both Swing and Watkins for reelection, endorsing former Sheriff Frank Snear of Media and Harry A. McNichol, general manager of the John McClatchy Organization, which built most of 69th Street in Upper Darby Township. At the meeting, the ailing McClure stays in bed, interviewing each War Board member, finally asking Francis Catania and Joe Eyre to present his selections to the full War Board. Watkins commented to the News, "Senator McClure put me in... and he took me out. That's politics." Swing files for reelection stating that he was "protecting" McClure's interests by running, instead blaming his dumping on Dickey. "Sam Dickey has convinced McClure that it is politically expedient to dump me. Sam Dickey is out to take over Delaware County and he is not the best type of individual to be interested in controlling our county government. I am the representative of good government, and the choice is between me and the Big Five." Eyre, in his capacity as county GOP chairman, announces that Swing has been dismissed from the War Board, accusing the latter of "seeking to supplant" McClure and "perpetuate his own brand of political panhandling" by holding two elected positions with a combined salary of nearly $50,000.</p>
<p>In April, A management consultant survey of county government, which had been authorized over Watkins' objections, is released and calls for abandoning political patronage hiring, going to civil service, reassessing all county properties every ten years, maintaining open space, reforming the management of Fair Acres, and consolidating some departments and positions. There is no indication whether the recommendations will be approved. Swing charges that county employees are being "coerced into political contributions", otherwise known as macing. He blames the practice on the "Duke-Dickey-Williams machine" and vows to turn over to the district attorney any evidence of this practice.</p>
<p>An executive committee is formed to support Swing's reelection bid. It includes Reid S. Cordier, who is running against Williams for township commissioner; Robert B. Miller of Radnor, Swing's campaign chairman; Harry Eastburn, former leader in Marple Township; Alfred S. MacFarland, former leader in Collingdale and Richard S. Krick of Radnor, chairman of the county Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes. Meanwhile, Snear charges that Swing "recently offered to recognize Samuel R. Dickey as Republican leader of Delaware County in return for his support in this election." Planning a review of county insurance practices, Swing states the current situation had left "a single individual holding all the insurance policies on our public buildings." He charges that $62,000 of premiums is being handled "solely by John J. McClure". Eyre counters, stating that Swing is a "pious political phony" and has lost "forever the right to both call himself a Republican and appeal to the party's voters" by appointing three top county Democratic leaders to county jobs, along with MacFarland.</p>
<p>Swing's ally, Krick, orders special assessors to conduct "an investigation of assessment practices in Springfield". Krick immediately doubles the assessment of the municipally-owned Springfield Country Club to $70,200, causing Williams and township treasurer Louis Wagner to cry foul. Eight assessors, including two from Springfield that were close to Williams, are fired, but immediately rehired by the County Commissioners due to a technicality. Williams, in responding to attacks from his Republican primary opponent, Cordier, says that he had no designs on county office and "my lack of political ambition is well-known to everyone but Swing and his puppets." Cordier states that he decided to run against Williams because the latter was "a tool of the McClure Machine and would do anything to further his political ambitions". He says that Williams' "continued control over the Springfield Republican Party can lead only to its destruction."</p>
<p>In May, Swing, again over the vehement objections of Watkins, names an "ethics committee", headed by Charles A. McCafferty, president of Riddle Memorial Hospital. Its purpose is to look into the issue of county employees who were doing business with the county, such as an assessor who was selling tires to the county. Watkins calls the appointment "ramrod, unjust, unethical and illegal..." As one of the most bitter election campaigns in county history drew to a conclusion, Welsh charges that widespread gambling exists in Delaware County. He says he has proof that a "big operation" existed in Upper Darby, along with Chester, and would turn over such information to the state attorney general. Watkins denies the accusations, stating: "There is no evidence of widespread gambling and crime in this county and whenever criminals are brought to court for misdeeds committed within county boundaries, they are usually the riffraff from Philadelphia." Swing releases his "six point program for county government", which consists of a county crime commission, a self-financed regional transportation authority, an ethics commission, open space acquisition, an overall study of hiring procedures and a full time industrial development specialist. In spite of all of the fury and effort, Swing receives a humiliating 23,000 votes to the 62,000-plus average vote for Snear and McNichol. He only scores well in his hometown of Radnor, 3,500 to about 1,300, perhaps due to his opposition to the Blue Route, which is unpopular in that town. He loses Williams' Springfield four to one; Eyre's Chester and Duke's Clifton Heights four-and-a-half to one, as well as Dickey's Upper Darby three-and-a-half to one. Williams, who was never in any danger of losing in his own home ward, trounces Cordier 1,176 to 278.</p>
<p><b>1965 - Local Issues Heat Up</b></p>
<p>Spring - The three candidates that Williams and the Springfield GOP have endorsed for the School Board, in an effort to fight the Morton merger, are elected: William C. Hollibaugh, Richard D. Carter and James G. Windsor. In a crucial test of power for Williams and his organization, the three candidates receive 3,037, 2,872, and 2,450 to their independent opponents' totals of 1,798, 1,389, 1,327 and 793. Russell, Samuel and Leslie Green of Springfield apply for a building permit to build a restaurant on their mother's property at 754 Baltimore Pike. The permit is rejected and a messy three-year legal battle soon begins.</p>
<p>Summer - Williams states in writing to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board that the Greens' permit request should be rejected due an "excessive number of liquor licenses" in the area. On the same day, he personally testifies in favor of the license request of another bar on the same street situated on a property co-owned by Fred Duke and the wife of the vice president of the L.G. Williams for Congress Committee.</p>
<p>Fall - Williams asks the school board to meet privately with the township commissioners regarding the merger. Instead, the school directors hold a public meeting, which Williams attends, stating: "I asked for a private meeting with the school board. This was my answer." Williams argues that the increased number of school children from Morton would cost Springfield residents added taxes. He foresees the building of apartments and the depreciation of "dilapidated homes" in Morton as the reason for the economic harm that Springfield would suffer. He denies that there is an issue with the 80% of Morton's students that are black and would be attending Springfield schools. The Springfield Republican chairman also tells Dale Frye, the president of the Springfield Education Association, a teacher's union, that as an employee of the school district, the latter has no right to speak. The school board votes four to three to appeal to Dauphin County Court and a group of residents, many of whom are township Republican workers, form COME (Committee Opposing the Merger Effort). Williams denies charges of prejudice, stating: "The race of the Morton students has no bearing on this question." The Rev. Peter Young, of St. Paul's United Church of Christ, charges that "political pressure" was behind the appeal. "I was and am very concerned that the consequences of this political involvement in school board affairs will work to the detriment of the children and the youth of both communities," he further states. The Rev. Wallace Stetler of the Covenant Methodist Church submits a statement to the Board signed by 21 ministers and one rabbi in support of the merger.</p>
<p>The president of COME, Peter Rimmer counters: "I think our local ministers should devote their efforts to the spiritual concerns of this community and stop meddling in community affairs." War Board Chairman Snear comes out strongly against the school reorganization plans. "Nobody wants this except some school officials trying to spread out the high tax load over several municipalities so that one district doesn't stand out with heavy taxes," states the staunch ally of Williams.</p>
<p>The request from the Sportsmen's Club for a zoning exception is approved the same night by the Zoning Board. The county Democratic Party, in its platform, calls for a seven to eleven member county "legislature" directed by an elected "county executive". The Democrats declare that the record of the "tired, old self-perpetuating...War Board makes it clear it cannot meet the challenges of a process of deterioration which has already set in." The minority party also calls for a "county highway advisory board", a county health department, a county welfare department, centralized collection of municipal taxes and county coordination of police statistics and crime prevention. GOP chairman Bullen refers to the Democrats as having "labored on a mountain of promises and brought forth a molehill...Republicans stand for fiscal responsibility, honesty in government and promising what they can deliver."</p>
<p>The Green's request for a zoning exception is rejected, due to the application not being signed or notarized. Only seventeen days later, the commissioners begin hearings on a zoning change that would disqualify the Green property. Samuel Green appears, calling the amendment "discriminatory, unreasonable, harsh and unconstitutional."</p>
<p><b>1966 - Williams Moves Up</b></p>
<p>Winter - The commissioners adopt the proposed E-Business zoning amendment, which requires a 250-foot wide frontage for certain buildings, a total area of 125,000 square feet, with no more than 40 per cent of the lot covered by a building. The 2.8-acre Green lot has only a 200-foot frontage and its depth of 350 feet leaves it short of the 125,000-foot requirement. The old ordinance had no limits on the size of the lot or the frontage and only required a building to not take more than 60 per cent of the property. Former congressman Milliken announces his resignation from the War Board, citing the lack of a "representative process" in making decisions. In his letter of resignation, he further stated: "The needs of the people in this county are growing and the burden of meeting them cannot be carried without the voice of a political organization open to all." War Board chairman Snear replied: "There are plenty of indications from the people in the districts the supervisors represent indicating closer cooperation than ever before. Milliken's statements, in that respect, are an extreme fallacy." After flirting with a third party candidacy, Milliken becomes a candidate in the GOP primary. As to the War Board's candidate, the names mentioned in political circles are: Bullen, Upper Darby attorney Stephen McEwen, and Williams.</p>
<p>Spring - Williams is endorsed by the War Board for the open 7th District seat, stating: "I expect my congressional duties will require my full time attention. There's only one way I know to campaign and that's hard." The Democrats endorse John J. Logue of Swarthmore, a Villanova University political science professor.</p>
<p>Collingdale mayor and county clerk of courts, William E. Ruthrauff Jr. is appointed to the War Board. After the Springfield School Board votes, four to three, to accept Morton students on a tuition basis, the Board of Commissioners officially endorses COME. This action is then condemned by local clergymen, led by the Rev. Peter Young, of St. Paul's United Church of Christ. "I continue to abhor the interference of the commissioners in school board affairs," Rev. Young states. The clergy members, including representatives of Springfield's three Catholic churches, issue a joint statement asserting their right to speak out on moral issues.</p>
<p>Barely two years after the historic Civil Rights Act began the defection of white conservatives from the Democratic party, two small signs of the ultimate alignment of both parties in the Deep South were showing. Two moderate groups, Republicans for Progress and Republicans for Advance issue a joint statement advising the GOP to take action to reverse the trend toward "lily-white" party organizations in some southern states. The groups laud the Republican parties in North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas and Virginia, but decry the segregated parties in Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama. Three months earlier, the Alabama Democratic state committee had voted to change its slogan from "White Supremacy for the Right" to "Democrats for the Right". One Democratic state party member, Charles McKay, Jr., said the party "cannot afford to take a stick and run off a prospective 150,000 to 175,000 [African-American and Euro-American civil rights supporters] who might vote Democratic." The Springfield Zoning Board rejects the Greens' second request for an exception, citing the new zoning amendment and the Greens appeal to the county court.</p>
<p>In a low-key election, Williams trounces Milliken in the Republican primary, 43,719 to 19,443. Milliken manages to carry only Morton, Swarthmore, Sharon Hill and Tinicum. Logue defeats his challenger, Carl Barus, a fellow professor, in the Democratic primary. Barus had opposed U.S. policy in Vietnam. Lt. Governor Raymond P. Shafer, Republican, is nominated for governor, and Milton Shapp beats Bob Casey for the Democratic nod. Logue suggests that the 30% vote that Milliken received "may signal the beginning of the end for the Republican War Board". He predicts the November election would be "a referendum on the War Board since the Republican candidate (Williams) is 'Mr. War Board'."</p>
<p>Fall - Logue is endorsed by the Delaware County AFL-CIO Council, along with state senator Bell and the Democrats running for state legislature. Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, along with Shapp and Logue tour Delaware County. At the Bazaar of All Nations in Clifton Heights, a crowd of 5,000 comes to hear the senator. At the Alpine Inn in Springfield, 500 Democrats pay $50 to hear the senator and candidates. Kennedy quips: "You may wonder why a Senator from Massachusetts is here campaigning for John Logue for Congress. When a Harvard man like me travels hundreds of miles to campaign for a Yale man (Logue), it certainly shows how much I think of him." Logue predicts a "revolution in the suburbs similar to those in other parts of the United States" regarding the need to defeat the War Board. Shapp tells the crowd: "John F. Kennedy almost made this a Democratic county in 1960, and in 1964 LBJ made it one." Further, he states: "The Democratic party thinks in terms of people. The Republican Party thinks in terms of special interests, as it always has."</p>
<p>Both candidates are interviewed by local branches of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Their positions on the major issues of the day are remarkably similar. On Vietnam, Logue strongly supports President Johnson's policies and the civilian government of Premiere Ky. Williams cautiously states that "we can accomplish our military objectives without indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam" and favors negotiations with all parties involved, including the Viet Cong. Regarding admitting Red China to the United Nations, both candidates are in opposition. Logue believes that the administration's poverty programs should not suffer due to the war, while Williams feels that if waste in the program were eliminated, the nation could finance both a war on poverty and a war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Both candidates also were opposed to abolishing the House Un-American Activities Committee, believing that it served a useful investigatory purpose. On civil rights, there are sharp differences, however: Williams opposes the attempt to pass a fair housing law, stating that the issue could be handled on a local level. Logue supports the civil rights bill that had passed the House that year. In his campaign literature, Williams echoes the national GOP stands by promising to "fight against inflation", work for "a balanced Federal Budget", fight the "increase of crime and violence which is a reflection of the moral decay of our government", and work to obtain "a fair share of our Federal tax dollars to this region". Williams is elected to Congress, beating Logue, 101,042 to 58,766.</p>
<p>Republicans also make sharp gains in Congress and governorships, as national discontent grows against President Johnson's Vietnam war policies. They gain forty-seven seats in the House and four in the Senate. The new lineup will reduce the Democrats' majority to 248 to 187 in the House and 64 to 36 in the Senate. Shafer handily defeats Shapp for governor, 2.110 million votes to 1.868 million, a margin of 242,000 votes. The GOP candidate also carries Delaware County, 140,225 to 74,418, an unusually strong showing. He sweeps the suburbs by 171,000 votes and only loses Philadelphia by 110,000 votes, in this very Republican year. Shafer will be the last governor bound by the one-term limit of the existing state constitution. Locally, Williams is the township's chief witness against the Greens during a hearing before President Judge Henry G. Sweney of the county court.</p>
<p><b>1967 - Freshman in Congress with a powerbase at home</b></p>
<p>Winter - Williams resigns as Springfield Township commissioner, but remains as township GOP chairman and member of the War Board. His resignation takes place in front of an audience of eighty at his last commissioner's meeting. Commissioners took turns praising Williams' service to the township. The new board president, Robert Simpson, states: "he'll be back on weekends and available to us for wise council." Williams' successor to his commissioner's seat, Leonard Dickerson, says there will be "big boots to fill". Williams jokes that he had to do a good job as commission president "because I followed Lou Wagner. I learned a lot from Lou, both good and bad, but Lou insisted that I learned just the good from him." He also says that Simpson is "the finest man I have ever met."</p>
<p>His district office is in the Springfield Municipal Building, enabling him to keep in close proximity with his Springfield power base and still call all the shots in local decision-making. When he is sworn into office, along with Watkins, who was reelected to his second term, Delaware County has the rare distinction of having two residents serving in Congress at the same time. He wastes no time in establishing himself as a hawk on the Vietnam issue. He refuses to give full support to LBJ's policies "because I think that there is entirely too much political interference. The matter, at this stage, should be primarily a military problem." Watkins, on the other hand, declares: "I support the President all the way through." Delaware County's two congressmen also differ on Johnson's tax surcharge request, with Williams in opposition, but Watkins in favor "because of the cost of Vietnam."</p>
<p>On the tenth of January, Williams is sworn in and is joined in Washington by 800 of his supporters. Sixteen charter buses carry guests from the Springfield Country Club at 10 a.m. and return at 1:30 a.m. the following morning. Williams, as the master of ceremonies, introduces most members of the War Board who are in attendance. Governor-elect Shafer praises Williams and the county GOP and Nixon also makes a speech before the throngs of loyalists. Some observers say that this is the largest turnout in memory for a member of Congress. When Congress convenes, Democrat John McCormick is reelected Speaker over Gerald Ford by a 246 to 186 vote. The Democratic House caucus removes Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, an African-American and Democrat from New York, from his chairmanship of the Education and Labor committee. Powell, who was charged with using public funds for private trips, calls the action a "lynching - Northern style." The full House, with Williams in support, refuses to seat Powell, until the select committee investigating him has completed its work.</p>
<p>Locally, three commissioners boycott the reorganization committee of the Marple Township commissioners. Democrats Ron Fertel and J. Pepper Goslin, as well as maverick Republican Percy Berkowitz, stage their protest "to focus attention on one-man rule that exists in Marple." The focus of their ire is township GOP chairman, Walter ReDavid. Williams calls for the State and Defense Departments to sanction an invasion of mainland China by 600,000 troops from Nationalist China to "overthrow the Communist regime there and take some pressure off our troops in Vietnam." He states that from 1946 to 1965, the U.S. had given $4.75 billion in assistance to Nationalist China and "there should be some return from the substantial investment the American taxpayers have made in Taiwan."</p>
<p>Judge Sweney upholds the Greens' appeal, stating: "The township is guilty of discriminatory zoning practices against the Greens." The following month, the township appeals to the Pennsylvania supreme court. A fifteen-year-old sophomore attending school in the Haverford School District is suspended for having hair "longer than many a girl," as described by school officials. The parents sue the school district and a hearing is held before Judge Louis Bloom. The school disciplinarian describes "hair down to collar in back," "long sideburns," and "long locks were combed over his right eye." Further, he states: "long hair is associated with things we read about in newspapers..." The student agrees a week later to trim his hair.</p>
<p>Spring - Williams introduces a bill to establish a twelve member Select Committee of Standards of Conduct, with one purpose being to enforce the disclosure of assets, liabilities, and honorariums for members, spouses and staff members making over $15,000. Williams votes against an attempt to recommit the $4.5 billion supplemental defense appropriations bill for the Vietnam War to committee with instructions that no funds would be used to attack North Vietnam. The move fails, 18 to 372, in an early test of Congressional sentiment on the expanding war.</p>
<p>Dissent among Democrats in Congress grows against the administration's Vietnam policies. In a speech on the Senate floor, Robert F. Kennedy asks for a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam as a gesture towards peace talks. Secretary of State Dean Rusk replies that such a proposal has been tried before "without result." It is reported in Time Magazine that Kennedy, during a meeting with Johnson the previous month to discuss their differences over Vietnam, referred to the President as an "s.o.b." Johnson reportedly had told Kennedy that "if you keep talking like this, you won't have a political future in this country within six months" and "the blood of American boys will be on your hands." Kennedy denies the story: "I don't want to talk about that." Johnson administration participants in the meeting also issue denials.</p>
<p>Locally, Paul R. Sand is sworn in to replace Jacques H. Fox, who had resigned as District Attorney to take the post of general counsel for the state Department of Public Welfare. Williams speaks before the Marple Veterans of Foreign Wars at the Paxon Hollow County Club and again pushes his hawkish war stance. "Any war worth fighting is a war worth winning," Williams states. The congressman also declares that he is "sick and tired of hearing President Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara talking about fighting a controlled war." State Representative Rocco O'dorisio dies at age 66, of phlebitis and diabetes. He was in his fifth term in the state House and also was a Radnor Township commissioner since 1950. In May, 1964, he had been named to the War Board to replace John G. Pew, but resigned the post in September, 1965. Williams and the War Board oppose the proposed state constitutional convention to update the state constitution. He states: "Today there are very strong forces favoring and advocating regional government." Williams and Snear go on record supporting incremental reform of the state constitution, amendment by amendment.</p>
<p>In the primary election, the question of the convention passes statewide about three to two, but loses in Delaware County by 44,000 to 41,000 votes. For the Democratic nod for county commissioner, Edward McErlean and Wilton Bunce beat William Welsh, tallying 10,626, 8,320, and 6,694, respectively. Welsh has been an outspoken critic of the War Board and county government practices. Both of Williams' endorsed candidates, Annamae McKee and Robert E. Pemberton, handily win the GOP nomination for school board. Both have pledged their opposition to the merger. A bill to extend the Selective Service for four years, passes, 362 to 9. Williams votes for the measure, which also restricts presidential authority to institute a draft lottery and make other changes. Sand is endorsed by the War Board to replace Common Pleas Judge Thomas A. Curran, who died.</p>
<p>Summer - As war rages in the Middle East between Israel and Egypt, Williams attacks the Johnson Administration for "their inept handling" of the situation. "Like the Vietnam conflict, the war in the Middle East is Communist-inspired resulting from our failure during the past few weeks to exert leadership in the cause of international law and order," the conservative congressman declares. He further states that when the U.S. became aware of the military buildup by Egypt, the administration should have issued a strong protest "that we will take whatever action necessary to preserve the sovereignty of Israel."</p>
<p>Williams supports a bill to accelerate the phasing out of silver backing for paper currency, with the measure passing 234-109. According to a deal struck with Snear and Williams, Dickey joins the War Board in return for the endorsement of Steve McEwen for District Attorney. Dickey attends his first War Board meeting at the Springfield County Club. The state supreme court denies Springfield township's appeal of the Green zoning decision. The township files a second petition, which is rejected again by the state court. The following month, Judge Sweney orders the township to issue a building permit to the Greens. The Israel Emergency Fund raises $400,000 at rallies held in Marple, Nether Providence and Radnor. A bill to extend the Civil Rights Commission six years passes the House 284-89, with Williams voting in favor. He also votes for the Anti-Riot Bill, which prohibits crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot.</p>
<p>In a letter to the News of Delaware County, Williams vigorously defends township efforts to maintain "sound zoning", in reference to the Green case. "To permit Springfield's Zoning Code to be broken would easily lead to Springfield becoming a 'Developer's Paradise' which would de-value the property of every home owner in the Township." He says he "did not even know about" the decision of the township to appeal the Green case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Williams votes for a bill giving citizens additional protections against interference with the exercise of civil rights.</p>
<p>Fall - Williams' successor as Springfield commission president, Second Ward Commissioner Robert Simpson, resigns as president due to the former's continued direct involvement in local government. An angry Judge Sweney declares during another hearing on objections based on technical grounds filed by Springfield township: "They are holding up this thing just as long as they can. They have no respect for this court...they have no respect for this court's opinion...I resent it." The judge also states that it is "absolutely unheard of" for a local zoning case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme court. Although not referring to Williams by name, the Greens' attorney charges that the attempt "to relieve us of the liquor license is the result of political machinations."</p>
<p>900 supporters pay $25 at a fund-raiser to cover Williams' expenses that are not paid for by the government. Senator Hatfield, the guest speaker, calls for American arming and training of the Southeast Asians in order to "substitute their manpower for our manpower" and "de-Americanize" the Vietnam War. Referring to mounting U.S. casualties, he says that "Peking and Moscow must rejoice in the idea that we are being bled, bled, bled." Williams votes against $40 million for special projects, such as rat control, for the Partnership for Health. It passes, anyway, 227 to 173. He also votes for increasing postal rates and a 6% raise for postal workers, 4.5% for other federal workers, with a proviso that a "comparability gap" be closed between federal and private sector salaries in two steps by 1969. The measure passes, 319-89. He supports the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967, which passes 403-1.</p>
<p>Muckraking columnist Ruth Malone of the News writes a scathing attack on the War Board, using an ad fictitiously written by the county Democrats. "We will no longer go along with the two-faced hypocrisy which says we run real elections here, which are real contests between real people dealing with real issues; instead of a 'fix' arranged beforehand by something called the WAR BOARD."</p>
<p>Williams votes for the Air Qualilty Act of 1967, which passes 362-0 and authorizes HEW to seek court action to halt polluters. McEwen is elected District Attorney, along with Snear and McNichol to their second terms as county commissioners, as the Republican ticket sweeps the county. Edward McErlean, who is widely considered a "McClure" Democrat, wins the post of minority commissioner. In her column, Ruth Malone alleges that Republican voters were asked to vote for McErlean over fellow Democrat Wilton A. Bunce. In Springfield, the GOP school board candidates win by about two to one and the four incumbent commissioner candidates easily defeat their Democratic opponents. In Philadelphia, Mayor James H. J. Tate barely staves off a spirited challenge from Republican District Attorney Arlen Specter and wins by only 49% to 47%. Williams supports the Age Discrimination Act of 1967, which prohibits discrimination, covering those between 40 and 65. The vote is 344 to 13.</p>
<p>Springfield Township residents question the amount of taxpayers' monies being spent on the Green case. When commission president Al Young indicates that the board will continue to appeal, Samuel Green states: "Go ahead. Waste more of the township money." Even though the U.S. Supreme Court twice refuses to hear the Green zoning case, the family soon gives up its attempts to build their restaurant.</p>
<p><b>1968 - National and Local Fireworks</b></p>
<p>Spring - Williams speaks out against riots and deficit spending in his newsletter to constituents. He also votes against banning discrimination in the sale and renting of housing. He states: "In my opinion, persons should be free to sell their property to anyone of their choosing." In his own party, Williams' position is in the minority, with 100 Republican representatives voting in favor and 84 opposed. Those in favor include Congressmen George Bush of Texas and Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan.</p>
<p>In the Pennsylvania presidential primary, anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy carries over 76% of the Democratic vote, as the only declared candidate, while Nixon wins 76% as a write-in candidate on the GOP side. Williams is unopposed for renomination and his Democratic opponent will be forty-two year old Edward J. O'Halloran, an attorney from Haverford Township.</p>
<p>Summer - Williams votes against the 10% income tax surcharge, requested by President Johnson to help finance the Vietnam War, citing the need to cut $10 billion in spending. He also speaks out in favor of keeping guns from "people with any criminal record, the mentally ill and emotionally unstable" and for legislation that "would make it more difficult for criminals to obtain guns." (In 1985, there was a shooting spree in the Springfield Mall by a mentally disturbed woman that made national news. Williams votes in favor of a gun control bill which prohibits the interstate shipment of rifles, shotguns and ammunition, as well as restricting their out of state purchase. The bill passes the House 305-118.</p>
<p>At the GOP convention in Miami, Richard Nixon wins a first ballot victory on August 8 over his chief contender, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, 692 to 277, with California Governor Ronald Reagan receiving 182 votes. Unlike four years earlier, the Republican platform is adopted without controversy, including the Vietnam plank. In spite of deep splits within the party over the war in Vietnam, the Democrats nominate Vice President Humphrey over his nearest rival, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, 1,761.75 to 601, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern receiving 146.5 votes. Nixon, Humphrey and Alabama Governor George Wallace, running as an independent, now face each other in a bitterly contested election.</p>
<p>U.S. forces in South Vietnam now total 541,000, with fighting intensifying across that war-torn land. American causalities have now risen to 27,508 combat deaths, with 171,809 wounded. South Vietnam reports that 3,000 civilians have been killed in terrorist attacks since the beginning of the year. President Johnson says the "next move" in the stalled peace talk process was up to North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fall - County GOP chairman Ed Hineman, in an "off-the-cuff" question and answer session following the Chester Jaycees Banquet levels criticism at fellow War Board member Williams. "Williams sometimes spends too much time on local activities and not enough on congressional duties." Hineman, however, feels that may change: "Williams seems to be straightening out." He also says that some county officials are upset about the congressman's "meddling" in Springfield politics.</p>
<p>It seems certain that both Williams and his key ally, Snear, raise objections to Hineman in private. The next day, the party chairman backtracks, stating: "I am fully familiar with the congressman's congressional record and in my opinion he is doing an outstanding job for is in Washington. Williams is one of our strongest candidates for reelection and I am 100 per cent behind his efforts." Whatever face Williams' fellow War Board members put on in public, it is clear that behind the scenes a power struggle is brewing, with the congressman the focus of attention. In taking such controversial stands on local issues in public, Williams becomes a "lightning rod" for the political opposition, and as a member of the War Board, draws undesired attention to that body, as well.</p>
<p>Nixon visits Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, and draws a crowd estimated at 200 to 250 thousand, the largest since FDR's visit in 1936, according to some. He also visits the Springfield Shopping center, where he is almost pulled from his limousine during a bout of intense hand shaking with the crowd. Williams, during his first term, has voted 92% with his party and had attendance of 93%. He was in support of the Johnson administration 49% of the time and in opposition 43%. Williams introduces a bill to allow non-residents to vote in cities in which they pay a wage tax and also condemns trading with "Communist countries".</p>
<p>O'Halloran interrupts an otherwise low-key campaign to criticize Williams for a "grandstand play for votes" for his wage tax proposal. "In a similar situation involving ward apportionment in Springfield he led the attack to retain a half-vote status for residents of the first and sixth wards." Regarding the effect of Williams' proposed bill, he states: "Here he advocates that come citizens be given two votes." O'Halloran favors a bill introduced in Harrisburg to exempt non-residents from the city wage tax. Williams and Richard Schweiker receive a warm reception campaigning in the Upper Darby terminal and are joined by District Attorney McEwen. A woman, evidently referring to Williams' excellent constituent service, puts her hand on his shoulder, stating: "There you are, my penpal." Her companion states: "Larry, you've just made her day." Schweiker attributes his recognition from the recent televised debates with incumbent U.S. Senator Joe Clark.</p>
<p>Williams rails at the Johnson Administration and Attorney General Ramsey Clark for "not taking advantage of existing laws" to combat riots and crime. "This country is founded on one set of laws for everybody. The laws must be enforced equally for everyone. We've got to give back respect to the police officers." He calls the Vietnam War a battle against "world Communism". Judge Francis Catania issues a temporary injunction to prevent the Springfield School Board from condemning the 63 acre Borgh tract, owned by the Elocin Corporation, for the purpose of building a new school. The injunction scores the probable tax burden caused by the new construction and the lack of need for new classrooms.</p>
<p>At a stormy meeting on October 29, the Springfield School Board meets to decide a further appeal of the merger with Morton borough. Before a crowd of 700, charges of racism are made by merger supporters, such as: "Why don't you move to the South where you can continue segregation." At one point, when a high school student attempts to speak, resident grabs the microphone from him and a nasty altercation is narrowly averted by the intervention of other audience members. Finally, the Rev. Harvey Marsland, pastor of the Covenant Methodist Church tells the hushed crowd: "I sat in shock and dismay at the attitude expressed here, the lack of decorum. This is not the American way, to shout down speakers..." In a climactic moment, the school board votes four to three against any further appeal, with one of the four votes being Pemberton's, who, although elected with the endorsement of the GOP organization, does not support his party in the dispute. After the Board adjourns, angry knots of residents, on opposing sides of the issue, confront the school board members on the podium and each other. A woman hands a student, who supports the merger, some Wallace for President literature, commenting: "Here take this home and read it." As the campaign winds up, Williams speaks at a rally at the headquarters of the Republican Party of Marple. "I've followed the career of Richard Nixon with great interest," Williams quips. "Particularly when I found out we're the same age." At an appearance before the Radnor Republican Party, Williams comes out against the bombing halt, stating that during the past nine halts "no significant results except to give North Vietnam the opportunity to infiltrate more men into South Vietnam..." Williams is reelected, 105,799 to 79,782, losing six towns and receiving lower than usual majorities in some of the larger towns, due to Humphrey's strong showing in the county. Williams beats O'Halloran in Upper Darby, 22,611 to 18,496; Ridley Township, 7,988 to 6,797; Springfield, 8,247 to 5,139 and Marple, 6,638 to 4,839. Richard Nixon wins the U.S. presidency, beating Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace, in a very spirited election. Nixon's margin over Humphrey is narrow, only 510,315 votes, but the GOP picks up 4 House and 5 Senate seats. Humphrey carries Pennsylvania by 169,388, with Wallace polling over 378,000. Delaware County voters, however, support Nixon over Humphrey, 133,777 to 106,695, while Wallace polls 25,051. Nixon's showing in the Seventh District is also not impressive, 99,140 to 79,916 for Humphrey and 17,276 for Wallace. Schweiker, though, carries the Seventh 113,021 to 73,414.</p>
<p>Due to Humphrey's fairly strong showing in the county, several county state representatives were reelected by much smaller majorities than usual. Mrs. Mae Kernaghan squeaks by her Democratic opponent, Aldan lawyer Joseph "Ted" Doyle, by only 334 votes, while Joseph W. Dorsey of Collingdale wins a second term by only 12,865 to 10,890. In Chester, which was carried by Humphrey by over 3,100 votes, incumbent Thomas H. Worrilow beats Democrat Lucius Norris 7,171 to 6,723. His re-election breaks a 36-year-old jinx, which had voters sending a Democrat to Harrisburg from Chester during presidential elections. Schweiker defeats Clark, 2.399 million to 2.117 million votes statewide and he carries the county 152,429 to 97,895. He fashions his upset by carrying the suburbs by 196,000 and only losing Philadelphia by less than 194,000. He scores very well in traditionally Democratic western counties, such as Allegheny, Beaver, Washington and Westmoreland.</p>
<p><br />
<b>1969 - The Year of Republican Popularity</b></p>
<p>Winter - Williams is sworn in for his second term, while Nixon becomes the first president since 1848 to begin his first term with a Congress controlled by the opposition party. The House votes 252 to 160 to seat Adam Clayton Powell, after he was reelected in November, but fines him $25,000. Richard Nixon takes office as the 37th president and states during his Inaugural Address: "The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beacons America...if we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind. This is our summons to greatness." While the Paris Peace Talks finally begin, the United States loses its 1,000th helicopter in Vietnam. U.S. troops in Vietnam reach their all-time peak of 543,000 and the Communists begin a major offensive.</p>
<p>The Independent Republicans of Springfield is formed to challenge Williams' control of the GOP "In essence, we are attempting to provide the people of Springfield leadership that is neither controlled or tied to the machine, but that is both responsible and representative while maintaining the ideals of the Republican Party." The group, headed by Dean T. Helm, endorses four candidates in the upcoming primary.</p>
<p>Spring - In an interview, Williams describes his relationship with members of the War Board as "good", stating "I solicit their advice frequently, and not one has ever indicated to me he has any fault to find with my job as a congressman." He adds that he hopes to serve another five or six more terms in office. U.S. combat deaths in South Vietnam reach 33,641, in eight years and three months of fighting, exceeding those lost in the Korean War.</p>
<p>Williams calls for remaining "strong militarily in South Vietnam", "more modern equipment to reduce our casualties" and resuming bombing of North Vietnam to "protect our troops". He also supports Nixon's controversial proposed Anti-Ballistic Missile system. In a stunning blow to Williams and his local party organization, two independents win the GOP primary for school director. In Williams' own ward, James D. Parmiter beat J. Robert Denworth, the endorsed candidate, by a narrow 612 to 594, while in the third ward, James V. Mannion, Jr. defeated organization candidate Elwood Kohl, 529 to 492. But, in the sixth ward, endorsed candidate, Joseph "Wally" Gattinella beat incumbent independent David Wolstenholme, 421 to 220. In the open seat for second ward commissioner, James M. Hermann, who was backed by the party, barely beat independent Republican Allen A. Troutman, 342 to 306. This watershed election becomes remembered as the election that Congressman Williams lost.</p>
<p>Summer - Williams supports the first withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, talks to end the Middle East crisis, and ending federal assistance to universities failing to curb campus disorders. He also calls for revamping social welfare to stop programs that "accentuate the problems they are supposed to solve", citing huge increases in the Aid to Dependent Children payments, due to increases in "illegitimacy". He again decries deficit spending, calling for closing tax loopholes for "high income corporations and families", cutting expenditures to create a "surplus each year to start paying off our huge debt." However, he supports an immediate increase in Social Security benefits, which will still leave a "$700 million" surplus in the trust fund. Nixon announces the first U.S. pullout of 25,000 troops from Vietnam by August 31, with more cuts "as decisions are made." The U.S. Command discloses that 5,666 U.S. aircraft, valued at $3 billion, have been lost in Vietnam fighting since January, 1961.</p>
<p>Fall - Commenting on the death Republican Senate Leader Everett McKinley Dirksen, Williams comments: "As minority leader of the Senate, Mr. Dirksen has been a powerful spokesman for the Republican Party for better than a decade." Dirkson succumbed to cancer at age 73. Williams is "strongly opposed" to former Vice President Humphrey's Metrobank Proposal, which would involve the selling of federally guaranteed bonds so that money could be lent to cities at low interest rates. "The truth of the matter is that the more money we sink into our big cities, the more alluring they become for some people," Williams declares. "The smaller towns, villages and farms ... need much the same services as our big cities..." Williams calls the proposed House resolution calling for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam "ill-conceived and presumptuous," as well as "abhorrent and repugnant."</p>
<p>"What this resolution would do would be to service notice on the Communists that Vietnam is to be theirs, courtesy of the Congress of the United States... This effort is being forced by members of the President's own party in interesting concert with the political plans" of Senator George McGovern." Williams, in the outspoken fashion of Vice President Spiro Agnew, condemns anti-war protesters as "wild-eyed zealots of the Left" and "Communist-applauded, generally misguided peacenik cult. Malinformed, misguided, suspiciously-led students ... giving aid and comfort to the enemy." He supports Nixon's plan of Vietnamization, by letting the South Vietnamese take over the ground fighting, while withdrawing U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Republicans come out on top in the general elections in two states, taking both governorships at stake. William Cahill beats Robert Meyner for New Jersey's top spot by 500,000 votes. In Virginia, Republicans make further inroads, electing Linwood Holton as governor. In the local elections, Republicans sweep all of the county row offices at stake by the traditional two to one margin, but in several townships, Democrats made some surprise inroads. The minority party picks up commissioner seats in Radnor, Haverford and Nether Providence townships, while also taking control of Darby Borough and Darby Township. They also retain their two year control of Marple Township. Most important for Williams is the huge GOP win in Springfield, including the hotly contested Sixth Ward school board race between Joseph W. Gattinella and Edward A. Powers. Following the election, there is speculation that Williams will not seek a third term. Powerful Upper Darby GOP boss and War Board member Sam Dickey, does not endorse Williams' reelection bid, but does say if Williams seeks the Pa. lieutenant governorship, "we in the Delaware County organization would go along with him". Williams has no comment on the speculation. It's also a good year for Republicans in Philadelphia, as Arlen Specter is reelected as District Attorney, 347,681 to 245,858 and Tom Gola wins as Controller, 322,258 to 252,555. The GOP also captures four contested Common Pleas Court judgeships.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports state that Dickey's War Board faction, which included the head of the War Board and County Commission chairman, Harry McNichol, Judge Francis Catania's Ridley Township organization, and the Chester group, headed by Joseph Eyre, County Recorder of Deeds and former mayor, have broken with Williams, who heads a smaller faction of his own. McNichol states he is "considering" his own candidacy for Congress. In the meantime, the president of the Radnor Township Board of Commissioners, reformer Bernard White, declares his candidacy for the Republican nomination and has his name placed before the War Board. A local group that backs independent candidates for school board, the Save Our Schools Committee asks that Williams apologize for statements made on a piece of campaign literature. The piece, on which Williams' name headed the signatures, claimed that Powers had misrepresented some of his credentials.</p>
<p><b>1970 - A Primary Battle with a Reformer</b></p>
<p>Winter - The News of Delaware County endorses Bernard White for the GOP nomination for Congress. The paper cites Williams "audacious manner and over-conspicuous over-involvement in Springfield's local affairs" and lack of being "the quiet organization man the machine would like to have in Congress" as reasons for his possible dumping by the War Board. The editorial praises reforms in governmental operations during White's tenure on the Radnor commission, including: "inviting applicants (for township boards) to interview so choices could be made on the basis of qualifications, not political rewards."</p>
<p>Springfield commissioners vote to rezone 45 acres of land at Baltimore Pike and Sproul Road to allow the construction of a mall by Kevy K. Kaiserman, a Philadelphia Developer. A majority of the 350 residents who attended the meeting are in opposition. The following month, a "Stop the Mall" organization of Springfield and Swarthmore residents is formed. With McNichol deciding not to run, Williams is endorsed by the War Board, reportedly by a narrow eight to six vote, over White, and a heated primary battle began. In attempting to defeat Williams, White takes on the War Board. Snear, an ally of Williams, steps down as chairman of the county commissioners, citing health concerns, and McNichol is elevated to the post. Both Snear and McNichol denied that the swap was part of a deal to keep the latter out of the primary race and preserve party harmony. White attacks the "self-appointed, self-perpetuating" War Board and calls for its replacement by an elected executive committee. "Such an undemocratic setup can be compared with the Russian Politburo, a small group of men who run that country and choose the officials." James H. Finch, a black man crippled by arthritis, is evicted from his dilapidated Springfield home by the township. The home is leveled by a bulldozer, with the township citing it as a "health hazard".</p>
<p>Spring - White comes out in support of the Javits-Pell resolution in the Senate to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and halt all U.S. combat operations in Vietnam by December 31, 1970. In an attack on Williams, White cited the recent and controversial rezoning of land for the Springfield Mall and the township's bulldozing of the Finch property, as events that seem "to have shaken the confidence of people in their local government." The two Democratic candidates are conservative Joseph R. Breslin of Haverford township, who is supported by county commissioner Edward McErlean and liberal C. Barry Sherwin of Lansdowne, who has the backing of county Democratic chairman Ernani Falcone. Williams, in a House debate, terms the Nixon Administration's proposed Family Assistance Act of 1970 "a dreadful hoax on the American people". "Past experience has proved that whenever a new welfare program is created for the purpose of solving a problem, that problem is only accentuated and its cost escalated," the conservative congressman further stated. The proposal would have had the federal government establish a guaranteed annual wage for persons on welfare. White criticizes Williams, citing a "continual inconsistency between Williams' public statements and his voting record" and his (Williams') "very limited grasp of today's serious problems." The incumbent declares: "We must never again commit American troops to an Asian land war," adding that the "63 million people (of South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand) can fight off the approximately 19 million people in North Vietnam if they desire to do so." Democrat Sherwin says that the statement is "a confession of the bankruptcy of Williams' consistently pro-war position."</p>
<p>White unsuccessfully sues in U.S. district court in an attempt to stop the "practice of giving county employees primary election day off form their jobs to work at the polls for War Board-endorsed candidates." The practice is defended by Snear and McNichol, but not by minority county commissioner McErlean. Another controversy erupts when White charges that Williams has shown only "perfunctory interest" in a Collingdale resident's proposal to prevent the M-16 rifle, which is used by U.S. troops in the Vietnam war, from jamming when being fired. Williams counters by reviewing his extensive involvement with the Army in an effort to resolve this safety issue.</p>
<p>At a candidates debate in May, Williams states "I didn't agree with the move into Cambodia", but had voted against a measure to cut off funding for the U.S. move into that country. White, in taking a more liberal stance, states he "opposed President Nixon's sudden decision to expand the war into Cambodia." Sherwin, likewise denounces the Cambodian incursion, but Breslin sides with the president. "Nixon decided to place the interest of the nation above himself and his political future," he declares.</p>
<p>In his newsletter to constituents, Williams attacks the News of Delaware County, citing "prejudiced, slanted and untrue editorials" against him. The newspaper responds by calling Williams accusations "vicious and absurd" and pointing out that the congressman "grossly violated his franking privileges" by using his taxpayer funded "Washington Report" for "an item which has very little to do with Washington but a great deal to do with the preservation of his political career."</p>
<p>Williams joins the fray in attacking Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. The congressman joins 51 Republicans and 52 conservative Democrats in requesting an investigation of Douglas for possible impeachment. Cited are Douglas' alleged public prejudging of specific cases; his chairmanship of a foreign affairs organization engaging in "un-American" activities, as well as authoring a book, "Points of Rebellion", which "clearly advocates rebellion and the overthrow of the Establishment," according to Williams. Williams and the War Board show their electoral strength by defeating White by almost 2 to 1, 38,900 to 20,600 votes, spending about $31,000 to the latter's $15,000. In Springfield, however, independents make gains by winning two GOP committee seats. Williams and Springfield township's health officer, Mary Ann Arty, visit Finch in the Rest Haven Convalescent Home in Broomall. According to Finch, Williams was "trying to make a settlement" and asked for an estimate of damages.</p>
<p>Summer - In a nine page statement, Congressman Williams supports Finch's eviction and the razing of the home by the township. Williams and township officials are unsuccessfully sued by the man. A proposed amendment to the Voting Rights Act lowering the voting age to eighteen passes the House on June 17. Williams is one of 132 representatives voting against it and explains: "I favor the reduction of the voting age to 19, but I do not believe it is practical to reduce it to 18." According to Williams' reasoning, nineteen is the age that young men can be drafted. Williams declares he is in "categorical opposition to any measure that would further increase the federal debt limit." He decries the national debt of $374 billion and the fiscal 1971 interest cost of nearly $20 billion.</p>
<p>Fred Duke, a member of the War Board for over 30 years, dies at age 78. Williams, who had known Duke since 1939, claims "it will be almost impossible to find a man who will be ale to match the outstanding record compiled by Fred Duke." Duke had spent his entire life in politics, having served as a county Clerk of Courts, County Commissioner, a county detective and finally County Director of Personnel, until being forced to resign by County Commissioner Al Swing in 1961. Williams votes with the administration against the Cooper-Church Amendment that would bar large scale military operations in Cambodia, citing it would "impair the safety of the remaining troops in Vietnam" and hurt the efforts of the Vietnamese "to protect themselves from attack".</p>
<p>Williams' key ally on the War Board, Frank Snear, dies at age 66, and there is a mad scramble to replace him. Congressman Watkins, 68, dies suddenly, further complicating county politics. Hineman makes a play for the vacant county commissioner post, but Catania is also interested in the post. As a compromise, H. Walter Weaver, county parks superintendent, is selected to fill out the remainder of the term on condition he not seek election. Williams nominates Hineman for the War Board chairmanship, but Dickey and Catania are able to get McNichol elected to the post.</p>
<p>Fall - The War Board is sharply split on filling the three vacancies. After two new members are appointed, it appears that the Williams faction, now allied with another faction led by county GOP chairman Ed Hineman, has greater strength than the McNichol faction. Williams' group consists of William E. Ruthrauff Jr., clerk of courts, and William Kirschner, Haverford Township treasurer, and newly appointed James Merriman of Radnor. Hineman is backed by County Commissioner H. Walter Weaver, State Representative Mae Kernaghan, John Gable, and newly appointed Robert Pennell of Aston. McNichol is supported by Dickey, Eyre and Ridley Township treasurer, Nicholas Catania. Another member J. Warren Bullen, is reportedly unaligned. The vacancy caused by Watkins' death is left unfilled for the time being.</p>
<p>As the campaign winds to a close, Williams attacks the "Democratically controlled Congress" for overspending, deficits, and inaction on legislation to deal with environmental control and inflation. He reiterates "the economy of this country cannot stand any more deficit spending." He comes out in favor of federal revenue sharing with the states in lieu of a state income tax. The 42 year old Breslin campaigns door-to-door, stressing that voters of the Seventh District "need someone concerned with their problems which are economy and taxes." His platform consists of more funding for mass transit, updated medical facilities, housing and education, but opposes massive foreign aid programs, including credit to Israel. He agrees with Williams on the Nixon Vietnam policies. Williams easily wins a third term, defeating Breslin, 95,000 to 62,000. It is not a good year for Republicans, though, as Nixon's push for GOP control of the U.S. Senate fails, with the party picking up only two seats. Democrats gain twelve additional House seats and some governorships.</p>
<p>Democrat Milton Shapp resoundingly beats Lt. Governor Raymond J. Broderick, 2.036 million to 1.540, while Hugh Scott is reelected to a third term over state senator William Sesler, 1.869 to 1.647 milliion. Broderick carries Delaware County by only 15,000 votes and a Democrat, Joseph T. Doyle, in his second run, beats David W. McLaughlin, 10,519 to 10,377 in the open 163rd state House District. This is the first time ever that a Democrat outside of Chester is elected to the legislature from Delaware County. Doyle's win foreshadows the dramatic Democratic gains that will come four years later.</p>
<p>Falcone declares the Democrats' strong showing to be "the beginning of a genuine two-party system in our county." In December, Williams appears as a character witness for the president of the Havertown Savings and Loan Association, George Hykel, who is facing federal charges. There is a minor controversy as it is revealed that Williams had called the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Home Loan Board to arrange meetings to inquire into the case. Williams says he did "nothing improper and in fact would do the same thing for any constituent." He states he knew Hykel for four years and took an interest in the case because the Havertown Savings and Loan has "80 per cent of its money in home mortgages, which we need so badly now."</p>
<p><b>1971 - Some Local Surprises</b></p>
<p>Winter - Williams' clout on the War Board fades as key supporter, William Ruthrauff, suddenly resigns. The alignment now has McNichol, Dickey, Catania, Eyre, Merriman, Kernaghan and Bullen in one camp. Williams' only support remains from Kirschner, while Hineman has only Pennell, Weaver and Gable. With this change, the Upper Darby-Chester faction will have the majority of votes for the next four years, sealing Williams' political fate. In a speech, Williams states "the American system is far from perfect, but it is the most near-perfect in all human history. He describes his office as placing a "heavy emphasis on constituent communication and service" and "this priority applies to proposed legislation and to the manner in which I cast my ultimate vote."</p>
<p>Spring - Williams assails the Nixon 1972 budget, with its projected deficit of $11.6 billion. He further states: "This Democratic-created mess is not going to be solved by a Republican using a Democratic formula for failure." Legislation is introduced by Williams to save a large area of tidal marshland in Tinicum Twp. in his district. In a stunning rebuke to the Springfield machine, independent Republicans Andrew Wright and William Bryan win two Springfield commissioner races in the primary. In an act of bad timing, the board of commissioners had met only days before the primary election and voted on a controversial and unpopular proposal to build a playing field in Woodland Avenue Park. In Philadelphia, former Police Commissioner Frank L. Rizzo, wins the Democratic primary for mayor, beating Congressman Bill Green and state Senator Hardy Williams.</p>
<p>Fall - Williams introduces a bill to cut the annual U.S. payment to the United Nations and condemns the replacement of Taiwan with mainland China in that body. The financial records of the Delaware County GOP are seized by Richard Sprague, a special prosecutor appointed by McEwen in response to charges by the Pennsylvania Crime Commission of widespread governmental corruption in Delaware County. Sprague, the First Assistant District Attorney of Philadelphia, is investigating charges of forced political contributions, "macing", by county employees to the county Republican party. McNichol tells the audience at the county commissioner's meeting: "getting jobs based on patronage is prevelant today throughout the United States...All county jobs, with the exception of civil service jobs, are filled through patronage..." Later he denies that macing of these employees is occurring: "Again, as far as we're concerned, there is no macing. However, we are always glad to accept contributions." Hineman describes the investigation: "I personally think this is a laughable thing. I think it's a joke." Several county employees, however, attest to being told by their supervisors that "certain payments" to the county GOP would allow them to retain their jobs. Meanwhile, Williams denies his opponent's charges that he is interested in taking political control of the school district. "As a U.S. Congressman, I have more than a full time job. I have no desire to interfere with the operation of the school district." The first Democrat in history, Russell Gramiak, is narrowly elected commissioner in Williams' own ward. The county GOP suffers unprecedented losses and Harry McNichol is narrowly reelected as county commissioner over Democrat Bill Spingler. Charges of county Republican corruption figure prominently in the election. Williams local strength has been sharply eroded, as his GOP party controls only four of seven commissioner seats.</p>
<p>Also, of major significance is the victory of Bill Spingler for the guaranteed post of minority county commissioner. In the past, this position was usually filled by what some observers have called a "McClure Democrat". Unlike his predecessors, Spingler would uncover and challenge publically questionable or controversial actions of the Republican majority. In Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Frank L. Rizzo, a Democrat, beats Republican city councilman Thatcher Longstreth in a topsy-turvy race. Rizzo wins by only 394,000 to 345,000 by carrying the culturally conservative white Republican areas of south and northeast Philadelphia, as well as Roxborough, with his tough, law-and-order message, "Rizzo Means Business." As a result of a backlash to Rizzo, Longstreth carries the traditionally black wards of west and north Philadelphia, as well as the mostly white liberal areas of Chestnut Hill and center city.</p>
<p><b>1972 - Nixon's Landslide and Williams' Energetic Opponent</b></p>
<p>With the redistricting issue having been fought over bitterly twice in the past ten years and presidential electoral politics dominating the scene, the issue of reapportionment seems much less contentious this year. Since the crossing of county lines was finally breached in 1966, further changes to congressional district boundaries seem anti-climatic. As a result of the 1970 census, Pennsylvania must reduce its delegation from 27 to 25. With the city having lost 52,000 residents since the last census, there was agreement that the city could not retain its five seats. With four seats, Philadelphia would still have an excess of 63,000 residents. Rumor had it that some South Philadelphia wards would be shifted to the 7th District to equalize the population difference. At a political dinner that both Williams and Green attended, it is said that Green joked that instead of the "Green Grab", it would be the "Williams Grab".</p>
<p>Plans initially proposed in the House and Senate State Governments committees would have eliminated the 9th District by moving most Chester County towns to the 13th or a Lancaster County-based district. Eleven Delaware County towns would have been to the 13th District: Chester Heights, Bethel, Birmingham, Concord, Edgmont, Haverford, Middletown, Newtown, Radnor, Thornbury and Upper Providence. The 7th District would have consisted of the 38 remaining communities. With the Democrats in firm control of the state House, 110 to 90, a revised plan is passed, 104 to 87, on January 20, that consolidates the Philadelphia districts of Democrats Bill Green III, who succeeded his late father, and James Byrne. The Republican-voting 21st Ward, consisting of Roxborough-Manayunk, is moved to the 13th District. Two Republican-held districts in central Pennsylvania are also paired together, those of J. Irving Whalley and John P. Saylor.</p>
<p>Relatively minor alterations are made to the 7th District, expanding it to the west to take in a dozen former 9th District Delaware County communities. In the state Senate's version, passed four days later, Ware's 9th District is renamed the 5th and drastically changed, with the removal of northwestern Chester County and the addition of northern Montgomery County. Unfortunately for Williams, the friendly towns of Haverford and Radnor are moved to the 5th District and replaced with the politically hostile City of Chester. Interestingly enough, by not swapping Haverford and Radnor with Chester and several other adjoining riverfront towns, there would have been a negligible effect on the population differences between the 5th and 7th.</p>
<p>There is no indication in the news media that Williams played a major role in the redistricting discussions that took place. Indeed, his only comment was that he "picks up the strong Republican municipalities of Media, Nether Providence, Rose Valley and Chester." McNichol states: "Mr. Shapp wanted it done this way and he had the votes." In reality, if Shapp and the Democrats had wanted to truly flex their muscles, they would have retained five city based districts by including areas of the suburbs. The addition of ticket-splitting blue collar and riverfront towns to the 7th and the removal of staunchly Republican Radnor, could hardly cause the Democrats to be unhappy, though. With the prospect of successfully dumping Williams sharply increased, his opponents on the War Board must have been even happier than the Democrats. Rumor has it that the War Board decides not to dump Williams during this presidential election year, but will wait two years. The GOP House minority leader, Kenneth B. Lee, commenting from the sidelines, states prophetically: "Larry Williams might win one more term, but after that, it would be very difficult." He predicts that the Democrats could pick up the seats of John Heinz, Saylor and Williams.</p>
<p>Winter - In Williams' once all-Republican hometown, one Democratic and two independent Republican commissioners are sworn in and will consistently vote against the party agenda for the next two years.</p>
<p>Spring - With more attention focused on a hotly-contested presidential race, Williams wins renomination unopposed. However, he faces a very energetic, young Democratic challenger in the fall, Stuart Bowie. Little-noticed is the third independent elected to a GOP committee seat in Springfield.</p>
<p>Williams gives his usual strong backing to Nixon's Vietnam policies, supporting the recent mining and bombing operations against North Vietnam, stating Nixon "has taken the only possible course open to him. President Nixon and his administration have made it evident in every way possible that the U.S. desires peace. What the Communists are doing is Southeast Asia is sheer aggression and this should be recognized by everyone in this country."</p>
<p>Summer - Bowie also unsuccessfully files a federal lawsuit, charging that Williams' constituent newsletter was being used for political purposes. Williams accuses Bowie of staging "a cheap publicity stunt." On the local front, a citizens group, known as the Whiskey Run Rebellion, files suit against Springfield Township, in an effort to halt the bulldozing of trees in Thomson Park. According to Democratic Commissioner Gramiak: "I sit on the Park Board and I've been to all the Park Board meetings and I can't remember ever voting on or approving any work in Thomson Park." The president of the commissioners contends that the work was being done in preparation of the park's development into a recreational area.</p>
<p>Fall - Williams and a dozen other congressmen are opposed by a group of business executives for supporting Nixon's war policies. The group endorses Bowie, but Williams said "their efforts are having no effect." As the election heats up, Bowie attacks Williams for voting against a House Banking Committee investigation of the recent Watergate break-in. The former refers to the latter as a "political hack" and "right winger" and announces Senator Edward Kennedy is supporting his effort to unseat Williams. Williams refers to Bowie as "ludicrous" and "misinformed" in attacking the former's vote against using highway trust funds for mass transit. Bowie is endorsed by three GOP local elected officials, including one of the independent Springfield commissioners. They state that Williams is an "ultra-conservative" and is part of the "Republican establishment" that is open only to persons "who conform to its narrow ways of doing things without fail." In response, Harry McNichol states: "The Republican Party in Delaware County has delivered good government" and is "responsive to the people".</p>
<p>For good measure, Bowie also charges Williams with failing to vote to cut federal spending "while voting for bigger budgets and higher taxes" and predicts a recession of "terrible magnitude" due to Nixon's economic policies. Williams cites his support for federal revenue sharing and social security increases and notes that Nixon kept his pledge to reduce American forces in Vietnam and that the economy was doing well. In its newsletter, the Springfield Democratic Party refers to Williams as "a consistent supporter of big business and military interests and a poor voting record on measures supported by labor, consumer groups, and liberals, according to a recent profile issued by consumer advocate Ralph Nader." The Democrats also mention that the congressman had refused to speak to the Nader interviewer and subjected him to an "outburst of most ungentlemanly and profane behavior."</p>
<p>The local Democrats also make note of contributions to Williams' campaign by Kevy Kaiserman and Michael Lubin, developers of the Springfield Mall, as well as a plumber who secured a variance from the township Zoning Board. Nixon is reelected in a huge landslide, in all respects, winning 46.7 million votes to McGovern's 28.7 million. The Nixon-Agnew ticket takes 49 of 50 states, with only Massachusetts going Democratic, as well as 521 our of 538 electoral votes. Nixon's coattails are short, however, as the GOP loses two Senate seats and only picks up 13 House seats, still leaving the Democrats in charge, 242 to 192, with one independent.</p>
<p>In spite of all of the Democrats' efforts, Nixon is reelected in a landslide over Senator George McGovern and Williams smashes Bowie's bid, 122,622 to 79,578. Nixon carries Delaware County by 65% of the vote. Some politicians point out that in Springfield, Bowie received the highest vote of the five Democratic candidates on the ballot, while Williams received the second lowest of the GOP candidates. In four of fourteen precincts in his hometown, the congressman polled less than 55% of the vote, while the lowest precinct vote Nixon received was 64.7%.</p>
<p><b>1973 - The Decline of Nixon and Williams</b></p>
<p>Winter - Williams meets with representatives of local antiwar groups and states that Nixon is "daydreaming" if he believes that he can extensively bomb North Vietnam "without making explanations to Congress and to the people of the United States". He still will not vote to cut off funds, as long as "Russia and China and other Communist countries continue to supply Hanoi..."</p>
<p>Spring - As Republicans nationally lose popularity with the unraveling of the Watergate scandal, local politics heat up considerably. Controversy surrounds Williams dumping of the incumbent tax collector, his support for the controversial Springfield Mall and general involvement in local politics. In the primary election, Williams' loyalists win all contested commissioner seats against relatively weak opposition. They also win a governing majority of school board seats for the first time since the party began endorsing school board candidates in 1965. The onus is now on the Democrats to break Williams hold on local politics in the fall election.</p>
<p>Summer - Edwin Hineman, leader of the War Board faction that had joined with Williams' faction on some issues, dies suddenly of a heart attack. McNichol indicates that the War Board may never fill the vacancy. This untimely death probably removes one of the last barriers for the War Board to dump Williams.</p>
<p>Fall - A local furor is set off when a copy of a letter written by Williams on his congressional stationary to a Republican candidate for commissioner, is made public. In the letter, Williams negotiated with a major retailer regarding building a buffer fence behind a store and having the police chief erect stop signs on a local street. Questions are raised as to who is really governing the township and a Democratic candidate is escorted from the public commissioners meeting when he attempts to quote from the letter. Williams said he had "not a strong role at all" in running the township and only became involved when local officials could not resolve the problems.</p>
<p>Vice President Spiro Agnew pleads no contest to charges of federal income tax evasion and resigns from office. In what became known as the "Saturday Night Massacre", Nixon orders the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. This causes the resignations of Attorney General Elliott Richardson and his top deputy, William Ruchelshaus and a firestorm of criticism erupts, further damaging local GOP chances. In a major blow to Williams, a second Springfield commissioner seat is lost to the Democrats and Williams' party loses control, three to four. Williams supports an effort to have the County courts redistrict Springfield's wards to add two new court-appointed commissioners, thus tilting the balance of power back to the regular GOP The courts ultimately refer the issue to the Board of Commissioners, who finally realign the wards in 1975, retaining seven wards.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the county GOP sharply criticizes the effort to realign Springfield's wards "in such a way as to thwart the will of the electorate." He further stated that he believed a majority of the War Board agreed with his statement. This is viewed by many as the opening salvo of efforts to dump Williams for reelection. The Upper Darby Republican Party then issues a statement urging that the courts not be used "to subvert the will of the voters, particularly those of our neighbors in Springfield Township" and further stating any ward realignment which "would negate the recent municipal election would and should result in the eventual rejection of the individual or party who benefits by this inequity."</p>
<p>In December, The Springfield GOP committee endorses Williams for a fifth term. The chairman of the War Board, Harry McNichol, warns Williams not to hold a planned fund raiser until after county endorsements are made. Williams ignores the warning. In a further bid to hold onto power, he suggests that the outgoing commissioners reappoint members of various township committees, rather than allow the new board to make the appointments. This attempt to circumvent the choices of the incoming commissioners fails when no commissioner seconds the motion brought by one of Williams' supporters.</p>
<p><b>1974 - The Fall of Nixon and Williams</b></p>
<p>Winter - In his State of the Union address, Nixon names the energy crisis as the nation's number one priority and says he would "never walk away" from his job. Gasoline supplies grow shorter, as lines grow longer at the pumps. The 55 mile per hour speed limit goes into effect, along with daylight savings time four months ahead of schedule, as an effort to conserve fuel. Inflation rose 8.8% in 1973, the worst showing in 25 years and causing further resentment against Nixon and the Republican party.</p>
<p>The governing coalition of the Springfield Commissioners now consists of two independent Republicans and two Democrats. The Democrats support Wright and Bryan for board president and vice president, respectively. The three remaining Williams loyalists, for the most part, are relegated to the role of minority opposition, a crushing blow to Williams' local power base. Thirty year old Rev. Bob Edgar, a Democrat and Methodist minister, enters the race for Congress, as a political reformer.</p>
<p>Spring - The War Board endorses District Attorney Steve McEwen by a 14 to 2 vote. The two votes for Williams were his own and Marple Township GOP leader Bob Wenner, who also lost the nod for state senator. The rejection is denounced by Williams, who said it came from those who felt his political independence "clashed with the special interests of a political group." Another spurned independent, Jim Wilkes, runs for a state house seat in the Chester Pike area. Williams thus becomes the third incumbent congressman to be dumped by the War Board, following in the footsteps of Wolfenden and Milliken. In the rough-and-tumble world of Delaware County politics, no political endorsement comes easily. The county GOP mails a letter to each committee person, citing five reasons why the War Board did not endorse Williams: "meddling in the internal affairs of Springfield Township", membership "in a Congress that has lost the confidence of the American people", consumer-advocate Ralph Nader's report on Congress which characterized Williams as "arrogant and profane", Williams' misrepresentation of his committee seniority, and the resignation of 66 members of his D.C. staff during the past six years.</p>
<p>Williams resigns as Springfield leader in order to devote his time to his reelection fight. Although mostly loyal to Williams, his local GOP is embroiled in intra-party fighting and contests for committee posts. Williams and Wenner resign from the War Board. "I want it clearly understood we did not seek or ask for his resignation," says Harry McNichol. Stepping up his attacks on his opponent, Williams refers to the disappearance of $4,000 in evidence from the District Attorney's office as "something similar to a scene from the old Keystone Kops" movies. McEwen has no comment. A third candidate, Arnold Barnabei, who resides in the neighboring 5th congressional district, declares his candidacy for the 7th district. An investigation reveals that the Springfield police chief, a longtime Williams associate, has been billing the township for repairs to Williams' personal vehicle. Williams denies any knowledge of the billing practice.</p>
<p>Congressman Williams appears in the DA's office, asking to see an unreleased report that McEwen commissioned three years earlier that allegedly has information regarding corruption in the county government. McEwen is not present, but an assistant District Attorney, in front of a reporter, refers to Williams as being "drunk". Having disproved the charge with a sobriety test, Williams sues the official who made the allegation.</p>
<p>Democrats win a special election for Michigan's 8th congressional district. With the win of Bob Traxler, the Republicans have lost four of the past five special elections. Pennsylvania Senator Hugh Scott says the recently released transcripts of White House conversations relating to Watergate show "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, immoral performances" by all involved.</p>
<p>The Evening Bulletin runs a series, "Anatomy of a Machine" that expose questionable or illegal practices in the county government. Harry McNichol strongly denounces Williams at a fundraiser: "We made four mistakes (in endorsing Williams' previous election bids). We won't make a fifth." He said the major reason for the dumping was that Williams "tried to move in a power play...and get his greedy little hands in a position to call the shots." He told the audience of 1,200: "There will be no resurgence of a candidate with our backing in Washington like Williams, so despicable a man." Then, during an interview, McNichol continued his tirade, stating that after the death of War Board member Frank Snear four years earlier, Williams attempted to "establish himself as a second John McClure", referring to the founder and uncontested head of the War Board. During a televised debate between the Republican candidates, Williams continued to hammer at McEwen's record as DA, calling him a "do-nothing DA" who failed to prosecute alleged corruption detailed in the 1971 Pa. Crime Commission report. McEwen accused Williams of falsely claiming the endorsement of Vice President Gerald Ford on his campaign literature. Williams said that he was endorsed by Ford in a letter. A few days later, Dickey sues Williams for libel for statements Williams made during the debate regarding allegations of payoffs of $100,000 made to Dickey by a landfill owner. Dickey's attorney stated Dickey was "an honest and law-abiding citizen".</p>
<p>Congressman Williams continues to criticize alleged corruption in the county government, stating that DA McEwen should put "a halt to the illegal macing (forced political contributions) of public employees that is taking place right under his nose." The Evening Bulletin then publishes a letter that Williams wrote eight months earlier, while still a member of the War Board, to a Springfield GOP ward leader, regarding the hire of a Springfield resident as a county employee, stating that the employee understands "she is expected to work politically for the Republican party" and "that she will make a contribution to the Republican Party Campaign Committee." This damaging revelation dilutes Williams charges of War Board corruption. As the bitter campaign grinds to a close, Williams asks the U.S. Attorney General to send federal observers to polling places in the City of Chester based on allegations of past voting fraud.</p>
<p>On Election Day, McEwen narrowly defeats Williams, 35,098 to 32,561 with Barnabei receiving 3,788 votes. "Thank God for the city of Chester", proclaims Harry McNichol. McEwen wins Chester by a whopping 3 to 1 margin, 6,200 to 2,100, in spite of door-to-door campaigning by Williams there. Without Chester, Williams would have won by over 1,000 votes. Williams carries 21 of the 38 communities in the 7th District and states that "the election was stolen from me in Chester. It involves the buying of votes, taking derelicts from missions and having them vote, and election judges helping people vote." A Williams worker in Chester is quoted: "It's so crooked down here in Chester, it's pretty hard to win an election." Wenner and the independent state legislative candidate also lose, along with a slate for GOP state committee members. Bob Edgar wins the Democratic primary and challenges McEwen to debates in the fall. In Springfield, even though Williams receives over 62% of the vote, the War Board backed independent candidates win 11 of the 28 committee posts, including a precinct of Williams' ward. Pete Flaherty, mayor of Pittsburgh, scores a narrow win for the Democratic nomination for U.S. senator, beating Herbert Denenberg, ex-state insurance commissioner, by 23,000 votes. Flaherty will square off against incumbent Richard Schweiker. Shapp is renominated for governor and will face Republican businessman, Drew Lewis, in the fall.</p>
<p>Summer - Williams, in a letter to the state Attorney General, asks for a probe of Chester's election results. In a report sent to the F.B.I., a Williams aide reported threats of bodily harm from a Republican committeeman at the polls. Some precincts reported 70% turnouts, even though the turnout was only 31% in the rest of the county. In some key precincts, Williams lost by margins of as high as 16 to 1 and there were allegations that Republican election officials accompanied voters into the voting machines, votes were cast for persons who were not present to vote, the Republican lever was locked for registered Democrats with the judge of elections casting the votes, and voting that took place at the homes of city policemen. The Democratic minority county commissioner, Bill Spingler, refuses to certify the results. The investigation is not pursued by the state, however. Harry McNichol, in rebutting the charges, said: "If Mr. Williams would look at the returns, he would find that Mr. Eyre has been providing these kinds of returns for years."</p>
<p>In further fallout from the party schism, Dickey announces his intention to resign from the War Board, stating: "I'm not in accord with Harry McNichol, with what he said to the paper to the effect that Democrats are not admitted to Fair Acres...In Upper Darby, to my knowledge, we never check political registration with respect to Fair Acres." It is reported that the McEwen campaign committee spent $172,000, while Williams spent $76,000. The House Judiciary committee votes to approve three articles of impeachment against Nixon regarding the Watergate cover-up and misuse of presidential power. Nixon resigns as president, as the national elections ensue, with the Democrats poised for big gains. Williams declares that he will support neither McEwen nor Edgar for his seat in Congress. "I am not going to support Edgar, that is my policy. I will do what I have always done and this is support the Republican ticket. As of right now, I have not patched up things with Steve McEwen or the War Board. I do not anticipate that they will come to ask for my support."</p>
<p>Fall - Williams loses a federal lawsuit to gain a place on the fall ballot as an independent. He also pursues a lawsuit to force the public disclosure and prosecution of alleged county corruption. The Sprague Report is released and completely denying the existence of corruption within the government of Delaware County. "I wish to emphasize that very serious charges have been levied against government officials in Delaware County, but little or nothing has been shown by anyone to prove these charges," Sprague concludes. However, Lawrence Hoyle, former executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, says otherwise: "...there is ample evidence of a scheme of macing in Delaware County that needs the attention of a prosecutor." He adds that the Crime Commission had given "specific detail and evidence" to Sprague regarding macing. Williams states: "I knew McEwen was very serious trouble and that's why I came out for for him...The Republican Party started to decline about five years ago because of the changes in the Board of Supervisors." He cites the losses of Snear, Duke, Watkins and Hineman as having weakened the War Board.</p>
<p>"It's a funny thing that in 1964 Lyndon Johnson carried Delaware County but we didn't lose anything else," Williams opines. "Nobody can tell me the national scene had anything to do with the Democratic victory on Tuesday." Williams further claims that had he been on the ballot he would have won by "60 per cent" of the vote and helped elect other Republicans locally. Edgar dismisses that analysis: "He can say that because his name wasn't on the ballot. He had his chance." After a low-key campaign by McEwen and hard work by Edgar, the latter wins by almost 17,000 votes, carrying Springfield by an unprecedented 62%. This time, the party machine in Chester only gives McEwen a 54% plurality. There are also other severe losses for the War Board, Governor Milton Shapp, a Democrat, carries the county and the party picks up the state senate seat denied to Wenner along with five state house seats. The GOP is left with the other state senate seat that was not up for election, five other state house seats and control of the courthouse. Nationally, the GOP is trounced in Congress and state houses.</p>
<p><b>1975 - Out of Office and Still Battling the Machine</b></p>
<p>In January, Edgar takes office as Williams' successor. For the first time in twenty-four years, Williams does not hold an elected office. Having decided to forgo a try for county commissioner, Williams is named by President Ford as special assistant to the federal co-chairman of the Ozark Regional Commission. In February, in an effort to survive, the county Republican committee dumps McNichol and Catania for reelection as county commissioners and dismantles the War Board. Williams does not personally participate in the election, but does endorse a Democrat, Esther Clark, for the county courts.</p>
<p>On May 31, Williams enters Tri-County Hospital in Springfield with a severe concussion from a fall at home, a 104-degree fever from pneumonia and cerebral hemorrhaging. He is moved to Episcopal Hospital and diagnosed with brain tumors. His condition having deteriorated, Williams dies on July 13, 1975 at University of Pennsylvania Hospital. "Those of us who knew Lawrence G. Williams over the years realize how much he contributed to making Springfield what it is today," reflects Andrew W. Wright, President of the Springfield commissioners and former Williams foe. "Those efforts can be appreciated by us all." "The name of Lawrence Williams was synonymous with Springfield for many years. Now, on the occasion of his death, it is fitting to note that his influence will be felt in this, my home town," muses Edgar. "for years to come. He was a tireless worker, giving one hundred per cent of himself in the pursuit of his every endeavor. I extend my sympathy to his family during this sad and difficult time." The L.G. Williams Memorial Fund is established by the Lions Club of Springfield.</p>
<p>Of Williams' former War Board colleagues, only Joe Dorsey and Bob Wenner attend his funeral. Congressman Edgar attends, as well as those from neighboring areas: Lawrence Coughlin, Richard Schulze, and William Barrett. Some 15 years after his death, the Springfield Commissioners, on a split vote, renamed Powell Road Park to Williams Park.</p>

<p>Robert William Edgar was born on May 29, 1943, graduated Springfield High School, then went on to receive his Bachelor of Arts from Lycoming College, followed by a Master of Divinity at Drew University Theological School in 1968. He also received a Certificate in Pastoral Psychiatry from Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital. While serving as pastor of the East Falls United Methodist Church in Philadelphia, he organized and was the first president of the Human Relations Committee of East Falls. Edgar also served as a member of the Police-clergy Unit and rode with city police in high crime areas. He also was co-director and funding coordinator of the People's Emergency Center in Philadelphia, which served as a shelter for homeless persons. He served as a full-time United Protestant chaplain of Drexel Hill University from 1971 to 1974, where he helped organize the counseling center. All of his activities indicate he was geared to assist the less fortunate and vulnerable segments of our society, while trying to bridge the gaps between the races.</p>
<p>1974 - Bob vs. Goliath</p>
<p>The political scene in Delaware County has incumbent Republican Lawrence G. Williams on the outs with the Board of Republican Supervisors (War Board) and politically vulnerable. Democrats had made significant gains in local elections and nationally, the Republicans are on the defensive on economic, as well as issues of corruption.</p>
<p>In February, Edgar becomes the first Democrat to enter the political fray in Delaware County, which pits the incumbent Republican against the War Board. He describes himself as a "new politician". Edgar accuses Williams of "trying to pass himself off as an independent," which "is a desperate move to woo voters who've become disenchanted with the Watergate administration. Ironically, Williams was pushed out of War Board power by another opportunist when Sam Dickey chose Springfield reapportionment as the opportune moment to axe Williams in favor of his protege (Steve McEwen)." He describes McEwen as "the latest hand-picked offering" of the War Board, adding "voters in the Republican primary have a choice between Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee. They're both seasoned politicians who represent the special interests of the financial and political power blocs which back them." Edgar receives a boost with the endorsement of most of the county's Democratic county and municipal leaders. He again aims his fire at the GOP: "I don't care who the Republican candidate is. If it is Williams, I'll run against his record. If it is McEwen, I'll run against his being a War Board-controlled candidate and some of the things Steve has muddled in." Edgar offers to fill in for McEwen, who has not responded to Williams' calls for a debate, but is turned down.</p>
<p>The thirty year old Edgar wins the Democratic primary over twenty-six year old David Belitsky, 10,511 to 6,367. With the incumbent Williams losing re-nomination and the War Board thoroughly discredited, the spotlight is on the young Democratic nominee. Edgar reports receipts during the primary election period of $3,611 and expenditures of $3,245. Edgar calls for State Attorney General Israel Packel to investigate "macing and other official corruption in Delaware County", the release of the Sprague report, a new independent county prosecutor and possibly federal marshals to monitor the elections in Chester.</p>
<p>In July, Edgar begins campaigning full-time, starting at the Swarthmore train station, shaking hands and handing out literature. Edgar calls on McEwen to stop "playing games" regarding the investigation of official corruption in the county. All of the Democratic candidates, including Edgar and the legislative slate, issue a statement calling for the state Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. Edgar pledges, if elected, to open district offices in Upper Darby and Chester.</p>
<p>Following the expected resignation of Nixon, the onus is on the new president, Gerald Ford, to lead the nation and prevent the wholesale defeat of the Republican party in the upcoming election. Several weeks later, Ford nominates former New York Governor Rockefeller for the vacant position of Vice President. During the fall campaign, Edgar calls for improving the Pension Reform Act to extend protection to more workers and for reforming the congressional committee system. State Representative Joseph Dorsey, who also serves as Republican chairman of Collingdale, heckles Edgar at a meeting of the county commissioners. Edgar, who had toured courthouse offices and Fair Acres, expresses his concerns to the county commissioners regarding admission policies to the county run nursing home. He states that in order for his grandmother to have been admitted to Fair Acres, his parents were forced to change their registration to Republican. Commission chairman Harry McNichol denies the allegation, stating "That is not true. You're making that statement for political purposes." Dorsey yells: "the reverend is a hypocrite" and "don't stand there and lie!" Edgar retorts: "I don't like being called a liar." At a candidates' forum at the Media Fellowship Home, Edgar, McEwen and Ralph Johns, the Constitutional party candidate, share the floor. McEwen is peppered with hostile questions from the audience, which has an abundance of Democrats, regarding allegations of political corruption in the county. Exasperated, McEwen replies: "Don't vote for me, vote for my opponent."</p>
<p>President Ford pardons Nixon for any possible Watergate crimes and his popularity in the Gallup poll drops from 71% to 49% and with it, G.O.P. electoral chances. Edgar states his opposition to the pardon. Both he and McEwen are in opposition to any further pardons related to Watergate. McEwen, in a letter to Edgar, registers his objections to the tone of the campaign. "You have engaged in personal attacks upon me during your campaign," the district attorney writes. Edgar responds: "At no time have I ever made any attacks on Mr. McEwen as a person." In a letter to the Times, Edgar outlines ten major issues of the campaign: inflation, energy, tax reform, environment, mass transit, campaign reform, congressional reorganization, tax relief, senior citizens issues and foreign aid. The candidates outline their views on the issues with Edgar supporting the right to abortion during the first three months of pregnancy and capital punishment "in the rarest of circumstances", including the killing of a prison guard. McEwen takes opposite stands, opposing abortion and favoring more liberal use of the death penalty.</p>
<p>Minnesota U.S. Senator Walter Mondale stumps for Edgar, stating in the superlative: "There is no congressional candidate in the country better than Bob Edgar." Bob Edgar trounces McEwen, 89,680 to 70,894, in a win that sent tremors through the ranks of the War Board and GOP faithful. In some towns, Edgar's landslide approaches fantastic proportions, for a Democrat: Aston by over 1,000 votes; Marple Township by over 1,800; Springfield 2,800; Ridley Township over 2,100. He even carries staunchly Republican Newtown Township and Sam Dickey's Upper Darby. All of this is in spite of the fact McEwen and the War Board spent $110,075 to Edgar's $38,819. "I think the people are tired of corrupt politicians," the newly-elected Democrat declares. "It was a people's campaign, and it was the people who came out and voted today." The Republicans blamed their historic losses on the convergence of the "Three W's": Watergate, Williams and War Board. One employee of the county courthouse states: "John McClure gave up his ghost Tuesday night in Delaware County."</p>
<p>The issues of Watergate and double-digit inflation allow the Democrats to pick up 43 House seats, leaving the balance over two-to-one in their favor: 291-144. In the Senate, changes were not as dramatic, with the Republicans losing three seats, leaving the balance in favor of the Democrats, 60 to 38, with two independents. Most of the casualties among the Republicans occurred with conservatives, while the moderates generally held their ground against the Democrats. Some of the moderate Republicans reelected were Charles Mathias of Maryland, Jacob Javits of New York, Robert Packwood of Oregon, and Schweiker. The Democrats also nab three additional governorships, giving them 36 out of 50, their highest total since the 1930's. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Milton Shapp is reelected over Andrew L. Lewis by over 300,000 votes, 1.885 to 1.573 million. Shapp carries Delaware County 103,043 to 102,426, as well as Bucks County. The governor sweeps the five county Philadelphia region by almost 225,000 votes. However, voters are sophisticated enough to reelect moderate Republican Senator Schweiker to a second term, 1.838 to 1.597 million votes, over Pittsburgh mayor Pete Flaherty. Schweiker does very well in the Philadelphia area, carrying all four suburban counties and only losing the city by some 3,300 votes. He sweeps Delaware County 128,081 to 76,129, with East Lansdowne the only municipality he loses.</p>
<p>In a stunning rebuke to the War Board, Upper Darby Township Director of Parks and Recreation, F. Joseph Loeper, loses to Democrat John Sweeney, a real estate broker from Drexel Hill, 42,687 to 42,157. Sweeney becomes the first Democrat to represent the heart of Delaware County in the state senate since the Civil War. The Democrats pick up four additional house districts, as well as reelecting Doyle. Ralph Garzia beats incumbent Stan Kester in the 160th, 10,603 to 7,308; Peter O'Keefe bests incumbent Ed Jones in the 161st, 10,024 to 9,963; Pat Gillespie downs Bill Taylor in the 162nd, 9,770 to 8,819 and Tom Stapleton ousts four term incumbent Don McCurdy in Springfield's 165th district, by a surprising 11,835 to 11,037. A rising star in the G.O.P., Faith Ryan Whittlesey, wins a second term in Haverford Township by beating Archie Pergolese, 12,888 to 10,341.</p>
<pre>
       1975  - The  Year  of  the  "Watergate Babies"
</pre>
<p>In January, Edgar is sworn in along with 91 other freshmen and becomes part of a group that will have a major effect on legislation and congressional operations. He is appointed to two committees: Public Works and Transportation and Veterans Affairs. In a major setback to the seniority system, Democrats in the House vote to replace three influential committee chairman: Wright Patman, Banking and Currency; F. Edward Hebert, Armed Services; and W. R. Poage, Agriculture. Edgar votes for the changes. In deposing three influential southerners from leadership positions, the Democrats have unwittingly contributed towards pushing white southerners out of the party and into the G.O.P. fold.</p>
<p>In responding to a tanker collision in the Delaware River near Marcus Hook, Edgar calls the federal disaster assistance program inadequate and unable to handle a "mini-disaster". Edgar votes with the rest of the House and rebuffs the president by suspending Ford's imposition of an oil import tariff. He also votes for a tax reduction totaling $21.3 billion in a bid to stimulate the economy and pushes for a five day workweek for members of the House. Edgar, a champion of mass transit, meets with Amtrak to obtain Metroliner service for Chester. He makes a major point by bicycling to his first meeting with the president at the White House. The March unemployment rate reaches yet another post-war high of 8.7%.</p>
<p>A county resident files a class action suit against county commissioners Nicholas Catania and Harry McNichol, charging that her application for employment was denied because she was not a registered Republican. The Republicans refuse comment, but Spingler states: "For years, people have accepted political discrimination as a basis for filling county jobs. But the fact of the matter is that the salaries of people on the public payroll are paid by all of the taxpayers in Delaware County. And all of the taxpayers should have an opportunity to fill these positions." The suit was filed by Jack Brian, a Democratic candidate for county judge.</p>
<p>In April, Edgar characterizes the House Democratic leaders as "egoship rather than leadership" and criticizes "excessive partisanship". As the government of South Vietnam nears collapse trying to resist the invasion from North Vietnam, there is wrangling on the House floor regarding aid to the South. Edgar criticizes Ford's call for $722 million in military aid, stating "It shows he (Ford) is out of touch with reality...with what the American people want." Edgar's amendment to set a ten day deadline on evacuations from South Vietnam and provide humanitarian aid is ruled out of order. He votes with the majority of his party against an amendment to prohibit the funds from being used by North Vietnam or the Viet Cong and votes "present" for an amendment noting the "flagrant violations of the Paris Peace Agreement" by the Communists. In tough language, Edgar gives his view of the seizure of the American merchant ship, the S.S. Mayaguez, by gunboats from Communist Cambodia, in international waters. "If they don't give it back, we should go in and take it back." After military intervention by the United States, the ship is freed. "I commend the president for being decisive," Edgar states, but he feels that Congress is "ill-informed" during times of crisis. Edgar votes against final passage of the Vietnam assistance bill, which fails anyway, 162-246. He also votes in opposition to an amendment to hold federal spending to the amount of revenues in 1976, $300 billion. The effort to balance the budget failed in the House, 94-311.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate finally peaks at 9.2% and then begins a steady descent as the national economy slowly pulls out of the worst recession since World War Two. Edgar votes with the majority to renew the Voting Rights Act for another ten years and votes to override Ford's veto of a bill to provide temporary subsidies for the middle class to purchase homes. The veto is sustained, 268-157. Edgar votes to override two other vetoes on public works projects and strip mining regulations, but the vetoes are also sustained.</p>
<p>Edgar sets a precedent by performing a wedding for a fellow member of Congress, Representative Max Baucus of Montana. Congress votes to block the Administration's plan to lift price controls on domestic oil, 262-167, with Edgar voting with the majority. He votes with the minority against raising the pay for members of Congress, as well as high level executive and judicial branch employees. Edgar also joins 90 other House members and backs a resolution calling for the U.S. to renounce "first use of nuclear weapons", stating such use is "not an option for civilized man." Edgar introduces legislation to reorganize thirty narrowly-defined transportation aid programs into four categories: interstate, rural, urban, and safety and bridge improvements. Commenting about two recent assassination attempts upon President Ford, Edgar states: "We live in a fragile society...attempts on the President's life are going to increase." He announces that he will set aside the "after-taxes" portion of the recent congressional pay raise for a "small scholarship" program for Delaware County colleges. Edgar votes against final passage of the $90.2 billion Defense Department appropriations bill, which passes 353-61. Another of Ford's vetoes is overridden in the House by a vote of 397-18. Edgar votes with the majority to pass the School Lunch and Child Nutrition bill over the veto.</p>
<p>Locally, the “New Look” Republicans, beat back a spirited challenge from the Democrats, who had hoped to follow in Edgar's footsteps. Whittlesey and Keeler are elected county commissioners, receiving about 103,000 votes to Spingler's 87,000, reelecting the latter to the minority seat. Spingler admits "Keeler and Mrs. Whittlesey are not the hack politicians that McNichol and Catania are, but they're philosophically different from myself. They believe government shouldn't do anything for people."</p>
<p>1976 - Edgar's Second "Miracle"</p>
<p>Edgar votes to bar aid requested by Ford to anti-Soviet factions fighting in Angola. The ban passes 323 to 99. He also votes with the majority to override Ford's veto of a $36 billion Labor-HEW spending bill, which passes 310-113. Whittlesey, Keeler and Spingler take office under the new Home Rule Charter as County Council members and begin a series of reforms to streamline county government and eliminate waste. Ford wins the New Hampshire primary, narrowly defeating Reagan, 49.4% to 48% and taking 17 delegates to Reagan's four and former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter wins the Democratic primary. Edgar votes with the majority to add 320,000 emergency jobs to the C.E.T.A. program. In the Public Works committee, Edgar votes against a bill to limit federal regulation of dredge dumping and filling in waterways and wetlands. He warns that the bill will create an "ecological and administrative nightmare" and leave 85% of wetlands unprotected. He also sponsors an amendment to add $610 million to funding for extending educational benefits eligibility.</p>
<p>Congressman William J. Green of Philadelphia wins the Democratic primary for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Hugh Scott. Green beats state senator Jeanette F. Reibman 762,733 to 345,264 statewide, carrying Delaware County four to one. In a heated six-way Republican primary, Congressman John Heinz III of Pittsburgh edges out former Philadelphia District Attorney Arlen Specter, 358,715 to 332,513, with George Packard receiving 160,379, in statewide totals. Delaware County gives Specter an overwhelming majority over Heinz, however. Carter beats Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson statewide, 511,905 to 340,340, with 259,166 for Udall and 155,902 for Wallace. The results countywide mirror the state returns. The Republicans nominate John M. (Jay) Kenney Jr., a former deputy district attorney to challenge Edgar in the fall. Kenney criticizes Edgar's commitment to "achieving a balanced budget as soon as possible", stating that the incumbent is "one of Congress' biggest spenders", having voted for a budget with at $50 billion deficit.</p>
<p>Edgar asks the House Ethics Committee to look into allegations that Congressman Wayne Hays, powerful chairman of the House Operations Committee, placed Elizabeth Ray on his payroll for non-work-related purposes. Edgar votes to override a presidential veto of bill to spend $125 million for states to comply with health and safety standards for federally funded day care centers. The override is successful, 301 to 101. Edgar's bill adding the 45 acre Folcroft dump to the Tinicum Wildlife Center is approved by the House unanimously. In June, Due to his generally liberal voting record, Edgar is targeted for defeat by the conservative National Committee for an Effective Congress. He votes for a defense department budget of $105.4 billion and against the Hyde Amendment, which passes 207-187, to cut off federal funding for abortions.</p>
<p>The Democrats meet in New York City in July and nominate Carter on the first ballot, in a relatively peaceful convention. Carter then selects Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale, a liberal, as his running mate and begins the race against Ford with a 33 point lead in the polls. The platform of the Democrats calls for addressing unemployment and cutting the defense budget, among other things. Meanwhile, Reagan, still unable to win enough delegates for the Republican nomination, throws a bombshell by announcing his running mate in advance: liberal Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker. Instead of attracting enough moderate delegates from Pennsylvania to put Reagan over the top, the ploy backfires, costing him the support of the conservative Mississippi delegation. The former California governor then fails to have a convention rule passed that would have forced Ford to name his running mate in advance. Edgar votes for a bill protecting consumers against unfair practices related to credit card companies, which passes 239-162. He also casts a vote in favor of a bill to increase unemployment benefits and to extend coverage to 8.9 million workers, which passes 237-157. Another veto is overridden, for a bill to spend $4 billion on public works jobs, anti-recessionary aid to states and waste water treatment. Edgar votes for this as well as a bill to mandate that all meetings of federal agencies headed by two or more open their meetings to the public, unless specific reasons are given otherwise.</p>
<p>The newspaper Roll Call, names Edgar among the top ten most effective Democratic freshman, ranking him as seventh out of eighty-one freshmen. He also denounces a Kenney campaign brochure that depicts Edgar's voting record with headlines as "grossly out of touch with reality" and files a complaint with the Fair Campaign Practices Committee. Not to be outdone, Kenney counter-files with the same group, objecting to Edgar's attacks on him. Both complaints are eventually dropped, however. Edgar votes for an average workweek of 54 hours for federal firefighters and premium pay for overtime, but the bill fails 184-204. A badly divided Republican party meets in Kansas City and renominates Ford over Reagan by a 1,187 to 1,070 vote of the delegates. Ford, having earlier dropped Rockefeller, moves to the right and selects conservative Kansas Senator Bob Dole as his running mate and begins the race with Carter as the distinct underdog.</p>
<p>In stepping up his efforts to unseat Edgar, Kenney states: "Edgar's voting record shows he represents a small fringe of his party." During a candidates' debate, the Republican challenger hammers away at the fact that Congress has been dominated for 40 of the past 44 years by the Democrats. In response to criticism of amnesty for draft evaders, Edgar states: "If we can allow Nixon and Agnew to play golf for the rest of their lives with just a slap on the wrist, we can deal seriously with young people who stood up against the Vietnam war." He favors pardons for conscientious draft resisters and a case by case review of military deserters. Kenney brands inflation as the major economic issue, stating: "Inflation is public enemy number one and deficit spending is the number one reason for it." Edgar, in contrast, states the traditional Democratic view: "Unemployment is our most serious problem." A flap ensues regarding separate letters that Kenney and his wife wrote to Edgar's office in September 1975, stating their strong opposition to aid for Israel. Copies of the letters make their way into the county's Jewish community. Edgar denies Kenney's charges that the letters were deliberately leaked. Kenney extricates himself from the matter by stating that he and his wife had since changed their opinion on the issue. Edgar, in turn, remarks that the only two letters he had ever received from the Kenney's concern objections to Israeli aid. Edgar calls for the deletion of two water projects in Alaska, costing $10.5 million, stating: "I decided that this project was clearly the most flagrant boondoggle at public expense." He backs down after being chastised by Alaskan congressman Donald Young. He also votes with the majority, 325-75, to stop automatic cost of living increases for members of Congress, federal judges and top officials. A bill to balance the budget, with $362.5 billion in revenues and expenditures, is voted down, 111-264, with Edgar voting against it. He does vote with 226 others to pass a budget blueprint, calling for expenditures of $413.2 billion and a deficit of $50.7 billion. However, 151 representatives, mostly conservatives, oppose the budget. Another notable bill passed by the House is to strengthen disclosures for lobbyists. It passes 290 to 53, with Edgar voting in favor. In the fifth and final debate in October, Edgar calls for a balanced budget through economic growth and decreased unemployment. Kenney favors a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The Times endorses Kenney, based on Edgar's pro-labor stand on repeal of the right-to-work provision, section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. For his first term, Edgar's support of Ford Administration legislation was 30% in favor and 67% opposed. He proves himself a loyal party member, voting 86% of the time with his party and only 10% against. His attendance is 99%.</p>
<p>Although many voters seem indifferent or turned off to both presidential candidates, Ford steadily closes the gap in the polls until he almost draws even with Carter. When the results are counted, the Republicans are unable to avenge their losses from two years before. Ford does carry the county, 148,679 to 117,252 and Heinz is given an unimpressive majority of 141,651 to 124,088. But, to the G.O.P.'s dismay, Edgar soundly beats Kenney, 109,436 to 92,788, proving that his first election was not a fluke. Again, Edgar is outspent, $170,508 to $129,172, but the gap is closing. The incumbent carries both Chester and Upper Darby, causing one G.O.P. worker to mutter: "This is a total disaster." County Republican Chairman Thomas Judge and Whittlesey criticize the Chester party, led by Mayor John Nacrelli, for handing out sample ballots that left Ford and Kenney off. The Democrats win five out of ten state legislative matches, reelecting all incumbents, except Gillespie, who loses to Gerald Spitz by 21 votes. However, the Democrats compensate by picking up the Chester seat with Francis X. Tenaglio's 9,096 to 7,971 win over Worrilow. Stapleton beats Williams 14,394 to 13,723 and wins a second term. Edgar comments: "If I've done anything, I've established a healthy, two-party system in this county." He further predicts the Democrats will win some countywide races the following year. Whittlesey attributes the strong support of labor for Edgar's reelection: "Labor distributed a support letter for Edgar last week at a cost of $20,000. We've got a lot of work ahead of us." Nationally, the election is close, with Carter taking the popular vote 40.828 million to 39.148 million. The Electoral Vote tally is much closer, 297 electoral votes for Carter to 240 for Ford, who had been steadily closing the gap in the polls. Even though Ford had made a valiant effort, the challenge from Reagan and the right wing left the president in a weakened position. In Congress, the close national election is also reflected. The Republicans manage to pick up one Senate seat from an independent, leaving the Democrats with a 61 to 38 edge, with one remaining independent. In the House, the Democrats pick up one seat, giving them a 292 to 143 edge, their highest total in twelve years. In Pennsylvania, Carter narrowly takes the state, 2.328 million to 2.205 million votes. Voters again split their tickets and elect Heinz over Green, 2.381 to 2.126 million votes. In Republican Bucks County, there is an upset, as Democrat Peter Kostmayer is elected over state senator John S. Renninger, 93,855 to 92,543. In the neighboring Fifth District, Schulze wins his second term by defeating Democrat Anthony Campolo, Jr., 119,682 to 81,229. During Gerald Ford's relatively brief two years and five months in office, he cast forty-eight regular vetoes, with Congress overriding twelve of them. He also pocket vetoed eighteen other bills. His total of sixty-six vetoes is the highest for a president's term since Eisenhower.</p>
<pre>
  1977 - the Democrats are Back in  the Driver's  Seat
</pre>
<p>Bob Edgar is sworn in for his second term and Jimmy Carter takes office as the first Democratic president in eight years. Edgar spearheads a drive for federal funds for "an economic recovery program for the impacted industrial area of Delaware County...We're hoping we'll be the first area the new administration approves for such aid." He notes the loss of jobs at the FMC Corporation in Marcus Hook, the Westinghouse Electric plant in Lester and the Boeing Vertol Company in Ridley Township. Joining Edgar were all three County Council members and other local officials. He also appears before 4,300 Boeing employees, pledging help in getting an $800 million Navy helicopter contract for the company. The Times, in an editorial, criticizes Edgar for voting against the B-1 bomber, stating: "Mr. Edgar, to say the least, is no friend of the Pentagon." Edgar criticizes the scheduled $13,000 pay raise for members of Congress, stating he will vote against any increase to the salary of $42,500.</p>
<p>Edgar votes for the Emergency Natural Gas Act of 1977, which gives the president power to allocate gas and raise prices, in order to combat critical shortages. His amendment to the Public Works Jobs Program bill to change the method of allocating funding to reflect the number of unemployed and the state unemployment rate, fails 187-201. After Representative Henry Gonzalez of Texas resigns as chairmen and a member of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Edgar is named to replace him. The committee, which is to investigate the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, saw a bitter dispute between Gonzalez and chief counsel Richard Sprague. Sprague also resigned. Edgar and Spingler call for an investigation into county hiring under the federally funded Comprehensive Unemployment Training Act. At a County Council meeting, Spingler charges that almost all of the new CETA hires were registered Republicans. Keeler and Whittlesey vehemently deny the accusations. In March, Edgar votes against the wishes of President Carter for an increase in the standard federal income tax deduction from $2,200 to $2,400. The bill passes 386-29. He misses the vote on the tax cut bill, which passes 282 to 131, although he declares his support for it. He also cosponsors a bill to create an oil spill liability fund to be used for situations, such as the Marcus Hook collision and spill. An amendment by Edgar to a water pollution control bill is attempted, but he throws his support behind a similar amendment, which loses by voice vote. Edgar's amendment would have strengthened and defined the wetlands protection program. Edgar votes against cutting overseas troops by 17,000, as well as active military strength by 50,000, and the bill fails, 88 to 301. Edgar votes against a series of amendments to weaken the Clean Air Act and supports its final passage. Returning from a trip to the Mideast, the Seventh District congressman states his belief that President Sadat of Egypt is sincerely seeking peace with Israel. Although a bill to prohibit federal funds from being used to bus students beyond the school nearest to their homes passes, 225-157, Edgar votes against it. The bill also forbids HEW from mandating the merger, pairing or clustering of schools to achieve desegregation. He also votes against an amendment sponsored by arch-conservative Democrat Larry McDonald of Georgia to prohibit federal legal assistance funds to be used for cases arising from a dispute over homosexuality or gay rights. The bill passes, 230 to 133. Edgar also speaks out in favor of the Conte-Derrick amendment to delete 16 water projects, but the effort fails, 194 to 218. He meets with Vice President Mondale to discuss the county's economic problems.</p>
<p>In July, Edgar votes to raise the minimum wage from $2.30 an hour to $2.65. The bill is passed, 331 to 44. An amendment sponsored in the Public Works committee by Edgar to impose user fees to recover 50% of new construction costs and 100% of operating and maintenance costs for water projects is rejected, by an eight to thirty vote. The House votes to create the federal Department of Energy, consolidating several related agencies, 353 to 57, with Edgar in support. Both Edgar and Carter oppose the proposed Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant, due to concerns about the environment and the terrorist potential of the plutonium generated. "The breeder is bad business...A delay now would hardly be any sacrifice, and it might just make the difference to bring some sanity in a world which is becoming increasingly insane," Edgar states. Edgar calls for the resignation of embattled Budget Director Bert Lance, whose personal business dealings have raised questions of ethics and competence. A bill to raise the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70 passes 362 to 0. Edgar votes against an amendment to delete a provision for the automatic adjustment of the minimum wage for inflation. The amendment passes 223 to 193, but another amendment to pay 85% of the minimum wage to teenagers under 18, fails 210 to 211, with Edgar opposed. Edgar and 18 members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation meet with President Carter to discuss local issues, such as the failure of Boeing Vertol to secure the Navy L.A.M.P.S. helicopter contract. Carter promises a review of the contract award and Edgar declares "the President is sensitive" to the county's economic problems. A major reform of labor legislation passes, 257 to 163, with Edgar voting in favor. The bill will aid union organizing and bargaining by streamlining regulatory procedures and will strengthen penalties against employers who violate labor laws. The Times attacks Edgar for his vote, stating that the bill is too pro-labor. The recommendation of the Obey Commission to reform House rules, travel, committees and House employee discrimination matters, fails 160 to 252, but Edgar votes in support of it. A major bill to ensure the solvency of the Social Security system is passed, with Edgar in favor, 275 to 146. Both tax rates and the taxable wage base will be increased. Carter signs a bill introduced by Edgar to continue federal subsidies to SEPTA at 80%, rather than 50%, until October, then allowing them to drop for the next two years.</p>
<p>“New Look” Republicans Dennis Rochford and Harold "Bud" Haabestad are elected over Democrats Jim Cunningham and Henry F. Teti by about 87,000 to 60,000 votes. Springfield resoundingly returns to the G.O.P. fold, but Edgar's hometown of Marple Township is seized by the Democrats. Edgar votes for the final conference report on the Social Security bill, which passes by a close 189 to 163 vote. Only 15 Republicans support the measure, while 109 oppose it. Democrats vote 174 to 54 in favor of restoring Social Security to fiscal health.</p>

       1978 - Resurgence of the Republicans,  but Edgar Survives
</pre>
<p>The year begins with Edgar working behind the counter at the Camera Shop in Lawrence Park, as part of a program sponsored by the Small Business Council of the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce. He also makes public his unhappiness with Carter's lack of commitment to mass transit, as shown in the budget. Edgar's efforts finally bear fruit, as Amtrak announces that a stop in Chester will be given a trial run. He introduces a bill to provide for the merit selection of U.S. attorneys, in the wake of the public outcry concerning the firing of U.S. Attorney, David Marston. Marston, a Republican appointee, had been investigating cases involving allegations of corruption regarding local Democratic officials when the firing occurred by the Democratic Carter Administration last year. The popular and affable Mayor of Upper Darby, Eugene "Sonny" Kane declares his candidacy for Edgar's seat. Edgar is accused by Kane of sending a staff member to collect information at the latter's press conference. Edgar later states that Kane's uninvited visitor was a volunteer, working at Edgar's office, who had attended the meeting on his own. The two new Republican members join Whittlesey and Keeler on the Delaware County Council, leaving Spingler as the lone Democrat for the next two years. Edgar votes for 150 new federal judgeships, $250 million for weather-related highway repairs, and again against funding the B-1 bomber, which the Carter administration opposes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department characterizes Delaware County's CETA program as having a "hiring system that is subject to charges of abuse, favoritism and political discrimination." It further charges that federal hiring guidelines are not being followed by the county or Upper Darby Township. In the case of the latter, while 68% of the voters are registered Republicans, 95% of those hired under the CETA program were Republican registered. Kane refers to Edgar's criticism of Upper Darby Township's CETA program as "politically inspired." A proposed constitutional amendment to allow the District of Columbia residents elected representation in Congress, passes 289-127, with Edgar in favor. A bill to allow for public financing of House elections, fails, 198 to 209. Edgar votes in favor of the bill which would have limited the influence of outside special interest money on House elections. At a press conference, President Carter attributes his decline in popularity to problems with the national economy. "Government doesn't have the unilateral autocratic control over some of these very difficult issues," he declares. Edgar is challenged from within his party by Doris McHugh, a Lansdowne housewife, who opposes abortion rights and supports tuition tax credits for non-public students. Kane, the endorsed Republican candidate, is challenged in the primary by Raymond Burrows, a former Yeadon auditor from Folcroft and Peter Diachenko, a Philadelphia courts employee. Democratic electoral fortunes fall as Carter's popularity continues its tumble. According to a Gallup Poll, only 39% of Americans voice approval of the job he is doing, while 46% disapprove.</p>
<p>Kane challenges Edgar's "liberal" stands on issues, such as the Panama Canal transfer and federal spending. He blames the incumbent's "anti-defense posture" for the loss of defense department contracts and jobs at Boeing Vertol. Edgar counters, stating that there is "only a limited amount a congressman can do to get a particular contract, and I did it." He blamed Boeing's loss on its bid being higher than that of the winner of the contract. Edgar votes against a budget resolution to balance federal revenues and expenditures at $464.6 billion each. The resolution is defeated, 170-226, and he votes for another resolution that passes, allowing for a $58 billion deficit. Edgar votes in favor of killing the Neutron bomb, but the measure fails, 90-306. When the primary election votes are tallied, Edgar easily defeats his opponent, 15,844 to 3,377. Kane, the first mayor of Upper Darby under its new Home Rule Charter, wins the G.O.P. nomination, 41,896 to 11,587 for his opponents. With Milton Shapp bound by the two term limit for governor, the Democrats nominate Flaherty over Casey and Lt. Governor Ernest P. Kline. The county vote is Flaherty, 12,071; Casey, 9,448; and Kline 4,687. Statewide, Flaherty has about 575,000 votes to Casey's 445,000 and Kline's distant 224,000. The Republican race is also divided, with three major contenders. Specter carries Delaware County with 36,383 votes to Republican House leader Bob Butera's 21,220, former federal prosecutor David Marston's 13,036 and another former federal prosecutor, Richard Thornburgh, with 8,541. Statewide, the results are quite different, Thornburgh wins the nomination with 325,000 votes, with Specter a distant second with 206,000, Butera 190,000 and Marston 161,000. With a huge statewide Democratic registration edge, Thornburgh begins the race as the underdog. Locally, however, the big news is really the lieutenant governor's race for both parties. Spingler carries his home county, 12,532 to 5,108 for Robert P. Casey, who is not the former State Auditor. Statewide, Spingler comes in a disappointing eighth out of fourteen, with only 47,000 votes to the winner, Casey, who takes 346,000, with name recognition certainly a major factor. Philadelphia Controller Tom Leonard comes in second with 219,000 and C. Delores Tucker, also of Philadelphia, former Secretary of the Commonwealth, comes in third with 162,000. The results on the Republican side are equally gloomy for county Republicans. Whittlesey is soundly beaten by Scranton, 444,000 to 265,000, but carries her home county 52,033 to 18,016. But, this will not be the last time that both Democrats and Republicans from Delaware County aspire to statewide office.</p>
<p>The Times lauds Edgar for his efforts as a member of the 148 member Northeast-Midwest Economic Advance-ment Coalition. During the month, votes were taken on several "hot button" social issues. Edgar votes in favor of tuition tax credits for private elementary and secondary students. The bill, which passes, 209-194, would allow a maximum of $50 for 1978 and $100 for 1979 and 1980. He votes on the losing side, 122-287, to allow HEW funds to be spent for abortions and votes against an amendment, which passes, 232-177, to outlaw HEW funding for quotas in hiring, promotions and admissions. He votes against a bill to prohibit Commerce Department funding for conducting of trade with Cuba. The bill passes 241 to 158, however. He also votes with the majority for a $2 billion federal loan guarantee for New York City, which had been teetering on bankruptcy. In July, Edgar addresses a rally of Sun Ship workers, calling for the building of more smaller-sized ships, as a way to spur employment at the company. In another pro-environment vote, Edgar votes to reduce funding for the Clinch River nuclear breeder reactor program and limit any further work done to studies. The amendment fails, 142 to 187. Two amendments to restrict the Civil Rights Commission are voted on: to prevent the commission from studying discrimination based on handicap and the other to prevent commission members from lobbying Congress or state legislators. The first one fails, 87 to 224, but the second passes, 159 to 125, and Edgar votes against both. Edgar pushes to have SEPTA trolley cars built by Boeing Vertol, rather than overseas. He had inserted language into a House transportation bill to require that purchases made with federal funds be made from American companies, if the cost is reasonable. The House passes a Sense of Congress resolution against withdrawing troops from South Korea, 212-189, with Edgar in support. An amendment to prohibit foreign aid to Uganda, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam fails, 198-203, with Edgar voting against it.</p>
<p>As a prelude to the 1980 G.O.P. campaign, an amendment to reduce individual income taxes by one-third over three years, fails in the House, 177 to 240. The total package of cuts for individuals, corporations and capital gains would have totaled $16.3 billion. In jousting over the Equal Rights Amendment, which was reaching the end of its seven year limit to gain the necessary number of states for ratification, several amendments were voted on. One was to allow states that had ratified it to withdraw and not allow any extension of the deadline. That failed, 196 to 227, with Edgar in opposition. A 39 month extension of the deadline for state ratification then passed, 233 to 189, with Edgar in favor. At a Democratic fundraiser at the Log Cabin Inn, First Lady Rosalyn Carter addresses the crowd, which gives her a standing ovation. Edgar rallies the party faithful by stating: "I don't apologize for voting my best judgment or for standing up to the leadership of Congress when I think they are wrong." The House fails to override President Carter's veto of a defense procurement authorization bill, 191 to 206. Edgar votes to uphold the veto, even though he had voted for the bill earlier in the year. Kane refers to Edgar as a "rubber stamp" for the Carter Administration and criticizes the incumbent's "flip-flop" on the defense bill. Edgar defends his vote on the veto, stating that the veto was due to the bill's provision for a nuclear carrier, which, like the President, he opposed. Edgar and Kane meet separately with federal Housing and Urban Development officials to try to obtain $1.8 million in funding for a Community Block Grant for Upper Darby Township. Kane, who met with the officials, first, calls Edgar's meeting unnecessary. Edgar votes to successfully uphold a presidential veto of a $10.1 billion water projects bill. The override attempt fails, 223 to 190. A proposed individual tax rate cut of 5% a year for four years with the proviso that federal spending is not increased above inflation is passed 268 to 135. Edgar votes against the cut. In spite of strong administration opposition, Edgar again votes in favor of tuition tax credits for private elementary and secondary school students. Even though the bill passes, 207 to 185, it dies in the Senate. The final conference version of the Revenue Act of 1978, which provides for an $18.7 billion tax cut in 1979, passes 337-38, with Edgar voting in favor.</p>
<p>The position of the Democrats is strengthened, as Carter's popularity remains at the 50% mark, due to his efforts at brokering the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt. Edgar is endorsed by the Inquirer and Bulletin based on his leadership on issues such as mass transit and the Tinicum National Wildlife Center. Bob Edgar tops Sonny Kane by only 79,771 to 78,403, in clearly the former's toughest challenge yet, with Kane having a spending advantage of $170,508 to $129,172. A strategy pursued by Kane's campaign handlers to capitalize on his large girth, evidently backfires. A piece of literature, as well as television ads, stating "Sonny Kane Gets Results in Upper Darby by Throwing His Weight Around" appear undignified when compared to the clean cut and studious Edgar. Kane cuts into Edgar's margins in the blue collar areas, but does not do as well as expected in the white collar towns of Marple and Springfield. In a Republican year, Thornburgh tops Flaherty in the county, 125,936 to 80,571 and wins statewide by 228,000 votes of 3.7 million cast. The state senate seat vacated by John Sweeney, who had decided not to seek reelection, is taken by Loeper, who beats four term state representative Ted Doyle, 45,147 to 40,389. Tenaglio, Garzia, O'Keefe and Stapleton are unseated, as local Republicans ride the Thornburgh wave. Democrat Scott Caspar also fails to succeed Doyle in the district the latter vacated to run for state senate. Statewide, the G.O.P. gains 17 House seats, but with the results of one House district in doubt, there is now a 101 to 101 tie between both parties. In the 91st legislative district, encompassing Adams and York counties, both candidates receive 8,551 votes. A recount awards the seat to the Democrat by 14 votes, but another recount settles the matter in favor of the Republican by 21 votes. Nationally, Republican gains were modest, but solid, with three additional Senate seats, twelve House seats and six governorships swinging their way. The new lineup will see slightly reduced Democratic majorities of 59 to 41 in the Senate and 276 to 159 in the House. Pennsylvania will be sending twelve Democratic congressman to Washington, along with seven Republicans. National Democratic chairman John C. White assesses the election, stating: "For the first time in the postwar era, Democrats have retained more than 60% of the House seats in three successive elections." For the 95th Congress, Edgar has a 99% attendance record and supported the administration on 75% of votes taken and was in opposition only 19% of the time.</p>
<pre>
 1979 - The Year of Hyper-Inflation and the Iranian Crisis
</pre>
<p>The year begins with Edgar testifying at a hearing before the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service against a planned location for an environmental education building at the Tinicum National Environmental Center. He favors a location at the western end of the center, as opposed to the proposed eastern location. At a forum in Media, the Seventh District congressman criticizes Carter's State of the Union address as "fell flat". Edgar states: "The mood in Washington is sobering. We're all interested in getting the national deficit down and balancing the budget by 1981." Regarding his votes against the defense budget, he explains: "The country needs a strong, practical defense system...I retain the right to weed out parts I cannot accept." He also reiterates his support for term limits: "Congressmen should be recycled every twelve years." Tip O'Neil is reelected Speaker of the House, 268 to 152, for his second two year term. John J. Rhodes of Arizona, again becomes the Minority Leader, a position he has held since 1973. The report of the task force appointed by Edgar to study the Blue Route is presented to Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams. According to Edgar, the original highway design was to accommodate a 70 m.p.h. speed limit and had traffic projections based on the completion of other since canceled expressways. It was also planned for six lanes its entire length, with wide medians to allow expansion to eight lanes. Lowing the limit to the current 55 as well as reducing the overall width of the highway would result in slightly sharper curves and steeper grades and use less land.</p>
<p>Edgar tours the Wade dump in Chester, located under the Commodore Barry Bridge, where some 3,000 of barrels of toxic wastes, such as sodium copper cyanide and glacial acrylic acid were left behind. Edgar comments on the site, calling it "a time bomb waiting to explode." Edgar declares he will not seek the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated by the retiring Richard Schweiker. Edgar debates Marple Commission president Gerald Connors, a fellow Democrat, regarding the proposed scaled-down version of the Blue Route. Connors exclaims: "We were assured all along PennDOT would investigate alternatives to the Blue Route" and that officials were trying to "ram the Blue Route down our throats." Edgar retorts that "There are highways that are built well", such as the Baltimore-Washington beltway and calls for a regional transportation plan giving motorists access to trolley, bus and railway lines. Connors states that it will cost the township $900,000 a year in additional police patrols and a new pumping station will be needed to pump sewage across the highway. Edgar hopes for "genuine support" in Congress for a scientific review of the evidence that led the House Committee on Assassinations to conclude two gunmen shot at JFK. "I don't think we should reopen the whole investigation again. But we had better make sure the acoustics stuff was as valuable as the majority of the committee said it was. We found no evidence to suggest a conspiracy. We found no gunmen or evidence of a gunman. We found no gun, no shells, no impact of shots from the grassy knoll. We found not entry wounds from the front into any person, including President John Kennedy or Governor John Connally... Few credible eyewitness accounts back up the marginal findings of our acoustics experts." The committee had spent $5.8 million to investigate the slayings of Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Catania is rebuffed in his bid for a comeback to county office. His first effort to have the votes of the municipal leaders cast by secret ballot loses by a vote of 39 to 10. He receives 101 votes for endorsement, as opposed to 164 for state representative Frank Lynch, 200.5 for Whittlesey and 225 for Keeler. Catania charges that county job holders had been pressured and flirts with the idea of an independent candidacy.</p>
<p>Speaking before the Council for Urban Economic Development in Long Beach, California, Edgar praises the jobs created by small business. "We have to develop more imaginative tools to develop finance legislation to help these firms." In a letter to the Times, Edgar, who now serves as Chairman of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Co-altion states: "I believe that far more harm than good would come to the economy of the nation, the Northeast region and the 7th District if we put ourselves in the straightjacket of a mandated balanced budget at this time." The Edgar for Senate Committee files with the Federal Elections Commission and Edgar states he is "exploring the possibility" of pursuing Schweiker's seat. However, he qualifies this by saying: "I like being a congressman from Delaware County." He also wins the Environmental Award from the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects for "enlarging the area of the Tinicum National Environmental Center and his search for an environmentally sensitive solution to the Blue Route." In spite of worsening oil shortages due to the turmoil in Iran, a bill supported by Carter to permit gasoline rationing under emergency conditions fails, 159-246, with Edgar supporting the administration. At a forum on the energy shortage, Edgar states the increased demand for gasoline, the small reduction in imports from Iran, inadequate supplies of unleaded gasoline, and the building up of oil stocks for the winter season "create the appearance of a shortage more severe than it actually is."</p>
<p>In a relatively close vote, Edgar votes with the administration to implement the Panama Canal treaties. Only 35 Republicans vote in favor, while 122 are in opposition. The legislation passes, nevertheless, 224 to 202. He also supports taxing corporate windfall profits due to oil price increases. Another Edgar amendment to delete spending for a water project, fails 13 to 97. In attacking the proposed Stonewall Jackson dam in West Virginia, Edgar remarks: "This project has no merits" and that he was "angry at the Congress for its failure to stand up to the politics of pork." Edgar criticizes the administration's gas allocation system and calls for the firing of Energy Secretary James Schlesinger. He introduces legislation to permit the issuance of "Energy Savings Bonds", calling the purchase of the proposed bonds a "patriotic act". An estimated $50 billion would be raised and used for research and development. Another bill sponsored by Edgar would provide another $10 billion for mass transit. He also is leaning strongly towards running for the Senate and is involved with three major events that center around meeting state Democratic officials or raising funds. A constitutional amendment that would, in effect, prohibit school busing beyond the nearest school, fails, 209-216, with Edgar voting against it. In another example of the growing ideological split between the two parties, especially on social issues, Republicans support the amendment almost three to one, while Democrats are opposed almost two to one. The all-white Southern Democratic delegation, in a show of increasing moderation, only narrowly supports the amendment, 47 to 38. In its final report, the twelve member House Assassinations Committee concludes that conspiracies probably played a key role in the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Edgar, along with three other members in dissenting from the majority, states that there was a "rush to a conspirational conclusion." Edgar who is "shocked" by Carter's purge of top government officials, believes that the president is blind to "excessive dependency on White House staffers from Georgia. These people have often shown political insensitivity and ignorance during the past two and a half years." Gone from the administration are Attorney General Griffin Bell, Brock Adams, HEW Secretary Joseph Califano, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal and Schlesinger. Carter had appointed Hamilton Jordan as his Chief of Staff. Edgar decides against running for the United States Senate, citing the difficulty in raising the large sums of money needed for the campaign.</p>
<p>Edgar votes for the Emergency Energy Conservation act, which finally passes, 263 to 159. The measure authorizes the president, with the consent of Congress, to ration gasoline if there is a shortage of 20% or more. In an opening salvo for his upcoming congressional bid, County Councilman Rochford attacks Edgar's votes in 1975 against the Republican administration's energy plans. Specifically, he criticizes Edgar's vote against congressional review of federal Energy Department regulations and his vote to rollback domestic oil prices. Edgar retorts, stating: "My record is pro solar energy, pro synthetic fuels and pro coal gassification." Edgar votes against a proposed 7% raise for members of Congress and others. The measure fails, 191 to 211. The American Conservative Union gives Edgar a score of 4% and Schulze 89%. The statewide average for is 45% and the national average 47%. Rochford again criticizes Edgar for being only one of 49 representatives to vote against "final" passage of the defense budget for 1980. Edgar says he opposed the bill because "each and every increase in the defense budget serves to send more of our tax dollars to the South and West. It's about time we protested." He qualifies this by stating: "I have voted for every appropriations bill and defense bill to come before the House of Representatives." A bill passes the House, 217 to 198, to limit the amount a House candidate can receive from PACs during a two year cycle to $70,000. Each PAC would be limited to donations of $6,000. It would also prohibit campaign funds from being used to repay a candidate's personal loan to the campaign in excess of $35,000. Edgar supports the bill. Edgar is not aligned with Carter or Kennedy, but says that the Massachusetts senator "can only go down" in the polls. He also is fighting plans by the federal government to move over 400 jobs from the Defense Contract Administration Service from Philadelphia to Marietta, Georgia. In other "hot button" social legislation, a welfare reform proposal to create demonstration programs, using block grants to the states and allowing greater local flexibility, fails, 200 to 205. A bill setting a national minimum benefit, requiring states to cover unemployed two family households with children, and reducing administrative costs, passes by 38 votes. Edgar votes against the first bill and in favor of the second.</p>
<p>The unfolding hostage crisis in Iran gives Carter a needed boost in popularity, as the nation rallies around its leadership. Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy and California Governor Edmund Brown, Jr. formally enter the race for the Democratic nomination, challenging Carter. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker and former California Governor Ronald Reagan enter the fray on the G.O.P. side. Regarding the American hostages, Edgar states: "Let me emphasize that it is counterproductive to make inflammatory, belligerent remarks at this sensitive time." Edgar says he will urge Carter to break diplomatic relations with Iran once the hostages are returned. In December, Edgar begins his campaign for a fourth term by attending a fundraiser in Middletown, with guest speaker Representative Morris Udall of Arizona. At several other meetings held, the major topics are energy, inflation and the hostage crisis in Iran. "Regardless of how you feel about the Shah or Iran, all over the world we have embassies and American citizens who could be held hostage for one thing or another," states Edgar. "Many congressmen are determined to do something but are not sure how to respond." After several votes are taken, the House fails to resolve the issue of setting a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King. In its last piece of major legislation, during this long session, the Crysler loan guarantee program, backed by the administration, finally passes, 271 to 136. Edgar votes for this bill, which provides $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees to the ailing corporate giant, on the condition that there are $500 million in wage and salary concessions by both blue and white collar employees. Kennedy, in a television interview, criticizes the deposed Shah of Iran, and opponents charge that the Senator's remarks could possibly endanger the hostages held by the Iranian militants. Nine days later, a Gallup poll shows Carter now leading Kennedy among Democrats, 48% to 40%. Carter calls for increasing the military budget 4.5% a year for the next five years, in light of the Iranian crisis and increased Soviet military spending.</p>
<p><br />
1980 - Another Incumbent President is Challenged &amp; the Pendulum Swings Back to the Right</p>
<p>At a forum in Swarthmore in January, Edgar "reluctantly" states his support for President Carter's call for universal draft registration, in response to the international situation. He also supports increased funding for research into nuclear waste disposal. He talks tough about the Soviets, stating: "I deplore the obscene move of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan. It is a brazen act of audacity with complete disregard for the international community and a massive violation of human rights that must be dealt with." With the lure of federal spending for their constituents, House members reject another Edgar amendment to delete eight water projects that had incomplete feasibility reports from the Army Corps of Engineers. The amendment would have saved $161 million, but failed by well over two to one. Kennedy's hopes are dashed by his loss to Carter in the Iowa caucuses, by a whopping 59% to 31%. Bush beats Reagan, 33% to 27%, with Baker trailing at 14%, and the rest of the vote split among the others. Consumer prices for 1979 have risen 13.3%, the highest rise in 33 years, with the cost of energy leading the way. Edgar carries the Carter Administration banner to oppose unnecessary water project spending and introduces 184 amendments to cut spending. However, the House refuses to pass another Edgar amendment to delete a proposed memorial to the Army Corps of Engineers to be built in the District of Columbia. An amendment to force the president to terminate assistance to Nicaragua if free elections were not held by the end of 1981, fails 191 to 212, with Edgar in the opposition. With Republicans attempting to force the administration to take a tougher stance on international Communism, another amendment to forbid funds to be used for any Nicaraguan schools that house or are used by Cuban personnel passes by a vote of 235 to 166. Edgar votes against this amendment, also.</p>
<p>Reagan's candidacy receives a major boost at a debate with Bush in Nashua, during a dispute as to whether the other contenders should be invited. Reagan's campaign had financed the entire cost of the one-on-one debate with Bush, which was sponsored by the Nashua Telegraph. Unknown to Bush, the Reagan's campaign director invites the other candidates, anyway and Bush refuses to acknowledge their presence. When Reagan protests that they are being silenced unfairly, editor Joe Breen threatens to have Reagan's microphone turned off. An angered Reagan declares: "I paid for this microphone, Mr. Green (sic)." Three days later, buoyed by his debate performance, Reagan beats Bush by two to one and his momentum is regained. Carter beats Kennedy, 49% to 38% and takes 10 delegates to the latter's nine. Edgar and 99 other members of Congress and key government officials met with Carter to discuss the President's plan to balance the budget. Edgar warns that revenue sharing cuts would cost Pennsylvania over $110 million. "I have asked the president to consider weaning the states off revenue sharing rather than dropping it all at once," Edgar states. Edgar meets privately with Carter as the chairman of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition and speaks for the 218 members of the group. He is hopeful that Carter will reverse the decision to move the DECASA to Marietta, Georgia. He also warns that the deregulation of domestic oil would provide $157 billion in state oil surtax revenues to eight major oil producing states. Edgar introduces legislation to make van and car pooling a priority within the federal Department of Transportation. "Ride-sharing is a proven energy conservation measure." Haabestad carries Delaware County over Specter, 64,000 to 25,000, but loses the state narrowly, coming in second out of eight. Specter wins the prized nomination for U.S. Senator, 419,382 to 382,281. There are also eight Democratic candidates, with Flaherty far ahead of the rest, with 771,119 votes to his nearest competitor Joseph Rhodes, who receives 179,107. Flaherty also carries the county with 11,000 votes to Logue's 3,000. Rochford defeats his rivals easily, with 41,000 votes to the 24,000 combined tally for the other three. Edgar is renominated without opposition.</p>
<p>Edgar votes to allocate $13 million for the administration's call for resumption of Selective Service Registration in wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The vote is close, however, 218 to 188. Failing to make headway in the Republican primaries, Congressman John Anderson announces an independent bid for the presidency. A poll has shown the half of Americans believe Carter and Reagan to be unsatisfactory choices for the job. Carter admits that a "short" recession has begun as sales of automobiles and new homes plummet, while the unemployment rate increases to 6.2%. In opposition to the administration, Edgar votes to delete funding of the MX missile program, but the measure fails by almost four to one. He also votes against another measure to delete $500 million for the missile, but allow studies. The vote is 152-250. Edgar argues that the proposed Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway will have a true cost of $3 billion, rather than the estimated $323 million. An amendment to delete this project fails, 185 to 230. "This is the granddaddy of all pork barrel projects, requiring as much dirt to be moved as digging the Panama Canal," Edgar declares. Edgar also opposes the president's imposition of an oil import fee of $4.62 per barrel. The disapproval receives a ten to one majority in the House. An amendment to strengthen the Fair Housing Act by allowing the Justice Department to appoint Administrative Law Judges to handle bias cases, passes 205-204, with Edgar in favor. He votes against the final version of President Carter's Selective Service registration bill, which passes, 234 to 168. Also, the Synthetic Fuels/Defense Production Act passes, 317 to 93. Edgar votes in favor of this bill, which will spend $20 billion to encourage the production of synthetic fuels, $3 billion for solar research and $1.5 billion for alcohol-based fuels. Edgar is hopeful regarding the Blue Route's final approval by Transportation Secretary Neil Goldschmidt. The amended Environmental Impact Statement had been approved by the acting head of the Federal Highway Administration. "I think we ought to have an open convention," declares Edgar in response to revelations that Carter's brother, Billy, was paid $220,000 as an agent of the Libyan government. "I join with the number of members of the House who have called on both the president and Ted Kennedy and all delegates at the convention to make the process open." Rochford states that a final determination should await a probe by the Senate. Edgar also proposes five planks for the party platform: tax cuts to stimulate investment and jobs where needed the most, energy conservation, mass transit, defense dollars spent in high unemployment areas, and reauthorizing Community Development Block Grants and general revenue sharing.</p>
<p>At the G.O.P. convention in Detroit, Reagan is nominated on the first ballot with 1,939 votes, 809 more than needed to win. After former President Ford declined the position, Bush is named the vice presidential nominee. Accepting the nomination, Reagan calls for a "new consensus of common values...family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom." County party chairman Jon Auritt echoes Edgar's comments by also calling for an open Democratic convention. Auritt hopes Carter and Kennedy will both withdraw and a third candidate will be nominated. Edgar is not invited to join the eighty Democratic congressmen who meet with Carter to pledge their support at the convention. Edgar supports Carter, though, but still calls for an open convention. Edgar votes against an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to require some school districts to provide instruction in native languages. The measure passes, 213 to 194. Kennedy's proposed rules change to open up the Democratic Convention and weaken Carter's lead in delegates, failed, 1,936.4 to 1,390.6 votes. Kennedy then withdraws from the race, leaving behind bitterness between the two camps. Carter then went on to win the nomination, retaining Mondale as his vice president. Former Upper Darby G.O.P. boss Sam Dickey dies at the age of 82, having held the reigns of power in that township from 1950 to about 1978. "I am neither a saint nor a sinner...I am proud that I have never been a hypocrite. I was a 100 percent rackets man when I was in the rackets," he had been quoted in the Inquirer. During the first candidates' debate, Rochford states: "I am not just asking for you to look at the man, but also to look at the party." He charges that Democrats have monopolized the legislative branch and mismanaged the government. Edgar retorts: "I am proud that Republicans in Delaware County voted for the man and not the party." A week later, at their second debate, Edgar and Rochford agree on the Equal Rights Amendment, alternative energy sources, completing the Blue Route, tax incentives for growth and balancing the budget. However, they sharply disagree on how to balance the budget, abortion rights and the need for congressional coalitions, such as the Northeast-Midwest coalition, that Edgar chairs. Rochford declares: "I am tired of this country being torn apart by petty regionalism." New York City Mayor Ed Koch speaks at the Bob Edgar Dinner at the Log Cabin Inn: "I am here because I really like Bob Edgar. He's bright, honest, forthright and (after a brief pause) he's not in jail." Koch, who served three years with Edgar in Congress, refers to the indictment of other congressmen on corruption charges. Future congresswoman Marjorie Margolies serves as the Mistress of Ceremonies. Edgar states at another meeting, he has worked for improvements at the Veterans Administration hospital in Philadelphia and that management has shown improvement since. Edgar refers to the Tug Fork flood control project as a "dangerous practice of legislating on an appropriations bill...to a new extreme." The House votes, 230 to 164, to keep the project. Edgar votes against a resolution to nullify a previous one directing the White House to turn over records regarding Billy Carter's dealing with the government of Libya, with the vote being 124-260. Edgar receives a score of 86% from the League of Conservation Voters, which cites his "outstanding record on conservation." He is endorsed by the AFL-CIO of Pennsylvania, as well as the Daily Times, which cites his work as chairman of the NE-MW coalition in keeping defense jobs in the region, persuading the Navy to overhaul aircraft carriers in Philadelphia, rather than Virginia, and working to create the Riverbridge industrial park in Chester. He is also endorsed by fellow Democrat Ed Rendell, District Attorney of Philadelphia, and Edward Kassab, a member of a prominent county Republican law firm. Rendell praises Edgar, stating: "He stands out as a beacon of integrity. Bob Edgar stands for integrity, honesty and courage." Rendell does say that Rochford is of a higher caliber than past G.O.P. candidates in Delaware County. The third debate is heated, with Edgar telling Rochford to "focus on facts, not fiction." Edgar plays a Rochford radio advertisement that claims "30,000 manufacturing jobs have left Delaware County" since 1975. Edgar states that since there were 39,000 manufacturing jobs when he took office, for 30,000 jobs to be lost, virtually every plant in the county would have to shut down. Rochford attacks Edgar on his voting in support of Carter policies 75% of the time, while only supporting Ford 24%. Edgar opposes balancing the budget at the expense of senior citizens and public mass transit. At the last debate, Edgar states his opposition to Selective Service registration and the draft. Rochford and Edgar differ on repeal of 14(b), creation of the Department of Education and a constitutional amendment banning abortion. The House expels one of its members, the first since 1861, Philadelphia Democrat Michael J. "Ozzie" Myers. He had been convicted of bribery and conspiracy charges that arose from the Abscam investigation.</p>
<p>With the Gross National Product rising 1% for the third quarter, the recession is over. In spite of a G.O.P. sweep locally, Edgar easily downs Rochford, 99,381 to 87,643, giving the Democrat a fourth term. This is the first election where Edgar has outspent his Republican rival, in this case, $295,529 to $253,406. He does well in the the Chester, the blue collar and Chester Pike areas and cuts the G.O.P. margin sharply in Newtown, Springfield and Upper Darby, as well as carrying his home town of Marple, by over 1,000 votes. In the Fifth District, Schulze wins a three to one victory over Democrat Grady G. Brickhouse, 148,898 to 47,092. Back in Washington, Edgar votes against the bill to fund the Energy Department's nuclear warhead program, but the bill passes 333 to 39, anyway. He believes "Reagan will not be as bad as some people think he might (be)." With inflation and the hostage crisis the major issues in voters' minds, Reagan defeats Carter and Anderson, 43.9 million votes to 35.5 million and 5.7 million respectively. Voters also extend their feelings for change to the U.S. Senate, voting in an additional twelve G.O.P. senators and giving that party a 53 to 46 majority, the first time since 1955. In the House, the minority party picks up another 32 seats, leaving the Democrats with a reduced majority of 243 to 192. The Watergate election gains of 1974 are more than rolled back by the public, giving Reagan a chance to enact much of his legislative agenda. Reagan also carries Pennsylvania 2.261 million to Carter's 1.937 and Anderson's 292,000 votes. Specter finally is elected to state office, beating Flaherty 2,320,404 to 2,122,391. The former Philadelphia district attorney carried his home city, 337,516 to 325,593 and did well in the suburbs, sweeping Delaware County 154,255 to 90,400. The county also gave its customary nod to the top of the ticket, with Reagan leading Carter 143,282 to 88,314 and Anderson trailing with 20,907. In the only close legislative races, in the 159th legislative district, Early beat back a challenge from Democrat Leroy Frattarola, 7,365 to 6,751. In the neighboring 160th, Durham defeated Garzia, in a rematch, 12,981 to 10,781. Ted Doyle tries to reclaim his old seat from Micozzie, but the Democrat is turned back, 13,646 to 11,140. For 1980, Edgar was present for 90% of the votes cast and supported the administration 65% to 17% and his party, 77% to 14%. Many of his votes in opposition to the administration involve the MX missile and other weapons systems. Edgar votes for an amendment allowing states to veto the selection of nuclear waste dumps within their borders, unless Congress overrode the objections. The bill fails, 161 to 218.</p>
<pre>
1981 -  the Old Guard of the G.O.P. is Back and the Reagan Era Begins
</pre>
<p>Edgar is sworn in for his fourth term, along with a decreased Democratic House majority. He and fellow congressmen Gerry Studds of Massachusetts and Barbara Milkulski of Maryland are on a fact-finding visit to Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica. Upon his return, Edgar immediately telegraphs President Carter, with the urgent message: "Halt immediately military aid to El Salvador." Although he did not enter that country, Edgar has heard stories of "murder, rape and torture" committed by forces loyal to the military junta in control of El Salvador. He says that U.S. support of the military government is pushing the people towards Communism. Further, he believes many revolutionaries in El Salvador are not Marxist guerrillas, but "Catholic priests, nuns and church activists". Costa Rica, by contrast, is an "island of peace" and the overthrown head of Nicaragua, Somoza, was a "brutal, torturous dictator". Honduras, Edgar finds, is led by a "three member junta" with its leader a "military general and alcoholic". This year will prove to be especially trying for Edgar, who now will serve as a liberal in a House where many key votes will be dominated by a coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans. With the Senate in control of the G.O.P., Howard Baker of Tennessee is elected Majority Leader and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia moves to the Minority Leader's job. Democrats elect Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill to his third term as House Speaker. This is the first time since 1932 that different parties are in control of the two houses of Congress. Ronald Reagan takes the oath of office for the presidency, and gives an upbeat address, calling for "an era of national renewal." The new president declares: "we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams" and that the nation is not "doomed to an inevitable decline." Jimmy Carter's Farewell Address to the nation warns of the dangers of nuclear war and he states the importance of human rights throughout the world, "human rights invented America."</p>
<p>Locally, as the “New Look” Republican faction continues to unravel, Haabestad lashes out at Whittlesey for opposing salary raises for members of County Council. He attacks her as being "a little bit hypocritical" for opposing the pay raises, while having "substantially augmented" her own income last year by taking a part-time job with a Philadelphia law firm. He also charges Whittlesey with failing to attend important meetings and trying to engineer the G.O.P. endorsement for Catania. Haabestad also accuses Whittlesey of publicly taking credit for holding down the county's tax rate, but was not attending the council work sessions where the required budget cuts are decided. "I don't care if I get any credit at all," he says, "but I'll be damned if I'll sit there and see her get the credit" for keeping taxes down. Edgar blasts the proposed Reagan budget cutbacks of 100% for the Economic Development Administration. He also opposes Reagan's request for an increase of $20 million in aid to El Salvador, stating: "I think it is outrageous that the new administration has separated the investigation into the death of the nuns from the increased military aid to the government of el Salvador for the specific reason that the troops we are giving lethal weapons to are the same troops implicated in the deaths of the nuns and religious worker." Whittlesey tells the Suburban and Wayne Times of her frustrations with Delaware County politics. Having failed at state office and tiring of fending off the Old Guard, Whittlesey sums her feelings up: "Let someone else lead the reform movement."</p>
<p>"The controller is an independent sort of person," County Controller Tom Lynch states. "He's a checker (on county finances), and I don't think he should be looking to the party leaders all the time." At the G.O.P. nominating meeting, Springfield Auditor James Scanlan is nominated to oppose Lynch by party leaders unhappy with the latter's increasingly maverick stance. There is some suspense generated at the party enclave as Haabestad withdraws his name from consideration, after having received no commitment from Republican leaders that he would not be relegated to the role of an observer on County Council. Standing on the Courthouse steps with Bob Edgar, County Controller Tom Lynch makes the following announcement: "I accept the endorsement of the Democratic Party because it is clear that the Republican Party has again become the captive of the War Board." At the endorsement meeting of G.O.P. municipal leaders the previous night, Lynch was rejected for a second term by a vote of 230-23 in favor of Springfield Auditor James Scanlan. Edgar refers to Lynch, who also changes his party registration, as the kind of "good-government" candidate that deserve support from fellow Democrats. Calling himself "the uncontrollable controller", Lynch says power in the county Republican Party again was being exercised by a "small group" of local leaders and that "the tactics of fear, intimidation and threats which they employ are intolerable." The endorsement vote for two seats on the County Council goes overwhelmingly for Catania, 55, and party stalwart Thomas Hayward, an accountant and commissioner in Radnor Township. They soundly defeat four other candidates, including state Rep. John Alden of Radnor. The Bulletin, in an editorial, states that the dumping of Tom Lynch and endorsement of Catania are a sign that the "Son of War Board" has returned to county politics. "The good-government theme that we have tried to bring to government will be carried out," declares party chair Thomas Judge, denying the charges. Commenting on Reagan's nationwide speech on the economy, coming about a month after the attempted assassination of the president, Edgar states: "I will not support the president's plan because of unfairness to our region." He will, however, support the House Budget Committee's plan, which shows a deficit of $40 billion, as opposed to Reagan's proposed $54 to 64 billions. Edgar and Auritt and blamed by some organization Democrats in Chester for the victory in the primary election of independent Democrats Anne V. Stanley and William "Rocky" Brown for city council. On a more positive note, Edgar receives an honorary doctorate from his old alma mater, Lycoming College.</p>
<p>In the first major showdown over Reagan's economic blueprint, the G.O.P. plan to cut outlays by $26 billion and cut taxes by $31 billion, leaving a deficit of $31 billion passes, 270 to 154. Edgar votes against it, but 84 Democrats have deserted their leadership and supported the Reagan plan. Only one Republican votes against it. An alternative Democatic plan, supported by Edgar, had been rejected. Several weeks later, the conference version of the Reagan budget is passed by the House, 244 to 155. Again, Edgar opposes it, but 77 Democrats have teamed up with 167 Republicans to pass the plan. Expenditures for fiscal 1982 are set at $695 billion, revenue at $658 billion, leaving a deficit of almost $38 billion. The debate on renewing the Legal Services Corporation, which the Reagan administration has sought to abolish, brought some social "hot button" issues to the forefront. An amendment sponsored by ultra-conservative Larry McDonald, Democrat of Georgia, to prohibit Legal Service Corporation funds to "promote, defend or protect" gays, passes, 281 to 124. Edgar voted against the amendment. Another amendment to prohibit LSC lawyers from giving legal advice on abortion laws fails, 160 to 242, with Edgar voting in the negative. Among representatives who voted for the McDonald amendment, but against the anti-abortion measure are: Coughlin, Coyne of Bucks County, Democrat James Florio of New Jersey, Allen Ertel, upcoming Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania governor, Gephardt, and rising Republican star, Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Against the wishes of the administration, the LSC is reauthorized, with a budget of $241 million. John "Terry" Dolan, co-founder and chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Caucus, holds a press conference in front of Edgar's district office. According to Dolan, "Edgar is the most liberal of the Pennsylvania delegation and yet in the last election, his district voted for President Reagan." Edgar is also targeted by the Fund for a Conservative Majority, headed by Robert Hechman. The Broomall Congressman's reply is: "I am not going to be blackmailed by any one special interest group." Another showdown occurs between the Democratic House and the Republican administration over Reagan's proposed tax cuts. A Democratic alternative plan for a one year reduction in individual taxes, geared toward those making less than $50,000 a year, along with narrower business tax cuts, fails, 144 to 288. The administration plan calling for an across-the-board 25% cut in individual tax rates over three years, indexing tax rates to inflation starting in 1985, and generous business and investment tax incentives, passes, 238 to 195. Again, 48 Democrats, mostly southern conservatives, desert their party and vote with 190 Republicans. Only one of the latter votes against the party plan. Edgar votes for the Democratic plan and against the Reagan proposal. Edgar votes against the final conference report tax cut bill that is passed by the House, 323 to 107. It will provide a 25% individual tax cut over 33 months. Conservative state representative Stephen Freind of Havertown, attacks Edgar's vote against prohibiting the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing auto emission standards.</p>
<p>Catania and Springfield Republican chairman Charles Sexton are a subject of an F.B.I. probe regarding allegations that they enlisted and paid Democrat Richard T. Burke to run against Lynch in the primary. Sexton allegedly had promised Burke a "no-show state job" could be arranged through state Auditor General Al Benedict, a Democrat. Edgar votes against an amendment to prohibit Justice Department funds from being used to block voluntary public school prayer and meditation. The bill passes by a resounding six to one margin, signaling a further shift to the conservative end of the spectrum for the House. He also votes against amending the National Security Act of 1947 to make it a crime to knowingly expose the identities of U.S. intelligence agents. But, the administration bill passes overwhelmingly. In September, Whittlesey resigns from County Council and is sworn in as Ambassador to Switzerland, after winning Senate confirmation. G.O.P. county controller candidate Scanlan is indicted by a federal grand jury for perjury regarding his alleged involvement in the brewing election fraud case. Edgar announces a $200,000 to $300,000 grant from the EPA superfund for the cleanup of the toxic Wade dump in Chester. Edgar votes to disapprove the administration's proposed sale of AWACs and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia. In spite of administration pleas, the disapproval passes 301 to 111. A bid to increase the outside earned income limit for House members fails, 147 to 271, with Edgar voting against it. As the recession takes hold, the nation's unemployment rate reaches 8.4%, the highest since the last severe recession of 1974-75. "Curt Weldon is most definitely my candidate and will remain my candidate," Keeler states regarding the filling of Whittlesey's seat. Weldon, Keeler believes, "has great personal courage, he's a doer and he's superbly qualified to sit on council. I challenge anyone to question Curt's credentials." The potential for a deadlock on the appointment occurs when Rochford declares his own candidacy for the opening and is supported by Haabestad, while the fourth Council member, Frank Lynch, is behind Weldon, the Mayor of Marcus Hook. No deadlock occurs when Weldon, considered a member of the “New Look” faction, receives the appointment unanimously. Even Edgar calls Weldon's selection "an excellent choice."</p>
<p>Stepping up his campaign, renegade County Controller Tom Lynch states: "I'm nobody's boy! I haven't been anybody's boy for the last three years and I won't be anybody's boy for the next four years. I'm not controlled by the Republican Party and I'm not controlled by (county) council." Lynch further lists his accomplishments as having "implemented a fully automated accounting system at the courthouse; blew the whistle on bad management decisions that cost hundreds of thousands of tax dollars; and directed the investment of all idle cash." In statements reminiscent of the Williams-War Board feud, he sums up his candidacy by saying he was dumped because he was "too outspoken...The party and council told me to keep my mouth shut." Scanlan, handicapped by his indictment, criticizes Lynch's managerial style. "...the controller should not be an adversary. I think Mr. Lynch has proven that he cannot work with council." Steve Joachim, 29, announces he will run for the Republican nomination for Congress. He is known locally as the athlete who was the star quarterback at Haverford High, who played two years at Penn State before starring at Temple, and who later was with the New York Jets after being released by the Eagles. After leaving professional football in 1977, Joachim began a consulting business in pension and profit-sharing. Having been groomed for local office by Springfield Party Chairman Charles Sexton, he was elected a Republican committeeman in 1978 and a township commissioner in 1979. Edgar again votes to delete funding for the B-1 bomber, but the amendments fail. He then votes against final passage of the $200 billion defense budget, as well as the conference report. The Old Guard of the G.O.P. takes control of the party by soundly defeating the Democrats in the general election. Catania and Hayward carry about 76,000 votes to the Democrats' 50,000. In the hotly contested Controller's race, the incumbent Lynch is trounced, 73,000 to 53,000. While the G.O.P. margin is less than the customary two to one, the results prove once again that there was no serious threat to the political status quo. Edgar decries the decision of the federal Justice Department to abandon a grand jury investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud stemming from the county controller's primary election. The indictment against Scanlan is dismissed. In his letter to Attorney General William French Smith, Edgar states "the public needs to know why the decision was made and who made it." The congressman believes that the decision to turn the investigation over to local authorities could allow a "political fix" to occur. Associate Attorney General Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, later to become mayor of New York City, calls Vairo back to Washington to discuss the election fraud case. Edgar, sounds a hopeful note: "It is rare for him to call a U.S. Attorney back to Washington to reopen a case." Network, a Catholic social justice lobby presents an award to Edgar for his voting record in favor of social justice and human rights. Following the elevation of Keeler to a county judgeship, Upper Darby Township manager Edwin B. Erickson is appointed to the vacancy in a unanimous vote. Erickson who also served as township director of public health, holds a doctorate in biochemistry and microbiology.</p>
<p>The Wrangle Over Redistricting</p>
<p>Another chapter in the partisan squabbling over congressional redistricting unfolds in the legislature, once again centering on how the five county Philadelphia area should be divied up. With the Senate in Democratic hands, 28 to 22 and the House Republican, 101 to 99, compromise would be needed for any plan to be approved. According to the 1980 census, Pennsylvania gained only .5% in population, a pathetic 64,000 residents. California, Florida and Texas together gained about 9.7 million new residents. Their share of House seats rose from 82 to 91, while New York lost a whopping five seats and Pennsylvania two seats. Philadelphia lost a stunning 261,000 residents, while the suburbs had a net gain of 54,000. Delaware County lost 56,000 residents, with over 10,000 of the total coming from Chester. With the ideal House seat in the state having 515,857 residents, Philadelphia would need a population of 2.063 million to keep its current four seats, which would mean adding large areas of the suburbs to seats held by Philadelphians. It was generally agreed that the city would be entitled to three seats, leaving an excess of 140,000 mostly Democratic residents who would need to be shifted into the suburbs. In September, 1981, the Republican National Committee and the twelve G.O.P. members of the state U.S. House delegation draw up plans to add several city wards to the 7th District. Loeper registers his objections: "I wouldn't tolerate adding parts of Philadelphia to the 7th District." A plan drafted by Stephen McNett, counsel to the minority Senate Republicans, would move about 46,000 residents of Philadelphia's 40th Ward into the Seventh District and move the remainder of the city residents into Larry Coughlin's Thirteenth District. Senator Bell objects to the plan, due to the fact he had no input and that seven municipalities along the riverfront would be moved into the Fifth District. Another Republican proposal would add the Philadelphia wards to the over-whelmingly Republican Fifth District, thus improving the chances of a G.O.P. victory in Edgar's district by diluting Democratic voting strength. A third Senate plan would shift 46,000 residents of the 34th and 52nd wards, with a five to one Democratic registration edge, in West Philadelphia into the 7th District. Haverford and Radnor would also be moved to the 7th, but the riverfront towns, except for Chester, would be shifted to the 5th District. Edgar registers mild objections to the plan, which would favor his reelection: "It is in the best interests of Delaware County to have a congressman who thinks exclusively about the county." In October, the Senate revises its plan again, which will be closer to the final result. The 7th loses Chester, Marcus Hook, Trainor, Chester Heights and Lower Chichester and gains Haverford, Radnor and the 40th Ward. Aston, which would have moved to the 5th is retained. Edgar opposes the latest plan, stating: "It is in Chester's best interest" to remain in the Seventh District. He believes that Schulze does not even want Chester in his 5th District. Schulze makes no comment about the plan. In January, the state House, by a vote of 104 to 88, approves a plan that moves Chester to the 5th and the 40th Ward to the 7th. The issue quickly moves towards a conclusion when the Senate votes 28 to 22, on a final bill on March 1, with House following suit the next day, 118 to 73. The measure would reduce the state's congressional seats by consolidating four Democratic districts into two. Philadelphia's 1st and 3rd Districts and the 12th and 21st in western Pennsylvania would be consolidated. The president of the Chester N.A.A.C.P., Commodore Harris says that blacks were "disheartened" by the move of Chester to the 5th District. Democrats charge that Chester was gerrymandered, moving some 20,000 urban black residents into a primarily rural district. A federal lawsuit is promised. Governor Thornburgh quickly signs the redistricting plan, just in time for the candidate's filing deadline. A panel of three federal judges refuses to delay the May 18th primary election due to questions about the legality of the redistricting. In September, the three judge panel rules against a suit filed by the Chester NAACP, which had charged that the 7th District restructuring had "diluted" black voting strength. Edgar predicts he will carry Haverford, but Radnor "will be a little more difficult." Even though Chester was removed from the district, the addition of the heavily Democratic 40th Ward is no cause for alarm for Edgar.</p>
<pre>
      1982 - Reagan's Recession and Edgar's  Biggest  Win   
</pre>
<p>The year began with Edgar criticizing Giuliani for halting the election fraud probe, stating: "What you've said to the people of Delaware County is nobody's watching the store. I think it's a miscarriage of justice". Giuliani had told Edgar that federal prosecution of a local election fraud case would set a precedent, tying up federal prosecutors in "nickel-and-dime election fraud allegations raised in every local primary". Edgar quietly meets with newly appointed District Attorney John Reilly to question why the election fraud case has not moved forward on the county level now that the federal investigation has been dropped. Edgar will not accept an increase voted by Congress in the tax deduction for expenses incurred by members. The deduction has been increased from $3,000 to $21,000. Edgar tells teachers and administrators from the Southeast Delco School District that "government is not the enemy" and Americans have "a very human, people-oriented kind of government." House Democrats attack President Reagan for certifying improvement in the human-rights record in El Salvador, as required by law in order to allow military assistance to continue. They argue that Reagan's account of declining political killings conflicts with reports of independent human-rights organizations, which found continuing high levels of political slayings and other abuses in that country. Edgar and about 30 other members introduce a bill to cut off $26 million in aid and nullify the presidential certification. Gerry Studds declares the purpose of the bill was "to make it as costly as possible in political terms for the administration to proceed on this course." 104 House members, including Edgar, and almost all Democrats, want the Administration to support proposed negotiations between the military junta of El Salvador and the rebels, as well as hold talks to ease tensions between the United States and Nicaragua. In a letter, they urge Reagan to support the suggestions of Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo, who has proposed the negotiations and also asks that Cuba be brought into the process.</p>
<p>In center city, Philadelphia, some 200 people conduct a peaceful march, demanding a halt to the nuclear arms race. Speaker after speaker denounce the Reagan Administation's view that a nuclear war can be winnable. Edgar urges the participants to rise and hold hands with one another, and most all do. "We want to tell Congress to freeze and reduce the weapons of war," he declares. He asks that funds spent for additional nuclear weapons be spent instead on social programs. The Consumer Federation of America names Edgar and 33 other House and Senate members "heroes" for their efforts on behalf of the consumer. In the primary, Edgar easily beats anti-abortion opponent, Robert E. Moran, 16,425 to 3,601 for the Democratic nomination. "The voters disappointed me by not turning out in greater numbers, even if only to oppose me," remarks Moran. "because I thought this was a referendum on abortion." Joachim is unopposed. Continuing his votes against the intelligence establishment, Edgar is only one of 23 who votes against the classified budget for the Central Intelligence Agency. 357 representatives vote to approve the budget. In yet another Democratic alternative budget, Rep. Miller of California, offers an amendment that any increases to spending be offset by cuts or revenue increases. This plan loses, 181-225, with Edgar voting in favor. Edgar votes against a complete freeze on nuclear weapons testing, production or deployment. The amendment loses overwhelmingly. Cyril Wecht, an Allegheny County Commissioner, beats John Logue for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator, 426,000 to 166,000 statewide. However, countywide, Logue is favored, 10,453 to 2,719 for Wecht.</p>
<p>Chaplain Fred Salsgiver, a Baptist minister and WWII veteran with right wing views, is unhappy with some criticism from Edgar. Both Edgar and Salsgiver had given speeches on the steps of the Courthouse during Memorial Day services. "After the prayer, I turned to him and said I was disappointed in it," Edgar states. "I told him I felt it was highly politicized and inappropriate for Memorial Day. It was a long list of very ultra-right wing causes that I thought were out of place." The part of Salsgiver's speech that Edgar objected to was: "If we as veterans are going to keep true faith with our honored dead, it will mean putting on the whole armor of God as we engage in this spiritual warfare and as we strive to return prayer and bible reading back in school, oppose the communist-dominated United Nations, the murder of America's babies by abortion, those who advocate a nuclear freeze, the Declaration of Interdependence, promotion of a world government and peaceful co-existence, all of which weakens our freedoms." Edgar also notes that he had observed a "Steve Joachim for Congress" bumper sticker on Salsgiver's car. After several attempts, the House passes a budget resolution by a narrow margin, 219 to 206. Edgar votes against the plan, which calls for spending $765 billion, revenues of $666 billion and a whopping deficit of over $99 billion. Bianca Jagger visits Edgar to discuss her concerns regarding the situation in El Salvador. The wife of Mick Jagger is a native of Nicaragua. Edgar votes for an amendment to delete $50.9 billion from the defense budget by killing the MX, Pershing II, B-1 bomber, two nuclear powered aircraft carriers and cruise missiles. This amendment fails, 55 to 348. Three amendments to cut each of these items out individually also fail, as well as an attempt to cut $10.5 billion from nuclear weapons production. The only measure that passes is one to delete all funds for binary chemical weapons and bar the use of existing funds for their production. Edgar votes for all amendments, except the cut in nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Edgar votes against a measure to spend $7.5 million to construct a radio station to broadcast to Cuba, Radio Marti, which passes, 250-134. He does support an unsuccessful effort to use existing facilities for the same purpose. He also votes for an amendment banning funding for constructing or improving airfields in Honduras, which was resisting aggression from Nicaragua. The measure fails, however, by almost a three to one margin. In an infrequent vote of support for the administration, he votes in favor of a bill backed by the Republican-led Senate and Administration, raising revenues by $98 billion over three years and reducing expenditures $97.5 billion. With low-key Democratic support, it passes, 226 to 207. The bill, which had been sponsored by Kansas Senator Bob Dole, increases excise taxes, reduces deductions for medical expenses and casualty losses, and mandates the withholding of 10% of dividends and interest. In effect, it rescinds about one fourth of the previous year's tax cut. "I can't think of an issue where my staff was so divided," states Edgar. "My wife was on the other side of the issue. There are an awful lot of stories around here about the trauma a lot of us have gone through trying to decide what is right." The Pennsylvania delegation split 14-11 in favor, of the tax measure, which was also endorsed by the State Republican Committee. The House Republicans from Pennsylvania split 8-5 in favor, with the Democrats, 6-6. Bill Gray declares that the measure merely reduces a $450 billion deficit to $350 billion over the next three years. "There's no way this administration is going to stand by and watch a $350 billion deficit," he says. "I think he's going to come back and continue the ravaging of social programs." Edgar blames excessive increases in defense spending for the need for a tax increase. "He (Reagan) gave the store away last year. He increased defense spending $1.5 trillion over five years. If we only spent $1.4 trillion on defense over five years, there would be no need for this tax bill at all." Joachim, Edgar's Republican opponent, opposes the tax bill.</p>
<p>During their first debate, Joachim accuses Edgar of "pursuing his own social Utopia", while showing concern for "the whale, the snail darter and the oppressed guerrillas in El Salvador." He further states Edgar's votes are "anti-American and Communist using our tax money to pursue his own twisted foreign policy." Joachim receives boos from the audience after he responds to Edgar's blaming of the Reagan administration for high unemployment. "I'd just like to remind everyone that he's not running against Ronald Reagan tonight," Joachim states. Edgar reiterates his strong support for the Equal Rights Amendment, while Joachim states: "It's already in the Constitution." The next day, Joachim clarifies one of his statements: "I'm not saying he's anti-American and Communist, but he's definitely left wing." In October, Joachim hammers hard at Edgar, stating: "...his having foreign policy discussions with Bianca Jagger insults my intelligence." Edgar responds that Jagger "is respected in and out of her own accord and has a long history of being involved with human rights issues." At the second debate at the Delaware County Community College in Marple Township, attended by 2,000, Joachim charges: "No matter who is in control of the White House, we continue to lose jobs and Bob Edgar continues to do nothing about it." He comes out against gun control, stating: "Gun control does not reduce violent crime." Edgar states: "Some responsible regulation can and may prevent many needless deaths." Edgar wins reelection by his largest margin ever, 105,775 to 85,023, defeating Joachim in Springfield 6,370 to 5,702, including the latter's own precinct. Edgar has now pulled far away from his challengers in campaign spending, having spent a whopping $495,013 to Joachim's $261,041, still a record for the G.O.P. This time, Edgar has received a huge $292,313 from PACs, including $157,390 from labor special interests alone. "I think Steve made a tactical error in building all the negatives with no positive in the beginning," Edgar declares. Joachim agrees: "I could have spent a little more time about what Steve Joachim thinks and building up a credibility, as opposed to spending so much time pointing out Edgar's weaknesses. I still believe I will be the next congressman. I feel very strongly about running again. I made the commitment to the office, not to the campaign." Edgar says he will run for one more term in the House: "It's too early to say whether I would try for governor or senator or something else."</p>
<p>With the recession as a major issue in Pennsylvania, the unknown Ertel makes a strong showing against Thornburgh, only losing by less than 100,000 votes statewide. The governor receives 1,872,784 votes to Ertel's 1,772,353. In Delaware County, the Thornburgh-Scranton ticket coasts to a two to one win, 127,000 to 67,000. In fact, Thornburgh carries the Philadelphia region by about 49,000 votes and Allegheny County by 6,000. But, due to the recession's effects on the state, the normally Republican outlying counties in the central "Bible Belt" give Ertel surprising support, along with the Democratic counties in the western and Scranton areas. For Senator Heinz, it was quite a different story, with a 724,000 vote route of his Democratic opponent. State Senator Loeper is reelected by 52,000 votes to 32,000 for Charles F. Sanders and no state legislative race was even close. Delaware County voters, with the exception of Edgar's victory, show their full confidence in the Republican ticket top to bottom. In the only relatively close legislative race, Durham defeats Brookhaven Councilwoman Janice Sawiki. In Bucks County's 8th District, Kostmayer makes a comeback by defeating Coyne 83,242 to 80,928. Nationally, with Reagan's popularity barely above 40%, due to the severe recession, the Democrats pick up 27 House seats. However, they are unable to pick up any seats in the Senate, leaving the G.O.P. with a 54 to 46 majority.</p>
<p>A few days after the election, the Reagan Administration releases the October jobless rate, which shows an increase to 10.8%, the highest since the Nation was pulling out of the Depression. Twelve million are out of work, 1.6 million have given up looking for jobs and 6.5 million are underemployed. A record 4.84 million are receiving unemployment benefits. Edgar also supports an administration-backed bill, the Transportation Act of 1982, which increases the gasoline and other highway taxes to provide more funding for projects. The vote is 236 to 169. A bill requiring U.S. automakers to use a specified percentage of American parts and labor in the making of vehicles sold here passes 215 to 188. Edgar votes in favor, but the Administration is opposed. The conference version of the defense budget passes 346 to 68, with the Administration's $250 billion request having been reduced to $230 billion. Edgar, however, votes against it. An amendment to freeze congressional pay at its current level of $60,662 fails on a tie vote, 208 to 208, with Edgar voting in opposition. A bill to raise the pay 15%, to $69,800, passes 303-169, with Edgar in favor. Supporters had argued that Congress had gone three years without a raise. For 1982, Edgar supported the Reagan agenda 30% of time and opposed it 62%. He attendance is 92% and he supported his party 84% of the time on the issues, while opposing it only 10%. Edgar reflects on the biggest win of his career and its impact on local politics: "What happens is that people split their tickets. People who are ideological Republicans can deviate on one instance, maybe two instances, but on the whole pull the party lever and only deviate when it comes to my office." "In order to really make a substantial impact on Delaware County, we have to either retrain people not to pull the party lever or we'll have to win from the ground up, and I think that's where the effort has to be put." "There are clearly a lot of people who are for Bob Edgar because they're environmentalists, because they're active in women's groups, or active in veterans' groups or active in senior citizens' groups, and they don't see themselves as either Republicans or Democrats," he opines. He attributes his wins to coalitions that support him on particular federal issues, which cannot be applied in the state legislative and county political arenas. In spite of this, Edgar believes that the all-Republican five-member county council may have Democratic members in the future. "But I think not until the day after half the townships and boroughs have a majority Democratic organization, and not until we get a cadre of five, six or seven really qualified Democrats who step forward to win some key races."</p>
<p>1983 - A Fifth Term and More Budget Battles</p>
<p>Edgar is sworn in for his fifth term, joining 268 other Democrats, with the Republicans having only 166 representatives. He gives up the chairmanship of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, after serving four years in that position. He is selected the chairman of the Clearinghouse for the Future, a group of 70 members of Congress. Reagan's firing of Rita M. Lavelle, former head of the $1.6 billion Superfund program to clean up toxic wastes prompts a flurry of congressional investigations, including hearings by the Public Works and Transportation, of which Edgar is a member. Reagan's action occurs after Lavelle refuses to resign at the request of EPA Administrator Anne Burford, who stated she lost confidence in Lavelle's ability to enforce the Superfund program. Members of Congress looking into allegations of mismanagement at the agency are characterized by Edgar as being "like piranha in the Amazon, smelling blood." EPA officials admit before the House Public Works and Transportation Committee that it was <i>stupid" to put paper shredders in the same offices where subpoenaed documents were being kept. As a result, the FBI starts a criminal investigation into the use of the shredders following the Reagan administration's refusal to allow Congress to see numerous subpoenaed documents. Edgar questions whether President Reagan, who had cited executive privilege in ordering Burford not to turn over some documents to the House committee, saw those documents. He states that issue is important because the Watergate scandal established a precedent that executive privilege may apply only to documents with which a president is personally familiar. The Committee on Public Works and Transportation had recommended a contempt charge against Burford and charges abound regarding possible "sweetheart deals" between the Administration and toxic polluters.</i></p>
<p>In March, the Edgar amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriation, which will mandate 75% of the bill's discretionary funding be spent in areas of high unemployment, passes 335 to 83. A compromise between the House and Senate versions of the provision is worked out between Edgar and Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Ore), which allows each sponser's formula to be used. Edgar's proviso, which was approved in the compromise, would target $1.67 billion in funds for the EDA, federal building repair, mass transit, rural water and sewer, national and urban parks, SBA and the Army Corps of Engineers "the the extent practicable". Hatfield's formula would involve other funds in the $4.6 billion appropriations bill. Edgar unveils an "environmental works bill" aimed at putting nearly 300,000 jobless people to work rehabilitating parks, weatherproofing homes and repairing railroad tracks. Edgar introduced the measure as a partial alternative to the compromise $4.6 billion jobs bill, pushed by House Democrats. He estimates the cost of his program at $4 billion to $5 billion. Criticizing the public-works program in the House package as "a slow way to create a few expensive jobs of dubious benefit," Edgar offers his bill as a way to create more jobs for fewer federal dollars while filling environmental and transportation needs. Even though three national environmental groups, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and the Environmental Policy Center, support his bill, it does not pass.</p>
<p>A proposal supported by Reagan to gradually raise the Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67 after the year 2000 in order to help keep the fund solvent, is passed 230-200, with Edgar in favor. The First Budget Resolution calling for revenues of $689.1 billion, expenditures of $863.5 billion and a deficit of $174.4 billion passes with Edgar voting in favor. The blueprint, presented by House Democrats, is a rebuke to Reagan and slows the rapid arms buildup, restores many social spending cuts, and possibly will cancel $30 billion in tax cuts. Thirty-six Democrats and four Republicans, all from the Northeast, defect from their respective parties in the basically party-line vote. In a continuing display of the erosion of loyalty to the national party, 21 of 38 conservative Southern Democrats vote with the President, while 16 stay with their party. Edgar asks the House to provide full public disclosure of the hearings of the Select Committee on Assassinations. Edgar is the chief House sponser of the Veteran's Health Care bill, calling it "the most sweeping veteran's legislation to come before the 98th Congress." Among its provisions: giving Vietnam veterans permanent eligibility for readjustment counseling, promoting preventive health care and alternatives to institutionalization, mandating a study and report to Congress on post traumatic stress disorders and other psychological problems of Vietnam veterans, creating an advisory commission on women veterans, and the study of long-term effects of radiation exposure from nuclear devices on veterans. After partisan wrangling, a resolution calling for a mutual and verifiable freeze on and reduction of nuclear weapons possessed by the United States and Soviet Union passes 278 to 149, with Edgar in favor. Edgar's amendment to delete $56 million for the Dolores and Dallas Creek water projects in Colorado fails, 140 to 257. The $14.2 billion Energy and Water Development approprations bill then is passed, by a ten to one margin, with Edgar opposed. The Reserve and Economic Recovery Fund is created by budget conferees to authorize spending for recession relief, as the unemployment rate hovers above 10%. It proposes $3.5 billion for public works jobs, $2 billion for health insurance for the unemployed, $1.5 billion for extended unemployment compensation benefits, $600 million for emergency loans for farmers and to help them avert foreclosures, $200 million to help homeowners avert foreclosures, $450 million for expanded food stamp eligibility and $150 million for veterans' job training. Edgar, though, expresses reservations about the fund: "(it) is not talking about industrial policy, it's not talking about retraining, it's not talking about long- and short-term infrastructure investment. I think it can really be described as a series of programs to buffer the long-term unemployment rate." He further reflects on the feelings in Congress: "There is little enthusiasm for public projects, whether they are good for us or not, because of the size of the deficit." While the debate over relief drags on in Congress, in Pennsylvania, the previous month's unemployment rate was a staggering 12.6 percent, with almost 700,000 out of work.</p>
<p>Congress is in no mood to make cuts in spending, especially for its own budget. Seven G.O.P. sponsored amendments to cuts legislative expenses, such as committee staffing, expense accounts, mailing costs, and operators of automatic elevators, fail by large margins, with Edgar voting against them. An amendment to Treasury and Post Office appropriations bill to cut over $910,000 from the office expenses of former presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter passes 244 to 169, with Edgar voting in favor. Again, Edgar supports attempts to delete billions of dollars for B-1 bombers and Pershing II missiles, which fail by large margins. Again, with Edgar voting with the majority, the House rejects the administration's plans to procure binary chemical munitions by 256-161, saving $115 million. Edgar votes for a Democratic plan to cut the deficit by placing a $720 per family limit on the 10% tax cut scheduled for July 1, 1983. The measure passes 229 to 191. He also votes for a plan to reduced spending by the same amount that is generated by the $720 tax cut limit. That also passes, 267-155. The Reserve and Economic Recovery Fund is agreed upon by budget conferees to provide money for recession-relief programs proposed by House Democrats, including $3.5 billion for public works jobs, $2 billion for health insurance for the unemployed and $1.5 billion for an extension of federal supplemental unemployment compensation benefits. Congress would, however, need to pass separate bills authorizing the actual spending. The fund, declares Edgar, "is not talking about industrial policy, it's not talking about retraining, it's not talking about long- and short-term infrastructure investment. I think it can really be described as a series of programs to buffer the long-term unemployment rate." From December to May, the number of those unemployed for 27 weeks or more rose by 179,000, to 2.8 million. Also, in May, for the second consecutive month, the median duration of unemployment stood at 12.3 weeks, meaning that half of the 11 million Americans out of work had been unemployed for nearly three months. Pennsylvania was faring worse than rest of the nation, with May unemployment in May reaching 12.6 percent, representing 693,000 people out of work. The national rate was 10.1% in May. In 1982, when the state's annual unemployment rate was 10.9 percent, 67 percent of Pennsylvania's 599,000 jobless were out of work for five weeks or more, and 39.7 percent were out of work for 15 weeks or more. "It is true that things are getting better, but in northern states like Pennsylvania we are not participating," Senator Heinz declares. "The debate has been fundamentally changed," says one economist. "It is no longer one of providing adequacy for people who are in need. It is now about the deficit and the budget and increases in defense spending."</p>
<p>Regarding two House members accused of misconduct, Republican Daniel B. Crane and Democrat Gerry Studds, Edgar votes for the lesser penalty of censure, as opposed to a reprimand. Crane's censure receives 289 votes to 136, while Studds receives 338 to 87 votes. A proposed amendment to the Defense Authorization bill opposed by the Reagan administration would limit the numbers of U.S. advisors in El Salvador to 55 and military personnel to the present number fails 170 to 247. Edgar votes in favor. Republicans overwhelmingly support Reagan, 16 to 147, but Democrats from the North votes 141 to 26 in support, while Southern Democrats are opposed 13 to 73. Another Democratic amendment to bar U.S. combat troops in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatamala or Costa Rica, unless certain extreme conditions are met, fails by a similar vote. Edgar also supports that proposal. One Democratic amendment that does pass, however, will allow up to $7 billion in defense procurement contracts to be spent in areas of high unemployment. That passes by a vote of only 218 to 201, with Edgar in support. Edgar, however, votes against the final House version of the Department of Defense authorization bill. He votes for the Boland Amendment to terminate U.S. covert actions in Nicaragua for 30 days, then allowing the president to submit a new plan to Congress for resuming such activity. The vote is 221 to 205. Edgar and six other House members challenge a scientific finding that U.S. servicemen who were exposed to radiation in Nagasaki did not suffer an excess amount of bone cancer. The seven write that they were "concerned that such confusion and disputation should reign supreme on so important a subject, and that it should originate from so prominent a scientific body." They asked for a review of the research methods and conclusions of the study. Edgar believes that veterans exposed to Agent Orange or radiation from atomic bomb testing should be compensated for their suffering. "I think that government has to have compassion for its Vietnam vets who were exposed to higher levels of dioxin in many instances than those at Times Beach." He was referring to a Missouri community that was bought out by the federal government for $30 million due to its high level of dioxin contamination. An amendment to reduce revenue sharing from $5.02 billion to $4.6 billion, fails 176-248, with Edgar casting a "nay" vote. Edgar meets with the new regional director of the EPA regarding the reports of toxic wastes in the Clearview landfill on the border of Darby Township and Philadelphia. He votes against the conference report on the $187.5 billion Department of Defense Authorization bill, which passes 266 to 152. Edgar observes that the deployment of American peace-keeping troops to Lebanon may be one of those "no-win situations" that Americans find hard to understand or tolerate. Edgar and other liberal Democrats take issue with the Democratic leadership's decision to make the deal with the White House for a bipartisan resolution allowing the Marines to remain in the Beirut area for another 18 months while giving Congress a voice in military deployment after that. A rival resolution requiring the president to invoke the War Powers Act by the end of November unless he certified to Congress that a ceasefire was in effect in Lebanon, fails by a wide margin, 158-272. Then, the bipartisan proposal is approved 270 to 161. Edgar votes in favor of the former and against the latter legislation. Another Edgar amendment goes down in defeat, 133 to 271. This time, he attempts to delete 20 unauthorized projects from a $119 supplemental appropriations bill for 43 water resource projects. The Boland amendment dealing with U.S. covert activities in Nicaragua is attached to the Intelligence Authorization bill by a vote of 227-194, with Edgar in favor. Edgar votes for two amendments to the Defense appropriations bill to increase naval shipbuilding. An amendment to add $218 million for the frigate construction passes 287-140, but another bid to add $355.5 million for other shipbuilding fails, 85-342. A reintroduced Equal Rights Amendment fails to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the House. Edgar votes for it, but the constitutional amendment fails, 278-147, having needed 284 votes. The proposal had died on June 30, 1982, having been ratified by only 35 states out of the 38 needed.</p>
<p>Edgar votes against the conference report for the Defense appropriations bill, which passes 311-99. The $249.8 billion measure is $10 billion, 4 percent, higher than the 1983 Pentagon spending bill and accounts for nearly 30 percent of the 1984 federal budget. The House votes, 403 to 23, to apply the 1973 War Powers Act to the recent U.S. invasion of Grenada. The vote requests that Reagan remove all troops from the Caribbean island by Dec. 24 or seek an extension of the deadline. Edgard votes with the majority. The House refuses, by a 153 to 274 margin, to force the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Lebanon by cutting off funds for the operation. The vote was on an amendment, which Edgard supports, to the fiscal 1984 defense appropriations bill to end funding for the Lebanon deployment next March 1. An Inquirer editorial calls the Reagan foreign policy “the most militarized American foreign policy since the 1960s, when President Lyndon B. Johnson virtually put the Pentagon in charge during the Vietnam War.” "This administration," states Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), "is using military force instead of foreign policy; it is relying on bullets instead of brains." House Speaker O'Neill Jr. describes the administration's policy as: "If they can't love ya, make 'em feel ya." Edgar asks: "Are we to send in our Marines and Rangers every time there is an international disturbance?" Edgar warns County Council that the soaring federal deficit will force the federal government to shift entitlement programs back to the state and local levels. He blames the rising deficit partly on the huge hike in defense spending.</p>
<p>1984 - Staving Off Defeat, Barely</p>
<p>A Republican-supported amendment to reduce weatherization funds for low income persons from $500 million to $200 million is passed 233-142, with Edgar in opposition. The Library Services and Construction Act is passed, 357-39. The measure, which Edgar votes in favor of, will allocate $156 million in 1985 and rise to $186 million by 1988. Edgar's Republican opponent is Curt Weldon, member of the County Council and former mayor of the borough of Marcus Hook. Weldon is a formidable opponent due to his possession of some of the political strengths of Edgar: an appeal to both blue and white collar voters, a keen grasp of the issues, and a very strong sense of what it takes to win an election. Where Edgar's last strong opponent, Mayor Kane, could not sufficiently cut into the incumbent's white collar base, Weldon, the former teacher and community activist, certainly could. Weldon begins the race by offering a challenge to Edgar to avoid the influence of national special interest groups. "Rather than either side being supported by PACs, I'd like to say...neither of us will take any support from PACs." Edgar refuses, countering that with his G.O.P. base, Weldon can easily outraise him in funds locally. Edgar criticizes an Air Force report that the Agent Orange defoliant used during the Vietnam War does not have an effect on the health of those exposed to it. He believes the Air Force reached its conclusion before studying the issue. Edgar kicks off his campaign for a fifth term, terming the race his "toughest". He states: "I am very concerned about the legacy this administration is leaving our children and grandchildren - soaring budget deficits, the unchecked growth of nuclear weapons, toxic waste dumps and water supplies, and an educational system that is ill-equipped to prepare young people for the future." Showing his strength and credibility as a candidate early, Weldon is endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police Delaware County Lodge 27. Again, Edgar plugs the Blue Route, stating that it "...will give the river corridor an opportunity to compete with King of Prussia and Plymouth Meeting in attracting business and industry." Thinking ahead, former County Councilman Bill Spingler says his is interest in pursuing the congressional seat in 1986 if Edgar runs for the U.S. Senate that year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Edgar votes to override Reagan's veto of the $36 million Water Research bill to aid in cleaning up drinking water. The vote is 309 to 81. Edgar responds to Weldon's previous letter to the Times that reiterates the latter's call for both to not accept PAC money. "We ought to get on to talking about the real issues of the campaign," Edgar states, again rebuffing Weldon, who said fundraising is still the "whole key to the race." He also states: "He's (Edgar) supposed to be a candidate of the people. Why does he have to raise so much money. He has far greater name recognition that I do." In the Primary Election, once again, Edgar easily beats Robert Moran, the national chairman of the Catholics Concerned for Mother and Child, an anti-abortion group. Moran had favored a tough approach toward the Soviets, cutting back U.S. support to Israel until the Palestinians are granted a homeland, tuition tax credits for non-public students and endorses Reagan's Central American policies. Edgar receives 28,526 to Moran's 3,556. The Reverend Jerry Falwell, head of the extreme right wing Moral Majority, and Edgar speak at the University of Pennsylvania regarding Religion and American Politics. Falwell refuses to share the stage with Edgar and the former and half the crowd leave when the latter speaks. Edgar nonetheless speaks: "I hope for an America where no individual will be deemed less of an American because of ...religious beliefs." Reagan's proposed Fiscal 1985 Budget is voted down by the House, 401 to 1, with Edgar voting with the majority. Edgar votes for the budget blueprint proposed by the Congressional Black Caucus to reduce the deficit $324 billion over three years by cutting military spending $203 billion and raising taxes $181 billion. That measure fails by a vote of 76 to 333. He also votes for a version by the Democratic Study Group that would reduce the deficit $261 billion by limiting domestic spending, holding defense spending increases to the inflation rate and raising taxes $76.2 billion. That plan, supported mostly by liberals, also fails, 132-284, but picks up five Republican and ten Southern Democratic votes. The plan submitted by the Conservative Democratic Forum, fails by an even larger vote of 59-338, even though it picks up 33 G.O.P. and 22 Southern Democratic votes. Edgar votes with 157 other Democrats and 123 Republicans to kill the measure, which would have cut the deficit by $255 billion with spending cuts of $53 billion and tax increases of $70 billion. A plan finally emerges, setting expenditures at $918.2 billion, revenues at $742.7 billion, leaving a deficit of 174.5 billion. A Reagan-supported plan to cut the deficit by raising $49.2 billion in new taxes, closing some tax loopholes, and raising taxes on liquor, cigarettes and telephone service, passes 318-97. Efforts to protect the fiscal integrity of Medicare are made by Congress. A proposal to freeze physician's fees for Medicare services for one year and cut increases in spending fails 172-242. However, a small $3.9 billiion cut over three years in Medicare, welfare, veterans and other benefits passes 261 to 152, with the majority of Democrats in favor and the G.O.P. opposed five to one. A measure expressing the Sense of Congress that no funds should be used for the mining of Nicaraguan waters in passed 230 to 153 in an almost party line vote.</p>
<p>After a town meeting regarding Central America held by Edgar in Collingdale in May, he denounces the "crassest display of political activity that I have ever witnessed in my 9 1/2 years." He charges that the forum was invaded by Weldon campaign operatives, led by Dorsey, a campaign manager, intent on disruption. According to Edgar, Dorsey turned people away at the door by putting Weldon signs on the door and "telling them it was a Weldon rally", raised "Weldon for US" signs in the audience, then stood up and led a Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. Dorsey counters, stating his objective was "letting our people know what Edgar stands for, that this congressman is an ultra-liberal congressman and cares more about the enemies of this country than our friends." Weldon told the Times he was not responsible for Dorsey's behavior and the former "came to take notes, to listen and ask questions. I think he (Dorsey) was emotional. But I think he was emotional about the issues and Bob's lack of support of this county." Edgar states: "This was a congressional forum and it was a congressional activity. Previous opponents rejected this (type of disruptive activity)." The Daily Times, in an editorial, states that Dorsey "showed up at the meeting to do nothing more than heckle Edgar, wave Weldon placards and generally disrupt the meeting... If he (Weldon) doesn't think he can beat Edgar without the help of people like Joe Dorsey, he is giving himself less credit than he deserves." Edgar is dissatisfied with the $180 million tentative settlement offered by the makers of Agent Orange. He states that if the matter had gone to court and the company found guilty, Congress could have determined the federal liability. Edgar votes for an amendment to prohibit aid to El Salvador unless the president certifies: the government of that nation removes those active in the death squads from the military, complies with international agreements on the protection of civilians during civil wars, and participates in good faith negotiations with all parties in the war. The amendment, sponsored by Gerry Studds (D-MA) fails by a wide margin, 128-287. The bill to authorize aid to Central America and military assistance to El Salvador only if the president certifies progress on human rights there, passes by a dangerously narrow 212 to 208 vote. Edgar votes against this as well as the entire Foreign Aid Authorization bill, which also barely passes, 211 to 206.</p>
<p>He also votes against an amendment to allow religious groups to meet in public schools during non-class hours if other groups are allowed. The amendment fails on a 270 to 151 vote, with two-thirds, 281, needed for passage. Again, Edgar votes for a series of amendments to delete MX and Trident II missiles, as well as the B-1 bomber and binary chemical munitions. All such efforts fail, except for the vote to prohibit chemical weapons, which passes 247-179. He also votes to prohibit funding the Sargeant York anti-aircraft weapon unless results of testing are sent to Congress; allow the Pershing II missile only if the Soviets refuse to limit their nuclear weapons deployment; and allow no funding for testing the Anti-Satellite missile system unless the Soviets conduct a test in space first. The first two amendments fail, but the latter is approved, 238-181. Edgar votes with an overwhelming majority of the House to bar the introduction of U.S. combat troops into El Salvador and Nicaragua, except under certain specified circumstances. That measure passes 341-64, with a majority of both parties in favor. A similar amendment to bar combat troops in Western Europe, Korea and the Middle East is overwhelmingly rejected. With these votes, Congress, with the support of about a third of the G.O.P. members on some votes, has shown its willingness to reign in the Reagan foreign and defense spending policies. Weldon takes a bullhorn and addresses shift workers arriving at the Boeing Vertol plant. He blasts Edgar for voting against a defense authorization bill, which contains $800 million in contracts for Boeing Vertol. "Your current congressman on Thursday voted against the JVX program, the CH-46 and CH-47 by turning down the 1985 defense authorization bill." Edgar counters by stating his vote was actually against the Pershing II cruise missile, B-1 bomber and MX missiles. The administration-backed Immigration Reform and Control Act barely passes, 216 to 211, with both parties closely divided in their support. Edgar votes against the measure which will provide sanctions on employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens and also provide legal status for many illegals in this country. He votes for the conference report on Deficit Reduction, which will increase taxes $50 billion and cut Medicare and other spending $13 billion. The bill, which is supported by Reagan, passes 268-155, with the G.O.P. almost evenly divided and almost three to one Democratic support. The House votes for a 2% cut in its budget by a close vote of 193-190, but Edgar votes against the cut. Edgar urges a one year moratorium on the proposed selling of Conrail to private industry. Accusing Edgar of accepting PAC contributions, while supporting legislation to curb them, Weldon says: "He does one thing in Washington and comes back here and tells the people of Delaware County something else." Edgar retorts: "I cannot allow myself to be handicapped by a PAC limit while my opponent can raise thousands of dollars from county contractors." Further, he states he would amend his bill to "put more limitation on the amount of contribution by local people who do business with public officials running for elective office." Regarding the choice of fellow Congress member Geraldine Ferraro of New York for vice president, Edgar, a strong Mondale supporter, agrees: "I think it's time for a woman. She's not only qualified to be vice president, but she competent to be president." The Boilermakers Local 802 at Penn Ship endorses Weldon, the reported first time that Edgar had been passed over. The business manager for the union states: "It was our feeling that when Sun Ship made its decision to get out of shipbuilding, Bob Edgar turned his energies to other interests and that was it."</p>
<p>Edgar votes against a measure to weaken the expansion of the Superfund which would prevent citizens from suing for damages caused by toxic waste dumping. The measure to limit the Superfund bill passes, however, by 208 to 200. Then, the expanded Superfund renewal bill passes, 323 to 33, with Reagan in opposition. Edgar, in response to Weldon's relentless attacks on his defense votes, states: "No major defense contract has been lost to Delaware County since 1977. He's trying to give the impression that by final vote of defense that I'm not working with and fully supporting these items." But, Weldon is quick to respond: "Bob Edgar has no influence whatsoever at the Department of Defense. He has the worst voting record in the country...Boeing Vertol has gotten everything without Bob Edgar." Edgar, as the chairman of the subcommittee for hospitals of the Veteran's Affairs committee, pushes for $18 million for site preparation for a $140 million expansion and renovation of the Veteran's Hospital. Weldon criticizes Edgar's vote for a budget blueprint sponsored by Julian C. Dixon of California, an African-American, calling it the "Jesse Jackson Budget". Weldon charges that the budget proposal would raise taxes and cut three defense contracts for Boeing. Dixon's office spokesperson states that the proposal would raise taxes for the wealthy, cut taxes for the lower income levels and not affect Boeing. He further states that the budget was developed by the Congressional Black Caucus Budget Task Force, headed by Philadelphia Congressman Bill Gray and that Jackson had no input. Edgar, obviously not pleased with Weldon's attack, states: "I don't know what kind of games he's trying to play with the name Jesse Jackson, but I object to the inference he's making." Over Reagan's opposition, the Safe Drinking Water act is passed overwhelmingly, 366-27, with Edgar voting in favor. The bill sets federal standards for contaminants, revises the enforcement mechanism, establishes new groundwater protection programs, and authorizes $216 million annually for the new program. The Weldon camp pulls an "October Surprise" with a campaign flyer criticizing Edgar for renting a home in Springfield from his Administrative Assistant. The brochure states: "He now lives in a house that is owned by one of his paid staff assistants, Ms. Ella Powers." Edgar terms the attack "offensive", stating "it implies that unless you own property and pay property taxes, you have no right to vote or privilege to vote." Weldon charges that Edgar, his wife and Powers voted from the same residence. Merle Edgar in a letter to the Times, explains that their Broomall home was sold in an effort to keep the family together and to allow the children to attend schools in Virginia, where the family has been living since 1975. "Whether we own a home in Marple or rent our home in Springfield, the entire 7th District remains the most important place on earth and always will." To add fuel to the fire, Springfield Auditor and County Controller, James Scanlan, publicly accuses Powers of not paying the business privilege tax on the rental income. However, 109 other landlords in the township who have also not paid the tax are sent letters and are not publicly harangued.</p>
<p>Weldon refuses to let the residency issue die, bringing it up at the next debate. "I think it's important for you to tell us today, Bob, where you live, and why all of a sudden because you're moving on to the Senate, you no longer consider Delaware County your premises," Weldon charges. Edgar counters: "Curt, I think your question shows the level of interest you have in the real issues of the campaign." Edgar goes on to mention that fellow congressmen Schulze and Coughlin own homes in the Washington area and not in their districts. The 2,800 members of Local 1069 of the United Aerospace Workers at Boeing Vertol endorse Edgar and the Boilermakers reverse themselves, after new leadership is elected, and endorse Edgar. In spite of this, it is clear that Weldon's persistent efforts have been cutting into the incumbent Democrat's traditionally solid labor support. The Times also jumps aboard the Edgar bandwagon, stating that his "honest, dedicated service as a reformer in Washington has made Delaware County proud." During another debate, Dorsey's son-in-law, James Powers, a councilman from Collingdale, challenges Edgar's patriotism at the Amvets Post in Morton. Powers, in referring back to the congressional forum in Collingdale in May, asks Edgar to deny that the congressman had said: "There are good Communists and bad Communists". Edgar responds: "You have made that statement before this and that is not only outrageous but is wrong." Weldon hammers Edgar for voting to spend $168,000 for elevator operators "to move congressmen up and down one floor to the other." Edgar replies: "Maybe we'll need a 13th debate to talk about the Taj Mahal County Courthouse in Media. We'll prepare some numbers." Geraldine Ferraro visits the Drexel Hill Middle School, stating: "You are very, very smart people when you send people like Bob Edgar to Washington." While Republican hecklers attempt to disrupt her speech, she declares she wants "a Supreme Court chosen by Walter Mondale and not by Jerry Falwell." Edgar jokes: "I hope to bring Fritz Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro in on my coattails."</p>
<p>Edgar's voting attendance is 94% for the year, with his support of fellow Democrats, 89% to 7% and for Reagan, 25% to 71%. In a cliffhanger election that appeared to hinge on a handful of voting divisions in the 40th Ward of Philadelphia, Edgar has an unofficial margin over Weldon of less than 500 votes. The incumbent outspends Weldon $765,898 to $434,420, with 32% of the Edgar's funding coming from PACs and 31% for his challenger. With Reagan's lead in the district, heavy ticket-splitting, once again, is responsible for Edgar's reelection. Some typical comments of voters interviewed after the election were: "I'm a Republican, but I still like Edgar." Sexton sums up the feelings of the G.O.P. leaders: "I think as far as Delaware County goes, for the first time in 10 years we managed to get through to the voters...and brought Edgar's negative voting record to the attention of the voters. They're sending Bob Edgar a message that they've had enough. Our committee people were absolutely enthused with the candidacy of Curt Weldon since last spring. We put on an issue-oriented, door-to-door campaign." Edgar dismisses the Republican rhetoric, stating succinctly: "If the Republican organization is as strong as it thinks it is, it would have won this election." Due to some suspicion that there were voting irregularities in the 40th Ward, Weldon requests a recount. Edgar, even though convinced that he won, agrees. When a voting machine used in Upper Darby's 3rd District, 10th Precinct, is opened, there are 100 votes not previously counted for Edgar. The Democratic minority inspector of elections charges that she was barred by the Republican judge of elections from viewing the voting machine counters during the vote count. Three weeks later, Weldon holds a press conference and concedes, blaming his loss on the 4th, 6th and 8th divisions of the 40th Ward, where Edgar won 605 votes to Weldon's 51. Weldon also admits that he could not prove any massive, widespread vote fraud in the Philadelphia portion of the district. The economic recovery appears to be slowing, as the GNP grows only 1.9% for the third quarter and the unemployment rate remains at 7.3% for October. Bob Dole is elected Senate Majority Leader by a 28-25 vote over Ted Stevens of Alaska. Dole succeeds Howard Baker, who did not seek reelection to the Senate. In Bucks County, another incumbent squeezes by an energetic opponent, with Kostmayer beating David Christian, 112,648 to 108,696. In the Thirteenth District, veteran incumbent Larry Coughlin survives a much closer race than usual, by defeating Joe Hoeffel, 133,648 to 104,756. In the Fifth, Schulze coasts to a huge win over Democrat Louis J. Fanti, 141,965 to 53,586. The official tabulation from the recount is released, showing Weldon carrying the Delaware County portion of the district, 115,537 to 112,479, while Edgar carried the 40th Ward 12,076 to 8,447. Edgar backs the Reagan administration tax reform proposal, citing his own goals of insuring adequate revenue, ease of administration, fairness and efficiency. He also meets with SEPTA General Manager Joseph Mach to discuss the unfolding financial crisis at the agency. Edgar places some blame on Reagan budget cuts and the need for emergency bridge repairs. Reagan proposes $34 billion in spending cuts in domestic programs in response to estimates of a string of federal deficits exceeding $200 billion. He proposes eliminating the Small Business Administration, Job Corps, Legal Services Corporation, rural housing programs, subsidies for Amtrak, dairy subsidies, and most urban mass-transit aid. The Pentagon proposes only $6 billion in cuts.</p>
<p>1985 - Aspirations for Higher Office</p>
<p>On the third of January, Bob Edgar is sworn in for his sixth, and last, term, calling his electoral victory a "mudslide". He votes for Tip O'Neill for House Speaker over Bob Michel, with the vote being 247 to 175, along party lines. He does not receive a seat on the Budget Committee, even though he was recommended by Majority Leader Jim Wright, as well as the chairman of the Public Works committee, Jim Howard. Dole introduces a bill to reduce federal deficits to $100 billion by 1988, in contrast to the Administration's projections of $240 billion. Dole and other G.O.P. senators believe that Reagan's proposals do not adequately address the budget problems. However, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Barry Goldwater, warns that any cuts in the military budget would endanger national security. In an opening salvo for the Democratic nomination for the 1986 U.S. Senate race, Pennsylvania Auditor General Don Bailey, a Vietnam veteran, states: "I have strong concerns about any candidate who had an anti-war orientation at that time." This statement is interpreted as an attack on Edgar. Reagan's 1986 budget comes under sharp attack, as the $973.7 billion proposal provides an overal increase in spending of only 1.5%. Sharp increases in defense spending would be offset by cuts in domestic programs, along with a 5% cut in the salaries of federal employees. Senator Mark Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, refers to the budget as a "fantasy." Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese finally wins confirmation from the Senate for the position of Attorney General. Reagan had nominated him 13 months ago, but the hearing were suspended pending an investigation of ethical violations. In apparent response to the controversy surrounding his county residence, Edgar purchases a condominium at Riddle Glen in Middletown Township. Sexton and Dorsey continue pursuing the matter, having sent a letter to Edgar demanding cancelled checks to prove he paid rent in Springfield.</p>
<p>In yet another close vote, $1.5 billion is approved for 21 MX missiles, 217-210, with Edgar voting against. The House votes for a Democratic plan to provide $4 million to implement the Contadora Peace Agreement and $10 million to assist refugees outside Nicaragua. Edgar votes in favor, with the vote being 219 to 206. Only 15 Republicans support the measure. Edgar votes against another amendment to provide $14 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras. That measure fails on a close vote, 213 to 215, with only 46 Democrats, mostly southerners, in support and 14 moderate Republicans opposed. Edgar, in preparation for next year's race, raps Specter for casting a deciding vote for the compromise budget plan worked out between Reagan and the G.O.P. Senate leaders, which passes 50 - 49. In the disputed election for Indiana's Eighth District, Edgar votes with the majority of Democrats to seat Francis X. McClosky, who was declared the winner over Republican Richard D. McIntyre. After months of bitter arguments, the vote was 236-190, with ten Democrats deserting their party. Edgar votes for the Democratic plan to cut the deficit $75 billion in 1986 and $350 billion between 1986 and 1988. Among the plans provisions would be an elimination of the cost of living adjustment for Social Security and other federal pension benefits, $12 billion in new taxes, along with other cuts. The vote was 258 to 170, with 24 Republicans voting against their party and only 15 Democrats doing the same. Edgar tells top state Democratic leaders that he will run for the U.S. Senate with or without the party's endorsement. He also is fighting to save the state and local tax deduction in the tax reform bill. "The average Pennsylvanian will come out better by retaining the deduction," he tells Governor Thornburgh. An Edgar amendment to reduce proposed Army Corps of Engineers water projects from $151 million to $51 million passes the House, 203 to 202. The House passes the Anti-Apartheid Act, which places immediate sanctions on South Africa due to its policy of racial segregation. The bill would ban bank loans to the South African government, prohibits the sale of certain equipment, bars U.S. business investment there and the prohibits the import of gold coins. The vote was 295 to 127, with Edgar, as well as 56 Republicans in favor. Only six Democrats, all southernors, voted against it. He also votes for the Boland amendment to indefinitely bar aid by intelligence agencies to the Contras, but the effort fails, 196 to 232, with 58 Democrats, mostly southernors, deserting their party. In July, Edgar is cleared by the Federal Election Commission, which dismisses charged filed in May by Dorsey and Sexton regarding the home rental dispute. "We are very pleased," Edgar states. "they had pretty much laid to rest this silly controversy." Edgar votes against a bill to authorize $5 million in aid for non-communist resistance forces in Cambodia and to prohibit aid to the communist Khmer Rouge. The measure passes 288 to 122. He votes against a measure to prohibit aid to El Salvador until the president reports to Congress and Congress passes a resolution stating that El Salvador has met three conditions. It must have made progress in prosecuting those responsible for 45,000 murders, carried out land reform and the government must pursue a negotiated settlement based on free elections. The measure fails with a 47 to 375 vote, with no representative from Pennsylvania voting for it.</p>
<p>He votes against insisting that House conferees for the Department of Defense authorization bill insist on language providing the death penalty for peacetime espionage. The measure does pass, however, 320 to 101. A coalition of conservative groups asked Thornburgh to run against Specter, but was unsuccessful. The radium contaminated "Hot House" located at 105-107 E. Stratford Avenue in Lansdowne is one of 67 projects put on hold due to the fact Congress has not reauthorized the Superfund. As a result, Edgar may introduce his own legislation, setting strict timetables. The conference report on the Anti-Apartheid Act is passed 380 to 48, with Edgar in favor. A statewide poll sponsored by the Pennsylvania Education Association, has Edgar with 24% support among state Democrats, trailing Bailey with 27%. Edgar is sharply critical of a bill approved by the Veterans Committe by a 14 - 12 vote, that cuts $300 million from the budget by the use of a deductible fee for veterans' medical care. Edgar calls for a cease-fire in campaign rhetoric, after a key supporter, state representative William DeWeese refers to Bailey as exuding "a jock, macho, gook-killing ethos". In spite of this request by Edgar, a fund-raising letter from his camp warns that Bailey accepts support from the "politics of hate," such as the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, the National Association of Pro-America and Sane Americans for Free Enterprise. Edgar's letter appeals to Democrats to "prevent right wing extremists from taking over the U.S. Senate." Bailey charges that Edgar is "preaching hatred and making a fool of himself" and refers to him as the "Goldwater of the left".</p>
<p>Weldon releases a six page investigative report of alleged voter irregularities in the 40th Ward, showing the 8th Division as having the most problems. Philadelphia Registration Commission officials respond with a four page report, dealing with the 8th District only. "Most of the allegations were not sustained by the investigation," the deputy registration commissioner states. "There were some irregularities that indicated further investigation should be made. We have not been able to do so because we are in the middle of an alignment of all divisions in Philadelphia." Weldon had complained that city officials and the local voter watchdog group, the Committee of 70, failed to respond to the allegations. Fred Voight, executive secretary of the Committee of 70, states: "We're certainly concerned about problems in the entire district...I seem to recollect there were problems in Delaware County. I would certainly like to meet with Mr. Weldon, in a place other than the pages of the newspapers." Some of the questionable voters are stricken from the registration rolls by the city. In a series of kickoff gatherings throughout the state in November, Edgar officially announces his candidacy for Specter's seat, stating that Pennsylvania "is crying out for new leadership. It's a choice between stagnation and progress." He charges that Specter issues "press releases instead of making policy." Governor Tom Kean is reelected with 70% of the vote in New Jersey over Democrat Peter Shapiro. In Virginia, the Democrats hold onto the governorship, with 55% of the vote. Gerald Bailes beats Republican Wyatt Durette and Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, is the first black to be elected lieutenant governor in a southern state since Reconstruction.</p>
<p>1986 - Looking for a Seventh and Eighth “Miracle”</p>
<p>Edgar is sworn in for his sixth and last term, but his sights are really on the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, Delaware County Democratic leaders are pushing for an open statewide primary, which would benefit Edgar. Edgar attacks Don Bailey's record as a congressman: "When Pennsylvania's future was on the line, Don Bailey votes for the (1981) Republican tax reform plan that helped big business, line the pockets of the rich and stuck it right in the heart of Pennsyvania." Bailey denies the charges, stating that he had voted for the conference report version of the Reagan tax bill that had "good, vital and necessary things for Pennsylvania." With the Democratic State Committee voting 289 to 107 to endorse Bailey over Edgar, the latter is again in his usual role of running against the ruling political establishment. Edgar charges that Specter voted for the Gramm-Rudman deficit control act, while at the same time opposes cuts in Amtrak and declares: "You simply can't have it both ways." In a major coup, the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO endorses Edgar, leaving Bailey to comment that he is "deeply saddened and hurt." The Sierra Club endorses Edgar and he also receives top ballot spot, which can be a critical factor in primary elections. Reagan's proposal to provide $100 million in military and non-military aid to the Contras, as well as lift restrictions on the CIA and Defense Department's assistance to the Contras, fails. The vote is another narrow one: 210 to 222, with 46 Democrats, mostly southerners, joining the Republicans. Edgar opposes this proposal. Edgar and Bailey back the U.S. bombing attack on Libya. Bailey suggests that Edgar has a "tendency to consider the U.S. the wrong-doer, the heavy in international relations. I don't think that is right." Edgar responds: "I recognize there are times when a good citizen must criticize his own country." Edgar charges that employees of the Auditor General's office "felt fear they would be in trouble on their jobs" if they did not contribute to Bailey's campaign. A Bailey spokeman calls the charge "smear and innuendo." The 440 member Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity endorse Edgar. "He has stood with us when the Reagan administration has sought deep cuts in social programs."</p>
<p>Edgar votes for $27 million in humanitarian aid for the Contras. The measure passes overwhelmingly, 361 to 66. The gun lobby scores a huge victory with a 292 to 130 vote to weaken provisions of the 1968 Gun Control Act. Edgar votes against this amendment to allow the interstate sales of rifles and shotguns, as well as transportation of all types of firearms and limit federal inspections of gun dealers to one unannounced inspection per year. During a debate, Bailey makes an issue of an ad in a Philadelphia gay newspaper, the Au Courant, which gives information about an Edgar fund-raiser and a contact number in City Hall. "How can Bob campaign," Bailey asks. "with a phone number in Philadelphia City Council?" Edgar refers to charges of politics in Bailey's office, stating: "It's the old way to use patronage and patronage politics to run your campaign." When questioned about his attack, Bailey responds: "Oh, no, I'm not trying to link him to gay and lesbian rights. This is a specific fund-raising thing." The campaign takes a nasty turn, as both sides air television ads personally attacking the other. Bailey's ads depict Edgar growing a Pinnochio nose, while Edgar's show his opponent gradually turning into an old, cigar-smoking stereotypical politician. Edgar pulls off his "seventh miracle", by defeating Bailey, 432,940 to 408,460 statewide and securing the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. Delaware County is a critical factor in his victory, giving its "native son" 25,112 votes to Bailey's 2,813. In a twist, chairman Weldon asks Edgar to join the rest of the County Council for a press conference regarding the 40 day old SEPTA strike. Edgar, seated alongside Weldon, Ted Erickson, Nick Catania and John Taylor, comments: "This is a historic moment, I guess, for both of us to be sitting on the same side of the table." Edgar urges Specter to vote against the nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions III for the federal judgeship in Alabama, citing the latter's "abysmal" record as U.S. attorney. In a reversal of its previous opposition, the House narrowly passes an amendment to provide $70 million in military aid and $30 million in non-military aid to the Contras. Edgar votes against the measure, but it passes 221 to 209. Specter calls Edgar to task for missing 46% of the roll call votes taken in the House so far. Edgar replies: "The real question is key votes." While the state AFL-CIO endorses Edgar, a poll is released that shows some discouraging numbers. The G.O.P. funded poll shows 63% of Pennsylvanians approve of President Reagan's performance, while only 33% disapprove. By a margin of 61 to 29%, voters choose Specter over Edgar. Edgar charges that Specter flip-flopped on the issue of economic sanctions against South Africa. Specter replies that he has been "always a strong opponent of Apartheid." Edgar is supported by Barbra Steisand and Meryl Streep, who donate $1,000 each to his campaign. He also receives the endorsement of Robin Williams, Judy Collins and Ed Asner and the backing of the Pennsylvania State Education Association. Specter attacks Edgar's vote against a bill to protect the identities of intelligence agents, calling the bill important to the fight against terrorism. Edgar defends his 1981 vote, stating it involved a "freedom of press issue." Edgar charges that Specter voted in 1982 to cut $40 billion from Social Security to reduce the deficit. Specter repeats his charge that Edgar is distorting the incumbent senator's voting record.</p>
<p>Both candidates have reservations about the Reagan administration's plan for mandatory drug testing of some government employees. While the Veterans of Foreign Wars endorse Specter, his is criticized by the Black Clergy for his vote against combating Apartheid. The Pennsylvania National Association of Women and the Human Rights Campaign Fund both endorse Edgar, who receives a $5,000 donation from the latter. He is also endorsed by the 4,900 member Association of Pennsylvania State Colleges and Universities Faculties. The United Press Service quotes Specter's top aide, Dan McKenna, as referring to Edgar as a "lying bastard" and "son of a bitch." McKenna denies the remarks. Edgar states: "There is an Arlen Specter on both sides of every issue." McKenna replies: "All Edgar has done in this campaign is throw mud." Edgar describes the television ad from the Specter camp that criticizes the 7th District Congressman's attendance record as having "premiered in the gutter." During their debate on television, Specter states: "My opponent is not only outside the mainstream of his party, he is outside the mainstream of the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party...really off the board." He repeats his charges that Edgar has distorted and misrepresented Specter's record. The Times endorses Edgar, but the powerful National Rifle Association targets him for defeat. Perhaps the American Civil Liberties Union sums up the race, finding more areas of agreement between Specter and Edgar, than differences. The liberal organization finds that both oppose the constitutional amendment to limit abortion, both support restoring federal Medicaid funding for necessary abortions, favor restitution for Japanese-Americans interned during WWII, oppose silent prayer in schools, oppose aid to the Contras, support the Civil Rights Restoration Act and oppose legislation to weaken the Exclusionary Rule which would permit evidence obtained from illegal searches to be used in court.</p>
<p>Edgar is not able to overcome Specter's name recognition and popularity, garnering only 1,448,219 votes to the incumbent's 1,906,537. Specter, as the incumbent, outspends Edgar, $5.993 million to $3.968 million. Each candidate loses his own home county, with Edgar losing Delaware County, 107,922 to 83,779 and Specter failing to carry Philadelphia, 271,759 to 211,193. The three other suburban counties weigh in very heavily for Specter, 233,000 to 138,000. With the economy expanding under Reagan and no serious issues that could be used against the incumbent senator, Specter was in no serious danger of defeat. Pennsylvania voters, when faced with a choice of a moderate Republican and a liberal Democrat, have generally chosen the former. Both Specter and Edgar were perceived by the public as being on the side of the "little guy". The Apartheid issue used by Edgar did not play as a major issue in the minds of many Pennsylvanians. Unlike 1974, it just was not a good year for Edgar to make another breakthrough. Even his own constituents were wary about replacing the popular Specter with their own Bob Edgar. The ticket-splitting Republicans who had loyally stuck with Edgar, even during the close 1984 election, would not transfer that loyalty to the Senate race. "Edgar's yesterday's news in this county," gloats Sexton, who serves as Weldon's finance chairman. Dorsey is even more harsh in his crowing: "Bob Edgar would not pledge allegiance to the American flag (in 1984) and I said we'd get him for that and we did." If Edgar were ever to seek office again in Delaware County, Dorsey adds: "we'll beat him. I'm confident of that." Edgar went on to teach a political science course at Swarthmore College as a Lang Visiting Professor of Social Change. He was left with $121,000 in campaign debt, while Specter sat on a cash surplus of $234,000. On December 17, 1986, Edgar tells over 200 supporters at a dinner in his honor at the Springfield Country Club that he has no regrets about serving in Congress. "It was worth the effort, it was worth the risk, it was worth the spirit and the enthusiasm and the commitment...I got elected to the private sector by accident." His remarkable career spanned the Ford, Carter and six years of the Reagan administration, an era where the Republican right wing moved toward dominating national politics. The political scene shifted towards the right during those twelve years, 1974 to 1986, with Edgar serving only four years with a Democratic president. He was elected and reelected based on his record as a reformer and one willing to challenge the status quo. After Edgar's first election breakthrough, jubilant Democrats in Delaware County thought the sky was the limit and felt confident enough about the future to agree to the elimination of the seat on the county commissioners that was guaranteed for the minority party. Subsequent elections proved that much of Edgar's victory was personal and was in spite of, rather than due to, the county Democratic organization. When the Republicans ran candidates for other offices, such as Whittlesey, Keeler, Hazel and Rochford, who were considered as "clean cut" and corruption-free as Edgar, they also won.</p>
<p>What is actually even more remarkable is the fact that Edgar was not elected in the overwhelmingly Republican Seventh District because he was a moderate or conservative Democrat. He was elected over and over as a liberal Democrat, who was a loyal member of his party in Congress. With his voting record, he was able to put together a coalition of labor, women, liberals, minorities and environmentalists, bringing together enough Democrats and Republican ticket-splitters to guarantee re-election. As he gained seniority in his Democratic party in the House, his Republican opponents, especially Weldon, sought to brand him as a member of the status quo, part of a majority of tired Democrats who had held the reigns of power in Congress too long. It did not matter that several of his opponents were closely tied to the same old Republican machine that dominated all countywide offices in Delaware County since the Civil War. "He would have continued to win in Delaware County," stated Dianne Merlino, chairperson of the county Democratic committee. "I think Bob Edgar would have won this year, if that's what he had chosen to do." Several days after leaving office, Edgar reflects on his past twelve years: "It is a fun job, being a congressman. You're at the cutting edge of a lot of important issues, meeting a lot of important people." Retiring from political office at age 43, Edgar did not rule out a return to political life in the future. "I told someone that I spent 12 years in the ministry, 12 years in the House, and if I spend 12 years doing something else," he said, "I will still be younger than many of the current senators."</p>
<p>Activities After Leaving Office (1987-1992)</p>
<p>In January 1987, Edgar addresses a Jobs for Peace rally in front of the Delaware County Courthouse. Speaking to about 40 people, he attacks the Reagan Administration's budget priorities. "The commander of a single Poseidon submarine floating offshore has the potential (firepower) of three World War IIs," Edgar states. "How many tons of food do we have available to feed the needy?" In April 1987, Edgar begins working as finance director for the presidential campaign of Illinois Senator Paul Simon. When he resigns from that post a year later, he explains: "I am really looking for a new direction and a new vocation for my life. It's time." The following January, when asked about returning to politics, the former congressman replies: "I have no immediate plans, but I'm not using the word 'never'. My personality and ego aren't based on getting elected to public office." In February 1988, when asked his opinion about his successor's performance in office, Edgar brands Weldon "an ultraconservative". He criticizes Weldon's votes for aid to the Contras, "Star Wars" and against the Gephardt amendment for free trade. He serves as the campaign chairman for Weldon's Democratic opponent, David Landau. In June, he becomes the Director of the Committee for National Security, a group that researches American foreign policy and nuclear weapons issues. That October, he speaks at a county Democratic fundraiser, standing in for Rep. Richard Gephardt. The following month at a seminar sponsored by the Delaware County SANE/Freeze groups, he tells the activists that peace groups need to "think strategically" and become experts on weapons systems, reach broader audiences and build bridges to the Bush administration. In May of 1989, he speaks at the Media Democratic Committee's Sixth Annual Community Service Awards dinner. "I have a dream that someday the U.S. and Soviets will together say, 'Let's vaccinate every child in the Third World." The following March, he endorsed Weldon's Democratic opponent, John Innelli. The following month, he announced: "I'm leaving secular politics. I think now I really want to educate others to do the same things I was able to do." In Media, he addressed a crowd assembled to commemorate Earth Day, warning them that "our planet can only sustain twelve billion" people. He departed for his new position as president of the School of Theology at Claremont in California in July. Even though he would be moving out of the state, he accepts the co-chairmanship, along with state representative Karen Ritter of Lehigh County, of the new group Democrats for Choice. In January, 1992, Edgar returns to Delaware County to endorse the congressional bid of Democrat Frank Daly. In October, he held a press conference with Daly to criticize Weldon's voting record on the environment.</p>
