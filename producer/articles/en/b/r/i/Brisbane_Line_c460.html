<p>The <b>Brisbane Line</b> was a controversial defence proposal allegedly formulated by the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Menzies</a> government during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> to concede the northern portion of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> continent in the event of an invasion. The actual location of the "line" demarcating this territory is unclear. When the proposal was originally revealed to the public in 1942, it was claimed that the "northern part of the country" was to be surrendered. <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_MacArthur_cfde.html" title="Douglas MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> subsequently claimed that the line was to run from Brisbane to Perth.[2,3,4,5]. A few months after his initial statement of the 'Brisbane Line' MacArthur attempted to distance himself from his earlier remarks as it was coming to light that his time lines and assertions were in fact incorrect.</p>
<p>There remains popular belief of a 'Brisbane Line' amongst many Australian Academia based upon a string of events and Australian Defence planning preceding the Second World War. Defence of the entirety of Australia's vast and <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outback.html" title="Outback">sparsely populated interior</a> would not have been possible with the military resources then available, it seems equally unlikely that any Australian government would have been prepared to concede so much Australian territory without a fight. The situation was clarified to American General George Brett who posed the question to Australian General Rowell "What would Australians do if the Japenese were to land at Broome and head for Alice Springs?" Rowell replied, "We would send out the Salvage Corps and pick up the bones of the Japanese who died in the desert." Australians did not believe that an attack would be made on certain parts of the continent. Government planning determined that ports, airfields and the industrial areas to the south were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The 'Brisbane Line' proposal first came to light when Labour politician <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Ward_cd47.html" title="Eddie Ward">Eddie Ward</a> received confidential information about a plan to abandon northern Australia from a public servant Major H.V. Howe who was working in the Secretary for Defence Office. Howe's information is at best confused as it appears to be a confused mixture of a proposal prepared by a defence sub-committee report from February 1936 known as the 'Maryborough Plan' and a secret briefing from 1942 that had been prepared by the GOC in C Home Forces General Sir Iven Mackay. Mackay's February 1942 brief stated that Australia's limited forces available (5 divisions in Australia, 3 of which were battle ready) was barely sufficient to defend the vital stategic areas of the South East of the continent. Compounded to this Australia had substantial Naval, Military and Air Force numbers committed in North Africa and Europe. Mackay stated that Militia units should remain in place to defend local regions and that civil populations should not be encouraged to be evacuated in masse as this would hamper military operations. Mackay's plan was presented in February 1942 to the Labor Cabinet and was immediately rejected. It was partially this document that was later to become the basis of Wards charges of the mythical '<strong class="selflink">Brisbane Line</strong>'. firm in his belief that there was in fact a Brisbane Line, Ward then publicised this information at a public meeting at <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prahran_Town_Hall_4827.html" title="Prahran Town Hall">Prahran Town Hall</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne%2C_Victoria_c90f.html" title="Melbourne, Victoria">Melbourne</a>. The quality of this evidence remains in dispute, with critics using it in turn as evidence of Menzies' alleged <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treasonous</a> sympathies.</p>
<p>A royal commission was held into the alleged absence of documents from official archives pertaining to the Brisbane Line, however the commission found that no such documents were in fact missing. The royal commission and the Brisbane Line controversy played a central role in the 1943 federal election, resulting in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Curtin_664e.html" title="John Curtin">John Curtin</a>'s Labor government returning to power in a landslide victory.</p>
<p>Proponents of the existence of the Brisbane Line proposal often refer to the existence of concrete <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon%27s_teeth_%28fortification%29.html" title="Dragon's teeth (fortification)">tank traps</a> in places such as <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenterfield%2C_New_South_Wales_8dac.html" title="Tenterfield, New South Wales">Tenterfield</a> as evidence <a href="http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/locations/tanktrapstenterfield.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/locations/tanktrapstenterfield.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
