<p>I suddenly realised that this article has spelt the name of the city wrongly throughout. the City was named Brighton &amp; Hove when it gained city status, so should be refered to as such. however when the old administrative areas of Brighton and Hove are refered to it is ok to omit the ampersand. I have also added a line to mention that this naming is unique in as much as it contains an ampersand. sharing the distinction with westward ho! that also has a non alphabetic character in its name.</p>
<p>I will also make a duplicate of the page renamed Brighton &amp; Hove so that links from other pages can be corrected. I hope that this is the correct way of going about it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a> 02:05, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>David, I've noticed you've changed the "In other languages" links to correctly use the "&amp;" instead of "and". Unfortunately, the articles in other languages are still incorrect. Any idea how we can go about correcting the foreign-language articles as well?

<p>iffy - I dont have the faintest - I hoped to give some time to it yesterday but ended up chasing my own tail around the help pages trying to find a coherent explanation of how the categories work, or rather how to edit them. - I ended up sitting perplexed at 4:30 am wishing I'd never started. maybe soon I will put aside a couple of days to give it another try. just now though Ill check to see if youve already changed them back, if not ill do it. thanks for your note <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a> 01:37, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, the city does <b>not</b> have an Ampersand in its name, to my knowledge. If you read the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951770_en_5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951770_en_5.htm" rel="nofollow">actual law</a> establishing the borough, you'll note it uses "Brighton and Hove" not "Brighton &amp; Hove". <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 23:52, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Morwen. like you i too have spent a while trying to clear this little conundrum up, since you posted, I might add. The reason that I was so sure that the ampersand was policy, was that I had a conversation with an ex mayor of the city and they insisted that the proper useage was with an ampersand.</dd>
<dd>the 'actual law' that you give a link to, are only the notes to the statutory instrument that notifies transitional provision of authority from the two separate towns - in effect it disbands their separate local authorities and forms a transitional one. that lasted 5 years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the actual royal charter of 2000 that confers city status is worded thus:
<dl>
<dd>"ELIZABETH the SECOND BY THE GRACE OF GOD OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND &amp; OF OUR REALMS &amp; TERRITORIES QUEEN HEAD OF THE COMMON WEALTH DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.</dd>
<dd>To all to whom these Presents shall come Greeting. Whereas We for divers good causes and considerations Us thereunto moving are graciously pleased to confer on the Towns of Brighton and Hove the status of a city Now Therefore Know Ye that We of Our especial grace and favour and mere motion do by these Presents ordain declare and direct that the TOWNS OF BRIGHTON AND HOVE shall henceforth have the status of a CITY and shall have all such rank liberties privileges and immunities as are incident to a City. In witness whereof We have caused Our Letters to be made Patent Witness Ourself at Westminster the thirty first day of January in the fourty ninth year of our reign.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By Warrant under The Queens Sign Manual Phillips."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Quite a mouthfull, and not exactly common usage, but it does not refer to the name of the new city at all, simply that the towns currently known of as Brighton and Hove shall have the status of city.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the link to the charter is <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1133221" class="external text" title="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1133221" rel="nofollow">here</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>however if you take a look at the <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">cities website</a> I'm sure you will agree that there is a concerted effort to use the ampersand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finaly there is the matter of correct usage - an ampersand is the correct form for a proper noun in the UK. As <a href="http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/marcomm/publishguide/editorial.shtm" class="external text" title="http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/marcomm/publishguide/editorial.shtm" rel="nofollow">Brighton universities Publication and corporate identity guidelines</a> point out:
<dl>
<dd><b>Ampersand (the &amp; symbol)</b></dd>
<dd>Don’t use except where correct form of proper noun</dd>
<dd>• Brighton &amp; Hove</dd>
<dd>• Marks &amp; Spencer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>so although the ampersand may not be the most web friendly of characters (Brighton &amp; Hove council simply replace it with a hyphen for their URL rather than replace it with 'and') most search engines ignore both the &amp; and the word 'and'. It is correct. I dont quite see why you consider it 'harmful'?</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ampsersands in URLs are bad. But that's not really a problem. I think we ought to remove the claim that it "is the only city that has an ampersand in its name", since the ampersand is only used informally. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 14:53, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Whilst you may deride this as a 'transitional provision of authority from the two separate towns', it still forms the current legal basis for the council, and has not been entirely superseded - certainly not by the royal charter, which is an entirely ceremonial document. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 14:56, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm diving in a bit late in the day, but nevertheless... I also consider ampersands to be dangerous. I don't dislike them, and I think it's a pity that they're dangerous, but they have long been used a kind of "control character" in various computer systems, and I prefer web documents to err on the side of caution. If it were absolutely certain that the ampersand is the correct usage, that would modify my opinion, but that case hasn't been proved yet.</dd>

<dd>Also, I can't resist pointing out a flaw in the logic where the Brighton University document is referenced. I don't do this to be pedantic, but to prevent a flawed argument from being accepted by default, and adding weight to one side of the argument. Basically the document in no way suggests that the ampersand is proper usage for a proper noun; it merely states that they should not be used in any <i>other</i> way, which is a much "smaller" scope of statement. In any case, a University style guide is no guide to correct usage, it's merely a marketing guideline for a single organisation.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry to stir this up, but my reading of this page suggests that we now have two people speaking in favour of the ampersand (David P and A bit iffy) and two against (Morwen and me).

<p>I can't believe I hadn't noticed before, but the official sign at the north of the city where the A23 enters says "Welcome to the city of Brighton and Hove" - with the ampersand only appearing in the logo above.</p>
<p>Another new thing is that certain versions of Firefox, with certain common enough extensions (including "linkify") are currently buggy, and prevent editing of Wikipedia articles with ampersands in the title.</p>
<p>Since we have a broad split in opinions (and the debate has gone cold), and since these are two reasonably strong new points, I think it's time to swing the balance of evidence the other way and rename the article without the ampersand. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 13:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would contest this - sorry Kieran! Is that A23 sign actually an official, formal statement by B&amp;H council? Or, more likely, is it something knocked up by an inattentive person in the Highway Maintenance department? I would say that the B&amp;H council's opinion of the city's name is what it itself uses on pretty well all its stationery and, above all, its website - these state "Brighton &amp; Hove".</dd>

<dd>As for the Firefox problem with ampersands, which version of Firefox would that be? If it's an older version, I would guess that most Firefox users keep their versions pretty much up to date, so it's only a problem for a small proportion of articles for a small proportion of users of a browser which itself has a small proportion of Internet users. There are many, many articles with ampersands in their titles, and renaming them to fit in with a minority browser would be quite wrong - it's really a Mozilla issue, not a Wikipedia issue. There are even cases where they could not be renamed by replacing the ampersand with "and": <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Sickness_%26_In_Health_2183.html" title="In Sickness &amp; In Health">In Sickness &amp; In Health</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_%26_Judy_4507.html" title="Richard &amp; Judy">Richard &amp; Judy</a> being just two examples.--<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 11:22, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see I'm never going to be happy about this one.&#160;;-) How about, as a compromise, we come up with a form of words for the introduction, just after where the ampersand is first used, which makes it clear that this cannot be definitively established as the correct version (particularly with the legal documents mentioned far above in mind)? – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 16:34, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think that's best. Maybe something like <i><b>Brighton &amp; Hove</b> (or <b>Brighton and Hove</b>) is a unitary authority and...</i> I'm not totally comfortable with that, though, as I don't like to see lead sentences become cluttered. So maybe there should be a separate section "==Name==" devoted to it, and this would allow expansion on the topic. This could include such things as the wordings in the legal documents (even though those still don't say to me that the city's official name is "Brighton and Hove"!). Also, it could include, if someone can organise it, a photo of the A23 sign - that would be a nice touch to demonstrate the uncertainty. In addition, I have a feeling that the house style of the Argus is to use "and" instead of the ampersand, so that could be included. Of course, what should definitely be included is what the council calls the city via its stationery etc. What do you think?</dd>

<dd>Also, if you don't mind, I want to back to the earlier argument about Brighton University's style guidelines: that argument is valid, because the guidelines imply that the university believes the correct name of the city uses the ampersand, and hence overrides their normal style of not using ampersands. And looking at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marks_%26_Spencer_2ad4.html" title="Marks &amp; Spencer">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, the official name as registered with Companies House is "MARKS AND SPENCER P.L.C.", but they choose to be generally known as Marks &amp; Spencer.--<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 12:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I agree about disliking unweildy intros. I'll put it in as you've written above for now, and we can try to refine it or move it into the article. On the company name argument, there is a subtlety to it: the company may "trade as" what it wishes, but it still has articles of memorandum (or a constitution, or charter, or what have you) that state its official name, which remains unchanged by what it puts on its stationery etc. Which gets us back to the infuriating complexity of the legal documents granting city status. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 14:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder why this article is still stubbed? There seems a fair amount here now, and some of what might be added could more properly be put in the separate articles on the towns themselves, surely? I've de-stubbed, although I expect to be taken to task with all the things that could be put in!!!

<p>Does this division into four areas makes sense? I am in particular concerned by the fact that <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rottingdean.html" title="Rottingdean">Rottingdean</a> is an area in itself, but that <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saltdean.html" title="Saltdean">Saltdean</a> is part of the Brighton area. Looking at a map, it might make sense to divide all the deans off, but hiving just Rottingdean off (persumably because it has a parish council) seems odd. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 15:59, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove ranks top in the Jedi census statistics, according to the 2001 census. Of course, this is more of a fun fact, but maybe someone cares to incorporate it into the article. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubversive_element_cc3c.html" title="User:Subversive element">Subversive element</a> 16:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
