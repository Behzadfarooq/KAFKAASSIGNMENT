<p>Born at number 11 Valley Road, <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grove_hill%2C_Middlesbrough_160e.html" title="Grove hill, Middlesbrough">Grove Hill</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>, he was the son of a local sweet <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factory</a> worker, and the fifth of eight children. When talking of his childhood he said he "adored it in all its aspects. If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mum and dad, I’m that person. I was the kid who came from a little part of paradise”. On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the nicest place in the world, “But to me it was heaven”. “Everything I have done, everything I’ve achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood. Maybe it was the constant sight of mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning till night, working harder than you or I have ever worked”.</p>

<p>Clough was a prolific striker for his home town club <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> scoring 204 goals in 222 starts for Boro, he then signed for <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland_A.F.C._5fa7.html" title="Sunderland A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> and scored 63 goals in only 74 games. Unfortunately for Clough on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">26 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, he injured his knee during a match against <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bury_F.C._b423.html" title="Bury F.C.">Bury</a> after colliding with the goalkeeper. It turned out to be a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruciate_ligament.html" title="Cruciate ligament">cruciate ligament</a> injury, which usually ended a player's career at that time. Clough returned two years later but could only manage three games before retiring. He played twice for <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a>, against <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales_national_football_team.html" title="Wales national football team">Wales</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden_national_football_team.html" title="Sweden national football team">Sweden</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">28 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, without scoring.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Clough_2372.html" title="Edit section: Derby County">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Derby County</span></h3>
<p>Clough then went on to manage <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartlepool_United_bd54.html" title="Hartlepool United">Hartlepool United</a> with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Thomas_Taylor_1085.html" title="Peter Thomas Taylor">Peter Taylor</a> as his assistant manager, before they both joined <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby_County_bd71.html" title="Derby County">Derby County</a> as manager and assistant manager in 1967. At Derby, Clough and Taylor won promotion to the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_First_Division_6af3.html" title="Football League First Division">Football League First Division</a> (then the highest echelon of English football) within two years. Clough was universally seen as a hard but fair manager, who insisted on clean play from his players and brooked no stupid questions with the press. He was famous for insisting on being called 'Mr Clough' and earned great respect from his peers for his ability to turn a game to his and his team's advantage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971-72_in_English_football_a69e.html" title="1971-72 in English football">1971-72</a> season, Derby tussled with <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_A.F.C._b85c.html" title="Leeds United A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> for the title. Leading the table by one point having played their last match, Clough took his players on holiday to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, where they learned that both title rivals had failed to win their final matches, meaning that Derby became champions for the first time in their history.</p>
<p>The following season Derby reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, but were knocked out by <a href="../../../j/u/v/Juventus_F.C._0c71.html" title="Juventus F.C.">Juventus</a> 3-1 on aggregate in very controversial circumstances. It later emerged that the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West German</a> referee had received gifts from the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> side before the match. Clough himself accused the Juventus team of being "cheating bastards" and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">war</a>. Clough's frequent outspoken comments against football's establishment (which had led to Derby being threatened with expulsion from the League) eventually led to him falling out with Rams chairman, Sam Longson, and the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_directors.html" title="Board of directors">board of directors</a> at the club. Clough and Taylor both left in 1973, to widespread uproar from Rams fans, who demanded the board resign and Clough be reinstated.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Clough_2372.html" title="Edit section: Brighton and Leeds United">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brighton and Leeds United</span></h3>
<p>Such was the loyalty to Clough that along with himself and Taylor, scouts and backroom staff completed the walk out, following the pair for their brief spell with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_%26_Hove_Albion_F.C._317b.html" title="Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a>. He proved less successful on the South Coast than with his previous club, winning only 12 of his 32 games in charge of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Third_Division_c093.html" title="Football League Third Division">Third Division</a> side. Whereas eight months earlier Clough was managing a team playing Juventus in the European Cup and eighteen months earlier guided a club to their first ever league championship, he was now managing a club who, just after his appointment as manager, lost to Walton and Hersham 4-0 at home in an FA Cup replay and who lost 8-2 at home to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Rovers_098f.html" title="Bristol Rovers">Bristol Rovers</a>, and eventually finished in 19th place.</p>
<p>Clough left less than a year after his appointment to become manager of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_A.F.C._b85c.html" title="Leeds United A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> following <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Revie_29cb.html" title="Don Revie">Don Revie</a>'s departure to become manager of England, though this time Taylor didn't join him. Such a move was surprising, given Clough's previous outspoken criticism of Revie and his team's playing style. Shortly after his appointment Clough famously told the Leeds players that they should throw all their medals in the bin, since they'd won them unfairly. He lasted in the job only 44 days before he was sacked after upsetting many of Leeds's star players, notably <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Giles_2557.html" title="Johnny Giles">Johnny Giles</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Hunter_2a4a.html" title="Norman Hunter">Norman Hunter</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Bremner_5e81.html" title="Billy Bremner">Billy Bremner</a>. Until season 2006 when Leeds's fortunes had diminished drastically at the foot of the championship (old second division) under manager John Carver, he had the unenviable record of being <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_A.F.C._b85c.html" title="Leeds United A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>'s <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_A.F.C._b85c.html#Managers" title="Leeds United A.F.C.">least successful</a> manager winning only 1 match. His pay-off was estimated at £98,000.</p>

<p>In January 1975, Clough made a quick return to management with Nottingham Forest, who at the time were a Second Division side. A year later he was joined by his old assistant Taylor. They transformed the club's fortunes and the first success at the club came in Clough's second full season (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1976-77_in_English_football_3507.html" title="1976-77 in English football">1976-77</a>) when they won promotion to the First Division. In their first season after promotion they won the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Cup_66aa.html" title="Football League Cup">League Cup</a>, beating <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> 1-0 in a replay at <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Trafford_%28football%29_4dfd.html" title="Old Trafford (football)">Old Trafford</a>, and were crowned champions of the First Division, finishing seven points clear of nearest challengers Liverpool.</p>
<p>This made Clough the first manager since <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Chapman_ca45.html" title="Herbert Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> to win the English Championship with two different clubs. During the 1978-79 season, Clough signed the 24-year-old <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_City_F.C._f327.html" title="Birmingham City F.C.">Birmingham City F.C.</a> striker <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Francis_5263.html" title="Trevor Francis">Trevor Francis</a> - Britain's first £1million footballer (although Clough insisted that the fee was actually £999,999). Forest retained the League Cup, but finished as runners-up to Liverpool in the league. The season was rounded off with victory in the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Champions_League_a339.html" title="UEFA Champions League">European Cup</a> final, thanks to a 1-0 victory over <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malm%C3%B6_FF_9303.html" title="Malmö FF">Malmö FF</a>. A year later, Clough guided Forest to a second successive European Cup after victory over <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Keegan_512a.html" title="Kevin Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a>'s <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger_SV_ffeb.html" title="Hamburger SV">Hamburg</a> and a third successive League Cup final, though this time they were defeated by <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.</p>
<p>It was not until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988-89_in_English_football_d73e.html" title="1988-89 in English football">1988-89</a> that Clough and Forest would enjoy another major trophy success, this time over <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luton_Town_F.C._24dc.html" title="Luton Town F.C.">Luton Town F.C.</a> in the League Cup again. For a time, Forest were on course for a treble that season, but ultimately had to settle for 3rd place in the league and a defeat in the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-finals. A year later, Clough guided Forest to another League Cup victory with a 1-0 over <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Athletic_634f.html" title="Oldham Athletic">Oldham Athletic</a>. In 1991 Forest reached their first FA Cup final under Brian Clough but lost 2-1 to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C._6bd2.html" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. They reached the League Cup final again in 1992, but lost 1-0 to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992-93_in_English_football_5903.html" title="1992-93 in English football">1992-93</a> season was Clough's 18th with Forest - and his last. They were one of the 22 clubs in the new Premier League, but the sale of key players like <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Sheringham_f52e.html" title="Teddy Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Walker_4f7f.html" title="Des Walker">Des Walker</a>, combined with the manager's increasingly uncontrolled alcoholism, saw the club's fortunes take a sharp decline and they were bottom virtually all season. Just before a 2-0 defeat against <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_United_F.C._8e73.html" title="Sheffield United F.C.">Sheffield United F.C.</a> confirmed the club's relegation after 16 years in the top flight, Clough announced his retirement as manager.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Clough_2372.html" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
<p>Clough retired as manager of Nottingham Forest F.C. in May 1993 to be succeeded by the <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyton_Orient_7430.html" title="Leyton Orient">Leyton Orient</a> manager <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Clark_9e0c.html" title="Frank Clark">Frank Clark</a>. He spent the majority of his retirement living in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarndon.html" title="Quarndon">Quarndon</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire.html" title="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> before moving to <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby.html" title="Derby">Derby</a> itself. Today he has a stand named after him at Nottingham Forest's ground, "The City Ground", which is the stadium's biggest stand.</p>
<p>Much of his retirement was spent concentrating on his fight against <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> which had plagued him since the 1970s. He considered applying for the job as manager of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C._dcb3.html" title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.</a> on the resignation of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Taylor_%28football_manager%29_cb0a.html" title="Graham Taylor (football manager)">Graham Taylor</a> in October 1995, perhaps thinking that he could take the struggling club (then just above the relegation zone in the new First Division) to the same heights to which he took Nottingham Forest. But nothing came of it and Clough's managerial career was over. Nottingham Forest honoured him by renaming the City Ground's Executive Stand the Brian Clough Stand. Clough was made an Inaugural Inductee of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Football_Hall_of_Fame_0969.html" title="English Football Hall of Fame">English Football Hall of Fame</a> in 2002 in recognition of his impact as manager.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Clough was implicated in the "bungs" scandal in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_England_1837.html" title="Football in England">English football</a> involving then <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C._6bd2.html" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Venables_9fb4.html" title="Terry Venables">Terry Venables</a> and Spurs <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Sugar_0c4b.html" title="Alan Sugar">Alan Sugar</a> and particularly the transfer of Teddy Sheringham from Forest to Spurs. Clough was alleged to have been receiving illegal payments during transfer negotiations and making illegal payments to players<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/09/23/sfnbos23.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/09/23/sfnbos23.xml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Owing to Clough's declining health when the case was put together, he was never formally charged by the FA.</p>
<p>Clough's relationship with Peter Taylor, his assistant at Derby, Brighton and Forest, was damaged permanently in 1983 over the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfer_%28football%29.html" title="Transfer (football)">transfer</a> of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Neilson_Robertson_c406.html" title="John Neilson Robertson">John Robertson</a>. The two fell out when Taylor, who had retired in 1982 but then become manager of Derby, signed the Forest winger without telling Clough beforehand. The rift had not been repaired by the time Taylor died in October 1990, but Clough and his family attended Taylor's funeral. When the assistant coach at Forest telephoned Clough to inform him of Taylor's death, he didn't say anything and put the phone down. He allegedly cried heavily after this and his bad feeling over the unreconciled rift increased Clough's already heavy drinking<a href="http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/managers/brian-clough.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/managers/brian-clough.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Clough dedicated his autobiography in 1994 to Taylor and when given the freedom of Nottingham also paid tribute to him, as he did in 1999 when a bust was unveiled of Clough at the City Ground.</p>
<p>In January 2003, the 67-year-old Clough underwent a liver transplant; 30 years of heavy drinking had taken its toll and doctors said that Clough would have died within two weeks without a transplant, as it was severely damaged and cancer had been found within it. The transplant gave Clough a new lease of life for the next 20 months.</p>
<p>Clough's reputation for never sitting on the fence and ever-strong views on all manner of football issues translated into an entertaining and sometimes controversial column which he wrote for <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Four_Two_0660.html" title="Four Four Two">Four Four Two</a></i> magazine up until his death.</p>
<p><a name="Death_and_legacy" id="Death_and_legacy"></a></p>

<p>Clough died of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomach_cancer.html" title="Stomach cancer">stomach cancer</a> on September 20, 2004, in Derby City Hospital, at the age of 69.</p>
<p>Such was his popularity, fans of Derby County and Nottingham Forest, usually the fiercest of rivals, mourned together following his passing. A memorial service was held at Derby's <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pride_Park_Stadium_adb3.html" title="Pride Park Stadium">Pride Park Stadium</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> which was attended by over 14,000 people. It was originally to be held at <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby_Cathedral_f69b.html" title="Derby Cathedral">Derby Cathedral</a>, but had to be moved due to demand for tickets <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3738032.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3738032.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Clough was often seen <a href="http://www.brianclough.com/new_page_7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brianclough.com/new_page_7.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> as the English public's pick for manager of England, but he was never given the job by the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_1c38.html" title="Football Association">Football Association</a>.</p>
<p>In September 1989, British punk band the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Dolls_bcb0.html" title="Toy Dolls">Toy Dolls</a>, released the album <i>Wakey Wakey</i>, featuring a song entitled "Cloughy is a Bootboy!", which describes an altercation between a fan and the resulting court case.</p>

<p>Clough was a committed <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a>, often appearing on miners' picket lines and being a sponsor of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti_Nazi_League_37b5.html" title="Anti Nazi League">Anti Nazi League</a>. <a href="http://whenwetouchedthesky.com/anl_arts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://whenwetouchedthesky.com/anl_arts.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> He also was a homophobe, who gave <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Fashanu_e86e.html" title="Justin Fashanu">Justin Fashanu</a> a dressing down for visiting gay bars.</p>

<p>In June 2005 the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham_Playhouse_dc0c.html" title="Nottingham Playhouse">Nottingham Playhouse</a> premiered a play called <i>Old Big 'Ead in The Spirit of the Man</i>, by the Nottingham-born playwright <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Lowe_4d0c.html" title="Stephen Lowe">Stephen Lowe</a>, in which Brian Clough "takes to the stage.. quite literally!", portrayed by actor <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Tarrant_1aee.html" title="Colin Tarrant">Colin Tarrant</a>. In August 2005 the stretch of the A52 linking Nottingham and Derby was renamed Brian Clough Way. His widow Barbara expressed her gratitude to Nottingham City Council, saying: "Brian would have been amazed but genuinely appreciative."</p>
<p>In 2000, composer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Steadman_9c22.html" title="Robert Steadman">Robert Steadman</a> wrote a song called <b>Brian Clough's CV</b> as part of his <i>Nottingham Songbook</i> which was premiered in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Dome_963d.html" title="Millennium Dome">Millennium Dome</a>.</p>
<p>The acclaimed writer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Peace_f735.html" title="David Peace">David Peace</a>'s 2006 novel "The Damned Utd." is a fictionalized account of Clough's 44 days as manager of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_United_0d88.html" title="Leeds United">Leeds United</a>, written from the perspective of Clough himself.</p>

<p>After a long process of money-raising, the town of Middlesbrough commissioned a statue of Clough, to be unveiled on his birthday, March 21, 2007. Although there was a movement to erect a statue in Grove Hill, his birthplace, the site chosen was Albert Park, Middlesbrough through which he usually walked on his way from home to <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayresome_Park_0b00.html" title="Ayresome Park">Ayresome Park</a>, the old stadium. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
