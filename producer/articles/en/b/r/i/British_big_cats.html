<p>Many stories have arisen over the years to explain how such animals could be living in the British countryside. Some are considered to be more credible than others, and some receive much more publicity than others. These are the major theories so far put forward:</p>

<p>This story could be possible if the cats were feral offspring of domestic cats and either <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_cat.html" title="Wild cat">wild cat</a> or a small exotic cat such as a <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_cat.html" title="Jungle cat">jungle cat</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caracal.html" title="Caracal">caracal</a>. The <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellas_Cat_1b05.html" title="Kellas Cat">Kellas Cat</a> of Scotland is an example of this. It has been suggested that the cats are hybrids of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cougar.html" title="Cougar">cougars</a> and leopards. These animals have been produced, and are known as a <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumapard.html" title="Pumapard">pumapard</a>, but they are prone to dwarfism. No pumapards survived to breed. Although female hybrid big cats are fertile, males are sterile and a breeding population would be next to impossible.</p>

There is an argument to <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reintroduction.html" title="Reintroduction">reintroduce</a> the Eurasian lynx to Scotland.</li>

<li>The cats could have escaped during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> when it was easy to keep dangerous animals without breaking the law of the time.</li>

Many owners did not want to have their animals put down or taken away, so they released them in remote locations where they established feral populations. This is probably the most likely explanation, and is the most often heard. The British Big Cat Society claims to have evidence of at least 23 releases of big cats in Britain.</li>

<p>The first regular sightings of big cats in Britain were in the 1960s, and since then they have been gradually increasing over the past 40 years to the present. In fact sightings go back some considerable time The oldest report <a href="http://www.bigcats.org/abc/sightings/1926/inverness5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bigcats.org/abc/sightings/1926/inverness5.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> was found by David Walker and is a has a report from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> in 1827 of a "lynx" being seen.</p>

<p>As much evidence that has been put forward over the years, very little has actually proven the existence of the cats. Many of the pictures that are taken are either taken from such a distance it is impossible to make out "the beast" or the picture is of poor quality. A few examples of hoaxes have also been exposed.</p>

<li>"Felicity the puma" was captured by farmer Ted Noble at Cannich, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness-shire.html" title="Inverness-shire">Inverness-shire</a>, Scotland in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. Her capture followed a string of sightings from the area, and they continued after her capture. She lived out her days as a tourist attraction at the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_Wildlife_Park_820c.html" title="Highland Wildlife Park">Highland Wildlife Park</a>, Kinguisse. There remains some controversy over whether she had ever been "wild" for any period of time. After her death she was stuffed and mounted and is now on display in the Inverness Museum, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_council_area.html" title="Highland council area">Highland</a>.</li>

It is currently being examined. It follows many reports of cats in the area (<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_of_Exmoor_aea6.html" title="Beast of Exmoor">Beast of Exmoor</a>), and even a report of a farmer shooting and later burying a puma.</li>

It had killed around 15 sheep within two weeks. The story was only reported in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, and the lynx is apparently owned by taxidermy collector in <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk.html" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>. For many years the cat was considered to have been a hoax, particularly by the hunting community. But in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> a police report confirmed that the case was true. It was probably an escapee from a facility in the area that bred animals including Eurasian lynxes.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4830320.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4830320.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Between April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and July 2005 there were five reported attacks on horses and 37 incidents regarding sheep kills.</li>

<li>Livestock kills have been noted in many counties, but they are centred in Devon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In January 2004 a farmer with pastures in Stoke St Michael near <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepton_Mallet_ecbc.html" title="Shepton Mallet">Shepton Mallet</a>, Somerset, reported that he had lost four ewes to predatory animal attacks but what was more surprising was a fatal attack on a six-month-old <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_Angus_3c4e.html" title="Aberdeen Angus">Aberdeen Angus</a> calf that weighed more than twice the weight of an average adult human. The bodies of the animals had large puncture marks around their throats and heads and in some, their stomachs had also been eaten. He described how these attacks had affected the behaviour of his remaining livestock, with animals that were fairly friendly before becoming nervous and almost aggressive after the incident.</li>

<p>It is impossible to establish how many people have seen big cats in this country, as many go unreported.</p>
<p>Upon seeing a big cat, it should be reported immediately to the land owner and the local police, although there is no legal requirement to report it to anybody. A number of organisations exist that monitor these animals, these vary in size from one individual to a group with 40+ members. Most will happily share their data with other workers in the area if they don't have a local worker. If reporting your sighting to a group, particularly if you want advice, confirm that they have a local member that you can contact - it saves time with describing the geography of the area, etc. Sightings can be reported via many of the websites below.</p>
<p>At present the only county in England where no sightings have been reported is Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>The "top ten" counties or regions of Great Britain between April 2004 and July 2005 were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many paw prints have been photographed over the years - some have even been taken as a plaster cast. However, some people have found tracks thinking they are of big cats to find they are of other animals, such as dogs, foxes, badgers, and in one case even rabbits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In March 2006, Warwickshire Museum put a cast of a huge paw print on display. The cast was taken by a farmer from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barford.html" title="Barford">Barford</a> in November 2004 and donated to the museum. The farm's <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamekeeper.html" title="Gamekeeper">gamekeeper</a> had watched what he believed to be a large black Leopard, hunt and catch a pheasant and noticed the fresh print in the mud. The print can still be viewed at <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> Museum, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Golfers using a course near <a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewdley.html" title="Bewdley">Bewdley</a>, near <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidderminster.html" title="Kidderminster">Kidderminster</a> in Worcestershire have grown used to finding large paw marks in the bunkers. They claim that the marks appear every two or three weeks and have been a regular occurrence for several years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During heavy snowfall in <a href="../../../d/r/o/Droitwich.html" title="Droitwich">Droitwich</a> in Worcestershire in the winter of 2002-3, a woman living on the Chawson estate reported seeing a large, black cat in her garden, followed by the discovery of large paw prints. This story differs from other big cat reports in that it takes place in the middle of a residential area rather than a rural area. The countryside around Droitwich is thought to be home to a population of big cats, and a local farmer has even purchased two <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llamas.html" title="Llamas">llamas</a> to protect his sheep.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Large paw prints were found near to <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a> in 2005, which prompted the local paper 'The Examiner' to offer a £500 reward for photographic images of the animal that made them. The cash is yet to be claimed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>February 2006 saw Police claim that they had found the first conclusive proof a Scottish big cat that had been dubbed the "Beast of Balbirnie" after sightings of it in <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fife.html" title="Fife">Fife</a>. Officers took a plaster cast of a paw print which was later verified by experts as that of an 18-month-old exotic large cat, most likely the print of a black leopard's paw. After several sightings at once on the Balbirnie Estate near <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenrothes.html" title="Glenrothes">Glenrothes</a> the police investigated and discovered the print. Experts could not be species-specific due to a lack of specific clarity in the heel pad but believed that judging by the size of the print, the animal was around 18 months old.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_big_cats.html" title="Edit section: Confusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Confusion</span></h3>
<p>One problem regarding sightings of big cats is the fact that people "see what they want to see" - for example people living on <a href="../../../e/x/m/Exmoor.html" title="Exmoor">Exmoor</a> may glance an animal, not fully focus on it, and "think" that they have seen "one of those big cats". Also a surprising amount of people have actually confused domestic cats with the "real thing". Also, animals such as dogs, badgers and foxes should be dismissed before reporting a sighting. New breeds of domestic cat where genes from other species have been introduced into them are sometimes bigger than ordinary domestics and have caused big cat scares in a number of areas. A Bengal cat (a domestic with spots containing leopard cat genes), was shot in Lancashire by a game keeper when it attacked pheasants.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_of_Exmoor_aea6.html" title="Beast of Exmoor">Beast of Exmoor</a> story first came about, many people thought it may have been a dog. This may have been the case to a certain extent, as dogs are perfectly capable of killing sheep and do so on a regular basis. Generally dogs will harass the whole flock of sheep, whilst cats will single out a sheep and kill it with injuries to the neck. Cats will also generally eat most of the carcass whilst dogs will kill for the sake of it. Cats may drag the body to a special "hiding place" or even store it in a tree. Feral dogs and dogs used for poaching make this more confused, and sheep that die naturally may be scavenged by foxes, buzzards and other animals to make it look as though the sheep has been killed by a predator.</p>

Sometimes they are named by the area where they are sighted followed by the species, e.g. the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey_Puma_fbab.html" title="Surrey Puma">Surrey Puma</a> or the Wrangaton Lion.</p>
<p>"The Beast of" is the most common name given followed by the location.</p>

<p>To date, very few people have been attacked, and none of the attacks were fatal, nor were they proved in any way. This is a serious matter that will have to be taken into consideration if the population of cats increases.</p>
<p>One recent alleged "attack" is the story of how during January 2002 a man from <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravesend.html" title="Gravesend">Gravesend</a>, Kent, claimed that his hand was scratched by a Eurasian lynx after approaching it in order to rescue a pet rabbit from its jaws. His original thought was that the animal was a fox, but as he got nearer he claimed it was actually a lynx. The victim suffered a three parallel lacerations to the back of the hand. However, the wounds did not appear to be typical of a lynx attack <a href="http://www.bigcats.org/abc/photoalbum/lynxattack.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bigcats.org/abc/photoalbum/lynxattack.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, and lynx are not known to spontaneously attack humans.</p>
