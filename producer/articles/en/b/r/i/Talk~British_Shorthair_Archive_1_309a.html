<p>I changed the intellecutually vandalized image back to Happycat because I believe that Happycat represents the species better as a whole. Also, Happycat is not copywritten or trademarked.

<dd>Yeah, I already know about the Fair Use criteria, but there's many problems with people's view of the term "free". YTMND deals more with pop culture than animal species, so their views on things are different. I know of at least two articles which have a similar edit war. I've already noted the problem above. Even when it comes to celebs, the commons may have an outdated half-decade old pic, but people still want to put a fair use pic that was taken 6 weeks/months ago. Unfortuently, WIKIPEDIA DOESN'T OWN IT! NOR DOES IT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL IT IF THEY WANTED TO. Having it on here, then having the Wikimedia foundation sell a hardcopy of Wikipedia with the Happycat image would be as bad as <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBaumsworld_788a.html" title="EBaumsworld">eBaum</a>. People making money off other people's work without royalties or credit, isn't that what YTMND DOESN'T WANT? My best advice in that case is for people to take their own pictures, or get permission from the original copyright owner to release it under GFDL or Creative Commons. If British Shorthairs are so known for their smiles, how hard is it to take a pic that at least resembles Happycat? Either that or go to <a href="http://www.happycat.ru" class="external free" title="http://www.happycat.ru" rel="nofollow">http://www.happycat.ru</a> and ask them for permission. There's a reason why we have copyright policies. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 05:16, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What makes me laugh is the combination of YTMND's hysterical overreaction to eBaumers uploading "their" stuff, and the conspucuous use of copyright music and images in the preparation of individual YTMNDs. One YTMNDer justfied this to me as "fair use parody", but the parody clause only allows you to parody <i>the copyrighted work</i>, it doesn't cover using the copyrighted work in parodying some other work or concept. If the copyright lawyers ever get onto YTMND they are going to have a field day. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. Companies won't seek legal action against resonably fair parodies, becuase it would tarnish thier image far more so than the parody itself. Television farce shows show technically copyrighted images all the time. Happy Cat appears to feels fine with thier mascot's use on ytmnd.com, where it is portrayed in a positive light and wokrs as a sort of advertisment, HappyCat may not feel the same way about it's image being used for an encyclopedia, without direct credit, which articles do not have room for. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.157.54.23 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.157.54.23_ab9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.157.54.23">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Debate Analysis as of 03:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</span></h3>
<p><b>From the Anti-NEDM PoV:</b> Here's what I see so far, and YTMND has the right to add to this. I see two users (ironically both from YTMND) and two wikipedia administrators stating along the lines of "Transient fads on YTMND are of little if any interest to anybody outside the YTMND community." YTMND is stating NEDM should be included because it is a popular internet meme. As proven by an image search on google (happycat site:www.happycat.ru), the happycat image is copyrighted by "Гранд-Альфа" of Russia, and not the exclusive property of SomethingAwful or YTMND. Although it doesn't appear to be the consensus of the opposition to YTMND, I would propose a few solutions (select only one<b>(1)</b>):</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Anti-NEDM members withdraw their complaint and allow Happycat on the article.</li>
<li>2. The YTMND members withdraw their complaint and leave the article it is current condition. YTMND should also agree not to further vandalize the page.</li>
<li>3. Request mediation from the Mediation Committee</li>
<li>4. I would probably permit the following sentence on the article: "The British Shorthair is also the breed of a prominent internet meme, known as Happycat, derived from a picture off a russian cat food manufacturer's website." The sentence will not recognize either SomethingAwful or YTMND, and will not make notice of NEDM at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has gone on long enough. Let's settle this soon, because nothing justifies torturing this article. Not Even Doom Music. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETargetter_27f5.html" title="User:Targetter">Targetter</a> 03:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>YOU just made the reference right there in your last sentence! It's a split vote. I say choice #2, with mention of YTMND and Something Awful.

<p>Whatever,as long as it's keeping wikipedias policy,it's fine. Oh,if Xioyux and Geni are nominated for admins,they get my vote for clearing this whole thing up,since the beggining.

<p>I can't believe this. I'm offering a compromise and this is the kinda crap arguements I get in return? My reference to NEDM in my last sentence was a joke. You know, Irony? Ha ha? lol? Snake Liquid, could I see a source from SomethingAwful proving either they bought the rights or they asked for permission? It might make a difference. 72.50.20.55, Xioyux and Geni have been supporting me the whole way through this thing.

<p>YTMND is not a unitary actor, so solutions proposing collective action on the part of YTMND are unlikely to gain any traction. This is clearly not a content dispute, and should be handled as simple forumcruft vandalism.

<dd>I like option 4. I say add that sentence and then create a new page labeled Happycat and link the sentence to there. Then people can write all they want about the fad where it would actually belong. I'm sure it will get marked for deletion, but so was O rly and that page survived. --<a href="../../../a/f/i/User%7EAFink_f2b2.html" title="User:AFink">AFink</a> 06:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet if you read the O Rly deletion debates almost no one said "I thought we should delete this until I saw a newspaper article about it. That magically legitimizes the entire thing. The consensus was to keep the article because O Rly was a popular internet meme. Anyway, my point was I'm against mentioning NEDM in this article. I just think happycat should get a brief mentioning due to the image's popularity. If people want to debate adding NEDM and uploading the image then let them do it under a happycat article. --<a href="../../../a/f/i/User%7EAFink_f2b2.html" title="User:AFink">AFink</a> 18:05, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reactions about these proposals.</dd>
<dd>Why can't we have both on the article? Keep the PD one as the main, and put happycat further down. I've seen other articles use both Free and Fair use images on articles.</dd>
<dd>In order for it to be Fair use, the image needs to relate to the context; that's where describing the meme comes in. In order for #1 to happen, #4 needs to as well. But the meme is only a fad in YTMND. You can't find it in a google test with "-YTMND". Sadly, it doesn't belong. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 07:58, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair use of the Happycat image would only apply for an article commenting on <i>Happy Cat</i> cat food or their advertising. Using their image to illustrate a breed of cat — or to illustrate the NEDM internet meme — would not be an appropriate use of the image. Please review <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> for more details. Additionally, Happycat is not even a verifiable example of a British Shorthair, and the photo is of poor quality compared to the existing image.</dd>
<dd>Again, I must emphasize that "YTMND" is not a unitary actor, nor can "YTMNDers" be considered to act unitarily. The fad turnover at YTMND is fairly short, and the vandalism to this article will most likely not continue much longer. To compromise the integrity of the article to resolve a pattern of vandalism would be an inappropriate decision. Semi-protection (or full protection) and action against individual vandals are the appropriate response. --<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">Ptkfgs</a> 08:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This will and should be forgotten in a few months. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 23:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's just not important enough to be included on Wikipedia. And to others on this talk page (not saying that anyone does have personal issues with YTMND), but this is not the place for you to vent your frustrations.

<p>Is there any attention in reliable published sources for "NEDM/Happycat"? If so, then I definitely agree that it belongs in the <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> article. Next, only after it shows up in cat fanciers' publications has it achieved notability vis-a-vis the <i>breed</i>. Hope this helps. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 04:34, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we should use the German article's cat.

<dd>I'm not so sure. I think the en photo is a better photo, and the cat books I have say that the blue self is pretty much the prototypical British Shorthair. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 02:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The blue is the most common colour for British. I have been to a few breeders, and I can't remember ever seeing white, though tabby and ginger are pretty common (still less common than blue). I will dig up a larger photo, and upload it. Don't know why I uploaded one so small, must have been on dial-up. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 05:17, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think there should be a major talk about Happycat in this article, but I think it should be mentioned that Happycat is a British Shorthair, other than that, nothing else should be said. The town I live in has less than 4,000 people in it and it's an article on Wikipedia. Since there are so many people loving Happycat, why not just say simply "The infamous Happycat from <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> is a famous British Shorthair". And that's it.</dd>

<dd>What? If they resort to vandalism, then we should not give them what they want to stop. They are too immature to persist with this, and they will eventually give up. We can talk, and try an reach concensus, but there has been no good argument to include this. As for the argument about it being valid because a town of 4000 people has an article. That town of 4000 people has had a history which has involved thousands, if not millions, of people. There is a large number of people which would find that article useful. This stupid affair is about a <i>joke</i> which entertained a few thousand people in 2006! Is there one article on a similar joke during 342BCE? --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 07:30, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except ... it's <i>not even a British Shorthair</i>.

<dd>Happycat isn't a British Shorthair? What breed is it then? (serious question, I don't have any real opinions on this article re: YTMNDification or not. Although I do agree with The Jazz Musician about what harm can a single sentence do in the Famous British Shorthairs section. IF it is indeed a British Shorthair, of course) --Loccy 11:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By that token, do we have a reference that categorically states the Whiskas cat is a British shorthair? In any case, do Whiskas have a single specific cat these days? --194.128.66.118 16:07, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to say I think it's a shame so much energy has been spent on this page yet almost none of it has been put into anything besides adding and reverting the words NEDM and happycat.
