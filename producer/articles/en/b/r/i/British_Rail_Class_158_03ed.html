<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_158_03ed.html" title="Edit section: Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description</span></h2>
<p>A total of 182 units were built, numbered 158701-872 and 158901-910. The majority of units were built as two-car sets, with individual carriages numbered 52701-872/901-910 and 57701-872/901-910. Seventeen units (nos. 158798-814) were built as three-car units, with the centre carriages numbered 58701-717. The final ten units (nos. 158901-910) were built specifically for the <i>West Yorkshire PTE</i>-sponsored services around <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>.</p>
<p>There were three varieties of unit when built. The standard batch, two and three car units from 158701 to 158840 and 158901 to 158910 had 350 hp Cummins engines. The next batch, 158841 to 158860 were built as non-standard to enable 350 hp Perkins engines to be fitted to maintain Perkin's interest in train manufacture. The final batch, 158863 to 158872 were given higher power Cummins engines, 400 hp, as it was originally intended that these units work the steeply graded <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport.html" title="Newport">Newport</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Marches_Line_e863.html" title="Welsh Marches Line">Welsh Marches Line</a>. Another 22 of these high power units were built, and became <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_159_c402.html" title="British Rail Class 159">Class 159</a>. Nowadays, however, the units have become mixed up as franchises changed and higher and lower power units can be seen working the same diagrams.</p>
<p>The Class 158 is not based on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Mark_4_e19c.html" title="British Rail Mark 4">Mark 4</a> bodyshell design, although the latter was developed at roughly the same time. The similar sloping sides of the coaches may have given rise to this mistaken notion.</p>
<p>When first introduced, the Class 158s, being lighter than other similar units, had traction problems on steeply graded routes, particularly during the autumn, giving rise to the apochryphal "leaves on the line" media stories. For this reason two car units were formed using one car from a class 158 and another from a class 156 sprinter unit.</p>

<p>There is currently an ongoing fleet shuffle with many units being swapped between operators,</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../a/r/r/Arriva_Trains_Wales_8372.html" title="Arriva Trains Wales">Arriva Trains Wales</a></b> (ATW) is the new name for the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales_and_Borders_4bb9.html" title="Wales and Borders">Wales and Borders</a> franchise. Wales and Borders (and their predecessor, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales_and_West_f69e.html" title="Wales and West">Wales and West</a>) had originally operated a large fleet of units (nos. 158815-842/863-872) on long-distance services, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penzance.html" title="Penzance">Penzance</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo_station.html" title="Waterloo station">London Waterloo</a>, but some of these units were subsequently transferred to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex_Trains_f922.html" title="Wessex Trains">Wessex Trains</a>.</p>
<p>The fleet was increased with the addition of 12 units (nos. 158843-854) when <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrian_Line_3887.html" title="Cambrian Line">Cambrian Line</a> services were transferred from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Trains_8abd.html" title="Central Trains">Central Trains</a> in 2003; by the end of 2006 these units were returned to the leasing company as Arriva transferred various 158-worked services to other rolling stock.</p>
<p>Most of the Arriva fleet was refurbished while in use by Wales and West prior to 2001 and repainted in new blue and silver livery at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> works. Arriva have since repainted some units in their own turquoise livery, and started to install CCTV inside carriages.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Trains_8abd.html" title="Central Trains">Central Trains</a></b> inherited a large fleet of units, which it used on long distance journeys. These included <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stansted_Airport_ab9c.html" title="Stansted Airport">Stansted Airport</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich.html" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. With the introduction of newer <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_class_170_6c60.html" title="British Rail class 170">Class 170</a> "Turbostars", some units were cascaded onto other routes, such as <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberystwyth.html" title="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> and <a href="../../../p/w/l/Pwllheli.html" title="Pwllheli">Pwllheli</a>. A new <i>Central Trains</i> livery was introduced in 1999 to replace the original <i>Express Regional Railways</i> livery.</p>
<p>In 2003, Central Trains reformed some of its standard 2-car units into 3-car units, numbered 158951-958. These were composed of three driving motor cars, with the innermost cab locked out of use. These units allowed the lengthening of carriages of some of the busiest trains during the summer months.</p>
<p>In late 2004, the three-car units were disbanded and reformed as two-car units. Due to the arrival of 17 <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_170_9d6c.html" title="British Rail Class 170">Class 170/1</a> units from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Mainline_2c94.html" title="Midland Mainline">Midland Mainline</a>, several units were transferred to other operators, leaving Central Trains with just 12 units.</p>
<p>In February 2007, five three-car units transferred from First Transpennine Express which will be joined by 4 more in the next few months. Once in service, these are expected to be used mainly on Central's services between Liverpool and Norwich, and Birmingham and Stansted Airport, being based at Cambridge depot.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Great_Western_5266.html" title="First Great Western">First Great Western</a> inherited the Wessex Trains fleet following the merger of the Great Western and Wessex francises. Some of the fleet have recently been refurbished at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> Works, and was repainted into Wessex Trains's silver and maroon <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphaline.html" title="Alphaline">Alphaline</a> livery. The fleet is used on the long-distance <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>/<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penzance.html" title="Penzance">Penzance</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> to Worcester and Great Malvern services.</p>
<p>In late 2004, Wessex Trains received further units from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Trains_8abd.html" title="Central Trains">Central Trains</a>. This allowed the formation of several 3-car units, which were renumbered into the 158961-968 range. Like the Central Trains three-car sets, they were formed of three driving motors, with the middle cab locked out of use. However these are being disbanded and reformed as two carriage sets following the DfT blocking the transfer of ex TransPennine Express units to Great Western. Following further negotiations with the DfT, FGW will be taking on some of the Transpennine fleet. Unit 158750 arrived in June 2006, with 158762-158765 arriving on the 1st August 2006. All have gained unofficial names based on the female characheters from the BBC Sitcom<a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_of_the_Summer_Wine_e3a0.html" title="Last of the Summer Wine">Last of the Summer Wine</a>. These have since been joined by 158766-158769, 158776 and 158778, and three-car 158798. Two units have joined the fleet from Northern, 158784/790. These are former Central Trains (whose base green livery they still carry) and TransPennine Express (whose vinyls they carry). They are both in need of refurbishment. Meanwhile, 158863 has been transferred to First Scotrail at Haymarket depot. It is rumoured that 158863-872 will eventually be based at Haymarket, FSR require more units within the next few years. Possibly in preparation for this, all the former three driving car sets have now been disbanded. 158961 and 158968 are operating as two car sets with hybrid numbered cars and 158748/9/51/815-7/864-6 are in service as two car sets again. First Great Western is awaiting three further units from TransPennine Express. On arrival of these, 158870-158872 will probably be taken off lease, thus paving the way for the above transfer.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../s/c/o/ScotRail_cf83.html" title="ScotRail">ScotRail</a></b> inherited the largest number of sets, originally having a fleet of 46 units from new in 1989. These were employed on <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> services, as well as services to <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>. From 1998 onwards, units were reliveried in ScotRail Railways livery.</p>
<p>When ScotRail leased new <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_class_170_6c60.html" title="British Rail class 170">Class 170</a> units in 1999, the Class 158 fleet was cascaded onto other routes, such as services to <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurso.html" title="Thurso">Thurso</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wick%2C_Caithness_e927.html" title="Wick, Caithness">Wick</a>. The resultant cascade of older units allowed ScotRail to finally retire its elderly <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_class_101_7f0d.html" title="British Rail class 101">Class 101</a> 'heritage' DMUs and end the lease on the Class 150. Six units were also transferred to other franchises. First Scotrail have begun to repaint the fleet into First's corporate pink and purple livery. 158863 joined the Scotrail fleet on loan from First Great Western on the 9th December 2006. This unit carries standard Wessex Trains "Alphaline" livery</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../t/r/a/TransPennine_Express_2014.html" title="TransPennine Express">TransPennine Express</a></b> was a new franchise created in 2004, it is formed of the express routes previously operated by <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arriva_Trains_Northern_f978.html" title="Arriva Trains Northern">Arriva Trains Northern</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_North_Western_a948.html" title="First North Western">First North Western</a>. The franchise inherited the majority of the Class 158 units from ATN, and has slowly added its new brandname over the top of the existing liveries, with interesting results. The fleet is used on long-distance journeys, such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-upon-Tyne_91d2.html" title="Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Newcastle-upon-Tyne</a> to <a href="../../../y/o/r/York.html" title="York">York</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleethorpes.html" title="Cleethorpes">Cleethorpes</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> services.
