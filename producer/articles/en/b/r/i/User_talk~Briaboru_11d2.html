<p>Hey Briaboru--</p>
<p>I've just discovered this wealth of African Union bio stubs you've been putting up. Nice work, and thanks for putting in the hours! I hope you don't mind my tinkering with a few things here and there (it's the English teacher in me), but I wanted to drop a note and say what a great job I think you're doing by filling these in. Best wishes, and happy editing! --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 04:39, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And by the way--I'm on and off Wikipedia right now as my schoolwork permits, but if there's a good way for me to help you out with any of this, let me know!</dd>

<dd>Well, no doubt some of these could use expansion, but my philosophy has always been that it's better to have a four-line stub up for people to expand than nothing! The most I'd suggest would be to make sure you add a stub tag to them (Africa-bio-stub is probably the best for this), and try to add them to country categories as well so that editors who work by country can notice and expand them. Most countries have a cat like "Malian politicans" that you can add on--and be sure to add the last name first there for alphabetization reasons. (I've just done this over at <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidibe_Korian_Sidibe_0ec6.html" title="Sidibe Korian Sidibe">Sidibe Korian Sidibe</a> if you want to see what I mean) I think the key is just to get it to where other folks can see it and build--after all, isn't the whole fun of wiki making someone else do your work? =)</dd>

<dd>I just thought of something else that I forgot. You may want to start adding links to whatever databases you're using to create these stubs. Just a brief header "External links" and then the link to the database would be helpful; that way when the next editor comes along she knows where the information so far has come from. Have a good one, and keep on keepin' on, --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 02:53, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Briaboru,</p>
<p>Again, nice work on all these new stubs--I can tell you're working your butt off for them. One thing you'll want to be careful of, though, since you're making them in such numbers, is to make sure you get the category tags right. To make sure they get alphabetized properly in say, "Tunisian politicians," it's important to add the name to the tag in the form Last Name, First Name. For example, <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyce_Nondwe_Kanyago_0ea8.html" title="Joyce Nondwe Kanyago">Joyce Nondwe Kanyago</a> needs to go in as "Kanyago, Joyce Nondwe" (see my edit to her article if you're still not sure what I mean). And don't forget to use the most specific category only--for example, "Tunisian politicians" is a subcategory of "Tunisian people," so you don't want to use both.</p>
<p>Does all this make sense? Let me know if you have any questions. I wish I had time to help you out with more of these but I won't really have the free time for a while--still, I wish you the best of luck! Keep up the good work! --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 23:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, remember that it's better to put up, say, eight properly labelled articles than ten improperly labelled ones--I realize the alphabetization is a few moments of extra work per article, but it's important to keep things sorted, too. Otherwise, other editors have to follow behind you doing it, and it gets a bit frustrating.</dd>

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request.

<p>I wanted to thank you for raising the Justice McMorrow thing to my attention. (I suppose in the interest of protocol, it's still appropriate to refer to her as Chief Justice McMorrow, but that's for another day.) I wouldn't have gotten her listed as a previous Chief Justice for quite some time, as I haven't advanced past the D's yet in the court's big list of all past justices. It's weird that they haven't gotten Thomas's biography updated, but I couldn't imagine they'd have left the wrong person as C.J. for almost four years. Yay, press release archives!</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you have been editing several Eritrea related articles recently. This is great because, as someone who is constantly adding info on African people and places, I know how little their really is out there.

<p>Hi again! An article can't consist only of an external link; that's why I deleted it. You should add some text before it gets clobbered again. If it does get deleted again, just recreate it with a reasonable amount of text. See ya! - Lucky 6.9 01:13, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your contributions are really welcomed, but they need to be much longer than just an introductory sentence or declarative statement. They can't ever be solely an external link.

<dd>If you are going to simply delete my work from an article, I'd appriciate it if you would discuss the issue first. Simply renaming the article to suit your purposes and then deleting the content with out discussing it first is rude and unprofessional. I brought the issue up on the article's talk page several days ago, without comment. I added the (in my opinion) perfectly valid and verifiable content to the article. You disagree with it's inclusion. Fine. That does not give you the right to act unilaterally. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGentgeen_2e43.html" title="User:Gentgeen">Gentgeen</a> 03:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop creating Region I of the NAIA (and any <i>Region * of the NAIA</i> articles as well) unless you can explain in the article just <i>what</i> the NAIA is. Right now there is absolutely no context to the lists of universities you have created, and they are liable to be deleted unless you expand them immediately.

<p>I'd like to ask you to alter how you are editing the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_Catholic_bishops_of_the_United_States_2513.html" title="List of the Catholic bishops of the United States">List of the Catholic bishops of the United States</a> page.</p>
<p>For example, in one edit you replaced this:</p>
<p>*[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archbishop of Dubuque]]</p>
<p>with this:</p>
<p>*[[Jerome Hanus]]</p>
<p>I think it would be more useful if you were to, instead, replace it with this:</p>
<p>*[[Jerome Hanus]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archbishop of Dubuque]]</p>
<p>That way, no information is lost. Also, the page is easier to maintain, because if Bishop retires, his line on the list just becomes false, but if his diocese is mentioned then people can still follow the link there.</p>
