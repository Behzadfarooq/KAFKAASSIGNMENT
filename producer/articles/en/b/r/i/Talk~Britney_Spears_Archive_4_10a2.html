<p>[sex ] Recently, reports from various newspapers (including the Sydney Morning Herald and The Sun) indicate Federline is threatening to release a Britney Spears sex tape in the wake of the couple's very public divorce.</p>
<p>According to the reports, Federline is recieving offers ranging up to $65 million for the 4 hour tape. K-Fed's publicist's denied charged sex tape rumors. So did B-ritts.</p>

<dd>I've taken the sentence out. It doesn't say what her role is (for example, it could be "Spears' role <b>as a diva</b> in pop music has been..."). If the role isn't defined, it can't be disputed.

<p>"inspiring several fashion crazes and fads, such as the use of low-rise jeans[39][40] lower back tattoos, navel piercings,[41] and the whale tail [42] among young women." -- Weren't these already popular before Britney? Surely she may have added some popularity to these things, but she hardly "inspired" them.</p>
<p><br />
She brought alot of those fads back, I think the biggest fad that she started was the belly shirt or cropped T-shirt because they became very very popular when she started wearing the in the early 90's. -- aye, popular in her grade school, I'm sure. She would have been 10-14 in the early 90's...</p>
<p>There is a mistake as this article makes reference to Britney as a Grammy Award Winning Artist and she's never won any GRAMMY!!!</p>
<p>she won a grammy for "toxic" - best dance recording 2005</p>
<p>The only way Britney Spears would ever win a Grammy was if she stripped on stage and ran around singing Jingle Bells, and even then she probably wouldn't.</p>
<p>Britney Spears does, in fact, have a Grammy. I can't particularly stand her, but it's true that she won for "Toxic" (you just know these things if you work in entertainment).</p>

<p>This is some unsourced material I'll put here in case I can find a source, or someone else can</p>
<p>""I believe that you marry in your heart and that means much more than a piece of paper. If I don't feel it there, than nothing else matters. You can write anything down on paper, but the real truth is love." Originally, Spears refused to have a prenuptial agreement, but her manager, Larry Rudolph, and her family insisted she do so and she subsequently fired Rudolph after the wedding."</p>
<p>I had seen on E! True Hollwyood Story: Britney and Kevin, that Britney mutually agreed with Larry Rudolph on firing him. I didn't see anything about prenutpial, I am unsure of that. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 14:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have moved alot of content into her bio, alot of the things from controversy I merged it into the appropriate sections since other of her controversial issues could be find there. I also moved someo of the facts from "Career Achievements" into the bio, I deleted that section. I also deleted the "politics" and "religioin" sections, and moved the content into appropriate areas since they were only small parapgraphs and seemed more controversial rather than something personal. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 15:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's something I have noticed lately.

<p>Someone has violated the page of "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" again. He or she removes the single cover and adds a crappy picture of an object. This person needs to be stopped. Also on the ...Baby One More Time (song) page that is the international album cover not the single cover.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for that, I changed the picture, though I don't think it was vandalism, someone probably uploaded a photo and named it "Broken" which replaced the single picture. Bad move in the uploaders part. Also, I believe that was the cover of ...BOMT for the US as well, but I'm not sure, I went to Amazon.com and most of the covers were imports, do you know what cover is the US one? Just put a link and I'll upload it. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 04:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"In August 2006, a rather peculiar video[2] of Britney began circulating the internet."</p>
<p>The original source of the so-called "Youtube" video is seldom mentioned in any of the articles that have been written about it. Several of these pieces have claimed that the video was "leaked to the internet". In fact, the video was officially released by Spears herself in September 2005 as part of the "bonus footage" on her "Chaotic" DVD.71.203.30.14 22:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

[24] On August 20, 2006, Spears introduced her husband, Kevin Federline, at the Teen Choice Awards. This was her first appearance at an awards show in almost two years. Britney will also release a new fragrance in late fall or early winter; it will be her fourth fragrance in all. Britney and her husband Kevin Federline also appeared via satellite at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards that were held in New York to present the award for Best R&amp;B Video. They performed a quick skit kicking back at what the media portray them as, even as far as pretending to misplace their child. This however was not seen to be in good humour, as the UK's Daily Mirror commented on September 2 that their joke went down like a lead balloon. In fact, in subsesquent replays of the VMA's on MTV, the skit is completely edited out and goes right from Jack Black introducing Spears and Federline to them announcing the nominees.</i></p>

<p>The date is important because of her legal wedding date - the pre-nup said Federline is entitled to more money for each year they are married. The date she filed for divorce is just less than 30 days after her wedding anniversary. If she had divorced him the next day, legally they would have been married for another year, and Federline would have been entitled to more money.</p>

<p>Well, silly me, I added a paragraph about it without coming here first. I also left out exactly what O'Reilly and many others are speculating specifically, namely that she's desparately crying for attention, and obviously is getting some. It's not just this, though; it's just the latest in a series of oddities, and the usual hand-wringing over whether this will be a bad influence on young teens (who are as apt to say "Yuch!" as anything, I betcha). One thing for sure, though: Britney has now become a "lobbyist". &gt;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:35, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't see how it isn't worth some mention. If you're going to biography her divorce and ensuing fall out - then going out on the lash with some of the most well known female drinkers deserves a mention, as does flashing your bits. Given only a few weeks ago she was fighting a case based on an alleged sex vid where the Judge actually judged against her based on the fact she sells her sexuality - this is probably the biggest pat on the back the judge could get. As for the depth. Meh. It's inconsequential, just like nipple slips and such. However something along the lines of "generated a lot of interest in the media after being caught 'commando' on nights out with Paris Hilton and L.Lohan" then a cite.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKoncorde_5338.html" title="User:Koncorde">Koncorde</a> 14:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it was only a one-time thing, like the occasional falling-out-of-one's-top, it might not be worth covering (pardon the ironic metaphor). But it seems she has been caught <i>several</i> times recently, which suggests that she's either doing it purposefully or doesn't care, and either answer possibly suggests that she's lost her marbles. Or maybe it's trauma connected with turning 25?

<dd>Don't go lecturing me about breaking the "spirit" of the rule, as if I were playing the "keep it to 3" game, when in fact I wasn't watching the clock at all, so it wasn't intentional, either.

This time. And don't try to argue this recent thing wasn't intentional. She was sitting there in the car with her skirt hiked way up. I'm guessing you haven't seen the photos. She either did it on purpose or was drunk-as-a-skunk and didn't really care. Either way, it's part of a "meltdown" pattern that has been building up over time.

<dd>At this point, I think it is unlikely that you are going to agree with any citations. O'Reilly fancies himself a "Culture Warrior" and an expert, of sorts, on this topic, presumably as a result of many, many observations which he has captured in yet another book (in addition to the TV show, the radio show, and the newspaper column - the old boy must never sleep). And I still think you're obsessed with this one particular issue. All I did was report the facts. If I had any extra spin, I took that away, but that's still not enough to satisfy whatever your issue is with this. That this <i>happened</i>, and garnered a good deal of publicity, is undeniable, cited fact. She can't sue us for reporting what actually happened. And it is not necessary to overtly say anything about a pattern. Listing the events of the last few months <i>might</i> suggest a pattern, to the reader who chooses to put that spin on it.

<dd>Kirk does seem obsessed with this and doesn't seem to understand the various points different users have made, that 1) Many credible news sources thought it was important enough to give it mention, one even two or more articles 2) It was a pattern 3) It's all been part of her post-divorce, as well as the notable friendship with Paris Hilton. As lude as it was, it's now an important part in Spears' personal life as well as career and is no longer just "tabloid" rubbish and should be part of the article, maybe it wasn't as notable for Lindsay Lohan, but the past week has proven it is for Britney. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 05:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

The satisfaction of encyclopedic policy is paramount, not our opinions; granted, it <b>is</b> my assessment of whether <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is being met, but it's a powerful assessment based on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and ad hominem arguments over that with which I may or may not be "obsessed" do not even attempt to address the issue: why should this be in the article (as opposed, as noted by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a>, to a fanzine). The validity of this sort of potentially damaging data is the crux of what an encyclopedia is all about, and why we must err on the side of caution. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 06:00, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to agree with Wahkeenah, Myrockstar, Jim Douglas etc.. This information has to be included... It was a series of events well reported by the mainstream press, that were related to a subject in Wikipedia, and its inclusion seems to meet all policies and guidelines.Unless someone can come up with some exceptional reason for its exclusion, it goes in.</p>
<p>Any user's moral objection to these occurrences or the reporting of them should not be the deciding factor unless there is a relevant guideline or policy.

<p>The information is clearly notable, beyond any reasonable doubt, and therefore it must go in the article.

The sics can easily be omitted, as quoted text is already known to be from another source.

<p>"Photos published on February 7, 2006, showed Spears driving her SUV on the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles with her infant son, Sean, perched on her lap rather than strapped into a car seat in the back. The photos show Spears holding the wheel of the car with one hand, and her 4-month-old baby with the other. In a statement to People, Spears said she did it because of a "horrifying, frightful encounter with the paparazzi" and that "I was terrified that this time the physically aggressive paparazzi would put both me and my baby in danger. I instinctively took measures to get my baby and me out of harm’s way, but the paparazzi continued to stalk us. I love my child and would do anything to protect him." She later told Access Hollywood, "It's kind of like I made a mistake and so it is what is, I guess." No charges were pressed. Later that month, U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, speaking at an event at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to mark the start of Child Passenger Safety Week said, "Recent photos of Britney Spears driving with her infant son on her lap are troubling...and while Ms. Spears has acknowledged her mistake, her actions still send the wrong message to millions of her fans."</p>
<p>On April 1, 2006, Spears' 7-month-old son fell and bruised his head after slipping from his nanny's arms as she was lifting him from his high chair and "something snapped in the chair." After an initial examination, he was thought to be fine but six days later Spears and her husband took him to the Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center for a second checkup. He got the all clear once again. This is the third incident so far. Following this visit, child welfare officials, as well as a sheriff's deputy, visited the Spears home. "While there was an automatic report by the hospital to the Department of Children and Family Services, DCFS immediately responded and determined there was no problem and no reason to open a formal investigation," Spears's attorney Marty Singer told People. "They determined that the parents were not involved in any injury and that nothing improper was done within the home."</p>
<p>On May 14, 2006, Spears was photographed driving in Malibu in her new convertible Mini with her 8-month-old son, Sean, strapped into a forward-facing car seat. It is strongly recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics that infants stay in rear-facing car seats until they are a year old or weigh at least 20 lb. "The seat is facing the wrong way. We like it when the child's head is facing back," said California Highway Patrol spokesman Tom Marshall. "It's far safer if the seat is facing backwards to avoid head-on injuries and whiplash in case of a collision." Since CHP officers did not actually witness Spears driving with Sean facing the wrong way, they would not consider citing her. Spears' rep released a statement saying, "There is no law in California requiring rear-facing car seats. In fact, there are only ten states that require a child to be in a rear-facing car seat, and in two of those states it is not required if the infant is more than 20 lb. Britney's son Sean weighs over 20 lb." Therefore, Britney Spears made absolutley no fault in this instance.</p>
<p>On May 18, 2006, Spears was photographed leaving the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manhattan with a glass in one hand and her 8-month-old son in the other. As Spears walked through the people and paparazzi-crowded street, towards her car, she stumbled and nearly dropped her baby. Sean's head jerked backwards and his hat flew off. Spears managed to regain her balance and prevent the fall with the aid of her bodyguard, who was close by. After retreating to the F.A.O. Schwarz Café, Spears started crying." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/r/User_talk%7EMyrockstar_5cfa.html" title="User talk:Myrockstar">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Myrockstar_bf5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Myrockstar">contribs</a>) 05:16, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>An encyclopedia is not a tabloid; beginning, middle and end of story. This sort of potentially damaging data—and, make no mistake, it is exactly that—requires the demonstration of its effect, or its inclusion is to unduly titillate and nothing more. (<b>Edit</b>: This is particularly true of the first version I saw, in which the encyclopedia essentially used the data to question her fitness as a parent.) Frankly, I don't care if the young woman wants to flash her snatch for all the world to see; until and unless the entire cause-and-effect equation is satisfied, they will not see it here.

<dd>The ex-pat thing is probably due to UK tabloid newspaper claims the she was looking to move to the UK. It happens all the time: as soon as a foreigner becomes popular in Britain the papers start printing stories like <i>"(X) looking for house in Britain!"; "(Y) moving to the UK! [insert invented quote]"</i>. They are mostly crap, but sometimes correct (by chance I'm sure). As for the English-American category, I don't see how a living maternal grandmother could be considered a vague connection: it makes her mother half-English with a right to a UK passport for a start. And anyway, this resource is packed full of so-called "Irish-Americans", their only claim (often made on their behalf by Wikipedians seemingly with an agenda) is made on the basis of an Irish relative tracked back five or more generations and ignoring any other nationalities in their heritage - including since the claimed Irish member. Other claims are based on nothing more than surname, rumour and hair/eye colour. Or you get the ridiculous situation we ocassionaly have with Mischa Barton - born in the UK to an English father and Irish mother yet in the past some Wikipedians have insisted she is Irish-American and not English-American and have tried to delete references to the UK. 86.17.211.191 14:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Below is a CNN article about Britney that may be the correct article. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/17/britney.bald.ap/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/17/britney.bald.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../z/i/d/User%7EZidel333_bbc6.html" title="User:Zidel333">Zidel333</a> 22:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Salon Owner</span></h2>
<p>The article implies the salon owner shaved Britney's head. According to CNN, the salon owner refused and Britney herself did the shaving.</p>
<p><br />
I saw a couple things of it on the channel E! today and the people at the salon did refuse to do it so she did it herself. It doesn't make sense that she tried to get them to shave it since she claims that she got it done because she wanted people to stop "touching" her. --Sexecutioner 00:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Here's a recent article from ABC that covers this. It should be added as a citation. <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Health/story?id=2885048&amp;page=1" class="external free" title="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Health/story?id=2885048&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Health/story?id=2885048&amp;page=1</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bald Image</span></h2>
<p>To the editors of this article, please do not add an image of Britney's recent bald photos if they are not free use. Also, consider proposing picture changes here on the talk page.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 01:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This'll be one to watch for developments. It looks like Britney's losing it. The current image is fine though in my opinion.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 19:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the image, I think one of my colleagues has one that was taken at a more recent concert.

<dd>As a matter of fact, I do. I took about a hundred pics at the concert. I'll sift through and find one to use. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBUDSMR_9fa1.html" title="User:BUDSMR">BUDSMR</a> 22:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
