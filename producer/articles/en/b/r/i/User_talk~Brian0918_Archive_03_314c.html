<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for those beautiful snowflake pictures!</p>
<p>It would be nice, for documentary purposes, if you could post the email granting permission to use them. If you get run over by a teacart tomorrow, Wikipedia becomes very hard pressed to claim it's using those by permission... if you're not comfortable posting private email, fair enough.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I just wanted to drop you a note to encourage you in your efforts to locate high quality images for Wikipedia. Quite an explosion of good <a href="../../../f/p/c/WP%7EFPC_af1f.html" title="WP:FPC">WP:FPC</a> candidates appeared over the weekend.</p>
<p>There is a mild problem though (and this isn't signposted enough). There was a decision taken sometime last year to disallow non-free images (apart from FairUse) on Wikipedia. Much of the point of the decision was to encourage people to license images that can easily be reused by forks and mirrors and most particularly print version of Wikipedia that might have to be produced on a commercial basis. The decision was obscurely posted on the Wiki-L mailing list by <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-April/012156.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-April/012156.html" rel="nofollow">Jimbo Wales April 2004</a>.</p>
<p>Without seeing the full email, I suspect that the clearance you've got on the Z-Machine image is a good one and probably qualifies as {{CopyrightedFreeUseProvidedThat}} (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#General_non-free_licenses" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#General_non-free_licenses</a>).</p>
<p>However, the agreement given on the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_picture_candidates_Snowflake_e439.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/Snowflake">Snowflake</a> images seems to be for Wikipedia only. Crazily, whilst this seems like it should be fine, it is actually one of the depricated tags that are liable for deletion (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#General_non-free_licenses" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#General_non-free_licenses</a>). The reason being that licenses limited to Wikipedia only, obstructs reuse downstream. As such I doubt they can qualify for Feature Pictures. So although I'd love to support the snowflake pics, I'm going to have to vote against.</p>
<p>In any case as I say, good work on locating some great images. And I applaud your efforts in clarifying licenses by contacting the copyright owners. Not enough people do this. But try to ensure that they are not 'Wikipedia only' licenses. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 21:56, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What should I specifically ask the snowflake image creator, and others, when asking for licensing? I doubt they'll just release it under GFDL. Should I just ask if it can be used on any encyclopedias or on any Wikimedia content? Would that be enough? The only reason the snowflake licensing is currently restricted to Wikipedia is because that is all I asked him for. I'm sure he'd extend it if I asked. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 22:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Its tricky. I'm pretty sure there is a pro-forma licensing request letter somewhere in the Wikipedia: namespace, although I suspect it is too formal to bear fruit. Possibly the best compromise is to shoot for CC-by-SA, in that it is functionally very similar to GFDL, but is easier for most people to understand and makes it clear that they retain copyright whilst releasing the image for reproduction under a free license and requiring that they are still creditted.</dd>
<dd>The carrot would be to mention that they would be getting much higher exposure for their images and the image page can contain a link back to a web site which may contain additional non-free images. They might also consider releasing a lower res version of an image under CC-by-SA or GFDL whilst retaining higher-res printable version for financial licensing.</dd>
<dd>However it it worth mentioning that there are several people on <a href="../../../f/p/c/WP%7EFPC_af1f.html" title="WP:FPC">WP:FPC</a> who are strongly against accepting lower res versions of pictures for Featured Pictures. I've also faced opposition against CC-by-SA licensing, largely from people who don't understand that GFDL images are still copyright.</dd>
<dd>It might be worth having a word with <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLomax_f1cc.html" title="User:PaulLomax">User:PaulLomax</a> to see what persuaded him to release some of his images under CC-by-SA. I nominated <a href="../../../l/o/n/Image%7ELondon_millenium_wobbly_bridge.jpg_5b04.html" title="Image:London millenium wobbly bridge.jpg">Image:London millenium wobbly bridge.jpg</a> for FP, but it initially had an irregular license. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitude_2d63.html" title="User:Solitude">User:Solitude</a> sent Paul several emails and eventually got him to change the license to CC-by-SA as well as upload a higher quality version of the picture. Paul has a much larger web gallery, but has since added a number of photos to Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 00:35, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Happy to discuss here, because I only have one small screen.

<p>Congrats on the promotion. I was merely asking about the stylistic use of 'See Also'. As an old-time UNIX guy, it was traditional to have lots of SEE ALSO refs in man pages, but I see them very rarely in WikiPedia.</p>
<p>The Battle of Gettysburg has a number of famous sub-battles that could eventually spawn separate pages, but the Army doesn't list them as official battles: LRT, Herbst's Woods, Oak Hill, Peach Orchard, Wheat Field, Cemetery Hill, Culp's Hill, two cavalry battles (east and south), and Pickett's Charge. Two of those, at least, already have pages of their own. A huge battle. Other examples of a single battle that has multiple sub-battles: Antietam, Petersburg, Chattanooga [III]. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 21:21, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would not recommend doing the sub-battle structure you propose. I think we can reach a point where WikiPedia has so many complications like this--boxes and templates and categories--that we'll deter regular guys from wanting to edit anything. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 21:33, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm having trouble interpreting your vote. You said: "Keep unless copyright status is questionable." The trouble is, that's a highly contested question. Some claim that the image is absolutely a copyvio; others claim it's not. Images of the same actor performing the same act have been found on pay-sites. But that exact image has not been found. How should I count your vote? As keep or delete or neither?
