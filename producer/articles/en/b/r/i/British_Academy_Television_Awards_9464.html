<p>The first ever Awards, given in 1954, consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_of_Television_Producers_and_Directors_c43f.html" title="Guild of Television Producers and Directors">Guild of Television Producers and Directors</a>. From 1958 onwards, after the Guild had merged with the British Film Academy, the organisation was known as the Society of Film and Television Arts. In 1976, this became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the name the organisation goes under still as of 2006.</p>
<p>From 1968 until 1997, the BAFTA Film and Television awards were presented in one joint ceremony known simply as the BAFTA Awards, but in order to streamline the ceremonies from 1998 onwards they were split in two. The Television Awards are usually presented in April, with a separate ceremony in May for the Television Craft Awards. The Craft Awards are presented for more technical areas of the industry, such as special effects, production design, or costumes.</p>
<p>The Awards are only open to British programmes — with the exception of the audience-voted Pioneer Award — but any <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_television.html" title="Satellite television">satellite</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogue_television.html" title="Analogue television">terrestrial</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_television.html" title="Digital television">digital television</a> stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances, such as from actors, can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a> of the year preceding the Awards ceremony (so, between January 1 and December 31 2004 for the 2005 Awards). Entry is free, and entry forms are made available between October and December each year.</p>
<p>After all the entries have been received, they are voted for <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online.html" title="Online">online</a> by all eligible members of the Academy. The programmes and performances attracting the most votes, usually four in each category, are shortlisted as the nominees for each award. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee. Each jury is designed to have a balance in areas such as sex, age and experience, and have experience related to the categories concerned but no direct connections to the short-listed programmes or performers.</p>
<p>There are also a number of non-competitive honorary Awards — the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Potter_d5dd.html" title="Dennis Potter">Dennis Potter</a> Award for Outstanding Writing for Television; the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Clarke_23d8.html" title="Alan Clarke">Alan Clarke</a> Award for Outstanding Creative Contribution to Television; the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dimbleby_fa3a.html" title="Richard Dimbleby">Richard Dimbleby</a> Award for Outstanding Presenter in the Factual Arena; the Fellowship for individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to television across their careers, and various Special Awards given on an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hoc.html" title="Ad hoc">ad hoc</a> basis. These Awards are suggested by the Television Committee and awarded by the Academy's Council. They are not necessarily always given every year, but as and when appropriate.</p>
<p>The Awards ceremony is broadcast on British television, usually the day after it has taken place. Transmission alternates each year between the two main UK television channels, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a>.</p>
