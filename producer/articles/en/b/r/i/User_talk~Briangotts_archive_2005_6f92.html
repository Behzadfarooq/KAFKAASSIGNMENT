<p>You want to by it by post? (it is hard to by it even in Kazan). It could be useful if you understand Russian. But in is only in one-volume edition, so all information is limited. --<a href="../../../u/n/t/User%7EUntifler_1daf.html" title="User:Untifler">Untifler</a> 21:25, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tatarstan Republic Academy of Sciences' Institution of Tatar Encyclopaedia, 2002 This is a publishing information for Tatar Encyclopaedia. M.b. different articles, which are about different objects (people, city and duchy) should not be merged, but I think, that Suars could be merged with Sabirs, because in some Tatar sources is said that Suars was only branch of Sabirs and their name changed due to pronoinciation of surrounding peoples. Another variant is Suvars. As for mistakes, I hope that you will correct it as it needs! --Untifler 21:39, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>(This thread relates to disputes over the categorization of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgars.html" title="Bulgars">Bulgars</a> in the Category "Turkic peoples".)</p>
<p>Using threats to further a point of view is scarcely the best way to approach any of the editors here. Behaving as if your own version is the best and ond only possible is a bit childish. <b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</b>, this stays below any page in Wikipedia and contrary to what you might think, it regards you, as well. Please, stop reverting the category, you are misleading readers to accept one of the explanations about the origin of the Bulgars. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 15:55, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, to suggest that I was "threatening" is a total mischaracterization. What I said was that rather than engage in a pointless revert war I would ask that the site administrators arbitrate the issue (as per <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html#Requesting_an_advocate" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution#Requesting_an_advocate</a>). This is quite different from threatening, which I note that you have been known to do in the past (e.g. "If you don't leave this article alone now, there will be 'sudden' outburst of vandalism against Romanian articles, this is final warning") You yourself concede that Turkic origin is one theory about the Bulgars. Linguistically it is the only theory accepted by most scholars. I refer you to the works of M.I. Artamanov, Runciman, David Christian, and D. Dmitrov (himself a Bulgarian) to name only a few. However, even if there are other theories worthy of consideration, Bulgars deserve a mention among the Turkic peoples category. Your accusation that I am trying to foist my views is totally ludicrous. I did not edit the article itself. The various theories are all in there. You are free to add the Bulgars to whatever other category (Slavic peoples, Iranian peoples, etc.) you wish. By repeatedly deleting Bulgars from the category you are attempting to force your ethnopolitical views on the article in the same manner you accuse me of. The notice "If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it" cuts both ways, my friend.</dd>
<dd>To avoid more pointless fighting and reversions, I propose the following:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1. On the "Turkic peoples" category page, I will add the following note:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Many of these peoples' origins are still being debated. For example, while most linguists classify Proto-Bulgarian as a Turkic language, others have disputed this classification and point to Iranic and other linguistic features. Likewise, the Avars and Hephthalites are sometimes classified as Mongolic, Iranic or even Tocharian in origin. Finally, some people listed, such as the Golden Horde, were in part or in whole Mongolian in origin, yet are included in this category because they adopted Turkic languages.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>2. Bulgars goes back in the "Turkic peoples" category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As a gesture of good will I have implemented #1 already. You are welcome to suggest modifications to the language. I ask that you return the Bulgars article to the Turkic peoples category within 48 hours, and I will consider the matter closed. If you do not, I will begin proceedings outlined under <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution</a>.</dd>

<dd>Wrong, I am not trying to impose any "ethnopolitical views" on anything. What's more, I don't have any such "views", I am not supporting any of the theories regarding the origin of the Bulgars. However, since there is a controversy about it, the article should either be placed in none of the two, conflicting categories, or in both of them. Sounds logical, doesn't it? And since you insist so much on their inclusion in the Turkic category, they should also be included in the Iranian one.

<dd>No one has made you argue with me, please don't act like an angry child. Yes, and I have added the category Iranian peoples. It is true that the older theory is that of the Turkic origin of the Bulgars but until as late as 60-70 years ago, all nomadic peoples were considered Turkic and both Bulgars and Magyars were associated with the Huns. To say nothing of the fact that at least until the end of WWII linguists did not have an especially clear idea of what the Bulgar language looked like. For the last 20 years, there has been a reversal and all newer books and textbooks, at least in Bulgaria, address them as Pamirian, this view has also started to gain recognition abroad. However, this is not the point: the point is that there is a controvery about their origin. The rest has already been said. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 21:40, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)~</dd>

<p>I am not responding to this individual any longer but I could not let his comments go on this page without a final note. I have read a lot of materials on the subject and I have seen no scholarly work that associates the proto-Bulgar language with the Pamir group, except radical, Bulgarian nationalist propaganda that seeks to minimize associations with Turkey. Be that as it may, I never had any objection to this individual putting up his Pamir theory, or with linking the Bulgar article to the Iranian peoples category. What I objected to were his repeated attempts to remove the Bulgars from the Turkic category, on the grounds that there was "dispute" about their linguistic origin. He has a history of bullying other Wikipedia authors, including administrators of this site, and of making various threatening comments, which history is readily viewable <a href="../../../v/m/o/User_talk%7EVMORO_b378.html" title="User talk:VMORO">here</a>.

<p>Hello! An article stating that Samaritan Aramaic is a variety of Aramaic spoken by Samaritans isn't really an article but a circular statement. I've redirected it to the main Aramaic article for the time being, but if you can add any info regarding the differences between the two languages and other facts, by all means feel free to do so. Since ancient languages seems to be your forte, I'm confident that you'll do just that. Best, Lucky 6.9 18:06, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The only reason I created a separate "Samaritan Aramaic" article is because the article on the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritan.html" title="Samaritan">Samaritans</a>, which I did not write, referenced it. I noticed this while putting together the Samartian category. At some point I may try and learn enough about Samaritan Aramaic to write an article; in the meantime, I think the redirect is sufficient.

<dd>"Maximum info" has limits. An article like <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> can't possibly contain all the relevant information available on its subject. The main article on any subject is intended to stand alone and serve as a fairly consise general introduction. "See main article:X" is used to direct a reader to more information, but <i>only</i> if the reader is interested in that particular subtopic. We don't expect that most readers will actually read all the spin-off articles, and that's fine.</dd>
<dd>Don't forget that Wikipedia is intended for everyone. As much as possible, physicists and auto mechanics should be able to read articles on history and art, while artists and historians should be able to read articles on cars and physics. We often fail to reach that lofty goal (many of our mathematics articles are opaque even to math students) but we do try. Featured articles in particular are expected to reach a general audience, since we'd like to put them on the Main Page for all to see.</dd>

<p>I would imagine that other readers would find this article pov in some parts. To preempt them, I suggest we use the pbs source. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml</a></p>

<p>It may be whitewash, but we must include it in some parts of the narrative to keep it NPOV. See what is salvagable from the pbs source and include it.</p>

<p>There seems to be some dispute with your version; two editors have claimed it is POV and one of them is proposing an entirely new version.

<p>Well, as I have noticed, you are on the arbitration committee. Perhaps you can cite your opinion with regards to Yuber's non cooperative style of editing. I have grown tired of policing his edits and his inability to accept either other's criticism of his combative pov style or his more often than not, irrelevent pov editing that he so often defends, even after half a dozen different editors have told him that he isn't making any friends by acting the way he has. You generally post in the same catagory of articles as me, mainly those relating to the Middle East. If you had any experience with Yuber's editing, I would appreciate if you make add your comments.</p>

<p>He managed to delete BCE/CE references from almost 300 articles in 3 hours or so. At one point he was hitting 4 articles a minute; I thought he was a bot. In any event, his theoretical reason for deleting was because the references were superfluous, but his actual edits show something else. These anons show up on Wikipedia from time to time; they take great offence at BCE/CE notation, and proceed to try to delete as many references to them as they can. He claims he will be back to delete AD references as well, but I find this doubtful, given the fact that he never bothered to do so on any of the articles he edited when he removed BCE/CE, and in fact added AD references to articles in place of CE. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll look at it in more detail soon, but I would say on first read-thru the thing that would be most helpful for the article would be for it to have explicit footnotes for the various statements made in it, rather than general references. E.g. Bendiner, Elmer <i>The Rise and Fall of Paradise</i>, pp. 48-50. I can show you how to make pretty footnotes if you like. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wouldn't mind its being taken off, but perhaps we should try to reason a bit longer with its disputant. My guess is that he just doesn't understand a few details, that are hampering his ability to realize that they're Jews...not the least of which is that you don't have to be able to trace your lineage back to Adam to be a Jew. Let it run its course. If he simply refuses to get it within a week, we can take up the discussion at that point. Meanwhile, anyone who sees the disputed tag has a quick way of seeing what the dispute is about, and they may learn a lot more from reading the talk page than just the article itself anyways.

<p>I removed the category mercenaries from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrecht_von_Wallenstein_ca4a.html" title="Albrecht von Wallenstein">Albrecht von Wallenstein</a> article.

<p>This question has bugged me as well. I guess both claims are source-based, and so both are valid. My personal theory is that when Styrbjörn defeated Palnatoki, Palnatoki remained the official commander of Jomsborg, but as a vassal of Styrbjörn. When Styrbjörn left for Uppsala, he hardly took the whole force with him. A part should have remained, probably commanded by Palnatoki. P was later succeeded by Sigvaldi.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 14:00, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, yes, I guess I am upset with having read one of their self-published books. They used spiritists, faked quotes and called 19th century maps 5th century maps. I think the less this theory is given space, the better. It has no following at universities, but their agressive preaching is making non-scholars quite confused. Even I was positive before starting reading about the subject. Thanks for adding the article to my userpage.

<p>Most of what remains of Norse mythology is the mythology of the elite, of the aristocracy. As far as I know the people who went to Hell were those who lied, had breaken an oath or did not cut their nails or their hair. The slaves went to Thor himself, and IIRC, the women who died in childbirth went to Frigg. I guess decent commoners went to another place, although there are no extant sources about this. Balder went to Hell, on the other hand, so all I can say is that we know too little today. I can verify later this evening and get back to you about it.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 18:39, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the evening, you bait cages with <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roach.html" title="Roach">roach</a>, and sink the cages to the bottom of the lake with a line and a floating device so that you can easily retrieve the cages. When it is dark, you go out with a flashlight and look for the floating devices, pull up the cages and look for crayfish. Then you boil them with <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dill.html" title="Dill">dill</a>, salt, sugar and perhaps some beer in it. The crayfish are served cool the next day at a crayfish party that you have together with friends and, traditionally, with Swedish vodka. It is a tradition to do so in August, and my parents have a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=58.856738,15.080538&amp;spn=0.020453,0.057811&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=58.856738,15.080538&amp;spn=0.020453,0.057811&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">lake</a>&#160;:).--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 22:18, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for butting in, I just happened to see this! I had no idea Sweden had "crayfish." Typing this word makes me laugh. I'm from the Texas <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Coast_3a68.html" title="Gulf Coast">Gulf Coast</a>, not far from the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> border, and the Louisianans call 'em crawfish. Texans tend to go with crawdads (or crawfish). And the recipe also made me laugh! We boil 'em with all kinds of spicy stuff, and Irish red potatoes, and eat 'em on the spot. No waiting until they're cool. The beverage of choice is generally beer, though vodka would do in a pinch&#160;;). Apologies, Briangotts, for hijacking your talk page.

<p>Thanks very much for voting for me at RFA, I feel almost embarassed by the unanimous vote (Boothy443 don't count).</p>
<p>Could you please have a look at the work of MichaelMcAnnis - start from Talk:Amarna Letters Dictionary Global, No. 1 and the two other articles referenced at the top of that talk page. It is totally outside my subject areas but I am sure that his work will never be suitable for Wikipedia.

<p>They're listed by Wikipedia name, but, as I'm sure you are well aware, some people's Wikipedia names are their real names. As well, many people who don't use their real names use similar ones, or leave biographical information on their User pages which either definitely identifies them, or makes them easy to trace. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:13, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>In case you haven't found the answer yet, the list at Stormfront was Wikipedia user account names only. A few who appear on the list look to be people who use their real names as Wikipedia account names. A discussion of whether that is enough to constitute a credible threat to those on the list had not reached consensus; however, Jimbo has stated his opinion that he thinks it is enough, so discussion has pretty much ceased on that issue in favor of his opinion.</p>
<p>(I found your post on Jayjg's talk page after reading his talk page, trying to find a reason for an article talk page edit of his. I noticed that you hadn't been given a response, so I thought I would.

<dl>
<dd>As well as Jimbo stating his opinion, there was around a two-thirds majority in favor of the block, so unless you're saying a consensus has to be 100 per cent, a consensus was, in fact, reached. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:23, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A consensus is not 66% nor 80%, nor 100%. You're confusing a supermajority with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. Consensus is a decision or resolution that all parties in a dispute or discussion can accept, even if they disagree. Please take care to note the difference. In day to day matters, such as VfD and RFA, a supermajority serves as a practical substitute for real consensus. However, such operational conveniences do not change the proper definition of consensus.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>Jimbo's decision forced a consensus that was probably already developing, but had clearly not been reached at the time he announced his opinion. Regardless of its history, it's now a fact of Wikipedia life that virtually everyone accepts, and I don't intend to argue it further. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 01:38, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wish I did. Unfortunately, it is not exactly a favoured subject, and the written sources are virtually non-existent.

<p>Hi Brian. My comment on the RfA page was brief, so it's not surprising it was confusing as well. As I clarified to Bababjou, while I did express concerns about his POV editing, I find Anonymous Editor generally reasonable in discussion, and don't see any reason to think he would abuse his admin privileges. In addition, I think that Wikipedia would benefit from multiple POVs. Also, I think the Muslim related articles get a lot of vandalism, and it would be helpful to have an admin patrolling them more regularly. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:39, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a great admirer of your work and I hope to work with you on Norse-related articles in the future, but I had to change my vote to oppose over the Stormfront incident.

<p>I have to change my vote again to <b>weak oppose</b>. From the developing discussion it seems clear that Haukurth still doesn't understand the danger of Amalekite's actions, and I find this very disturbing for reasons I've stated above. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 02:58, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if I can express this any more clearly now than before but I'll try.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amalekite's post, when taken in context of the VNN where he posted it, his moderation of that forum and his previous postings to it, arguably constitute an incitement to violence against certain Wikipedians.</li>
<li>Accepting the previous, the post puts people in danger.</li>
<li>This justifies the block of User:Amalekite under our rules.</li>
<li>If this had been the reasoning given for the block from the beginning I doubt I would ever have objected strongly for it and probably I would not have expressed myself at all.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, I don't think the aforementioned danger was large.</li>
<li>I don't think that blocking User:Amalekite did anything to ameliorate that danger.</li>
<li>I think that blocking in general is not a very effective remedy since people can so easily get new accounts - and indeed User:Amalekite returned under the name User:Etikelama and no doubt has other accounts as well.</li>
<li>I think that other action than blocking, or in addition to blocking, would probably have been more effective. Writing to the moderator of the Stormfront forums, asking him to remove the post in question, was something that seemed like more productive action to me so I did.</li>
<li>I think that arguing about the blocking of a Wikipedia username trivializes any real threat or danger that exists. If there is a real threat, danger and incitement to violence the matter should be taken through the appropriate legal channels - arguing technicalities of Wikipedia banning policy makes the matter seem like some trivial game.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel my opinions on this single issue, out of all the things I've done and said for the duration of my career on Wikipedia, weigh so heavily against me as to counter anything positive I might bring to the janitor position then you are indeed right to vote oppose. It greatly surprises me that people will apply this kind of litmus test for a single opinion. Based on this alone people have expressed the opinion that I'm an unethical person. Others have said that since my judgment is so flawed here I will clearly have poor judgment in other things - but no-one has pointed out to me any other previous failing of my judgment from my record.</p>
<p>I never expected this, I never thought this would be such a big deal, I never thought so many people considered me a bad person. I don't really care tuppence whether I get a rollback button or not - but I care about this. And frankly, I'm feeling absolutely horrible at the moment. I just woke up after a few hours of fitful sleep to find more oppose votes, your being one of them. I don't know what I'll do now. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur Þorgeirsson</a> 05:42, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one thinks you're a bad person, Haukur. The issue for me is that you didn't at the time, and I feel still don't, understand how strongly people felt about <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Linder_e7a0.html" title="Alex Linder">Alex Linder</a> posting that list. If a white supremacist had posted a list of names to a Ku Klux Klan website of editors he believed were black, are you seriously saying you'd want to see him continue to edit? You were asking your fellow editors back then to continue to work on a project alongside someone who wished them dead, and who had taken steps to publicize their existence to other people who wished them dead. You sent (as I recall) around 20 e-mails to the list about it, and posted numerous times to the talk page, so you clearly felt strongly that he should be unblocked. Yet you knew nothing about him. You stated, for example, that he didn't wish anyone dead, when all you had to do is read his posts on VNN and elsewhere to see that he has explicitly called for death to the Jews, and has advocated the genocide of black people. You also posted of his list: "This is not a threat. Nor is it, I believe, an action exposing any Wikipedian to danger. For one thing no information is made public that isn't already public." But many of the users whose names he posted don't make public that they're Jews, and in fact some of them aren't. You were expressing strong views on issues you'd done no research into. You also seemed not to know that the block was covered by the blocking policy. Again, a lack of research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the argument you and Matt had with El C today on his talk page, which is what drew attention to your nomination, was worrying for its timing, its vehemence, and because it showed your views hadn't changed. You were still arguing that: "From User:Amalekite's contribution log and his posts to Stormfront and VNN I see no evidence that he was acting in bad faith on Wikipedia. And we assume good faith unless we have overwhelming evidence to the contrary." I'm sorry but I find that very naive. When a group of editors is being attacked like that, we have an <i>obligation</i> to support them, and I want to see editors who understand that become admins.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But please don't mistake this criticism of your actions as an opinion that you're in any way a bad person. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many people have said that my judgment is so deeply wrong that I can't be trusted. Others have said that I don't have <i>ethical integrity</i>. El C has recently repeated that he feels revolted by me and he has never retracted his comment that I acted <i>as far from goodfaith as is imaginable</i>. Indeed there are people who not only <i>feel</i> but <i>have told me</i> that I am not a good person. I'm glad that you don't feel that way, Sarah.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why do you continually use the word <i>vehemence</i> to describe my extensive participation in the Amalekite discussion? You yourself have participated very extensively and entirely on one side in my RFA and the associated discussions - even to the point of commenting on a third party talk page here. Would you describe your own behavior as vehement? Can we agree that an alternative word is more apt?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did as much research as most people at the time and I carefully watched every contribution to the discussion. I realize now that I should have read through all relevant policy pages earlier, in particular to find the very rarely used provision that was invoked. I regret not having done that. If you yourself had stated your reasons for the block clearly and with reference to the relevant policy at the outset you might have been able to save us all some trouble. But hindsight is 20/20, of course, and I had thought - until this week - that we would let bygones be bygones.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I still think that Amalekite's contribution log suggests that he acted in good faith. Most of his contributions were naive, some were clearly not helpful and most were reverted with good reason. Some of his anonymous contributions were worse and I only became aware of them late in the debate. People can act in good faith for a bad cause. That someone acts in good faith does not mean that she is right or that she is necessarily a good person.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As I have stated many times before I essentially stopped objecting to the block when all the facts of the matter had become clear to me. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur Þorgeirsson</a> 09:15, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Haukurth, you stopped objecting but you believe that Amalekite acted in good faith which is shocking to me. You also believe that it is more effective to contact a website known for advocating the death of certain groups of people and then ask them to take down a list of names because it might lead to harm to members of those groups. This, to me, is just naivete. You are right that blocking the party in question is no way to ensure he will not continue his listing on Stormfront but it is the only remedy available to Wikipedia as a community to at least protect its members from harassment here.</dd>
<dd>Like Sarah, I don't attribute any bad faith, malice, or prejudice to you, only, as I said, what I believe is poor judgment in one specific area where admin powers are important. Whether other people have accused you of being a bad person, I can't control what they think, just as I can't judge you based on the fact that your support comes in part from people whose views are abhorrent to me and who have made similar baseless accusations against others. I would of course vehemently deny any such charges that were made against you, as I have done here and on the vote page.</dd>
<dd>In pointing to your numerous (and from my perspective excellent) contributions to WP articles, you are conflating two issues. One is whether a person's article edits are valuable to WP as a whole, and I don't think even your detractors can reasonably deny that they are in this case. The other is whether they can be relied upon to exercise the judgment necessary to be an admin (as determined by each voter), and I simply can't be sure of that in this case. I think the issues are separate, though they are difficult to distinguish (indeed, this is why it has been so difficult for me to vote against you in this instance). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 14:57, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am saddened too and it was certainly never my intention to hurt your feelings. I don't think I every said (because I don't believe) that you have poor "judgment as a person". I don't know you well enough to know that. From your edits and contributions to WP it seems you actually have very good judgment in general. I believe that you exhibit a lack of understanding in this one area that is unfortunate (just as, I am sure, I lack understanding in various areas as well). The problem here is that this area falls within the scope of an admin's duties. Whether you intend to involve yourself in that area of the duties or not, the question of adminship involves whether you should be given the power to do so. There's no way for an admin to be limited to this or that area of authority- the power is plenary in scope.</dd>
<dd>As a point of fact, I can't say what Stormfront as a group advocates. Certainly, as you point out, Linder does advocate extermination of Jews and others, and he is by no means alone among Stormfront readership. By posting a list of "Jewish" cabalists at Stormfront Linder knew or should have known damn well that he might be condemning some of those people to bodily harm or death if his list got into the hands of a tech-savvy neo-Nazi with too much spare time. This is an issue of vital importance to the entire WP community. If it were anything less critical, or if I believed that you had genuinely come to an understanding of these issues, I would never have opposed your adminship. But I don't see that from the discussion as it has developed.</dd>
<dd>Again, I'm sorry if I have hurt you because that was not my intention. I'm sure Wiglaf can attest that I have only the best of intentions in this as I've discussed the issue at length with him and he knows how conflicted I have been over it. And I hope that, whatever way the admin vote goes (and it seems like it could easily go either way at this point) you will continue to contribute and that we can collaborate on Norse related articles in the future. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 15:53, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This threat argument is rather extreme and narrow, and doesn't include the fact that while Haukurth defers, other admins are still free to take action. Also, considering that we know for a fact our site is frequented by Stormfront readers and other extremists, does that mean that everyone who participates in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Wikiproject%7EJudaism_3d70.html" title="Wikiproject:Judaism">Wikiproject:Judaism</a> has cursed themselves similarly? I think not. There are perceived threats, and there are credible threats. We need to be able to openly discuss the differences between them. While we discuss, deferring to the judgement of those who are more cautious is the correct thing to do. This is exactly what Haukurth did, and stated he would do in the future. That is certainly not poor judgement. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 16:13, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your position, and I respectfully disagree. There's a big difference between a few Stormfront folks looking at the site and actively going and posting a hit list on a Stormfront forum, in my view. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 16:19, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Hit list"? Again, the root of the reason why the discussion was necessary is in plain view. Unless I'm gravely mistaken, it was never expressed as a "hit list" except by those who felt threatened by the existence of the list. It was posted as list of users with a certain POV. The location of the posting is is why the discussion about it was completely appropriate. Opposition based on Haukurth's participation in the discussion is wrong. Wikipedia needed this discussion. Those who tried to cut off the discussion of what the list was and what it meant were (and remain) wrong. The answer to hatred and bigotry is not censorship. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 16:42, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we can resolve this issue between us. We will have to agree to disagree on this. In my view, a list of "Jews" and "collaborators" posted to Stormfront is a hit list, and it was disingenuous of Linder to claim otherwise. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 16:58, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a point of fact, Amalekite labelled his list "Elders of Wikipedia", and called them "Zionist cabalists". He did not explicitly label them "Jews" and "collaborators" in his post. This might not have any great bearing on your overall argument, of course, and you might say the "Jew" part was implicit from the context, but I think it's important we stick to the facts, and try not to read into Amalekite's statements more than there is definitely there. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:13, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm willing to agree to disagree, because now I think I understand you fully; but in doing so, I think I've further proven that the discussion itself was important. Haukurth should not be penalized for participating in a legitmate discussion, especially as he publicly deferred to those more cautious regarding what was done in the mean time and also publicly gave consent to what was done in the end. That is where judgement is separate from beliefs. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 17:18, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">User:Gilgamesh</a> is now imposing his <i>own</i> views by changing the transliterated Hebrew names of articles with redirects to unreadable Hebrew names and fonts, as if <i>his</i> criteria are the only ones to reckon with, when there are in fact several. My computer, as I am sure many others' as well, does not pick up his type of fonts, and thus he is messing up articles such as <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safed.html" title="Safed">Safed</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadera.html" title="Hadera">Hadera</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holon.html" title="Holon">Holon</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/u/Afula.html" title="Afula">Afula</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arad%2C_Israel_f5a1.html" title="Arad, Israel">Arad, Israel</a> and many others defacing them and making them unreadable on the web. He is going to DESTROY the normal usage of Wikipedia's Hebrew transliterations to satisfy his own needs without there being any consensus. Common usages are being thrown out in favor of obscure and pedantic academic usages familiar to only a handful of unkown academics. He should be called upon to stop BEFORE he rushes to do further damage without any consensus being reached. All his changes should therefore be reverted.

<p>Mr. Briangotts, I take great exception to your saying that much of Luther's work is antisemitic. This betrays an uninformed POV on your part. I agree that his <i>On the Jews and Their Lies</i> is antisemitic. I hold that view in opposition to my other fellow Wikipedians who are Lutheran, but as a scholar I take great exception to unfair exaggerations. Do you have a graduate masters degree in Lutheran doctrine that you can make such an unfair accusation? Luther's opponents were just as vitriolic if not even more so. One does not read what they wrote because only Luther is the famous one here. Perhaps you could suggest that sections of the article could be rewritten without engaging in supercilious, rude characterizations of what other people have written. I wonder if there is POV going on among those who want to censor any information that would tend to give the whole story about Luther. You could be more diplomatic when you chastise your fellow Wikipedians. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 14:36, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I "chastised" no one. What I said was that a particular passage was unencyclopedic and didn't sound right in a particular article. I also said that Luther's work contained many anti-Semitic rants. Both are statements I fully stand by; the former is an opinion to which I am entitled and with which many agree, and the latter is simply fact for which I could cite any number of references. If you choose to take offense at them, that is your own concern. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> 15:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, you also said, and I quote: "The fact is that many people in Luther's age (including his colleague Philipp Melanchthon managed to promote their particular religious views without engaging in the vitriolic anti-Semitism that characterized much of Luther's work." This is simply an historical error or, at best, an exaggeration. Encyclopedic articles are also supposed to be accurate. I tend to agree with you about the manner of writing the article, and I do believe that the sentence in question should be reworked or supported with citations; however, I think one could employ a little courtesy in bringing this matter to the attention of others. That is some advice from an old post grad. Cheers. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 13:24, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am frankly astounded that you found the quote you cited offensive. I would have thought that "an old post grad" would have a thicker skin, especially since the statement was not directed to you and as I have had to endure far worse in pursuit of my own graduate degree. I find your assertion that the statement is a historical error strange. Ultimately, this is not a fruitful avenue of discussion. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> 14:18, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't find it offensive. I found it an exaggerated generalization. With genuine curiosity might I ask how you arrived at this conclusion? Was it from primary or secondary sources? If I were to make a generalization about your field specialization, you might be a bit miffed at me, wouldn't you? <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">drboisclair</a> 14:49, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a codicil to the last comment I wish to say that I admire your interest in history and Jewish history--I too am a scholar of history, and I am very good at it--, and I am glad that you are taking an interest in the Luther article. I really think that we are all on the same page more than any of us think. Scholars that really probe for accuracy and the truth are rare!

<p>Hi Brian, I've been on the lookout for articles that meet the criteria at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Wikipedia:Good articles</a>, &amp; figured you have probably encountered a few in your area of attention.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_Karaites_3bb5.html" title="Crimean Karaites">Crimean Karaites</a> -- The inroduction needs to be rewritten, particularly because it first mentions "Karaim", &amp; only in the second paragraph is the subject actually discussed.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/m/Jomsvikings.html" title="Jomsvikings">Jomsvikings</a> -- Also in need of a good copy editting. For example, the age requirements for membership are mentioned twice.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritan.html" title="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> -- Another article in need of copy editting, particularly in the section "History". The way external sources are linked not only violates Wikipedia style, but is just plain confusing.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And if it looks as if I forgot one, I moved <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> to culture, where I thought it was a better fit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These are the only objections that I can see to including them. If these are fixed, then I feel that they should be considered Good articles. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are correct that I did not actually vote support. I very rarely do: I've probably only voted to support about 8 or 10 featured articles ever, and they've been ones I've really spent time researching, so I was personally confident of their accuracy and thoroughness. The fact that you left me a message doesn't change that. It doesn't seem short on supporters. However, I found the objection I remarked on to be inappropriate, and I think my comment there increases the chance that when Raul evaluates the situation he will dismiss that objection. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
