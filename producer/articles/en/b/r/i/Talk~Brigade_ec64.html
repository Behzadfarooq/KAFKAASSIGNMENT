I am removing the line:</p>
<p>'In the United States Army the term brigade is used instead of the term regiment, except in the cavalry. This is because a regiment has a fixed structure, whereas a brigade can be changed to suit the mission's needs.'</p>
<p>because it is inaccurate, and I can't think of a better replacement for it.</p>
<p>In the US Army, the term brigade does _not_ replace regiment. Rather, regimental units, such as 1-77 AR (1st Battalion, 77th Armor Regiment), are formed into brigades. To wit, the 2nd Brigade of the US 1st Infantry Division is currently comprised of 1-77 AR, 1-18 IN, and 1-28 IN. To these core units, other units, such as military intelligence, military police, engineers, and cavalry are assigned to form the Brigade Combat Team.</p>
<p>It would be true to say that regiments are generally only used for heraldic purposes. While regiments do have commanders, it is usually a secondary title for the Battalion or Brigade Commander that the regiment's unit(s) belong to.</p>

<p>Does this currently occur in any modern army?

<dd>Kinda-sorta. They're on equal for inter-service pecking order/NATO rank equivalancy purposes, but they a) have different names (which is pertinent here, as the article lists the two separately), and b) brigadier is a senior field officer, not a general officer rank. So, point/question stands. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, OK, but to respond to your original question: yes it is common for brigadiers or brigadiers general to command brigades in NATO operations. Calling a brigadier a "senior field officer" seems to me to be splitting hairs. The rank replaced "brigadier general" in the British and Commonwealth armies and is equivalent to brigadier general (which is a general rank) in the U.S. and several other armies.</dd>

<dd>My original question <i>was not about brigadiers</i>. Brigadiers are indeed the officer customarily in charge of commonwealth brigades: that was never the point at issue. Canada appears to be the main exception; I've no idea what Canadian BGs do. If you think it's "splitting hairs" to observe that "brigadier" is in fact not the same as a "brigadier general", then why does it make sense for the article to list them separately, as if they were, well, not the same? (They are in fact, not the same, and I suggest you review the articles on each if you're unclear as to why this is the case.) So to return to my actual original question: do <i>brigadier generals</i> command brigades (in NATO, or otherwise)? It certainly isn't their usual role in the US Army, at any rate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said in my last post, <i>yes brigadeer generals command brigades.</i> For example the brigade commander in Kabul is a Canadian brigadier general.<a href="http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1295" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1295" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I assume that one would mention both brigadier and brigadier general in the article because they are different (albiet equivalent) ranks in use in several English-speaking countries. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 19:00, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your last message was rather unclear on that but, but that's a very useful and interesting example; thanks. Canadian practice seems generally to be similar to the US's, i.e. colonels commanding "domestic" brigades (or brigade groups, to use their terminology), so perhaps this practice is particular to multinational formations (either because of differences in composition, or for transnational rank-equivalency reasons). If the US makes such appointments on a similar basis, that would tend to confirm that. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are quite right that domestic brigades in Canada are usually commanded by colonels; though sometimes they are commanded by brigadier generals. In the U.S. brigades are normally commanded by colonels unless they are functioning as "separate brigades," in which case they are commanded by a brigadier general. <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/army/unit/brigade.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/army/unit/brigade.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 21:18, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not familiar with separate brigades; if you have information on them to hand, it might make a useful addition to the article (or else to the United States Army article). Poking around some .mil sites, it seems that these are mostly commanded by colonels too (though with colonels as deputy commanders too, which seems almost as weird as the four naval captains per USN CVN). I did find one, the 256th Infantry Brigade, that had recently been commanded by a BG, but he'd been appointed as a colonel, and was recently replaced by a colonel, so at first sight the extra rank looks superfluous to the appointment. Granted you've demonstrated this does occur; I've reworded to indicate the usual case, with an addendum covering this. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certain US Army Reserve units are GOCOM's (General Officer Commands) at a brigade level, for example, the 804th Medical Brigade, the 300th MP Brigade, the 800th MP Brigade, 220th MP Brigade. I cannot confirm whether Active Duty MP Brigades are also commanded by Brigadier Generals, but eh reserve brigades ARE.--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 20:20, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
