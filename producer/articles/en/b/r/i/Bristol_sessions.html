<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_sessions.html" title="Edit section: Country music before the Sessions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Country music before the Sessions</span></h2>
<p>Country music had been recorded commercially since <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. Among these very early artists were <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Dalhart_971f.html" title="Vernon Dalhart">Vernon Dalhart</a>, who recorded the million-selling "Wreck of Old 97," <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Stoneman_172b.html" title="Ernest Stoneman">Ernest Stoneman</a> from <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galax%2C_Virginia_1917.html" title="Galax, Virginia">Galax, Virginia</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Dave_Macon_bd6e.html" title="Uncle Dave Macon">Uncle Dave Macon</a>. However, any "hillbilly" artists who recorded had to travel to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> studios of the major labels, and many artists, including Dalhart, were not true "hillbilly" artists but instead crossed over from other genres. ("Hillbilly" is used here to distinguish the largely secular folk music of the region from gospel and blues, and is not meant as a pejorative.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/k/e/Okeh_Records_5be1.html" title="Okeh Records">Okeh Records</a> and later <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a> had sent producers around the South in an attempt to discover new talent. Peer, who worked for Okeh at the time, recorded <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddlin%27_John_Carson_2de5.html" title="Fiddlin' John Carson">Fiddlin' John Carson</a> using the old acoustic method (known for its large intrusive sound-gathering horn) in 1924, at the behest of the Okeh dealer in Atlanta, Polk Brockman. Despite Peer's belief that the record was of poor quality, the 500 copies made of "Cluck Old Hen" sold out in weeks. This experience convinced Peer of the potential for "hillbilly" music.</p>
<p>Peer left Okeh for the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company_0eba.html" title="Victor Talking Machine Company">Victor Talking Machine Company</a>, taking a salary of $1 per year. However, Peer owned the publishing rights to all the recordings he made. Peer's arrangement of paying royalties to artists based on sales is the basis for record contracts today, and the company he founded, <a href="http://www.peermusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.peermusic.com" rel="nofollow">peermusic</a>, remains in existence today.</p>
<p>The rise of electronic recording allowed records to have a sound better than radio, which had threatened to reduce the recording industry to irrelevance by 1925. This new method allowed softer instruments such as dulcimers, guitars and jaw harps to be heard, and it also meant recording equipment was highly portable -- and as such, recordings could be made nearly anywhere (the acoustic equipment was not really portable.)</p>
<p>Peer asked his friend Stoneman, who had recorded for Okeh, how to find more rural talent. Stoneman convinced Peer to travel through southern <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachia.html" title="Appalachia">Appalachia</a> and record artists who might otherwise have been unable to travel to New York. Peer recognized the potential with the mountain music, as even residents of Appalachia who didn't have electricity were using hand-cranked <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victrola.html" title="Victrola">Victrolas</a>. He decided to make a trip, hoping to record blues, gospel and "hillbilly" music. Artists were paid $50 on the spot and 2 1/2 cents for each single sold.</p>
<p>In February and March, he made a trip which recorded blues and gospel music, and decided to make another trip. He decided to make a stop in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savannah%2C_Georgia_bd58.html" title="Savannah, Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina_1d79.html" title="Charlotte, North Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. He settled on Bristol (at the urging of Stoneman) as a third stop as with <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnson_City%2C_Tennessee_ab0c.html" title="Johnson City, Tennessee">Johnson City, Tennessee</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsport%2C_Tennessee_eaea.html" title="Kingsport, Tennessee">Kingsport, Tennessee</a>, it formed the Tri-Cities, the largest urban area in the Appalachians at the time. In addition, three other record companies had held or were scheduling auditions for Bristol. So Peer set out with his wife and two engineers for Bristol.</p>
<p><a name="The_Sessions_themselves" id="The_Sessions_themselves"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_sessions.html" title="Edit section: The Sessions themselves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Sessions themselves</span></h2>
<p>Peer then set up a record studio in a hat warehouse on State Street, which is the state line in Bristol. He placed advertisements in the local papers, which did not receive much response aside from artists who had already travelled to New York or were already known by Stoneman.</p>
<p>Stoneman was the first to record with Peer, doing so on July 25. He recorded with friends such as his wife Hattie, Eck Dunford and Mooney Brewer. Other acts, including the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnson_Brothers_1188.html" title="Johnson Brothers">Johnson Brothers</a> vaudeville duo and a church choir, filled out the rest of July. However, these artists were only enough to fill the first week of recordings and Peer needed to fill out his second week.</p>
<p>A newspaper article about one of Stoneman's recordings, which stressed the $3,600 in royalties that Stoneman had received in 1926 and the $100 a day he was receiving for recording in Bristol, generated much more interest. Dozens of artists went to Bristol, many of whom had never been to Bristol in their lives. He had to schedule night sessions to accommodate the extra talent, which included the Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers. Rodgers had a disagreement with his band over what name to record under, and so Rodgers recorded solo and his band recorded as the Tenneva Ramblers. Rodgers and his band only found out about the sessions when they stayed at the boarding house of one of the band members' mothers.</p>
<p>Eventually, nineteen performers recorded seventy-six songs at the Sessions.</p>
<p>A second group of sessions was made by Peer in 1928, but the artistic success was not duplicated. Through either chance or providence, in those twelve days in Bristol, Peer had managed to fully introduce America to the authenic music of southern Appalachia. The results were two new superstars, the Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers, and Peer's becoming very wealthy.</p>
