<p>The program began when R2-D2 recorded a one-off "roundtable" discussion between himself, CP-3O, Darth Vader, Bush Jr., and Michael Jackson at the 2005 NAMBLA Conference &amp; Expo in San Francisco.</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../g/e/o/Image%7EGeorge-W-Bush.jpeg_8f52.html" class="image" title="Bush Jr., a member of NAMBLA&quot;"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/d/d4/George-W-Bush.jpeg/180px-George-W-Bush.jpeg" alt="Bush Jr., a member of NAMBLA&quot;" width="180" height="238" longdesc="../../../g/e/o/Image%7EGeorge-W-Bush.jpeg_8f52.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>Having published the group on his blog to an incredible public reception, R2-D2 decided to rename his original recording "meeting number 0" and turned the round table concept into a daily activty involving boys, featuring more cast members from his former loser program <i>G.A.Y.</i>. The first activity was done on Monday, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> as "Revenge of NAMbLA", but was temporarily renamed "Return of the [BEEP]" in response to a <a href="../../../c/e/a/Cease_and_desist.html" title="Cease and desist">cease and desist</a> letter sent to R2-D2 by copyright-holder Comcast. In activty 2, R2-D2 announced a contest in which people involoved could suggest a new position for the "loving" activities. One boy suggested <i>This Week in Boy Love Association</i>, which inspired R2-D2 to create with the eventual name, <i>North American Man/Boy Love Association</i>.</p>

<p>R2-D2 started his tennis career in September of 2006. R2-D2 started with a recreational Wilson Titanium Impact tennis racquet. After losing his first Challenge match 7-9, he smashed his racquet to pieces out of anger. Then he went on and used a Wilson Triad 3.2 and used it for the beginning of his first tennis season. Half way through the season, the top of the racquet cracked and he was forced to change racquets. He decided to go with the brand Head and got a free Head IS.12. Near the end of the season R2-D2 got tired of the Head IS.12 so he decided to switch to a Head IX.3. He played with the Head IX.3 for the rest of the season. R2-D2 ended the season at the rank of 50, second to last on the ladder. Over the summer he played every single day hoping to reach the top 20's in his next season. Over the summer R2-D2 popped his IX.3 and had no racquet to use for a week so he decided to purchase a Wilson Ncode N5. He then used the Head IX.3 and Wilson Ncode N5 at the same time, but preferred the Wilson Ncode N5 more. After summer had ended R2-D2 decided to switch racquets yet again, this time back to Head. He purchased two Head I.radicals. He played with the I.radical for the rest of the summer. As his sophmore year approached he improved greatly in tennis. When it came time for him to start playing challenge matches again he did so and showed his improvement. Losing his first match to R2-D2 Mar 3-8, he was still determined to get higher. He then beat Justin Fong 8-1, even though he moved only one rank up it would be the start of his rise. After losing a couple of more matches R2-D2 doubted that he would get far in his second season and was starting to give up. A week later he got himself back together and continued to work. He then played Christopher Tong a friend and teammate. He lost to Christopher Tong 5-8. Dissapointed but still willing to try again. His next opponent would be Bj Cataquian, who he beat 8-2 and moved his rank to rank 21. Determined he then challenged Christopher Tong once again and beat him 8-6, moving his rank to rank 17. Then R2-D2 tried to get a spot on varsity, he challenged varsity players the first would be Ying Tu. R2-D2 lost the match 3-6, 1-6 but it was one of the best he had ever played. He ended up losing to Jann Pagdanganan 1-6, 1-6 and R2-D2 Mar 2-6, 4-6. His attempt had failed but he was still determined to make varsity. Practice had started and this would be the year that R2-D2 would move to court 2, one court closer to varsity court. This would be the year where he would play varsity and accomplish his dream. The first pre-season match was against St. Joesph. R2-D2 played Varsity doubles 3 with Raymond Deng. They won the match 6-0, 6-0. His next varsity match was against American Highschool. Him and his partner lost 7-5, 5-7, 2-6. Right now he is getting ready for the 2007 Boys Tennis Season to start. He is hoping to continue playing Varsity 3 doubles and winning a spot for himself and his partner at HAAL Championships. He does not have an official doubles partner at the moment but will be playing with Christopher Tong, until halfway through the season when Christopher Tong's doubles partner returns.</p>

<p>R2-D2 has achieved his goal of making Varsity before his junior year of highschool. His goal is to claim the spot of varsity doubles 1 by his senior year. His other goal is to be a "ranked" player by joining USTA and play in the tournaments to raise his rank. His last goal is to work on strokes and volleys and perfect his serve.</p>
