<p>Would this page not be more appropriately moved to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Armed_Forces_f475.html" title="British Armed Forces">British Armed Forces</a>? I have never heard the term <b>Military of the United Kingdom</b> (for a start, in Britain 'military' tends to specifically refer to the Army, not the other forces), but <b>British Armed Forces</b> is commonly used. <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_armed_forces_907c.html" title="United States armed forces">United States armed forces</a> is the title of the article about the US military (which ironically is a term that <i>is</i> commonly used). -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:21, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with this, and I've listed the page for a move (I can't do it myself). I have heard the phrases 'British armed forces' and 'Britain's armed forces' or, more commonly, 'British forces' many times, but never 'Military of the United Kingdom'. Possibly there might be controversy over the use of 'British' rather than 'United Kingdom' (Great Britain doesn't include Northern Ireland); if this is the case, 'United Kingdom armed forces' would be a decent second choice, although again this looks slightly odd grammatically, as if it should be 'The United Kingdom's armed forces'. <i>Armed forces of the United Kingdom</i> would be my third choice, then. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 00:04, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b>. I live in the United Kingdom and the term "military" is very rarely used when describing the British armed forces. Spending on the armed forces is "defence spending" and compulsary service is known as "national service" not "military service". Please can we change the article's title to reflect these facts. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_the_United_Kingdom_0ee2.html" title="Military of the United Kingdom">Military of the United Kingdom</a> should redirect to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_armed_forces.html" title="British armed forces">British armed forces</a> page and the title, but not the article, needs changing. <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpaajones_4ea2.html" title="User:Dpaajones">David.</a></li>

<p>Not sure where this concept of Naval Service = Royal Navy AND Royal Marines comes from. The Royal Marines is part of the Royal Navy. There is no common usage of any 'Naval Service' phrase. Maybe in some context unknown to me (ex-RN) that phrase means something. Strongly suggest that specific contexts be avoided in this global encyclopædia. Googling 'Naval Service' certainly doesnt give you links to do with the Royal Navy or Marines. Will amend (v slightly) to read this way if okay. Facius 11:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would support "British Armed Forces" if that's the official name (like <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Defence_Force_def3.html" title="Australian Defence Force">Australian Defence Force</a> for the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Australia_780c.html" title="Military of Australia">Military of Australia</a>) but I won't support "British armed forces" which I find inferior to the "Military of..." format. The article seems to suggest there are a number of alternate names so unless one of those is paramount, I think "Military of the United Kingdom" is an adequate compromise. So based on that, I don't really know which way to vote... <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 01:14, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's a link to the MOD's <a href="http://www.mod.uk/aboutus/keyfacts/factfiles/equality.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mod.uk/aboutus/keyfacts/factfiles/equality.htm" rel="nofollow">website</a> in which it quite clearly and consistently uses the capitalised term "Armed Forces" to refer to them. And to answer srs's claim above, it is completely untrue that "military" and "armed forces" are synonymous. They may be in the USA, but in Britain "military" only tends to be used as an adjective, and in most cases technically only refers to the Army and not the other services (Military Secretary and Military Attaché, for example, which only refer to army appointments - Naval and Air are used as the adjectives for similar appointments in the other two services). I would say that to use an artificial term that is not actually used in the country of origin just for consistency's sake is inappropriate and is in complete contradiction to the idea of an encyclopaedia. Do we artificially name other articles just so they look pretty in category lists? I've not noticed it. So why here particularly? -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:33, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most people in Britain would not use "Military" as a synonym for "Armed Forces", despite what the OED says. It would be looked on as an Americanism. And you will note that I used the terms "technically" and "in most cases" when describing the use of "military" as an adjective within the Armed Forces. Outside the Armed Forces it is naturally used as a basic contrast to "civilian". It is also used as an adjective to refer to the Armed Forces in general terms (as in "military aircraft") where a more specific term does not exist (obviously, since "armed forces" cannot be used adjectivally). That does not change the fact that as a technical term it refers in the UK to the Army (otherwise the Military Secretary would work for the whole Armed Forces, whereas in reality he is an Army officer and the Naval Secretary and Air Secretary are his equivalents in the RN and RAF respectively) and as a noun it is rarely used at all. I also note that you do not answer my point that the MOD website quite clearly uses Armed Forces consistently to refer to the British Armed Forces, which, without obfuscation, is actually the point at issue here. The <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2941-560,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2941-560,00.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Times</i> Style Guide</a> also says that Armed Forces should be used capitalised, incidentally. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:17, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't want to repeat what's already been said, but the use of "British Armed Forces" is the most predominant term in the UK for the military. The official title is, however, Armed Forces of the Crown but meh. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoLando_61ab.html" title="User:SoLando">SoLando</a> 15:45, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My personal view is that the term "Armed Forces" is a somewhat more passive and euphemistic term for "Military". It seems to me that its always our "Armed Forces" versus their "Military", hence my preference for some uniform naming (whether it be armed forces or military). Granted, that it's not likely that everybody else shares my perception of these words, but it does look odd when only the USA and UK pages are titled "Armed Forces" with the vast majority of the rest of the countries following the "Military of" format. I would much rather the official title is used (and if it's Armed Forces of the Crown, then so be it), and failing that, I would think that "Armed Forces of the United Kingdom" would be preferable as the country page is at <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, not <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. srs 05:30, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the exact number of personel in the regular forces as of 2007? It's been changed to 187,000 but I thought it was still around 195,000?</p>

<p>This article claims the UK has the second highest spending of any military in the world. The CIA World Factbook, [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2067rank.html|here" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2067rank.html|here" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>], places it at fifth, far below China, which it places second. Could someone enlighten me and resolve this discrepancy? If it's a matter of different definitions or something, the statement should still at least be qualifed. <a href="../../../m/y/c/User%7EMycroft7_4214.html" title="User:Mycroft7">Mycroft7</a> 00:39, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that "Gays and lesbians have been allowed to serve openly since the change of the Millennium. The British Army participates in Gay Parades and actively recruits this demographic." Seems a little non-politically correct, to say the least. Maybe, since 2000 sexual orientation has not been a factor considered in recruitment? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFeralWolf_c2bb.html" title="User:FeralWolf">FeralWolf</a> 19:40, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
