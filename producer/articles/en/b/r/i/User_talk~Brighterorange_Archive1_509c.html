<li>I think your edits are getting a lot more constructive, which is good. Do you really think that this needs to be the very first section of the article, though? The other editors aren't <i>deleting</i> it, really, but moving it into the section with all of the other conflicts. Maybe you'd achive consensus more readily by leaving it in that spot but expanding it to include the extra information. And as usual, discussing this stuff on the talk page instead of just reverting back and forth is a much better way to keep everyone from getting mad at each other and engaging in edit wars. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 22:10, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The "Problem Domain" entry is an attempt to start creating some sanity in the computer jargon world. I'm not surprised that someone really trained in math would find this obsfucating. Unfortunately you will see tons and tons of technical documents, etc. that will create these terms on the fly. The two prosaic meanings are first that the domain is the problem being discussed and second that the writer is trying to define a domain that can be used to map his problem functions. You are correct in that there is a very weak relationship to Domain Theory and this simple definition, but the point was to illustrate that there are formal disiplines that define some of these concepts that can be explored by the curious.</p>

<p>Hi Tom: saw your work on the Twelf article (via your edit on LF). I've just started to look over it: good work, and good to see you editing here. Did you know that Thorsten Altenkirch is also a Wikipedia editor (<a href="../../../t/x/a/User%7ETxa_0362.html" title="User:Txa">User:txa</a>)? I'm at Yale at the moment: I guess it's likely you know Carsten Schuermann and Jeffrey Sarnat. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 20:04, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

It's good to have some type theorists here to set the record straight.&#160;;) Jeff is a good friend of mine from CMU (I was his TA, actually!) but Carsten was outta here before I got into this stuff. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 15:27, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I suggest that, as a basic measure to reduce false positives caused by bad wiki format (unbulleted lists et al.), we filter out any article with a cleanup/cleanupsince(?) tag or a wikify tag. This way, we can add all badly formatted articles we get a headache looking at to cleanup, and filter them out as well, and also filter all articles needing cleanup. In fact, these articles seem to be the only ones generating false positives that I have seen in any number. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> 03:13, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh yeah, that's a good idea. I can't believe I didn't just think to look for those tags. I won't be able to do it until the next database dump is released, though. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 12:47, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Tom-7,</p>
<p>nice to see somebody else around here, who is interested in Type Theory. In fact I planned for a while to start a page on LF, seems you have done this. My feeling was that TWELF isn't so closely related to Martin-Loef's Type Theory hence I didn't include it. However, if you think that it should be there than that's fine with me.</p>
<p>Cheers, --<a href="../../../t/x/a/User%7ETxa_0362.html" title="User:Txa">Thorsten</a> 19:06, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, I didn't make the LF page, but I started the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelf.html" title="Twelf">Twelf</a> one and then added links wherever "Twelf" appeared (including the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_Martin-L%C3%B6f_2896.html" title="Per Martin-Löf">Per Martin-Löf</a> article). I don't know if there is a strong relationship between Martin-Löf's Type Theory and Twelf, but certainly his judgmental methodology has heavily influenced the design of LF, so there is definitely a connection at that level. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 19:52, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi! I noticed the pictures that you recently uploaded to some of the knot pages. They look really nice, and improve the articles a lot. You might want to upload the pictures into the Wikimedia <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Commons</a> so that they can be easily used in other projects as well. I have been planning on adding pictures to the knot pages for some time, and recently got a digital camera and was going to start today (with the midshipmans hitch, which I noticed is on your to do list). Perhaps you and I can work together to make the knot pages, and the illustrations on them more standardized and easy to follow. I was hoping to do step by step photos, but I haven't seen, or been able to think of a nice way to put them in the articles. If you have any ideas please let me know. Thanks! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarfoxy_685c.html" title="User:Starfoxy">Starfoxy</a> 01:01, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks, I'm glad you like them. The pictures I uploaded are already on the commons. (or am I missing something?) Anyway, there is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Knots_2c3f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Knots">Wikiproject for knots</a>, but it seems inactive, and the knot pages are in general pretty poor. I'd be happy to be part of a revival, especially on picture duty... but this month I am going to be pretty busy with other stuff. BTW, if you take knot pictures, for God's sake don't use a flash! (This is a really common problem with object photos on wikipedia in general... I don't understand why people do this.) The pictures will come out much better if you just tripod mount the camera and take the picture under natural lighting. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 02:44, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi - Noticed your comments on the Richard Rose page where you recommended deletion. I provided some additional information on his notability and non-self-promotion at my WP talk page here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sharnish" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sharnish" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I'm wondering whether you might accidently know some students in the Richard Rose discusion groups in Pittsburgh - there are activie groups of university students and graduates there that study his books and ideas. I have contacted the organization to see whether they could make the article more suitable for the WP format. Happy to provide any more information you would care to see. Best wishes. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharnish_cf92.html" title="User:Sharnish">Sharnish</a> 18:34, 22 September 2005 (UTC) Steve Harnish, Miami, FL.</p>

<li>Hi, Steve. What would convince me is some kind of objective verifiable evidence of his notability, which I would be happy to accept. Are there sales figures for his books, or membership rolls for his organization? As it is, I understand that he is a man who has published a few books, and has some (perhaps interesting to you) ideas, and has formed an organization. There are many of such people. By the way, even if the article is deleted, it would be fine to recreate it with new content; myself and others would be much more likely to vote to keep an article that is simply written in a more encyclopedic way, even without more information about notability. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 19:09, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difficulty is that the subject is "esoteric" which by definition is not integrated into popular culture. RR was never into building an organization and he lived on a shoestring his entire life. He insisted that the groups, of which there were many, were operated in the same manner. The groups (1970s, 1980s) were largely concentrated in universities in the Northeast (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maryland, West Virginia are the ones I remember right now) but there were also active groups in Colorado, California, North Carolina and Florida. After he was hospitalized with Alzheimers in the mid 1990s, many of the organizations fizzled, but some thrived, notable the Self Knowledge Symposium at universities in North Carolina, which had hundreds of members. RR advocated a very personal approach and his many lectures were attended by hundreds of people, many of whom benefitted in their personal lives from his influence but couldn't commit to weekly meetings, etc. This may sound like BS but if you've read Gurdjieff, he talks about a conscious circle of humanity, who's influence is not known to the general public, but which filters down through other writers, authors, etc. This may be more understandable if you know something about his methods: While he had a side-splitting sense of humor and wit, one of his primary tools was what he called "confrontation," which he used in an extremely subtle manner, and which eventually laid bare all the falsehoods that human beings typically hide within themselves. This is why he was called a Zen master, even though he was very critical of mainstream Zen, and also why he doesn't fit into any neat category. There was absolutely nothing phoney about the man. Consequently, only the most determined indivuals would stay with him for long. However, this produced the further result that he attracted the cream of the crop of thinkers and researchers. Specific to your question, to my understanding there are about 150 actual "members" in the TAT Foundation, but these are spread around the country, where they have their own study groups, which people attend without becoming actual members. I don't know whether they will release book sales figures. The organizations are on an upswing right now as some of the older students finally feel they are ready to teach. I agree with you on the re-write of the article. It could be an opportunity for the organization to produce a cogent analysis of his philosophy and methods. I have recommended that the authors revise it, but it's not my call. (And if I ask them too hard they might draft me into it!) What comes to mind are the instances of famous artists and musicians (e.g. Van Gough) who weren't widly known in their lifetime but whose work gradually became recognized, as RR's is sarting to be, even attracting some international attention (England, Australia). Hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharnish_cf92.html" title="User:Sharnish">Steve Harnish</a> 19:51, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I'd say that 'esoteric' is basically the opposite of 'notable'. If his importance only extends to a few hundred people, then that is pretty marginal by wikipedia standards. (I could claim, for instance, to have taught hundreds of students, but that certainly doesn't make me notable.) Still, I think your effort is better spent fixing the article than trying to convince individual Wikipedia editors to vote for it. I'll generally vote to keep a good article even if the subject is marginal, because Wikipedia is not paper. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 20:02, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Appreciate your reading all this. But if popularity is the standard applied, Madonna might be considered notable but Albert Einstein, in his early years, would not heve been. Personally I have no interest in pop culture but many do, by definition. I'd make a distinction then between "notable" and "worthy of note," which carries more of a connation of influential, sub-rosa, which is a better definition of "esoteric" as indicated above. Albert Einstein didn't have much time for teaching, so he taught only the next level below him, those able to grasp his ideas quickly, so his influence at the beginning was ony indirect. Esoteric philosophy, as well as nuclear theory 100 years ago, command pretty wide interest, but if you don't run in those circles they may not seem to warrant your attention. (Or even some arcane aspects of programming, shown in your profile, or the nanotechnology research up at Carnegie Mellon, which I follow.) Anyway, my real intent is to coax the author (or others) into doing a rewrite, which appears to be where the consensus is heading. It just may take some time, which is why I'm trying to avoid deletion of the entry altogether for now. Thanks again. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharnish_cf92.html" title="User:Sharnish">Steve Harnish</a> 20:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's right, Albert Einstein in his early years would probably not have been considered notable. Fortunately, important people have a way of being recognized for their work, sometimes after they are dead, and once someone is recognized, then he obviously deserves a Wikipedia article. If, as you suggest, Rose becomes as influential as Einstein, then I have no doubt that any wikipedia editors would vote to keep an article about him. But we needn't anticipate such notability to be fair or comprehensive today. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 21:51, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok. Maybe we will have to agree to disagree. I've checked the WP policies and they say there is no agreed (consensus) definition for "notable," which appears to be what is separating us here. Without beating dead horse, a couple of questions: 1) Do you have any interest in esoteric philosophy, meaning a direct path to self-knowledge? 2) Does notable in your mind mean commonplace or does it mean distinguished? Thanks. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharnish_cf92.html" title="User:Sharnish">Steve Harnish</a> 00:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) I have specific disinterest in Rose's philosophy based on what I have now read. I admit this bias. However, that does not affect my position much; I have many times voted to keep articles about people whose views I disagree with or find uninteresting. (2) Neither. Being commonplace generally implies notability, but it is not the only way something can be notable. Being distinguished depends on the compared set; someone who is distinguished out of all humans is certainly notable, but someone who is distinguished in his office or local government probably is not. Yes, notability eludes easy definition, but that is why we use discussion to establish consensus on WP. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 02:37, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm very sorry to have to bother you about this again, and I hope it will be the last time. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.253.195.228_17a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.253.195.228">69.253.195.228</a> has made some recent edits to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile">the eXile</a> which I am particularly displeased with. Since your are familiar with the article and its talk page, there's no need for any "my side of the story" -- I think these edits speak for themselves. I would like to point out the total lack of justification on the talk page, however, and the relevance of previous talk page material on the stuff that was edited in/out, which seems to have been ignored.</p>
<p>I'm honestly not sure what to do. So far consensus on the talk page has been an effective way of maintaining and improving the quality of the page despite blanking and blatant disregard for the rules (I won't say that none of this ip's edits have been productive, though all have required re-editing of some sort), but I can't keep policing what I feel to be borderline vandalism forever. This user seems to have no regard whatsoever for <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a>, seems to be editing only eXile - related pages, and only to introduce a certain yellow journalistic critical style of their subjects (not that his edits never contain useful information, or that his criticisms are never valid).</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said, I'm kind of stumped. I'm asking for your assistance not only because you're an administrator who has the abilitiy to enforce consensus, but also because you seem to have some experience in dealing with these kinds of things. I don't think blocking him for any considerable period of time, or demanding that all his edits be approved first on the talk page, would be in the spirit of wikipedia (or the letter of its policies). Also I've never started an RfC and it seems like too much trouble, and probably overkill on a problem that still might be solved via dialogue. If this were a registered user with many edits on different topics, I would suggest arbitration, but since he has existed here only to willfuly introduce his POV (see his contributions) I feel I would be talking to a wall. However I do think someone needs to make it clear to him that his edits have been inappropriate. I don't think I'm the one for this job, since he seems to bear me some animosity, and never responds to my posts on his talk page (which are generally vain attempts to convince him to indent, start new topics, and sign on talk pages). Anyway thanks for the sanity checks you've provided in the past, and for any help you could provide in the future. <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 00:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>In truth, I've only been an administrator for a month or so—so I haven't been involved in resolving too many major conflicts, and none yet in the capacity of administrator. I don't think it's true that administrators have the ability to "enforce consensus." (We can enforce rulings of RfAr, but there's been no such ruling here...). That said, I agree with you and I think you have a good attitude about it (and I know how hard it is to be patient with frustrating users!). I don't think that an RfC is overkill (although it is also something I've never done) given Ekman's dedication to reverting the page. But, the article has improved and so has the conduct of the editors involved, so it may be that continuing as you have will result in an article that everyone can be okay with.

<dd>Thanks for your help. I read up a bit more on RfC and I think it could be the best way. I'm not having much luck through dialogue. I think that's good advice about taking a break. I'm going to leave off for a few days, not because I think the problem will be resolved somehow (though you never know), but just because this really <i>is</i> starting to annoy me and I want to have a cool head before submitting an RfC.

<dd>Good call. If it's any consolation, the vast majority of wikipedia conflicts do get resolved. [unscientific observation] It'd be a shame to have a level-headed editor such as yourself get burned out!

<p>Hi. I am new to Wikipedia and I have two questions. I saw your edits on <a href="../../../w/i/t/Without_Looking_Down_9a2b.html" title="Without Looking Down">Without Looking Down</a>. I think that some of that material you removed might be appropriate to keep since a synopsis of the artists objectives would be a reasonable thing to have, but I am not sure how much? ok, I guess i only have 1 questions but maybe you have more than 1 answers? <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJars_of_Gray_01cc.html" title="User:Jars of Gray">Jars of Gray</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I think the page should be expanded, but the text that was there should not be. There are two important things to keep in mind if you do expand it. First is the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view policy</a>, which means that the text can't be a <i>review</i> of the music, saying how great it is, or how bad it is, or whatever. Since this is an encyclopedia, we only deal with neutral facts. (The text I deleted was rife with violations of this!) The second thing to keep in mind is the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>, which means that we only deal with <i>verifiable</i> facts. It might be true that the artist was thinking a certain thing when he wrote a certain song, but in order to say that in a Wikipedia article, we need to provide a verifiable reference. I think it would be extremely hard to fix what I deleted, which is why I deleted it instead of adding <i>cleanup</i> tags. But this said, if you want to do the work to create a neutral, verifiable article about this album, by all means please do it! And thanks for helping Wikipedia! <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 15:20, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>During the 10 November AfD discussion, Voice of All(MTG) moved the list to the new article name <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">sexual slang</a>, citing the introduction at the top of the list as the basis for the move ("it is more than a list").

<p>When an article is moved, the change history is moved with it, and a redirect is placed under the original article's title. If the redirect is edited, then the article cannot be moved back.

<ol>
<li>On Oct 18 the list was nominated for AfD (article for deletion), but this attempt to delete failed, and the vote was overwhelmingly to Keep.</li>
<li>An anonymous sock-puppet placed a clean-up notice on the list. It has been used as a justification to delete entries.</li>
<li>On Nov 10, The Literate Engineer made an AfD attempt against the list and it failed too.</li>
<li>Then Voice of All(MTG) underhandedly moved the list to the non-list name <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">sexual slang</a>, while the AfD was still underway.</li>
<li>Voice of All(MTG)reported false results for the 10 November AfD vote, and he and The Literate Engineer edited out the entire list.</li>
<li>I posted a rebuttal to the above antics on the talk page for sexual slang, and reverted the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">sexual slang</a> article to the November 15 version in the article's change history (the complete list). My username ("Bend over") was banned as inappropriate or offensive.</li>
<li>Some editors stated that an article is not the place for a list, and used that as a justification to keep list entries.</li>
<li>So I replaced the redirect at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang.html" title="List of sexual slang">List of sexual slang</a> with the actual content of the entire list. Unfortunately, the change history for the list is still part of the change history for the article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">sexual slang</a>.</li>
<li>An attempt is being made to protect the list against vandalism at its original location: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang.html" title="List of sexual slang">List of sexual slang</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the three reversion limit does not apply when reverting vandalism. Only if enough concerned users participate will this be successful.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_Archive1_509c.html" title="Edit section: Exile Revisited">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exile Revisited</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile"><i>The eXile</i></a> page is again embroiled in the question of whether or not the Exile can used a source for "what has been published in the Exile", but now it is possible the debate is having consequences for the rest of Wikipedia. My position is the same as yours: "the eXile <i>is absolutely a reliable source</i> about what itself has published" . <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> disagrees and contends that the Exile can sometimes be used as a reputable source for what they have published and sometimes not, depending on whether or not the Exile is talking about somebody else. She has claimed this distinction arises directly from Wikipedia policy. I have asked her to explicitly justify this distinction. Instead of referring to the section of the policy she believes justifies her interpretation, her first response was editing the guidelines page for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> after the fact to suit her immediate interests. Then on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_eXile_5c26.html" title="Talk:The eXile">article's talk page</a> she refered to this guidelines page as established Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>The policy she advocates, as she advocates it, is vague and superficially benign by blurring the distinction between stating "what a tabloid has printed as fact" and stating "what a tabloid has printed as what that tabloid has printed". The example she provides on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, however, is specifically tailored to advance her agenda on the Exile page.</p>
<p>If this precedent were accepted, it would be detrimental to many Wikipedia pages including the Exile specifically. For instance, this new policy would allow for the Pavel Bure lawsuit to be described, but prohibit a quote from the Exile newspaper of the alledgedly libelous statement that the Exile was being sued for. Thus, SlimVirgin's proposal would deprive users of relevant information and ensure a biased portrayal of the Exile. There are other weaknesses to her proposal as you might expect from a policy chosen because of its immediate convenience rather than its long-term consequences. (some might call it "legislating from the police station").</p>
<p>I spend time formulating my arguments to make them clear and reasonable. When this admininstrator abdicates argument and then gins up the guidelines page to suit her own immediate interests and says to me "That's the policy" I interprete this as a sign of contempt for the resolution process that Wikipedia advocates. It's a sophisticated equivalent of saying "I'm right, you're wrong, so shut up."</p>
<p>So to cut to the chase:</p>
<p>1) Would you comment on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>? SlimVirgin is under the impression that her viewpoints have widespread support and I don't think this is the case.</p>
<p>2) What are the standards that administrators are held to?</p>

<p>G'day Tom,</p>
<p>fair enough. I am trying to get people to make more detailed nominations (as opposed to "nn d ~~~~" or, on one very special occasion, "delete per nom ~~~~), so that, instead of making "non-notable" as a blanket statement, we actually say <i>why</i> we think something's non-notable. 97% of stuff that appears on AfD is drek, but the 3% that doesn't (and the proportion of the drek that has a creator who actually cares about his work) really deserves a good explanation for why we want it delete. I think good nominations are an important habit to get into, and am trying to nudge people in that direction by a) setting a good example myself, when I nominate stuff, and b) constructive criticism.</p>
<p>You make a good point, though. I've been unnecessarily prickly on AfD recently, to the point where "constructive" above could be replaced with "uncivil". I am sorry I caused offence, and I will try to put more effort into my own comments in future :-).

<li>I added your user page to my watchlist; the vandalism was a bit too long ago (and from shared IPs, alas) for blocking to do any good. But I'll keep on the lookout now. Actually, it seems the best strategy for user page vandalism is to quickly revert it, and wear it as a sort of badge of honor. (Many users even keep a count of how many times their page has been vandalized!) As for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Ames_d742.html" title="Mark Ames">Mark Ames</a>, I've never sprotected a page before, so I'm not quite comfortable doing it unless there is obvious persistent vandalism (perhaps some day when I become a more grizzled admin ;)). Despite how controversial he is, we actually see a lot more vandalism at, like <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jellyfish.html" title="Jellyfish">Jellyfish</a> (??). It seems like it is more just revert-warring going on now—I agree the 82-anon's edits are strange and not backed up by discussion, but I don't think it qualifies as vandalism. But this page is on my watchlist too now. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 19:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the input at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMark_Ames_5bbe.html" title="Talk:Mark Ames">talk:Mark Ames</a>. I guess you're right, protection might be premature. As for my user page, I didn't mean the outright vandalism (that was quite long ago, and I didn't mind reverting it myself, nothing like logging on to find my user page reading "fuck you fagot[sic]" in the morning), but rather the comments today under the sections "Re: Budapest page arrogance" e.g. 'You are not intellectual...You are very likely a Zionist shill paid to police the internet media by your ideologic handlers...' etc. etc., which I felt constitued a personal attack.

<dd>What I mean is, people almost always call it the "ICFP Programming Contest" rather than the "ICFP Contest", but that expanding the acronym to "International Conference on Functional Programming Programming Contest" is rather awkward.

<p>I respect your advice about high resolution images. I thank you and will learn to upload larger versions. I grew up when the Internet was so slow that large images were to be avoided if possible. Old habits die hard.</p>
<p>However, I don't think we should display an image where both ends of the large rope are lost to view. The whole point is to emphasize the importance of passing the line first round the short end of the larger rope. I have larger images and will insert a replacement if you approve.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback and comments about uploading images. As you appreciated, I'm still learning about Wikipedia. I'm not quite sure how to load images to the Commons.</p>
<p>My larger images do not have any text on them. The originals are mostly 2000 x 1500 or greater. This seems way too high and I can scale them What is recommended?</p>
<p>All the images were prepared for my website:</p>

<p>It is a non-commerical, advertisement-free site. It is becoming very popular and I get a steady stream of thanks. With this in mind I feel comfortable providing links on the knots pages. I would value your reassurance that you feel this is both useful and appropriate.</p>

<li>Please do upload the highest resolution that you have—2000x1500 is great! You just want to make sure the images are no larger than 5 megabytes or so. Wikipedia scales them down to an appropriate size to display on the pages, so you don't need to worry about download speeds. Higher resolution is always better for archiving, printing, and as we get higher-resolution monitors in the future. To upload on the commons, just head to an image that doesn't exist yet, like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Double_sheet_bend_bothends.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Double_sheet_bend_bothends.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> and you are given the option to upload it, just like on Wikipedia. Then you can just use the [[Image:whatever.jpg|thumb|right|caption]] syntax to include it in an article. Also, yes, I support adding links to your site on the knot articles, though some may see this as self-promotion, so you might be a bit careful. =) <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 18:42, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.

<p>Three "editors" hardly constitutes a consensus. In addition, I encourage <i>you</i> to take a nice hard look at the history page, since several other editors have made changes to the page and have had no such problem with the disputed problem. It seems to be only you and a <b>small</b> group of uninformed others. I look forward to hearing yet another unreasonable response from you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.76.120.122 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.76.120.122.html" title="User talk:68.76.120.122">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.76.120.122_aa6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.76.120.122">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>I am simply asking for you to make the case for the paragraph on the talk page, rather than adding it without discussion; three editors surely counts as consensus when there are <i>no</i> other voices. I am not trying to start a fight. <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 00:57, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't others speak when they allow the article to remain as is? They approve with their silence. What case do you ask I make on the subject? That group is a contemporary meeting very similar to the Inklings of Lewis. The group signifies the modern day influence of Lewis's Inklings, and therefore it deserves a spot in the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think so, because not every editor that makes a small edit to an article will take the time to edit the entire article. None expressed support when I solicited opinions about these paragraphs on the talk page (and I still encourage you to do so). I'm only asking that the paragraph be held to the same standards of notability as the rest of Wikipedia is. An example of a case being made for it would be a verifiable source (see the policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) that indicates the group's notability. Also, are you a member of this group? <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 03:16, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a former member of the club, whether or not that information is relevant puzzles me. For the final time: <b>the disputed paragraph of the article is pertinent information due to the fact that it is a contemporary influence of the Inklings, inspirations and effects of groups (i.e. bands or literary discussion groups) is important and useful information. This is completely applicable in this case also.</b> I understand your responsibility as an administrator of Wiki, and appreciate the hard work you put into stopping vanity - this is not such a case. This, I am sorry to say, cannot be backed up by a source since the club tries to keep a low profile (similar to Lewis'), and does not have a club homepage. The reason for this is that it is a semi-selective club, and seeks only to be home to those of the highest intellectual status. ειρηνη 68.76.120.122 00:21, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>From what you say, this is then a violation of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">wikipedia policy about verifiability</a>, which is one of the core policies that decide what can be included in the encyclopedia. I recommend that you read that page—relevance and/or pertinence doesn't even come up if the information isn't at a minimum verifiable. The reason that it is relevant to the discussion that you are a former member of the group is that you therefore have a self interest in its promotion. Writing about one's own group is not forbidden on Wikipedia, but it is <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_bad_article_ideas_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas">discouraged</a>. <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 00:33, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Saying I "have a self interest in its promotion" could not be any further from the truth; if I wanted that I would go back to high school and "spread the word" there, or start my own Inklings club at college. In addition: "the reason that it is relevant to the discussion that you are a former member of the group," is your own opinion, once again I have several times (ibid) stated the relevance of the included information. I encourage you to once again read why (as I have provided) this information is relevant, and to review those somes guidelines on vanity which you hoped would handcuff me into submitting to you, but on the contrary only gave me more proof for the credibility of that paragraph. In the meantime, since correcting every minute error and looking for every single violation of Wikipedia policy there are 1,000,000 other articles that you can take your time on.</p>

</ul>
<p>Please check the history of the Inklings article and you will see that the disputed paragraph was not included by me. So this inclusion by me (after you continually remove it) is not in violation of Wikipedia's discouraged article ideas. Also, please be sure to verify both: the Inklings society based in Aachen, and The Wade Center, located at Wheaton College</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to distinguish anonymous editors; I apologize for the assumption. Based on what you say about the group's notability, it seems likely that the paragraph was originally added by someone else associated with the group. In any case, re-inserting information about a group you were a member of is just as bad. But aside from all that, the information you add absolutely needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, meaning there must exist <i>some</i> source; this is wikipedia policy. <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 03:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, Wonder if you can answer me a quick querie.</p>
<p>I have recently started working my way through the dump files from the period bot, and i noticed that there are some that were started a couple of months ago, and no sign of anything been done.</p>
<p>Are we allowed to take over and complete these to help finish off the round?</p>
<p><br />
Cheers</p>

<p>Cool, it will be good to get through them, and with it being the easter holidays and me being a college student, i've got quite a bit of time, so probably can get through 2 or 3 a day at least. So i could get a long way to getting that september dump finished!</p>
