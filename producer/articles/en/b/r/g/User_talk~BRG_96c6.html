<p>Hello BRG, <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a> here and I want to ask you something as someone who also makes baseball edits on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_db2d.html" title="User:Jimbo">Jimbo</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_Beesley_e0b3.html" title="User:Angela Beesley">Angela</a> have made a new webstie called <a href="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a>. This link in particular will take you to the baseball Wikicity. As you'll see it's similar to Wikipedia, but my hope is this will allow baseball fans to do more and different things, like reporting on games, in depth statistics, create mulitple pages for pictures, and whatever else baseball fans care to create. You've done great work on Wikipedia and I was hoping you could help get this baseball Wikicity off the ground. Please let me know what you think either at my talk page, or you can email me at terry@wikia.com.

<p>Hi BRG, thanks for your response and questions about baseball on Wikicities. I agree with everyone that Wikipedia is a great place to make baseball contributions - I do a fair amount of that myself. My hope for baseball on Wikicities is that baseball fans will have a lot more variety of things on which they can contribute. Wikipedia of course is encyclopedic, so the content must conform to these standards. Wikicities is more of a fan site, so my thoughts are that users will have a place to do reporting on games they saw, a place to speculate on how the upcoming baseball seaoson will turn out, show their own statistical analaysis, share their game photographs more than is allowed on Wikipedia, or anything else that seems like a good idea. I understand your time contraints, but just be sure to remember the Baseball Wikicity and come and contribute when time allows. Thanks again. <b><a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man"><font color="green">Googie Man</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoogie_man_7073.html" title="User talk:Googie man"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b>, 14:16, 9 January 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>There is an unholy mess in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> article regarding a section entitled "cultural identity." Most of the editors agree that the state is a Northern one, and many facts have been posted and adequately cited to prove that fact. A Confederate sympathizer, however, is constantly going onto the article, removing cited information, and replacing it with unsourced "statistics" that steer Maryland into the Southern category. Please read the whole debate, weigh in, and please, PLEASE, help. History21</p>

<dd>You asked on BD2412's talk page how this is done. Basically, you create a link to User talk:BRG/archive 1 (or whichever number is appropriate) at the top of your talk page. This makes a redlink you can edit. Edit your talk page; also edit the redlinked archive; cut as much talk as you find stale or inconvenient from the chief page, and paste it into the archive; save 'em both. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:32, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hildegarde recorded Darling,Je Vous Aime, Beaucoup on May 20, 1935.</p>
<p>I think it should be returned to the 1935 in music page.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>John Rogers</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was first recorded in England. 1936 may be the US date of publication. My date comes from Rust's Complete Entertainment Discography.</p>
<p>If you go to www.britishpathe.com and search on Hildegarde, you can download a video of Hildy performing the song. The site gives the video date as 6 June 1935.</p>

<p>I prefer the band infobox because it doesn't have the date of birth and death, which is already mentiond at the beiginning of the article, and in MY opinion makes the infobox appear cleaner. However the reason I revert back from your infobox is that it is improperly formatted with a lovely "}}" at the start of the article. Usually I would fix this but I can't find the fault in your infobox formatting, so I am just reverting it back to the band infobox. Maybe you can double check it agian and see the problem.

<p>I agree with you wholeheartadly, we need more information on this kind of music on Wikipedia, and it would be better if we worked together, and yes, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_Como_4c82.html" title="Perry Como">Perry Como</a> is indeed the best singer and Sinatra is probably a step down. Now about the infobox, I changed it to another one althogether, its called the artist infobox or something but it includes all the information the singer infobox has and the brith name and website, so I think its better, and there are no {{ at the start if the article. If you dont like it you can revert it back. Thanks--<a href="../../../s/i/c/User%7ESicamous_b4d6.html" title="User:Sicamous">Sicamous</a> 14:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good Idea, I was not aware that there was a [[&lt;year&gt; in music]] page, I will try to get all my LP pages in their respective years. There are also Category's, "Category:1953 albums" or "Category:Perry Como albums", for example that can be put at the bottom of an appropriate artcle which links to another page with albums from that year or albums by that artist. As for the linking to the songs I thought a lot of them would be quite obscure, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Room_c899.html" title="Blue Room">Blue Room</a> for example and without and article, but I notice that most of these songs have articles (mostly by you)so I will do some linking. And as for being young, you just try to listen to a band like <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disturbed.html" title="Disturbed">Disturbed</a>, then you'll know why I like Como and Crosby and those guys who actually have talent. --<a href="../../../s/i/c/User%7ESicamous_b4d6.html" title="User:Sicamous">Sicamous</a> 18:14, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently you have created a number of redirects to non-existent articles. They seem to be alternate capitalizations of titles. Please don't do this. Redirects to non-existent pages shouldn't exist and meet the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. The problem with them is that they mask the fact that there isn't an article. Blue links should always take you to an article. Red links indicate that an article isn't present and needs to be written. When you redirect to a non-existent article, you hide the fact that an article needs to be written and confuse readers who click on a link expecting an article. If the link capitalization is wrong, simply fix the link. I've deleted these redirects. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 15:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You added Cathy Carr to the Stage Names list as below. Can you cite a source to substantiate this? (It really matters!) The SSDI doesn't show matches on either name: Cathy Carr (Angelina Helen Catherine Cordovano) Died 11-?-1988 ( Pop ) Born 6-28-1936 in New York City, NY, U.S. (She had a hit with,"Ivory Tower" and charted with "First Anniversary" and "Heart Hideaway").</p>
<p>Second, shouldn't the real name also be shown in the main entry under the stage name?</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you, but you are a member of AIW and I have to appeal to you for help. Deletionists are trying disenfranchise those of us who believe that all established and verifiable secondary schools are significant enough to be kept or at least merged. If you agree that it is not an "aburd" belief to hold, please give your opinion here: <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_September_22_b6fa.html#Finger_Lakes_Christian_School" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 September 22">Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_September_22#Finger_Lakes_Christian_School</a> <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:32, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at the discussion, it seems that it was not even proper to delete it based on the vote. That alone gives me reason to restore it, regardless of what I think of the school. -- <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 18:04, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Copying this from my own talk page as I'm not sure if you're watching)</p>
<p>Hi BRG, I didn't move the article as such - there were actually two seperate articles, one called Classic pop and one called Traditional pop, discussing the same basic "genre"/style of music. The article on Classic pop had significantly more information, so I merged Traditional pop into it. I've no objection whatsoever to Traditional pop being the overall title, so if that's the consensus feel free to change it&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../o/b/j/User%7EObjectiveBrit_38b3.html" title="User:ObjectiveBrit">Matthew Humphreys</a> 15:20, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BRG, I could use your help. I've just discovered that you had written an entry for this song. I have a personal connection to it, as you'll be able to see from the "edit" page for that title. I decided to expand your stub. I've added many more recordings and actually deleted one. (You listed a date - 1934 - which was before the song was written and copyrighted.) However, I don't have easy access to original recording dates, as I only have CD compilations and original sheet music. I'd appreciate your adding any that you might know. Thanks! -- Apace361</p>

<p>Hi, so sorry to have accidentally "stepped on" your work while you "weren't around." It took me a while to investigate the problem that cropped up with you. These things happen.<br /></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061111153400&amp;limit=3&amp;target=BRG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20061111153400&amp;limit=3&amp;target=BRG" rel="nofollow">Click this link.</a> It shows the edits you made on 11/11 to three <i>variants</i> on "I Can't Give You . . ." (link above), but without any "target" stub article yet created for the song itself. It turns out I'm a (struggling) musician, and song titles like this (that is, complete sentences) drive me nuts. I assume the original published version of the song doesn't capitalize the word "but". Be that as it may. In any case, be advised that according to my research, for six calendar days no work was done on the item(s) in question (in whatever form), until I came along and "cleaned up" after you on 11/17 as you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Give_You_Anything_But_Love&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Give_You_Anything_But_Love&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_I_Can%27t_Give_You_Anything_but_Love%2C_Baby_5e41.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby">These</a> are the pages that already linked (directly or not) to the song title you're using currently, which still didn't have its own article yet on 11/17. I don't know how old those "backlinks" are, but obviously there was a justification for an article on the song. Creating the stub "target" article <i>first</i>, and then fixing up the redirects, would avoid any well-meaning but clumsy intervention by folks like me. I'm sorry you were time-constrained, by the way.</p>
<p>That doesn't explain how I stumbled across "I Can't Give You..." in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/o/Special%7EBrokenRedirects_7a07.html" title="Special:BrokenRedirects">The Broken Redirects special page</a> is where it/they (<i>all</i>) turned up. This page gets updated every so often, and users pitch in and investigate the broken redirects. <i>There are a lot.</i> You are justified in stating the redirs I made pointing to the show "Ain't Misbehavin" were useless, except consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Person 1:</i> "You know that song, I think the title is, I can't give you anything but love?"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Person 2:</i> "Oh, wasn't that in Ain't Misbehavin'? "</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Person 3:</i> "That's right, I saw that show."</li>
</ul>
<p>(end of exchange)</p>
<p>If that's all somebody knew about the song, and they were a wikipedia user, but not a musician, that might probably be useful enough information <i>for them</i>.</p>
<p>Sorry again, I'll keep an eye out for song titles and your username henceforth. Now I'm going to go have some well-deserved leftovers.</p>
