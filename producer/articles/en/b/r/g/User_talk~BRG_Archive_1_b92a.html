If you are interested in working on any of the science textbook pages please feel free, assuming they open up <a href="http://textbook.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://textbook.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://textbook.wikipedia.org</a> there will be shortly parts of an organic chemistry book and then college physics.

<p>Thanks for the Fort Washington page, I've partially updated iy I wanted to let you know what I'm up to before I move it. We eventually need a real article describing Fort Washington capture by the British (Nov 1776), so I'm going to move yours to a (disambiguatioon) subtitle and cerate at least a stub for the battle. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 16:35 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">disambiguation</span></h2>
<p>Please stop creating broken links to MAJOR British towns and cities. Where one placename is principally associated with one location we use placename (disambiguation) to list the others and add a disambiguation notice at the top of the page with the ambiguous name, as per <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>. You edited <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington%2C_London%2C_England_e8da.html" title="Paddington, London, England">Paddington, London, England</a> creating broken links for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a>. These are the two principal cities in Wales with populations of over 200,000. Similarly you edited <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Road_Numbering_Scheme_c862.html" title="British Road Numbering Scheme">British Road Numbering Scheme</a> placing Holyhead in England, when it is in fact in Wales. Also Exeter is an ancient city, nearly two thousand years old with a population of over 100,000 unlike the one-horse truck stops you have listed on the Exeter pages. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 07:37 9 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exeter has 2000 years of history, a cathedral, a university and an international airport associated with it, as well as a population at least 10 times larger than and of those on "Exeter (disambiguation)" it is not "jerkwater town in England.". A quick google search shows that 35 of the first 50 hits refer to the English Exeter. Wikipedia is an international resource and should take an international perspective, not a purely North American one. As such Exeter in Devon is by far the most commonly referred to use of the word. My main point was that you created broken links with Cardiff and Swansea. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>The point, that you don't seem to be grasping, is that in the majority of cases when people want to look up Exeter they want the city in Britain. With nearly 2000 years of history it comes up quite a lot in various subjects, whereas the other Exeters do not. The long established convention is that where a place is significantly more well known than the others it takes precedence. Whether it is significantly large or not is not nearly as important. For example <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> in Britain is significantly more well known to people throughout the world than the other Cambridges and its population in 2001 was 108,863. Please learn the conventions. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 18:13 9 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your use of the term "jerkwater town" is extremely insulting and I have tried to ignore it, but you persist. What you are saying is that YOU have never heard of Exeter. This is your problem. Perhaps you should read <a href="http://www.exeter.gov.uk/timetrail/generic/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exeter.gov.uk/timetrail/generic/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and enlighten yourself. Whatever, my point remains that the word Exeter is most associated with Exeter in Britain, and this is the convention. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>Stop it with your blanket reversions and read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28city_names%29_425d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (city names)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (city names)</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>BRG this isn't how we do things around here. We don't just blunder in and make blanket reversions. We discuss things and reach a reasonable consensus. At the moment the consensus of opinion agreed some time ago over <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a> is that where a place is significantly associated with one particular place it takes precedence, now if you would be so kind as to cease making arbitary changes and discuss it. There is no need to get so uncooperative and make statments like <b>revert (once again, until you darned well give up, Mintguy!))</b>. this is not very constructive or helpful. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 14:51 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>What the hell are you doing renaming towns and cities with <i>St.</i> to <i>Saint</i>.

<p>Not according to the maps I have. Whether the US government uses St. or Saint doesn't matter a damn. If the official map says St. then things go in as St, PERIOD. You have been mucking up names of cities all over the place and breaking links all over the place with renamings that go against the agreed conventions that hundreds of wiki users use. If you want to change a convention, propose it and have it debated first.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bernie Williams</span></h2>
<p>How you doing BRG? I read the edit you made to the page and I think it's alright to point out that there is a difference between the two William's, even though I think that by reading the first version it's pretty clear. However, I reverted the title back to its original title because in the very first sentence of the article it states very clearly that "this " Bernie Williams was born on Sept. 13, 1968, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It doesn't seem proper norm to include the date of birth in the main title. Are you a Yankees fan? When I was a kid and lived in New York I got to meet the old yankee great ones. Recently I spent some time with Bernie and Joe Torre. Well take care, your friend in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">User:Marine 69-71</a></p>
<p>BRG, Now I understand and you're right. Hey, whenever you want to talk about baseball, especially about them Yanks, drop me a line. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">User:Marine 69-71</a></p>
<p>I'd recommend putting the article back under Bernie Williams, with a stub on the same page for the earlier player. I'm not sure the previous Bernie Williams would merit a separate article, but if there were one it could be included in the same way as you'll find on the page for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Baker_1707.html" title="Frank Baker">Frank Baker</a>. In cases where both players are more prominent, I'd have separate pages (see <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Thomas_28dc.html" title="Frank Thomas">Frank Thomas</a>), but I'm not aware of any notable accomplishments for the first one (at least not in the majors). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 13:11, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right. New Order are one of the biggest selling bands in Europe. Blue Monday is the biggest selling 12" vinyl of all time. It defined modern dance music. Fats Domino, on the other hand, is basically unknown outside of the United States, to the point that I, who DJ and hence have to know quite a lot about music, got his name wrong. There is also currently no article on his track of the same name, or indeed any album that it is on. The New Order track far exceeds it in fame outside the US, and probably in the US among those under the age of around 40.</dd>
<dd>I'm going to put a WP:RM on this, as I don't see how a basically unknown to many, barely charting outside the US single can deserve more than a disambiguation link at the top of the page, let alone rights to the main article page, or the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28song%29_6f1e.html" title="Blue Monday (song)">Blue Monday (song)</a> page. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 19:26, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The song was released 4 years -before- I was born, so I'd say its safe to say people 20 years older than me at least have heard of it. The vast majority of the current internet using population would have heard of New Order, or at least heard of the song if not the band; particularly those in Europe.</dd>
<dd>Is there likely to be an article on the Fats Domino track of the same name? If there is, I'd have to say that <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28Fats_Domino_song%29_1d3a.html" title="Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)">Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)</a> would be a more suitable title, disambiguated by a disabmig template and not a full page; as as a number 23 (and later re-entry at number 30) song is less likely to be known than a number 12 song, that re-entered at 9, then again at 3, then again at 17; over a 12 year period... (UK figures). Because currently, theres no mention of the Domino track -anywhere- on the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 14:50, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Heres the problem. The term isn't in common use, and can't have more than a dict-def written on it, which would be transwikied. And in the case of two, and only two, things having the same name, its policy to leave the best known one, and the first one with an article, which is obviously the New Order track on both counts, at the original location, and use a disambig template message. Even when there are more than two things with the same name, and one has significant fame over the others, which is true again is this case; the same is done. See <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows.html" title="Windows">Windows</a> for example. We're comparing a 1957 something-or-other genre track (I can't even find this out on the web, its that unknown) to the biggest selling 12 inch vinyl of all time - theres a pretty obvious fame margin there. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 15:06, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Biggest selling 12 inch <b>vinyl</b> of all time. Sold more than any previous 12" albums, althougn that was helped by albums being available on 8track or cassette a lot earlier than singles.</dd>
<dd>My tastes don't cover one kind of music - they cover a huge variety of music, just not 50 year old R and B (of the original meaning of that phrase, obviously).</dd>
<dd>Also, 25,000 hits versus 150,000 hits kind of shows the notability. The Fats Domino track, if, when and ever it gets an article (because its not got one now, meaning theres no need for any disambig), deserves no more than a dab link, not a full disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 13:23, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What you're not getting here is that the 'weird group' you keep referring to are FAR better know than Fats Domino. I get not a differential of '5 times' as many hits, but FIVE MILLION more hits on Google for 'blue monday new order' than 'blue mog nday fats domino'.</dd>
<dd>Also, there are no links to Blue Monday which refer to anything other than the New Order track.</dd>

<dd>And I've given it a dab header, which is what it would have got anyway.

<p>The best thing this dispute did was force me to look through my reference books.

I'll also try to go back to the Rolling Stone link and a couple of other resources on the 'net and then add a list of cover versions to the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28Fats_Domino_song%29_1d3a.html" title="Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)">Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)</a> article. Plus I ended up finding out that Gershwin's Summertime is the 2nd most popular cover song (after the Beatles "Yesterday", so I added that to the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">Cover version</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porgy_and_Bess_8d07.html" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a> articles.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Songs</span></h2>
<p>Might I suggest that you add links to songs <i>after</i> you create articles for them. Seas of redlinks aren't generally desireable. If you look through wikipedia you'll see most songs mentioned in articles are not linked, and if they are it is usually because they have an article. The Perry Como page really needs its unweildy list trimmed down anyway. I don't think any other singer gets that treatment, and his article is about 80% list, which also isn't really desireable for an encyclopedia. I'd also recommend more emphasis on quality of article and less on quantity. I'm sure there is something of substance that you could add to alot of these stubs you've been writing beyond who wrote them and a list of performers. Something about the lyrics, the story behind them, their special significance, <i>something</i> that explains why they deserve mention in an encyclopedia. There are many good articles on songs in wikipedia, but a simple template plus sentence isn't doing much to add to them. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:56, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree that listing writer, year, and performer is somewhat useful, I'm sure there is more useful information on most songs (and if there isn't I need to question how encyclopedic they actually are). And I still maintain that redlinks are useful only when an article is needed or very likely to be written. Most songs do not fall in to this category. You'll find most songs mentioned in articles are not linked. This is largely because the sheer number of songs out there (millions?) are larger than the current wikipedia, and wikipedia is never likely to have them all. Pick the most important ones and link them, and link the ones that already have articles, but, especially if you have no interest in writing "articles" on the songs, please don't turn them into links, because I doubt anyone else is going to write them. Now is there any chance I can convince you to stop using that <i>awful</i> template? Not only is its phrasing stiff and awkward, it makes it painfully obvious that these articles were written by computer rather than by hand, and, most importantly, it makes it difficult for others to expand and clean up. One must remove the template in order to alter any part of the exisiting article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:33, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fear we do differ on what we think wikipedia should be. I think it should be an encyclopedia (that key policy #1 is "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia" seems to indicate I am not alone in this). If you literally mean that you think it should be "anything that anyone might conceivably want to look up" then you're going well beyond the scope of an encyclopedia. Sounds a bit like an indiscriminate collection of information, something Wikipedia specifically is not. It is entirely conceivable that I may want to look up who currently sits at the desk I sat at in the 5th grade, if that same desk is still in the classroom, and if the stuff I wrote on it is still legible. Should wikipedia strive to contain such information, or did not not quite mean "anyone" and "conceivably" qutie so literally?</p>
<p>As for songs, while I still think the template is a bad idea, wikipedia should strive for articles of substance, and quality is often better than quality, you can feel free to disagree. The automaton approach to article creation does not make for good reading. Though I find Rambot's articles dry as hell, at least <i>they</i> have information that goes beyond what we used to have in out lists of songs. As I said before, the template makes it more work for people to make the articles better and more readable, and any one-size-fits-all approach always has problems. <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jambalaya_%28On_the_Bayou%29_5490.html" title="Jambalaya (On the Bayou)">Jambalaya (On the Bayou)</a> is described as a pop song, when a country song is a much better description. "Popular" is much to generic of a category to be terribly useful, and is sometimes confused with "pop". (I also wonder why you are so certain that Stafford's recording of the song is more popular than the original. I had never heard of Stafford's version (not that that's terribly relevant) and googling <i>jambalaya williams</i> gets me ten times as many hits as <i>jambalaya stafford</i>. I realize that as the author Williams is likely to be mentioned in the hits relevant to Stafford, and not vice versa, but it still seems quite a descepency. This is another issue, however.)</p>
<p>As for VfD's, I make no promises. Indeed a nomination for deletion is probably the only thing likely to turn some of these substubs into actual articles, or at least expand them ever so slightly. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:55, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assumed that the US Geological Survey place name database is the correct one, when it disagreed with the USPS name. (In fact, I used the information at <a href="http://www.placesnamed.com" class="external free" title="http://www.placesnamed.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.placesnamed.com</a> and did not check it against the official USGS site. However, I assume that <i>they</i> checked their information.)</dd>
<dd>In fact, the "official name" for unincorporated places is a matter of some question, and I've gotten into some discussions about that. (see the discussions about "St." and "Saint" higher on this page!) For <i>incorporated municipalities,</i> I think the charter issued by the state is accepted as official by everyone.</dd>
<dd>As to whether there are other towns with this problem, I'm sure there are. But I don't actually remember whether I've <i>found</i> any, and it's been a while since I've been working on this particular area of the Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 13:15, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jambalaya</span></h2>
<p>I'm sorry, but the article is not about the song "in 1952", it is about the song then, today, and in the fifty-odd years in between. I'll grant you that more than fifty years ago Stafford's version might have outsold Williams', but that is hardly relevant today. Since then, Williams has become one of the most legendary country musicians ever, while Stafford has somewhat faded into more obscurity. While I cannot, at the moment, prove it, I'd be willing to wager that when you mention the song to 100 random people today, a much larger portion of them will associate it with Williams than Stafford (google, if nothing else, seems to support this). Indeed your assertion that Stafford's is "more popular" is much like insisting that <i><a href="../../../l/e/a/Leave_Her_to_Heaven_485a.html" title="Leave Her to Heaven">Leave Her to Heaven</a></i> is a much more popular film than <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i>, because the former did much better at the box office. Or that <i><a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_Road_0264.html" title="Tobacco Road">Tobacco Road</a></i> is more popular than <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to prove that Stafford's is more popular, as you made that assertion in the article. I made no claim of what the most popular version was, so I need prove nothing. I'll be removing that statement again. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:32, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will (somewhat reluctantly) agree to the current phrasing, although I feel it gives some undue prominence that version. Actual sales figures would be nice to see as well. As for the divorcing sales from popularity, well, I thought my movie examples were a pretty good indication of how the two can be out of sync. Specifically concerning Jambalaya, I think airplay, appearances in other media, and the song's appearance on all varieties of Greatest Hits albums (both Williams' and country music in general) speak well of it's popularity even though I suspect very few vinyl 45s of the song have been sold in 50 years. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:07, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not that it matters much, as we seem to have worked out a decent compromise, but I think if we were to take the sales of Hank Williams greatest hits albums (of which there are many), and compare them to Jo Stafford's, we'd find Hank would take the cake. Likewise I cannot speak for country radio, as I've never listened to country radio in my life, but in terms of coming across one version or another in daily life, I, at least, have heard Hank's much more, though I can only speak for the past few decades. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 01:55, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>subst is easy to use. To simply call (trasclude) template foo, I type {{foo}}. To substitute foo, I type {{subst:foo}}. That is all there is to it, predcede the template name with "subst:". everything else is the same, including alll parameters.</dd>
<dd>The effect of subst is to make a copy of the template result and place it on the page as if it had been typed there. Future editors don't see the template, they see the text that the template has produced. This mens that they can edit and customize the text. It also means that when the page is viewed in future, it will be dispalyed faster. When a template is on a page, a separate server call must be made to retrive the template, and then further work must be done to render the template. This must be done every time the page is viewed. When subst is used, all this is done only once, when the edit is saved. But the main reason for using subst on these templates, IMO, is that it leaves a fully editable article. Main article text should normally be fully editable. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:50, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
