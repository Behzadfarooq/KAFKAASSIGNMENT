<p>Bruce Crandall was born in 1933. He was raised in <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia%2C_Washington_3b70.html" title="Olympia, Washington">Olympia, Washington</a> where in high school he became an All-American baseball player. He was drafted into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> in 1953 to serve in the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>.

<p>After commissioning and graduation from fixed-wing and helicopter training conducted by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> and Army, he was assigned to a mapping group based out of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidio_of_San_Francisco_140f.html" title="Presidio of San Francisco">Presidio of San Francisco</a> "that at the time was the largest flying military aviation unit in the world." From there he went on to fly <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessna_L-19_Bird_Dog_5f3d.html" title="Cessna L-19 Bird Dog">Cessna L-19 Bird Dogs</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-2_Beaver_9312.html" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver">de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, again for topographic studies.</p>
<p>Crandall's first overseas flying assignment was to Wheelus Air Force Base in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli%2C_Libya_1b12.html" title="Tripoli, Libya">Tripoli, Libya</a>, mapping the desert for two years flying <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-3_Otter_9d53.html" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter">de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter</a>, Beaver, Birddog and <a href="../../../o/h/-/OH-23_Raven_4979.html" title="OH-23 Raven">OH-23 Raven</a> aircraft as an instructor pilot and unit test pilot.</p>
<p>His next overseas tours were flying over thousands of square miles of previously unmapped mountains and jungles in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. For this mission, he was based out of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Air_Force_Base_a181.html" title="Howard Air Force Base">Howard Air Force Base</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panama</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costa_Rica_e226.html" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>. While assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division, Crandall helped develop air-assault tactics as a platoon commander. In early 1965, he joined the Dominican Republic Expeditionary Force as a liaison to the 18th Airborne Corps.</p>
<p>Later that year, he would command the 1st Cavalry Division's Company A, 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion at <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Khe_da2c.html" title="An Khe">An Khe</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.

The two also flew in the ammunition needed for the 1/7th Cavalry (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Armstrong_Custer_54fa.html" title="George Armstrong Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a>'s old battalion) to survive. The craft he was flying was unarmed.</p>
<p>In January 1966, during the first combined American and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Vietnamese_Army_0adf.html" title="South Vietnamese Army">South Vietnamese Army</a> operation, "Operation Masher", Crandall, while under intense enemy fire and with only a spot flashlight beam to guide him, twice dropped his Huey helicopter through the dense jungle canopy to rescue 12 wounded soldiers. For his courage in that incident Crandall received the Aviation &amp; Space Writers Helicopter Heroism Award for 1966.</p>
<p>After an assignment in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, he attended the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_Forces_Staff_College_544a.html" title="Armed Forces Staff College">Armed Forces Staff College</a>. Soon he was back in Vietnam, this time flying Huey gunships - "a big improvement" -- supporting the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Squadron, 1st Cavalry Division.</p>
<p>In January 1968, four months into his second tour, Crandall's helicopter was downed during another rescue attempt due to Air Force bombs going off too close to where he was flying. After five months in the hospital, with a broken back and other injuries, he resumed his career as a student earning a bootstrap degree through the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nebraska_a89b.html" title="University of Nebraska">University of Nebraska</a> in 1969. In <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, he would become a facility engineer managing 3800 people. He subsequently served as deputy chief of staff, deputy installation commander, and commander of the 5th Engineer Combat Battalion, all at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Leonard_Wood_45b9.html" title="Fort Leonard Wood">Fort Leonard Wood</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>South America was supposed to be his next assignment, and he and Arlene attended the Defense Language Institute, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterey%2C_California_8065.html" title="Monterey, California">Monterey, California</a>. as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> students in preparation as aviation and engineering adviser to <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> - an assignment that never came. A stroke sidelined Crandall, ending his flying career. After his recovery, the Crandalls did find the language training useful when he was sent to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caracas.html" title="Caracas">Caracas</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, as the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Mapping_Agency_d113.html" title="Defense Mapping Agency">Defense Mapping Agency</a>'s director for the Interamerican Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p>In his final Army assignment, he served as senior engineer adviser to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Army_National_Guard_e090.html" title="California Army National Guard">California Army National Guard</a>.</p>
<p>Crandall retired from the Army in 1977 as a <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_colonel.html" title="Lieutenant colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Major Bruce P. Crandall distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism as a Flight Commander in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Vietnam_25cf.html" title="Republic of Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>, while serving with Company A, 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion, <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Cavalry_Division_%28Airmobile%29_42d3.html" title="1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)">1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)</a>. On 14 November 1965, his flight of sixteen helicopters was lifting troops for a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_and_destroy.html" title="Search and destroy">search and destroy</a> mission from Plei Me, Vietnam, to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing_Zone_X-Ray_cd15.html" title="Landing Zone X-Ray">Landing Zone X-Ray</a> in the <a href="../../../i/a/_/Ia_Drang_Valley_f6f4.html" title="Ia Drang Valley">Ia Drang Valley</a>. On the fourth troop lift, the airlift began to take enemy fire, and by the time the aircraft had refueled and returned for the next troop lift, the enemy had Landing Zone X-Ray targeted. As Major Crandall and the first eight helicopters landed to discharge troops on his fifth troop lift, his unarmed helicopter came under such intense enemy fire that the ground commander ordered the second flight of eight aircraft to abort their mission. As Major Crandall flew back to Plei Me, his base of operations, he determined that the ground commander of the besieged <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> desperately needed more <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a>. Major Crandall then decided to adjust his base of operations to Artillery Firebase Falcon in order to shorten the flight distance to deliver ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers. While medical evacuation was not his mission, he immediately sought volunteers and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, led the two aircraft to Landing Zone X-Ray. Despite the fact that the landing zone was still under relentless enemy fire, Major Crandall landed and proceeded to supervise the loading of seriously wounded soldiers aboard his aircraft. Major Crandall's voluntary decision to land under the most extreme fire instilled in the other pilots the will and spirit to continue to land their own aircraft, and in the ground forces the realization that they would be resupplied and that friendly wounded would be promptly evacuated. This greatly enhanced morale and the will to fight at a critical time. After his first medical evacuation, Major Crandall continued to fly into and out of the landing zone throughout the day and into the evening. That day he completed a total of 22 flights, most under intense enemy fire, retiring from the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield.html" title="Battlefield">battlefield</a> only after all possible service had been rendered to the Infantry battalion. His actions provided critical resupply of ammunition and evacuation of the wounded. Major Crandall's daring acts of bravery and courage in the face of an overwhelming and determined enemy are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>.</p>
