<h2><span class="mw-headline">On Facts, Opinions, NPOV</span></h2>
<p>Some underlaying rules from Philosopy 101 may help to clear the air here. First there are two types of knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facts - Substantiated and proven statements. Something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed.</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>Opinions - A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof:</li>
</ul>
<p>Opinions can be either be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Biased - To influence in a particular, typically unfair direction; prejudice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Neutral - Belonging to neither side in a controversy: on neutral ground.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Encyclopedic articles are a way of imparting knowledge to people who may not have formulated their own "Opinions" on a particular subject. To not influence a reader an article should be as neutral as possible. To do this Facts should alway prevail. Opinions are ok as long as they are not biased. If the opinion is contraversial it should be stated.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Lee was born in 1940 - FACT</li>
<li>Bruce Lee was the best Martial Artist in the world - OPINION</li>
<li>Bruce Lee may be consider by many to be one of the world's greatest Martial Artis - OPINION with a NPOV or neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources are likewise important from a credibility perspective. A published book usually has more credence then say a web page because journalist usually have to list sources and those sources are usually corroborated. Web pages on the other hand can be written by anyone at any time and can say whatever anyone wants. No proof or corroboration is necessary; so these sources should be considered before they are used as sources.</p>
<p>"If someone tells me a lie and I perpetuate that lie; Am I lying"? Yes, But not intentionally. So, check your sources before you believe them.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">JKD and Trditional Martial Arts</span></h2>
<p>JKD can be seen as a natural evolution in Martial Artd development. It's what Thomas Kuhn would call a paradigm shift. It's not that Traditional Martial Arts is wrong and JKD is RIGHT. JKD could NOT exist without traditional MA. JKD is simply a new way at looking at MA that is perhaps more complete and maybe less restrictive. Describing JKD as a "BREAK" from traditional MA can be a bit of a stretch because Bruce Lee did NOT begin from scratch. He used traditional MA as a basis for his theories and concepts. Lee has many times said that he DID NOT invent a new style but in essense reevaluated existing system to bring forth a new APPROACH.</p>
<p>An example of this thinking is the Paradigm shift from Newtonian Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics. It's not that Quantum theory is correct and Newtonian theory is false it's that Quantum theory is a little more complete and can explain a bit more with respect to the subatomic world. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankWilliams_a1a3.html" title="User:FrankWilliams">FrankWilliams</a> 19:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the protypical "forest from the trees" edit. You are correct, one Classic high school English example of a paradigm shift is Quantum versus Newtonian physics. Unfortunately your definition is, incorrect. Perhaps an even more famous example of a paradigm shift would be a Plolemaic view of the universe versus the Copernican one. An old system (the Sun revolves around the Earth) can be completely obviated by a new one. It's true that one iteration of a paradigm shift can be that a new paradigm is a "little more complete and can explain a bit more" than on old one but that's far from the defining characteristic. In many cases a paradigm shift involves the complete annihilation of a previous POV. In regards to Bruce Lee, simply put JKD DID in fact unequivocably form a "BREAK" from traditional forms in "Martial Artd." There's an unending series of sources but I'll point you an analysis by Sifu James W. DeMile, a former Masters Level instructor of MMA for US Special Forces at Fort Lewis, Washington and former undefeated heavyweight boxing champion in the US Armed Forces. Any court would recognize him as an expert in close quarters combat. In addition Mr. DeMile is a internationally known Kung Fu Master and a first generation student of Bruce Lee. In the following document: <a href="http://www.wingchundo.com/default.cfm/PID=1.1.3" class="external free" title="http://www.wingchundo.com/default.cfm/PID=1.1.3" rel="nofollow">http://www.wingchundo.com/default.cfm/PID=1.1.3</a> it's clear that not only is JKD NOT a "natural evolution" of traditional Wing Chun, but it makes it clear that it was impossible to consider traditional Wing Chun philosophy directly developmentally linked to JKD. In large part because Bruce wasn't himself a master of the style. The elements of Wing Chun were merely the broad starting points of Bruce's "BREAK" from traditional arts which developed into JKD. Without the particular event of Bruce Lee's "BREAK," Wing Chun would NEVER have "naturally evolved" into JKD, had the art been practiced traditionally another 1000 years. Keep in mind also that BOTH JKD and Wing Chun are currently widely practiced today. This is contrary to a defining characteristic of paradigm shift. For example, using your example with the advent of Quantum physics, a serious Physicist does not rely on the Newtonian system to explain the inner workings of atomic structure. A publisher doesn't continue to widely use scribes to create books after the advent of the printing press. All indications are that the OP is correct. JKD is a "BREAK" and new development of martial arts, rather than a "natural evolution" "paradigm shift" of an old one. Obviously the above isn't going into the wiki article, since all I want is for you to retract your misguided remarks from the talk page. Keep in mind that the above ONLY deals with one of numerous (a dozen or more) traditional and street techniques that Bruce Lee incorporated into JKD. Keep in mind that Bruce also encorporated elements of Western Boxing into JKD as well. However, no one would presume to say that JKD is some sort of "natural" evolution of the sweet science of boxing. Let us not be so quick to lump all this together, merely because they are both Eastern arts. We must also be careful not to "overedit." Obviously many of the reports about Bruce Lee are amazing but they ARE largely substantiated. Because a man is extraordinary, like Ali or Jordan, that doesn't preclude his extraordinary feats from being fact versus fiction <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.185.113.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.185.113.183_ff5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.185.113.183">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>Response: The very first sentence of the comment was: JKD can be seen as a natural evolution in Martial Arts development. It does NOT say a natural evolution of Wing-Chun which is just one style amongst thousands. I retract NOTHING. Current mixed martial arts prove that hybrid systems of which JKD is a precursor; is an endpoint that would have occured with or without Bruce Lee and JKD. That fact that Lee came along and was light years ahead of current MA thinking accelerated what was already going to happen. Bruce Lee has also been considered by UFC president Dana White as the "father of mixed martial arts" for the very same reason. Anyone who understands JKD and the development of Martial Arts in the last 30 can plainly see the pattern.

<p>He did a back excorcize called a 'butterfly' wrong and was confined to a metal back brace for six minths. During this tie he wrote out his philosophies on the martial way.</p>
<p>some dude</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's incorrect. The exercise that injured Bruce's back is known as "good mornings". It is actually an excellent back exercise, but Bruce did it without warming up and using heavier than normal weights, causing severe injury to himself. Many bodybuilders will not perform this exercise precisely because of this risk, and the fact there are other back exercise that will achieve the same results.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Back to the orignal statement: Bruce did injure his hip pretty severely after a bout with a Thai Boxer. Bruce had essentially beaten the guy and when Bruce went to help the guy up the boxer kicked him in the hip. Lee compensated for this injury but it was never really the same after. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankWilliams_a1a3.html" title="User:FrankWilliams">FrankWilliams</a> 19:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Finally</span></h3>
<p>This quesion has been lagging at me from some time. I've finally combed through my library and found the citation for my comment. The information came from the Bruce Lee Jeet-June-Do club published magazine entitled "Bruce Lee His Privacy and Anecdotes" page 11. This was an article written by the Editors of the magazine as told to them by a Mr. Chan Ah-Kam a Chinese individual living in Thailand during the early 1970's. Apparently when Bruce Lee was filming "The Big Boss" in Thailand and still developing JKD he ran across Mr. Ah-Kam and convinced him to set up a sparring match between himself and a retired Thai-Boxing champion. Lee was still developing and refining his JKD and wanted to see how it stacked up against his system. Lee along with the rest of the world had heard of the martial arts prowess of Thai Boxers, so he wanted to see how he would fair. Apparently after 14 rounds of severe punishing blows Lee ended up victorious.</p>
<p>Quote From the Article:</p>
<p>"As Bruce walked up to help him on his feet, the champion unexpectedly gave a kick. Bruce rapidly turned away. Hoever, Bruce could not entirely avoid it, the kick still hit on his waist.</p>
<p><b>From then on Bruce's waist frequently had uncomfortable feeling.</b></p>
<p>Seeing that the result was out and the chapion had flared up, Ah-Kam divided them. Ah-Kam also had a deep cultivation in martial arts, the two moved a few yards away when pushed by Ah-Kam. The two saw their own mistakes. There, Ah-Kam suggested to go to a Chinese restaurant to wash away their hatred. They stored this experience deep down in their hearts. No one was gonna tell anything. Hoever, from then on, Bruce's waist frequently felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The article has the flow of truth for me based on some known knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It was well known that when Bruce was filming in Thailand that he was "out in the sticks" and had lost some weight due to poor nutrition. Being in such a remote area; it is plausable that such an event had transpired without much documentation. This would account for the story not being very well known.</li>
<li>B. Thailand is known their Muy Thai art which is especially brutal.</li>
<li>C. We know Bruce was skillful, knowledgable, and would rarely back down if he thought someone would pose a challenge to his martial skill.</li>
<li>D. Bruce was still developing JKD and while in Thailand and it is probable that he could not resist stacking up his JKD to their national art.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there is no way to definitely ascertainly the truthfulness of this story but it is documented in the cited text above and as far as: belief; this is left up to the reader of course. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankWilliams_a1a3.html" title="User:FrankWilliams">FrankWilliams</a> 03:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The exercise was called "good mornings". You hold a weight on your neck while repeatedly bending over at the waist. As you would assume, this puts a great deal of stress on your back and caused a injury that hospitalized him for several months. Lee's book "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" is a collection of notes he wrote during his lifetime and was compiled posthumorously by his wife and students.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Influence of Bruce Lee</span></h2>
<p><i><a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a>, a U.S. born, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> raised martial artist and actor, is claimed by his followers to be the most influential theorist-practitioner in martial arts history. He had a very successful action movie career, and from that position in the public eye spent the later part of his life decrying what he claimed was a degradation of combat effectiveness in the traditional arts that he blamed on the Confucian teacher-student relationships of the established Chinese schools.</i></p>
<p>Although he trained the Chinese south <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaolin.html" title="Shaolin">Shaolin</a> art of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_Chun_b905.html" title="Wing Chun">Wing Chun</a> when young, he eventually left the school headed by the well known Hong Kong based <i>Sifu</i> <a href="../../../y/i/p/Yip_Man_7139.html" title="Yip Man">Yip Man</a>, and any formal association with the Wing Chun system. Arriving in the Seattle area in the 1960s, he soon encountered styles of other martial arts, such as <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kali.html" title="Kali">Kali</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escrima.html" title="Escrima">Escrima</a>, Karate and Judo. As an undergraduate <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> student at the University of Washington, and after graduation, he began to teach his version of <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_fu.html" title="Kung fu">kung fu</a> to non-Chinese. Around the same time he began to state publicly that, while many traditional Chinese martial arts maintained and taught large catalogues of techniques, what he regarded as their uncritical maintenance of traditions in his view adversely affected their approach to unarmed combat. Couching his language in <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoist.html" title="Taoist">Taoist</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>, he stated that he sought to create an elastic framework -- "no style as style" -- claiming to be focused solely on the improvement of efficiency in unarmed combat. Lee proposed that this framework could absorb influences from any martial art -- and he actively investigated Filipino armed and unarmed techniques, European and Japanese grappling, fencing, Korean kicking techniques and Chinese close range hand techniques during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee's comments and methods were seen as quite controversial. Many traditional teachers disagree with his opinions on these issues, especially seeing what Lee described as their lack of strategic flexibility due to "rote" teaching methods to be a misunderstanding on Lee's part. Most, if not all, traditional martial arts teachers say "fluid" strategy is a feature of martial training that is indeed addressed in the curricula of most traditional styles at advanced levels, when the students are ready. The schools Lee criticized tend to see their initial conservatism as a safety feature; a legacy of practical experience passed down from generation to generation, said to insure that their students are thoroughly prepared for advanced martial training, skipping nothing and developing intangibles such as good character, patience and discipline. The hierarchy of the traditional schools is said by this reasoning to provide a level playing field for all students by instilling respect and care for one's seniors, peers and juniors, so that everyone, not just the physically gifted, has an opportunity to benefit from the training provided in a martial art school.</p>
<p>With his untimely death in 1973, Lee was unable to develop his philosophy further. What he taught has been elaborated by his students and is considered by them to be a new style, which Lee himself named <i><a href="../../../j/e/e/Jeet_kune_do.html" title="Jeet kune do">jeet kune do</a></i> (Cantonese 截拳道, lit. "way of the intercepting fist"). To resolve the apparent contradiction, teachers of jeet kune do often maintain that what they practice is not a style or a tradition, but concepts. One thing most people on both sides of the issues he raised agree on is that Bruce Lee, through his movie career, had a great impact on the international popularization of the Chinese martial arts.</p>

<p>Someone added this to the "Death by misadventure" section: "Chow said in a later interview that it was a Croatian mixed martial artists Nikola Mijic who had fought Bruce Lee a couple days before his death and Bruce Lee had been complaining about pain in his head ever since the fight" -- Unless someone comes up quickly with a reference (preferably other than a fansite or forum), I suggest removing that sentence since it seems to me a lame attempt to advertise one's name on the account of a famous dead person. I am neither Bruce's biographer or martial arts specialist, but a quick google search shows no affiliation of any Nikola Mijic with martial arts, much less with Bruce Lee. Needless to say, if the statement were true (or at least old enough), it would have been an issue of hot debate over years... Until then, I took the liberty to shade the sentence. -- unregistered</p>

<dd>This isn't true. Shaquille O'Neil had a video game made based on himself called Shaq-Fu. Also, various rapper/actors (like Method Man or Redman) have been featured in video games as well.</dd>

<p>I have since changed "only" to "one of the very few". Perhaps Shaquille O'Neal (I believe that's the correct spelling) should be mentioned in a footnote or something. However, I don't count appearances by Method Man or Redman, unless the <b>game itself</b> is named after them.

Secondly, there have been numerous games named something like <i>Tiger Woods's International Masters Golf Championship Challenge 1994, Extra-Special Edition</i>, but do they actually <b>use</b> any specific characteristic about Tiger Woods (for example) himself, or is the name only there for sponsorship purposes? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 09:49, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Lee is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_people.html" title="Cantonese people">Cantonese</a> and his last name should be spelled "Lee", the Cantonese variant.</li>
<li>yes, bruce was born in san franscisco. the article is mistaken and might have confused his birthplace with foshan because his family ancestry is from jun'an, shunde, in foshan (something like his grandfather or something was from there)</li>
<li>I may be able to shed some light on the possible source of such error. I don't know if it is still a common practice nowadays. But when our generation (read Bruce's) grew up in Hong Kong, instead of our birthplace, we have to report our <i>jiguan</i> in school and government documents. Jiguan (籍貫) literally means record's links, or practically means where our father came from. I beleive since ancient China, families needed to register where they lived with the government, such records of families are called huji (戶籍). One can trace the origin of one's ancestors through this kind of links. For example, Bruce's birth place is San Francisco, but he would report his <i>jiguan</i> as Fushan. One can then go to Fushan and dig up the record of Bruce's father. On his father's record, one would find where Bruce grandfather came from and so forth. This kind of links were important before the computer age. Nowadays, a centralized database may be able to produce a family genealogy with a click of a button. But back then, you had to know where to look for the next record up the chain. It is possible that somewhere down the line, <i>jiguan</i> was translated erroneously as birthplace by someone who don't understand Chinese traditions, and hence the confusion. Perhaps someone can start an article on the concept of <i>jiguan</i>. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 19:35, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can someone give reasons/evidence before reverting the article?</p>

<dd>First off, it is helpful to sign your messages here so that it is easier to see who we are talking to. Second, I'm not adding any info (beyond the <a href="../../../y/u/e/Yuen_Wah_c4cc.html" title="Yuen Wah">Yuen Wah</a> sentence, and my source is <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Chan_8b3e.html" title="Jackie Chan">Jackie Chan</a>'s autobiography) so I don't have a need for sources to cite. What I am doing is keeping the editorial tone neutral. Some people are BIG Bruce fans, others are not. To avoid the page becoming a Bruce Shrine, or an attack page, we should have dry entries that stick to the non-controversial documented facts. Paragraphs implying Bruce had a bigger figurative <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">dick</a> than Chuck Norris aren't <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedic</a>, in that sense. I wouldn't mention Jackie Chan's story of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammo_Hung_c804.html" title="Sammo Hung">Sammo Hung</a> kicking a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_donna.html" title="Prima donna">prima donna</a> Bruce around on a movie set for the same reasons. Also, there are those who say that Bruce didn't leave <a href="../../../y/i/p/Yip_Man_7139.html" title="Yip Man">Yip Man</a>'s school, but that he was kicked out. We avoid the controversy by simply saying that he didn't finish the curriculum, a statement that both sides agree on. Nobody owns this article, and as we say in our disclaimer; <b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it</b>.

Yet one of the links refers to an article which, altough initially published in "Official Karate" more than two decades ago is neither highly documented, unbiased or encyclopaedic. The author strives in the beggining to stay neutral, but ends up bashing Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do. My suggestion is, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the link</li>
<li>place a warn sign close to it so that people less familiar with Bruce Lee will not be deluded.</li>
<li>try to find a second oppinion article about that event.</li>

<p>If you want additional arguments, I'll be happy to provide them&#160;:) - Mike, Germany.</p>
<p>"He is widely regarded as one of the most influential martial arts actors[..]" --- Perhaps it should be pointed out that Lee did much to establish himself as a martial artist first and actor second. I don't refer to his two-finger push-ups or one-inch punches, but rather to "Tao of Jeet Kune Do", "The Art of Expressing the Human Body" and "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method 1,2,3" when I say this. I think it's a matter of respect and fairness to change the starting sentence to something like "He is widely regarded as one of the most influential martial artists and actors[..]"</p>
<p>"Lee expanded his style over time, STATING THAT he included elements from[]" --- if you cannot trust your sources EVEN ON SUCH A STATEMENT, why bother quoting them? Look, I understand the difference between keeping a neutral tone and being highly doubtful, but do you?! - same dude.</p>
<p>Here I have to agree. Look at other actors bio and tell me who else made such a huge contribution to martial arts. Who else developed new styles, new fighting approaches. Who else wrote even a single book reflecting his philosophy, Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, Van Damme? Even the highly esteemed Ed Parker, although considered the father of American Kenpo, little did he to improve the original Kenpo taught to him by Frank Chow {Derek Foreal}</p>

This book is both a bio, and an in depth look at the Game of Death Movie as it related to Bruce lee's life, as well as Jeet kune do. John Little has written many books on Bruce Lee, and is the only author to be given total access to all of Bruce lee's notes, and personal library by Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's widow). He is the foremost expert on Bruce Lee. Agian, Bruce Lee's German heritage is well documented and known. That is why I thought Wikipedia should mention it when saying he was Chinese. Lee's mother's father was German. If you need another more ancestry specific bio let me know. However, John Little is the foremost expert.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wong Jack Man</span></h2>
<p>At the start of the "beyon jeet kune do" section there is a very poorly written/informed piece describing what was no doubt one of the greatest martial arts battles of all time, between Lee and Wong Jack Man. The piece in question refers to the fight as being set up by elders angry at Lee for teaching whites, although his opponent was also famed for teaching whites. It also claims that the fight was 3 "rounds," when in fact no source supports it. As it was, the fight was relatively secret and very few were in attendance (mostly the lee family). According to most sources, it was agreed that the fight would not be dicussed afterward, and that it was to be a friendly demonstartion between two young masters. The Lees claimed (in a press conference immediately afterward) that Bruce Lee had just defeated a great master. The local Chinese press at the time reported an entirely different outcome, based on eyewitness accounts. Although it has since been shrouded in legend, I believe that the event could use some more fleshing out (at least with Wong Jack Man's name!) and perhaps a more factual basis. One undisputed fact is that it is what led Bruce Lee to change his style so dramatically. The one source I have found so far is here.... <a href="http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html</a>. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EDIT <a href="http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kungfu.net/brucelee.html</a>. is run by the supporters of Wong Jack Man, and is biased&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have also read about it in Sports illustrated, but it was a back issue and I'm not sure from when. I also have seen the article in the Chinese language paper, but I don't read (or speak) Chinese, but I will look to see if I can find it. My friends father owns a copy... I didn't edit the page because it does say it is controversial, and this is by no means my area of expertise. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7EReggaedelgado_9285.html" title="User:Reggaedelgado">Reggaedelgado</a> 08:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes he used many styles but the major styles of which JKD consists of (80%) are</p>
<ul>
<li>Wing Chun</li>
<li>Silat</li>
<li>Kali</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
<li>Fencing</li>
<li>Jujitsu</li>
<li>Muay Thai</li>
</ul>
<p>15% comes from 26 official styles and 4 unofficial (other than the above)which he learnt thoroughly</p>
<p>5% comes from countless other styles</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>OK</b> Alright, here is the crux of the JKD argument. What does it consist of??? You know even responding to the above comment is quite difficult. He quite posibbly could have learned x(thousand) techniques, <i>all from different styles</i>. The one thing I don't really understand is why people always come up with the number 26??

<p>But in total <a href="../../../j/k/d/JKD_7b64.html" title="JKD">JKD</a> is mostly around 26 different martial arts styles.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for an answer to where this number of 26 came from? What are they? The original composition that went into Jun Fan, what Lee was teaching when he died, or what you are learning right now? I'm curious of the answer.</p>
<p>I've found it quite humerous to try and figure out what styles influenced Lee for his personal JKD as opposed the JKD Process. How is it even possible to extrapolate the styles that Lee personally incoporated into his personal JKD? He had access to so many martial artist and so many texts where would one even begin. In the final analysis what does it give you? Are folks trying to duplicate what Lee did? JKD was designed to be tailor made for each and every individual. Ultimately it is up to every individual to ascertain what works for them personally; and that means experimentation. Not sure what the benefit is of figuring out what styles influenced Lee.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankWilliams_a1a3.html" title="User:FrankWilliams">FrankWilliams</a> 02:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 26 arts hypothesis was copied by author Paul Vunak out of Dan Inosanto's notes. It may have been out of context. In my experience of the lee arts, wrestling, boxing, fencing, savate, mantis (southern), taiji, baguazhang, tae kwon do, muay thai, gojuryu, uechiryu, kali, judo, hapkido, crane, choylifut, white tiger, white eyebrow, and Parker's kenpo all contributed techniques to tao of gung fu, while wing chun remained the nucleus. That is 20 arts, tho' the list differs from Mr. Vunak's. Lee's later approach minimized techniques and focused more on attribute development. The contrarian view of the Wong Jak Man fight is gaining in popularity. My impression from have spoken or corresponded with original students of Bruce Lee is that they simply had no reason to doubt Linda Lee's version of events. I am just wondering: of the wikipedia editors in charge of this article, how many are martial artists or martial arts historians, how many have trained in either the Lee arts or wing chun, and how many actual know direct students of Bruce Lee? I question the whole affair on the basis on anti-elitism, hatred of expertise, the privileging of trolls over experts, and the view that a contrarian view of events is possibly vaild just because someone says it. To me, contrarian views are not to be advanced merely because they are held. Most Americans believe that the founding fathers were Christians and that the earth is less than 10,000 years old, but that does not make it so. I am also disturbed that contrarians dismiss the views of martial arts legends like Mr. Inosanto merely because Guro Inosnato was a Lee student. As if one couldn't admit that a friend lost a fight. NPOV is a nonissue. BTW the original article writer of the 1980 OFFICIAL KARATE writer was challenged to meet with Lee students to prove his case, and he refused any such meeting. Bob Guedel IV</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the other side of the coin on the fight from Wong Jack Man's camp: <a href="http://www.lakungfu.com/sifujackmanwong.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lakungfu.com/sifujackmanwong.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lakungfu.com/sifujackmanwong.html</a></p>
<p>Who knows where the truth lies...probably somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Also, I think it's revisionist and reductionist to say that "elders" were angry at Bruce for teaching non-Asians. Moreso, they were just chapped that he was constantly deriding "classical kung-fu" and so wanted him to walk his talk. That said, one must also realize that Chinese were legally BANNED from immigrating into the US for about 60 years - all the way up until WWII. So, when Bruce Lee arrived on the scene in the 60s, virulent anti-Chinese racism was still a very fresh memory in the lives of many of these Chinatown "elders."</p>
<hr />
<p>I tend to agree with the guy above. The being angry part is Linda's view and I don't know if it reflects reality. I will incorporate different viewpoints into the article.</p>
<hr />
<p>I put in the Wong Jack Man POV referencing the Kungfu article but someone after me wholesale copied the Kungfu article. That portion needs to be rewritten and I am too lazy to do it. Otherwise, put everything in quote. BTW, there are other articles on the fight. I made it clear that it was sources from single article and this distinction needs to be maintained.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Facts only, please.</b> Wikipedia is not a rumor mill. These are the hard facts: Bruce Lee fought Wong Jack Man privately, a match only a few people saw. Lee claimed one version of the fight, Wong described another, but neither fighter incurred serious injuries by all accounts. Wong later challenged Lee for a public fight, which Lee ignored.

<dd>Wong wrote an article in the Chinese Pacific Weekly newspaper describing the fight. The article was run on the front page, which means many people in San Francisco read it in 1964 (I'm asking User:Reggaedelgado to get a copy of it). There is no documentation or even rumor that suggests they ever fought again, so by definition, Lee ignored the challenge. The fact that Lee taught whites (he was 1/4 German) has little to do with how well or poorly Lee fought against Wong. Note that "Far from attempting to keep Kung Fu secret and exclusive, Wong observes that his was the first school in San Francisco’s Chinatown to operate with open doors. That the other Kung Fu schools then in existence conducted classes behind locked doors was due more to the instructor’s fears of being challenged, say Wong, than to a refusal to teach Caucasians."</dd>

Nice work guys. Still hoping Josh's dad will lend me that article<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7EReggaedelgado_9285.html" title="User:Reggaedelgado">Reggaedelgado</a> 00:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have edited the account to record what I remember of what Bruce said about the fight before four or five of us informally. By the way, I was one of the whites he taught, and not teaching whites was a big deal then, and there was no question in my mind THEN that that was one reason why the fight occurred. Why would there be such talk among his Chinese students? Most of the students in Jimmy (James) Lee's garage were Chinese. I heard it repeatedly. We weren't the media. I also don't doubt that he won the fight, since I believe that at least two of the other people had actually witnessed the fight (one of them was Jimmy Lee, I think, his assistant instructor). They were laughing about it as people would if their favorite had won. It was Bruce who spoke up about it with a slight grin but more serious and embarrassed. 128.32.2.75 20:49, 23 August 2006 (UTC) James French. Opps, looks like someone deleted my comments from the article. Sigh.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Graduation</span></h2>
<p>Bruce did not graduate from the University of Washington. This is no big deal, he's smarter and knew more than most philosphy Ph.D anyway. But let's keep the fact straight. His friend James Lee died only a year or two after getting with Bruce. I have no doubt the decision to head down to San Francisco was the right one for Bruce.</p>
<p>He should be given an honorary Ph.D and I think this will happen in the future.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Any proof that says Bruce didn't graduate?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most biographies mention this. I have never seen a bio that claimed that he graduated. Not even one. The registra office has no record of his graduation since he didn't and never claimed that he did. The alumni magazine has an article this and he he attended, never graduated.</p>
<p>Look at the official UW alumni magazine - there is a * by Bruce Lee "*Attended but did not graduate"</p>

<p>Like I said, it's no big deal. He had a decision to make at that time and from his life and career - he has shown that he more than qualified for the degree. Let's not forget that many great people drop out just before they were to graduate.</p>

On 23:18, December 15, 2005 user 172.132.179.157 converted all the native text in the article into question mark characters. Such act could be vandalism or just newbie's inability to edit an article properly. One likely scenario this could happen was when he copied and pasted a displayed page into the edit window instead of directly editing the original content inside the edit window. The edit window preserves the binary code of the foreign characters, but the displayed page may not preserve it depending on whether the language pack for the text is available on the user's machine. The result is all unmatched characters turning into&#160;? characters. For this reason, I prefer putting non-English text in the &amp;#ddddd; syntax. Though it is harder to edit, the content is unaffected by other users' lack of language pack and improper encoding settings.</p>
<p>Then a user removed all these&#160;? characters because they were no longer readable. It was an easy way out. It is easier to trim off the damage instead of repairing them. Including native text in an English article is a controversial topic. Some people want them because they help future researchers to further the study through native sources. Some people don't want them because they cannot benefit from the info until they learn the language.</p>
<p>In any case, information was lost from this article since Dec 15, 2005.</p>

It is unwise to remove native text JUST because this is an English encyclopedia. Try harder to counter the reasons listed below. I'd bet when people wrote encyclopedia in the last century, they didn't omit native text because it was foreign language, they didn't include them because they didn't know the language or printing technology didn't allow that. In wikipedia, we have the technical means (Unicode) and the language skills(from contributors), it would be foolish to not add native text to articles.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>DISAMBIGUATION is #1 benefit. Even if you cannot read the language, by comparing the glyphs, you can at least tell if any two terms are related or not. e.g. There are a few articles here about the name <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Bao_8e67.html" title="Zhang Bao">Zhang Bao</a>, but they are all different persons with names written differently in the native text. Native text confirms they are different. If you go to the library and pick up any book about China written in the 1800s, you will have a hard time mapping between the transliteration then and that we used in modern books. An obvious example is Peking turning into Beijing. This name is so well known that their mapping causes no problem to anyone. But how about other less known terms like "Lee Chun Fan"? The Chinese language uses many homonyms, any one spelling can easily maps to 70 to 80 different Chinese characters. Multiply that by multiple systems of transliterations. You basically have no way to disambiguate many terminologies without cross referencing to the native writing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Enabling further research is another benefit. If you travel to Japan and show the native text in a printed wikipedia article to a taxi driver, you may be able to go to many more places without an intepreter. For ambiguous terms, even an interpretor may give you a bad translation without knowing the exact native text. Imagine you hire an interpretor to help you research the history of someone called <a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhang_Bao_8e67.html" title="Zhang Bao">Zhang Bao</a> in China. The first thing he would asked you is how to write the name in native text. The pinyin Zhang Bao can also be spelled Cheung Bo in Cantonese. How would he know you are not looking for Cheung Bo instead???</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Graphic search on the Internet is yet another benefit even you can benefit from without knowing the language. Open up Google image search and cut and paste some native text from an wikipedian article into Google and you open up a whole new world of visual information that you may not have by using English alone.</dd>

Instead, the statement, as in others, was copied from <a href="http://www.bruceleedivinewind.com/feats.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bruceleedivinewind.com/feats.html" rel="nofollow">bruceleedivinewind.com</a>, a fansite, which apparently got the number from a Joe Lewis dialogue: "<i>Joe Lewis: Bruce Lee told me that he wanted to prove to the world that the Chinese martial artists were superior to all the other races, the Koreans, the Japanese, and in particular, the Caucasians. At that time, no one knew that "Enter the Dragon" was going to become a major $300,000,000 mega film. My advisors told me not to do martial arts films period.</i>" In this context, "$300m" seems to be an exaggeration/joke, and should not be used as a reference for the movie's actual revenue.</p>
<p>According to the following references, Enter the Dragon is not in the list of $300m+ films, or rather not in the list at all: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_top-grossing_movies_in_the_United_States_and_Canada_bc0d.html" title="List of top-grossing movies in the United States and Canada">List of top-grossing movies in the United States and Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm" rel="nofollow">boxofficemojo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.the-movie-times.com/thrsdir/alltime.mv?world+ByWG" class="external text" title="http://www.the-movie-times.com/thrsdir/alltime.mv?world+ByWG" rel="nofollow">the-movie-times.com</a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 13:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bruce Lee-The greatest martial artist of all time. With regards to the personal challenge, bruce won the fight in 3 minutes which was too long for him. He realized how out of shape he was and startred the fitness regime. Lee could take on anyone and beat them in a fight. I know for my uncle challenged bruce lee and lost the fight in 35 seconds. My uncle at that time was a russian martial artist who had fought in the military and was fluent in the russian system. My uncle invented his own style of russian combat called Prezviat, which is taught by all the secret service. He has over 45 years experience in martial arts and was more than qualified to challenge bruce lee. Yet he lost. Bruce Lee was that good, no make it that damn good. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 199.172.228.206 (<a href="../../../1/9/9/User_talk%7E199.172.228.206.html" title="User talk:199.172.228.206">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.172.228.206_f537.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.172.228.206">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>I think "Bruce Lee's feats" is POV.</li>

<dd>I agree. Although this is a popular wiki and recievs a high amount of traffic <b>and</b> vandalism, it is in need of a serious makeover. I've tried to streamline it a bit, but there is quite a bit of editng needed. Compared to what it used to look like there has been some nice editions(pictures, etc.), some bad deletions(info on family???) and quite a bit of clutter (messy and hard to sort through). Not to make a complaint and leave it at that **cough,cough,AHEM**, I will make changes here and there when I can. The biggest thing I would like to add to the discussion would be the article should concentrate Bruce Lee. A little more personal info on his life, and a little less on his physical prowess.

<p>No, I truly believe there is a mistake there. Please someone confirm it. A quarter of a cake, for example, means the cake divided by 4. Five hundreths of a second means a second divided by 500. It may be an expression issue, either way, someone please check on that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe your math is off a bit. Five hundreths of a second <b>does not</b> mean 1/500, it would be .05 divided into 1 or 1/20. More appropiate explanation would be: the cake is a whole 100% or a 1, just as the clock-second is a whole 1, subsets of the seconds are tenths and hundreths. Most stopwatches measure up to 99 minutes and out to the hundreth of a second(99:99.99). If you start the watch it counts <b>UP</b> starting at the hundreths. Thus 10 hundreths is 1 tenth(00:00.10) of 1 second. 10 tenths is a full 1 second. The qoute is a direct qoute and it is the conventional way to say it. I don't know of any other way you would say that. "My 40-yard dash was three hundreths of a second faster than yours!" I'm not sure of how else to explain other than to look up basic arithmetic rules. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuckyDucky_7e9c.html" title="User:ShuckyDucky">ShuckyDucky</a> 02:43, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I did not add that to the article, I do recall reading somewhere the bout was a school function. I don't remember it mentioning anything about him fighting a 'champion'.

<p>Ok, so since I don't really know all the wiki codes, wiki rules and so on and so forth, do you think you could change the "Bruce Lee's first formal, organized bout came as a teenager at his high school in Hong Kong. He was to fight a young British boxer, a reigning two-time boxing champion. Bruce knocked his opponent out with repeated strikes, using the Wing Chun technique jik chung chuy." part into something more fact-supported?</p>

<dd>The original question is why isn't sourced? Why not? Instead of making a statement that is not helpful in any way, source it! This article is rife with inaccuracies and bloated with unneeded info. If someone can make a dent into fixing this article <b>FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT BRUCE LEE</b> than I commend you.

<dd>It doesn't matter who the authors are if the book isn't listed as a source + we still need the name of this 'champion'. Can't just trust someone saying he's a champ, because even good people pass on false information every now and then</dd>

<p>-JonathanWalsh 00:56, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But you have no specific reason to believe the information in the book is false. 'The Bruce Lee Story' is also one of the top three Bruce Lee books of all time. Let me ask you something.

<dd>Alright, baby steps. A misunderstanding has led you to make two assertions and ask two questions. First, no one states the information is false. Again, I will re-state the question. Why is it not sourced? Perhaps my statements earlier are misleading, but then again I do not have access to the book and thus a proper source. You could source it, couldn't you? The second assertion you make is about 'the top three Brue Lee books of all time'. This is an example of a highly non-neutral point of view. You are entitled to your opinion, as they say, as long as this opinion does not effect an encylopedic article. In any case this is a moot point. Last, the two questions you asked are due to your misunderstanding. None the less they are also highly fallacious, and I would say that you should try a more productive line of reasoning. Is this all clear? Now how about a source? -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuckyDucky_7e9c.html" title="User:ShuckyDucky">ShuckyDucky</a> 04:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No need to ask the question twice. The film does not star Bruce Lee, it is about him. Does not belong in his Filmography, was moved to the Documentary section. What should be included in the Filmography section is the other films he starred in as a child. Do you have a list of these?
<dl>
<dd>I can confirm that Sifu Lee didn't star in that film...it wasn't even weird one like Game of Death where they cut bits of all his other films to make a beginning and middle bit of the film as he had already made the ending before his death.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clean up needed</span></h2>
<p>Much of the new content appears to be from older versions, eg. "Many who witnessed the fight believed Lee had won the duel." The weasel term "many" implies a majority point of view which is unsourced and is therefore POV. The phrase "for unknown reasons" is unnecessarily speculative and was already removed from the Wong Jack Man article. Also, again, Lee came up with JKD after he fought Wong; see the "Wong Jack Man and Jeet Kune Do" section above. This means the "Beyond Jeet Kune Do" title is erroneous. Also, the sentence <i>"However, Lee did not agree with this account"</i> is unsourced: there is no citation which states that Lee specifically denied Wong's claim about the alleged open challenge to all martial artists. NPOV-minded editors should make the necessary changes. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 06:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
