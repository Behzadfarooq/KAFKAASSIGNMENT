<p>Hi Bruce, glad you didn't take my comment to heart. Have you read the talk page archives for Cuba and Castro? You'll see what you are up against with your hopes for civilty, or consensus. I've considered various strategies over the last few months, but in the end I'd need to spend more of my week than I have spare to get anywhere with what I consider necessary - the development of a twin track entry. Too many people out there who feel it necessary to overwrite contrary perspectives. I do feel strongly that invoking Wiki standards/mediation/etc is a real waste of time. The regular warriors simply take a break and when the page is open again return to their edit warring, and meanwhile there are plenty of newcomers/passers by, ignorant of the page's history and debate, who plunge straight in with their asserted truths. My opinion is take it as it is and do your best to uphold some encyclopedic standards, which in this case do amount to describing the range of viewpoints on the subject. Don't expect more than small victories, and hope that they will accumulate. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelW_52ae.html" title="User:MichaelW">MichaelW</a> 09:33, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bruce. I appreciate your efforts to apply encyclopedia and wikipedia standards on the Cuba page. I believe that these immediate disputes <i>will</i> be ironed out, even if the dispute process is moved on somewhat. I will continue to support any efforts here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What I'm also interested in is what occurs after this dispute is resolved. I'd like to liase with other parties to minimize the potential of such breaches of NPOV on this page in the future. It's an important aspect of Wikipedia, the internet and thus has wider implications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's striking to observe the difficulties some editors have in applying objective standards. Personally I have argued (and will continue to argue) at length with socialists and Marxist-Leninists etc outside wikipedia about the implementation of such ideologies. And I've been accused in some circles of being an anti-Castro reactionary (though I dispute that also!). But all of this should be left at the door when editing Wikipedia. My motivation is to challenge common misinterpretations and cultural bias, so we can present an accurate picture of Cuba free from dominant received wisdom. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 13:59, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bruce, are you still interested in progressing the dispute process, and following the step towards formal mediation?--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 21:32, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, sure. Doesn't mediation require that all parties be willing to mediate? I don't see that we meet that condition right now. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 21:39, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bruce, I've sent you an email, in the mean time I think it is worth considering a Rfc on Adam Carr. Do you have any thoughts on this?--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 22:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, no IM, but everybody is invited to email me, including you. My email is bruce@hallman.org and I try to respond quickly. I trust that Wikipedia, ultimately, will be fair about this. I regret that some at <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> appear to feel that they 'own' the article and appear unwilling to 'play nice', collaborate and compromise towards a NPOV. Still all POV's must be represented including POV's I don't like.

<p>Personal attacks have only taken place where another editor has criticised you as a person, not your edits or pronouncements. When Adam stated that he could not begin to express his views about you, he was not making a personal attack. He then went on to express his opinions of what you had written.

<p>His open advocation of pushing a Marxist POV on the Cuba page - also see his own talk page for his use of phrases such as "capitalist fanboys" - as i said with my experience of people like Richardchilton and his sockpuppets and cohorts i am wary of lefist POV pushers - ditto for right wing POV pushers when it comes to the crimes and death squads of right wing governments of Africa, Asia and the Americas - i try to protect articles from both "The Communist Peoples Party" on one side and "The National Salvation Front" on the other as someone put it on here some years ago.</p>

<p>Hi Bruce, I think you need to inform Adam formally of the Rfc. Other than that I see no reason why it should close, whether Scott is banned or not.

<p>You have just falsely accused me of initiating the ban on Scott Grayban. You must either produce some evidence for this allegation or retract it, or I will take the matter further. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:59, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize for any misunderstanding. I have edited what I wrote trying to make myself more clear. What I wrote, and what I intended to convey, was not to accuse you of initiating the ban of Scott Grayban, but to rather ask questions about the appearance of timing. As I tried to make clear before, I do not have good information and my repeated requests for information have gone unfulfilled. Regardless, the second hand information that I do have raises a question of appearances as to the timing, and raises a question of appearance of retaliation. I hope you join me in wanting the facts to be disclosed. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 14:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly you didn't speak with me so you couldn't have 'told' me, and if you wrote it to me I don't see it on my talk page, and I searched my inbox and don't see an email from you. If you wrote such to the general Wikipedia community, I don't recall reading it until you wrote it much after the fact on 04:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC), sorry. Regardless, I made no false allegation. I simply pointed out an odd appearance and asked for the facts. I still haven't been shown the facts about the evidence used for the ban, the source of the evidence and the timing. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 13:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that asking for a block, (which you claim to have done), and providing the evidence, (which Adam claims to have done) are significantly different steps in the process that led to the banning of Sgrayban. I apologized to Adam Carr. It appears he has accepted my apology. So, it is not clear why you now are warning me, (or accusing me?) about 'false allegations' when I made no false allegation and 'personally attacks' when I made no personal attack. This too appears odd, but can we just move on to something more constructive? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 13:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I saw your alert at Esperanza and wanted to stop by to see what's up. I've looked through your talk page and edit summaries some; it's a pretty big issue to grasp, having come in at this stage. I'd like to know more about it, so if you have time for a longer explanation, that'd be helpful. In the meantime, hope that you're keeping cool and not letting the edit wars get to you... perhaps taking a break on the side to edit a less controversial article would be a good way to refocus before heading back into the Bay of Pigs (sorry, awful joke). <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #228B22;">¡Épa!</span></a>-<a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_EA_ade9.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass/EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup></b> 06:13, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to explain your side of the situation to me, I appreciate it. As you know, I'm not able to take a side on the content dispute, and it's be pretty foolish of me to do so anyway as my knowledge of Cuba is limited to Celia Cruz, vintage cars and plaintains. Nonetheless, I agree that personal attacks aren't acceptable in any context... they ruin good faith, stifle intelligent discussion and turn users away from Wikipedia. I guess it happens to everyone sooner or later, even from the best of us.</dd>
<dd>At any rate, I'm glad that you haven't become frustrated and decided to call it quits. To offer some unsolicited advice, when I start to get irritated with vandals, I'll take a break to do some behind the scene stuff... pick up on some article <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">cleanups</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWIKIFY_0f2f.html" title="WP:WIKIFY">wikifying</a>. Helps keep me sharp. May work for you, may not, in any case, you'd know better than me what's relaxing. I hope that y'all find a middle ground soon; I'll be watching the article myself, as it's a subject I've long been meaning to read up on.

<p>Sorry, hadn't had the chance to reply, as I haven't been near an internet connection since Friday.</p>
<p>I asked Adam to stop reverting, and he duly did so. I then asked CarlKenner to do the same, as he was being reverted by a bunch of parties and was very far over the three revert rule. He then accused me of being a vandal. I then made it clear that I would block him if he continued to do so, and he accused me of being a vandal again and made clear his intention to continue. He was thus completely fairly blocked. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand how the material I added is in tension with the idea that the amendment protects, rather than creates, a right to keep and bear arms. Indeed, no one could be further from that proposition than I: I don't believe the Constitution - or for that matter, that any constitution CAN - creates any rights. The Federal and state constitutions prevent certain rights from being taken away by government. Those rights already existed, which of course is the point of the material that I added: that the right to keep and bear arms existed for centuries before the authors of the second amendment were born, and so the second amendment is only a codification of that right, and a protection of it from government intrusion (the history also absolutely forecloses the proposition that the second amendment protects a collective, rather than individual, right to arms, which makes its inclusion even more important). The second amendment, by the way, did not purport to "protect[] the right from being abridged by the <b>States</b>"; until 1868, it protected the right from being abridged by the <b>federal</b> government.

<dd>It's fascinating to me, though. Slightly off topic, but this Cuba democracy/elections business is reminiscent to me of the hugely defining and bitter <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_miners%27_strike_%281984-1985%29_34a1.html" title="UK miners' strike (1984-1985)">UK miners' strike (1984-1985)</a>. The powerful UK trade unions traditionally based decisions on voting by public meeting, discussion and an open show of hands. The Thatcher government of the time enforced a law declaring the actions illegitimate, utilising police to break the union <a href="http://lisweb.swan.ac.uk/swcc/images/strike/orgchrg.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://lisweb.swan.ac.uk/swcc/images/strike/orgchrg.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. They liased with the Rupert Murdoch owned media to portray union leader <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Scargill_e7e4.html" title="Arthur Scargill">Arthur Scargill</a> as a tyrant (featuring a front-page picture of Scargill mocked up as Hitler) and the Unions as a "threat to democracy" <a href="http://openweb.tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/1984-11/1984-11-23-ABC-15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://openweb.tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/1984-11/1984-11-23-ABC-15.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The government won, the Union and mining industry was effectively disbanded, ushering in the era of private capital dominance to the benefit of Thatcher's international corporate sponsors. It's a highly effective tool of politics, and it usually works. Of course, the activities of the government during the affair were later declared illegal, newspapers were forced to pay damages to Scargill and Blair's government have had to pay over £8b of public money to compensate miners for "illness" (and counting). But by then the sting had been activated and the international private sector had managed to gain control of the UK economy. If anyone needs theories to explain US public policy towards Cuba one may look no further than the above story. Call me a cynic, if you must! --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 18:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I really don't want to get into a discussion of the semantics and connotations surrounding the term 'democracy'. (Democracy is like pornography—I know it when I see it.&#160;:D ) I haven't any intention of wading into editing the article, since there appear to be a sufficient number of informed and enthusiastic volunteers for that duty.

<p>I removed the link to Direct Access Democracy on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Democracy (disambiguation)">Democracy (disambiguation)</a> page (which really needs more work). The article itself seems to be a semi-vanity page for <a href="http://www.etches.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.etches.net/" rel="nofollow">this website</a> - most of the uses of the phrase I've come across so far link back there somehow.

<p>Actually, if you look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Direct_Access_Democracy_Canada&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Direct_Access_Democracy_Canada&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history</a> of the Direct Access Democracy Canada article, I actually just recently pruned it down to the current format (and added the "importance" tag). Personally, I suspect this is a private hobby-horse for one rather eccentric individual who enjoys creating large amounts of formal verbiage - I found absolutely no indication of even minimal notability or membership outside of Mr. Oprea. The article would probably get deleted as vanity, original research or non-notable if put up on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, and definitely doesn't need to have an entry on a main-level disambiguation page such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Democracy (disambiguation)">Democracy (disambiguation)</a>, and in any case seems to be only marginally related to the equally idiosyncratic Direct Access Democracy article. Frankly, I could create a website for, say, "Kitten Drowning Democracy", complete with constitution, platform, and all the rest, and likely get more that 138 votes in certain Canadian ridings. Mr. Oprea is undoubtedly much more earnest, but no more notable. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your constructive edits to <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Five_83be.html" title="Cuban Five">Cuban Five</a> I've had enough of Wikipedia for today, I need a break. A few suggestions: add info outlining arguments for why the trial was so flawed. I think the conclusions of the UN commission of why the trial was arbitrary<a href="http://www.trabajadores.cubaweb.cu/antiterrorists_ingles/historia/official.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trabajadores.cubaweb.cu/antiterrorists_ingles/historia/official.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, or general conclusions from the overturning would be even more convincing than the Amnesty claims, which are not very strong. Also, the Cuban Five website seems a good resource of legal documents. Surely there's plenty reliable material there we can refer to<a href="http://www.freethefive.org/updates.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freethefive.org/updates.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. I think we can make agood article out of it if we include good bits of court material, and a solid sections on criticism of the trial, and to balance that to include prosecution arguments too. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 15:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bruce, and CJK. I've roughly translated (via copy and paste / Bable-Fish) three translations of the Cuba page from the Spanish, French and German wikipedia versions, to get an idea of the differences between those and ours. And a bit more of a world view. If you can get through the pigeon English it's worth a look, amusingly - those pages have the same "neutrality" and protected tags all over the place as well.

But to (implicitly) seven or eight different "types" of democracy specific to American political history makes no sense at all.

It's a Cuban short film which has some notability, yet users apparently deem this not appropriate for wikipedia - citing spurious google searches as evidence. Personally I think this is wrong, as the subject has much more interest to me (I studied Cuban cinema for a year) than the acres of articles on fictional characters from Star Wars. What's more, the editor who has been creating a number of articles on Cuban cinema is treated with the following comment - "Very likely a vanity article, as article author has only made edits promoting this filmmaker".

<p>Hey Bruce. I saw what you did with the red carpet image and I think it's maybe better to convert the whole image to greyscale. A manipulated picture is certainly going to attract attention of people who don't get offended by red carpets, but by manipulated red carpets... <strong><a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaester_mensch_68e0.html" title="User:Maester mensch">mensch</a></strong> • <strong><small><a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaester_mensch_7c13.html" title="User talk:Maester mensch">t</a></small></strong> 19:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a good solution. But manipulating parts of the image might conflict with the licensing policy. We'll see how it turns out. If something goes wrong I'll be happy to convert the image to greyscale, so you don't have to bother with the GIMP.&#160;;) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaester_mensch_68e0.html" title="User:Maester mensch">mensch</a></strong> • <strong><small><a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaester_mensch_7c13.html" title="User talk:Maester mensch">t</a></small></strong> 20:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bruce, I know we don't quite agree with all the democracy disambiguation issues, but I wanted to thank you for being calm and respectful throughout the entire discussion - I'm really impressed, I know many an editor who would become rather aggrivated in your situation.

<p>It's clear that you have a lot of passion for the subject of democracy and seeing that it is fully and appropriately covered in the Wikipedia. I see that aspect as very beneficial. That's why I would positively recommend that you consider pouring that passion into helping out with the "varieties/types merger" (or whatever it is to become), or take on a bigger task: Start "WikiProject Democracy" as a child project of "WikiProject Politics". I think we can work together (and with others) on a project to enhance coverage of democracy-related subjects in the Wikipedia. I sincerely hope that you can accept the clear consensus on the dab page and convert that time/energy into building up democracy-related content throughout the Wikipedia. Thanks for your time. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 17:32, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bruce. Would you mind taking a look at the first two sections of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Cuba_cf61.html" title="History of Cuba">History of Cuba</a> page that I've been tinkering with, that deal with the early settlers. I'm still not satisfied with the overall tone - how it reads and so on - it's a bit of a struggle trying to incorporate information into unsourced text that was already there and rather poorly constructed. I need another pair of eyes. Thanks.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 01:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">HighwayCello</a>, is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture.

The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>

<p>I'm all about continuous improvement. What wording would you recommend? Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminally ill</li>
<li>Terminal diagnosis</li>
<li>Death watch</li>
<li>Death bed</li>
<li>Dying</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the important point to express with whatever wording you like is that the reader understands that this person is currently living but has been diagnosed as terminally ill. And, of course, the diagnosis should be verifiable and not just an editor's opinion. For example, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricia_C._Dunn_e808.html" title="Patricia C. Dunn">Patricia C. Dunn</a> has stage IV ovarian cancer - a stage that's nearly always fatal. However, I haven't found any sources that describe her condition as terminal, so... no such category for her (yet). <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 17:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I should have explained myself on the article's talk page, sorry. I have now done so. Basically, I thought the list of gun uses was OR and it was previously objected to on the talk page. The reference to knives and swords was redundant with a similar sentence a couple of paragraphs down. And the rest was redundant with the discussion of the Uviller &amp; Merkel reference, which I had added because it seemed more reputable than the Potowmack Institute and made the same point. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 16:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I should add that my reversion of the very first part of your edit ("and/or" in the opening sentence) was unintentional. I have put that back in, as well as editing a later sentence in the article ("The right to bear arms in United States is best understood as a collective and an individual right") that seemed clearly POV ("best understood"?). <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 16:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bruce. I wonder if Annie Hill is really that notable? We dont need to list everyone in the History section who wrote a book durring that period, the list would be terribly long. I personally dont see the need to include Annie Hill, in fact I have never even heard of her until your addition and I am pretty well versed in sailing authors and books. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 15:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand your position, especially in that her books has been put back in print. But if you look at the post war era cruisers listed, many of their books are considered classics and are published by large publishers. In the more modern people listed, such as Lin &amp; Larry and the Dashews, they have published several books that have remained in print the entire time. I would suggest those listed before your additions are far more notable. You would be hard pressed to find a cruising sailor who has not heard of them, yet Annie Hall, while she may be notable in her 'cult' following as you suggest, does not mean she is notable to the general cruising community. I can think of people I consider more notable that myself still wouldnt consider notable enough to ad the article, Don Street comes to mind, as does Jimmy Cornell and I could probably list many others. I am not going to remove the additions you made, its not important enough to warrent worrying much about it, but I wished to offer you my point of view in hopes you chose to remove them yourself. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 16:15, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You reverted my 3/23 add that the military term for shotguns with a shortened barrel (often with a modified or missing stock) is combat shotgun, asking for attribution. The attribution is in the Wikipedia article that was linked. This is just what they are called. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 22:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is, in fact, such a thing as a combat shotgun and it pretty much is a fancied up sawed off shotgun with shortened barrels and stocks from the factory instead as a subsequent modification. By leaving out mention of the existence of combat shotguns you lose NPOV via omission. The facts of the case would have favored Miller but nobody argued the case. Those facts deserve mention in the article <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 01:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difference between a sawed off shotgun and a combat shotgun is that one is modified post-manufacture (the barrel is "sawed off") and the other is manufactured to the same modifications (shorter stock, short barrel). The difference between the conclusion of the Court and the physical history and real military use of those weapons means that there's grounds for reversal there. That the Court got the facts so wrong in *the* seminal 2nd amendment case for modern jurisprudence is noteworthy and I believe that people should have a link to what exactly a combat shotgun is in order to draw the appropriate inferences as regards to the facts v. what the Court said the facts were. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 15:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is just not true that the Supreme Court will reverse simply because they got the facts wrong. There's no automatic "oopsie" mechanism in the US constitution. You have to find another case and appeal it all the way to the supreme court. Roe (of Roe v Wade) and Doe (of Doe v Bolton) both tried to get their cases reversed because of factual errors (and being plaintiffs, they should know about lies on the part of their own attorneys). They were both denied. Somebody else has to come up with a case and the Cooley rule mandates that at least 4 justices agree to take up the issue. This is an incredibly hard standard to meet. We finally have one with Parker and we'll see. The factual error has the greatest possibility to mislead in the political realm where lots of people are going to misrepresent Miller as if it were actually factually correct. The record should be made clear because people will be misled otherwise.</dd>

<dd>Military use, historical and current, seems, by Miller's logic, to be one of the reasons why a particular weapon cannot be banned. The military and civilian versions of short barrel/short stock shotguns have different names. Discussion of Miller should include references to both terms so people understand the connection. Otherwise we're just buying into the prosecution's trick of pretending that they didn't exist. That's certainly not NPOV.</dd>

<dd>The militia, at this time, is established by statute and if you were to actually look at your state military code, you will find that the militia is not defined exclusively as the National and State guards organizations. That you mistakenly think that such is the actual statutory definition leads me to believe that you're either not well informed or not neutral. Pick a state code and let's take a look if you want to dispute this point. You can find the state codes at Findlaw (<a href="http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/#statelaw" class="external free" title="http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/#statelaw" rel="nofollow">http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/#statelaw</a>).</dd>

<dd>I'm not the one bringing up 1789. I think a much more reasonable vision of modern militia outside the National Guard structure is the korean shopowners mutual aid militia in the Rodney King riots, armed neighborhood watches in post Katrina New Orleans and along the rest of the Gulf Coast, etc. in other words, modern examples of a reasonable use of force to assure public order during temporary breakdowns of normality. But you can't have that kind of ad-hoc coming together if arms are not widely distributed. But we've swung off and started to debate policy, haven't we? Is that what this whole thing is about? I just want to make sure that those who read the article understand that sawed off shotgun = combat shotgun that's been modified post manufacture. This is a reasonable point to make, something that is relevant to the case, and something that would have come out had anybody bothered to show up to argue the other side in Miller. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 17:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If attribution is the sole problem, instead of reverting, you should have simply added a 'need's attribution' tag. In any case, googling "US v Miller combat shotgun" provides plenty of references and analyses outlining the problem. Here are a few.</dd>

<dd>There, no doubt, are plenty more. I just went through a few pages of hits and took less than 5 minutes to find the above links, No doubt I'd get a better list (the last one is probably inappropriate for encyclopedia use). In other words, attributing this to other people's research is not much of a problem. So if I put up the information again and include a link to Puckett's research into Miller are you going to let it stay in or revert again? <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 00:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jack Miller's gun, as described by the Court, fits the category of improvised combat shotgun. The very existence of combat shotguns was not taken into account in the case, a mistake of fact in a seminal 2nd amendment case. Dancing around the different names, trying to hide what is plain is not NPOV. Combat shotguns, sometimes called trench guns, are short barrel, short stock guns. The combat shotgun article has a short double barrel specimen (the confederate soldier picture) whose only difference with Miller's gun is that Miller's gun probably wasn't a muzzle loader. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 20:00, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to think this is a policy discussion. It is not. Independent of our little tete a tete, others have modified the article in a way that I find more to my liking. I added a simple link where appropriate and find it good. I blog at <a href="http://www.snappingturtle.net/jmc/tmblog/" class="external free" title="http://www.snappingturtle.net/jmc/tmblog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.snappingturtle.net/jmc/tmblog/</a>. You can find my email there. If you care to debate policy, email would probably be best. Since there's no longer any wiki issue, I'll terminate the discussion on the issue letting you have the last word but maintaining you're wrong. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 17:48, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
