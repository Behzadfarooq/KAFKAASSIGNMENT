<p>The Bruderhof's foundation is faith in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. His teachings are central to Bruderhof life - particularly the command "Love your neighbor as yourself," the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, and His teachings concerning nonviolence, faithfulness in marriage, and compassion for the poor. Bruderhof members share the beliefs as recorded in the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostles%27_Creed_d1e6.html" title="Apostles' Creed">Apostles' Creed</a> and the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html" title="Didache">Didache</a>.</p>
<p>The Bruderhof follows the practices of the first church in Jerusalem, whose members were (according to the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Book of Acts</a>) of "one heart and mind, and shared all things in common." Bruderhof members do not hold private property, but rather share everything. No Bruderhof member receives a salary or has a bank account. Income from all businesses is pooled and used for the care for all members, and for various communal outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The Bruderhof is a <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_church.html" title="Peace church">peace church</a> whose members do not serve in the armed forces of any country. Rather, they model a way of life that removes the social and economic divisions that bring about war. The goal of the Bruderhof is to create a new society where self-interest is yielded for the sake of the common good.</p>
<p>The Bruderhof movement draws inspiration and guidance from a number of historical streams including the early Christians, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a>, the <a href="http://www.blumhardts.com" class="external text" title="http://www.blumhardts.com" rel="nofollow">Blumhardts</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Youth_Movement_6a8a.html" title="German Youth Movement">German Youth Movement</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruderhof_Communities_00c3.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Bruderhof was founded in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> by <a href="../../../e/b/e/Eberhard_Arnold_c331.html" title="Eberhard Arnold">Eberhard Arnold</a>, a philosophy student and an intellectual speaker inspired by the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Youth_Movement_6a8a.html" title="German Youth Movement">German Youth Movement</a> in post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> he rented a house in Sannerz, Germany, and founded a religious community.</p>
<p>When the group outgrew the house at Sannerz, they moved to the nearby <a href="../../../r/h/%C3%B6/Rh%C3%B6n_Mountains_a6f1.html" title="Rhön Mountains">Rhön Mountains</a>. While there, Arnold discovered that the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutterite.html" title="Hutterite">Hutterites</a> (a body he had studied with great interest) were still in existence in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> he traveled to meet the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutterites.html" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a> and was ordained as a Hutterian minister.</p>
<p>With the rise of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, the Rhön community moved its draft-age men and children to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liechtenstein.html" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> around <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> because of their <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscientious_objection.html" title="Conscientious objection">conscientious refusal</a> to serve in the armed forces and to accept Nazi teachers. This community became known as the <i>Alm Bruderhof</i>. Continuing pressure from the Nazi government caused others to move to England and found the <i>Cotswold Bruderhof</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. On April 14, 1937, secret police surrounded the Rhön Bruderhof, confiscated the property, and gave the remaining community members forty-eight hours to flee the country. By <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, all the Bruderhof members had reassembled in England.</p>
<p>While in England, the population grew to over 350 members, largely through the addition of young English members seeking an alternative to war. Even before the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the community’s German members and its pacifist stance attracted deep suspicion locally resulting in economic boycotts. When confronted with the option of either having all German members interned, or leaving England as a group, the Bruderhof choose the latter, and began to look for refuge abroad. Soon after England entered the war, the Bruderhof emigrated to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> — the only country that would accept a pacifist community of mixed nationalities.</p>
<p>During the first years in the Paraguayan <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gran_Chaco_775a.html" title="Gran Chaco">Chaco</a>, Bruderhof members founded three settlements as well as a hospital for community members and local Paraguayans. The only clinic in the area, it served tens of thousands for the next two decades. By the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the community in Paraguay had grown to about 700 members.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, the Bruderhof started a settlement known as the Woodcrest Bruderhof in the United States near <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifton%2C_New_York_34e7.html" title="Rifton, New York">Rifton, New York</a>, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of American guests. Hundreds of new members joined, many from other communal groups across the country. Around this time, under the leadership of Heinrich Arnold, the Bruderhof reestablished the teachings of Jesus as the basis and foundation of the communal movement. He also revived the writings of his father, Eberhard Arnold, and those of Johann and Christoph Blumhardt.</p>
<p>New communities were also founded in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>) and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>). At the same time, although the Paraguayan communities were thriving, a tension between the American Bruderhofs who followed Heinrich Arnold's leadership and the Paraguayan communitarian movements resulted in the disbanding of Bruderhof presence in Paraguay. There was a shunning of many Paraguayan members due to doctrinal, theological, and ideological differences with Heinrich Arnold. By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, all members had relocated from Paraguay to the northeastern United States, or to England.</p>
<p>The Forest River colony of Schmiedeleut Hutterites in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Dakota_3971.html" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a> invited the Bruderhof to join them, and about 36 members moved to North Dakota. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, the Schmiedeleut group excluded the Bruderhof and placed the Forest River colony under probation. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, the Bruderhof leadership apologized for the problems among the Forest River colony and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> was reunited with all branches of the Hutterian Church. However, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> the more conservative Dariusleut and Lehrerleut Hutterites excommunicated the Bruderhof, refusing to recognize them as Hutterites because of practices that did not conform to standard Hutterite order including sending children to public schools, the use of musical instruments, and opposition to the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>. In 1990 the <a href="http://www.springvalleybruderhof.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.springvalleybruderhof.com/" rel="nofollow">Spring Valley Bruderhof</a> was founded adjacent to the <a href="http://www.newmeadowrunbruderhof.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.newmeadowrunbruderhof.com/" rel="nofollow">New Meadow Run Bruderhof</a> in Farmington, Pennsylvania. In 2002 the Bruderhof purchased the house in Sannerz where the movement started. It is one of two Bruderhof houses in Germany.</p>

<p>The Bruderhof movement has continued to grow, and membership is more than 2,500. The largest Bruderhof has over four hundred members; the smallest has less than twenty. Most communities have a nursery, kindergarten, school, communal kitchen, laundry, various workshops, and offices. Bruderhof life is built around the family, though there are also many single members. Children are an important part of each community and participate in most communal gatherings. Disabled and elderly members are loved and cared for within the community and participate in daily life and work as much as they are able.</p>
<p>Like the Hutterites, the Bruderhof members do not hold private property individually, but rather share everything in common. No Bruderhof member receives a salary or has a bank account. Income from all businesses is pooled and used for the care for all members, and for various communal outreach efforts.</p>
<p>Children of Bruderhof families do not automatically become members, but are encouraged to leave the community and live elsewhere before deciding on their own whether or not to join the community.</p>
<p>Numerous guests visit the Bruderhof and all communities are open to guests. One attraction was the Bruderhof Museum at the Woodcrest Bruderhof which was designed, built, and staffed by Bruderhof high school and college students. The museum housed exhibits illustrating the community’s 80-year history spanning five generations and four continents. The museum is no longer in existence, however, due to a community decision to convert the room into a place of meeting: The Brotherhood Room.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.communityplaythings.com" class="external text" title="http://www.communityplaythings.com" rel="nofollow">Community Playthings</a>, a line of classroom furniture and toys, was developed during the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950s</a> and soon became the Bruderhof’s main source of income. It still provides the community with a livelihood today. Other Bruderhof businesses include <a href="http://www.rifton.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rifton.com" rel="nofollow">Rifton Equipment</a>, which offers mobility and rehabilitation equipment for disabled adults and children, <a href="http://springvalleysigns.danthoniadesigns.com" class="external text" title="http://springvalleysigns.danthoniadesigns.com" rel="nofollow">Spring Valley Signs</a>, which produces <a href="http://www.springvalleysigns.com" class="external text" title="http://www.springvalleysigns.com" rel="nofollow">hand carved wooden signs</a>, and <a href="http://www.cleansheen.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cleansheen.com/" rel="nofollow">Clean Sheen Services</a>, which provides cleaning and property management services.</p>
<p>The Bruderhof has operated a publishing house since its founding in 1920, though it is now discontinued. For the last forty years, the community has published books and periodicals under its own imprint, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plough_62a2.html" title="The Plough">the Plough</a>. Plough published spiritual classics, inspirational books, and children’s books. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of the Bruderhof's books were available as free resources on their websites. Some are still available on the <a href="http://www.plough.com" class="external text" title="http://www.plough.com" rel="nofollow">Plough</a> website in ebook format as well as occasional articles. The Plough is no longer operational, however, due to a community decision to focus its efforts elsewhere.</p>

<p>Through the Bruderhof Foundation, a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charity</a> created to support outreach and service efforts, and through individual members, the Bruderhof remains actively involved in the neighborhoods that surround its communities, and in the world at large. Bruderhof members serve on school boards, volunteer at prisons and hospitals, and work with local social service agencies to provide food and shelter for those in need of help. Through <a href="http://www.breakingthecycle.us" class="external text" title="http://www.breakingthecycle.us" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Cycle</a>, a conflict resolution program for schools, the Bruderhof also reaches thousands of high school students each year. They are involved with a variety of peace and justice issues.</p>

<p>Because the Bruderhof communities, like other Anabaptist communitarian movements, maintain a separation between the community and the outside world, there have been conflicts with neighbors and those outside the Bruderhof. Property rights cases near the Woodcrest Bruderhof have resulted in some lawsuits, but for the most part the surrounding communities are at peace with Bruderhof neighbors.</p>
<p>Accusations have been made that the Bruderhof acts like a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a>. These accusations were made by a sociologist, Julius Rubin, who wrote a book on the subject after interviewing ex-members and researching Bruderhof history. He has never visited a working Bruderhof and has not been in contact with any current members, though readers of the book who have visited the Bruderhof are impressed with his knowledge nonetheless. There have been accusations of harassment and abuse made by some who have tried to form support groups such as Keep-In-Touch, an organization of ex-Bruderhof members. There have also been accusations made that the family of Johann Christoph Arnold has access to resources and benefits beyond most of the community-members' simple lifestyles, but these have not been proved substantially.</p>
<p>The Bruderhof has sued some of the most vocal detractors in what the detractors claim was an attempt to silence the criticism.</p>
