<p>--JoeHine, I appreciate the good contributions you have made to the article, but I must reiterate: "Please keep in mind that this article is encyclopedic, so it is appropriate to indicate there are detractors as well as supporters." I added back the Peregrine Foundation link and the reference to the Rubin book. Trying to hide negative material from the reading public could give the impression that the Bruderhof really has something to hide. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 22:52, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Particularly to JoeHine, but to anyone who may have this information: IMO, some good additions to the article would be to give an historical account of the leading elders of the organization (e.g. Eberhard Arnold (1920?-1935),&#160;?? (1935-1962) Heinrich Arnold (1962-1982), etc.) and an accounting of how many communities and members exist currently. On the leaders, a little biographical info would be good (except E. Arnold, of course, since we have a separate article for him). Please keep in mind that this article is encyclopedic, so it is appropriate to indicate there are detractors as well as supporters. I added back the Peregrine Foundation link. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 22:17, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it really necessary to include all sixteen of the Bruderhof's links? Links should tell us something about the topic of the article and not merely be offshoots of the main topic. Websites such as the Bruderhof's Grief Companion page do not actually tell us anything about the group and we could no doubt reach that page from within the main Bruderhof site if so inclined.

<dd>Swegner, I think you are right. We should prune the amount of links in the article. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 00:28, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text never mentions that the Bruderhof was admitted into the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutterite.html" title="Hutterite">Hutterite</a> church, and subsequently excommunicated by all three churches. It does not make note that there are thousands of people who have banded against them, does not mention the concealed weapons permit of one of the major leaders, and other actions that are in direct opposition to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> teaches of Hutterites and others. Good information can be had from the Peregrine Foundation <a href="http://www.perefound.org/jr_cn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perefound.org/jr_cn.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Also good is the essay <i>The Other Side of Joy</i> <a href="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~fun/bruderhof/rubin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~fun/bruderhof/rubin.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which the Bruderhof tried to suppress.</p>
<p>As I understand it, professional cult researchers and analysts would classify the Bruderhof as a cult (though I can't speak from that perspective) - whereas the other three <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> churches are not even close...</p>
<p>The text sounds like a massive sales pitch - including that link farm at the end. For all of the details that the Bruderhof want to suppress, the Pergerine Foundation is a high quality extensive resource.</p>

<dl>
<dd>David, I agree that article needs work. Several times the Peregrine link and mention of "The Other Side of Joy" were deleted. I know, because I reinserted them. I don't know that I would consider the Bruderhof a cult, and think we should be careful throwing that name around. But it does seem fairly apparent that some want to present only the sunny side of the Bruderhof. There is too much sales pitch in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as exclusion from the Hutterites, it is mentioned somewhat in this paragraph: "The Forest River colony of Schmiedeleut Hutterites in North Dakota invited the Bruderhof to join them, and about 36 members moved to North Dakota. In 1955, the Schmiedeleut group excluded the Bruderhof and placed the Forest River colony under probation. In 1973, the Bruderhof leadership apologized for the problems among the Forest River colony and in 1974 was reunited with all branches of the Hutterian Church. However, in 1990 the more conservative Dariusleut and Lehrerleut Hutterites excommunicated the Bruderhof, refusing to recognize them as Hutterites because of practices that did not conform to standard Hutterite order including sending children to public schools, the use of musical instruments, and opposition to the death penalty." - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 00:28, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After reading "Please keep in mind that this article is encyclopedic, so it is appropriate to indicate there are detractors as well as supporters" I had a quick look at the Roman Catholic and Church of LDS and Judaism articles, figuring big active communities like these would all have some controversy to write about. The RC and LDS articles do indeed have sections listing complaints of detractors, but I don't see such a section in the Judaism article. Maybe I just missed it, or maybe no one has anything bad to say about Judaism, but I have the feeling that most (all?) religious communities have detractors.</p>
<p>Shouldn't all articles about religious communities have a similar structure, with similar headings, including a section for detractors, that helps to ensure similar (fair) coverage of all religious communities? And an article about a really nice religious community could say, in the detractors' section, "No one in the world has anything bad to say about this religious community. They are beloved by all." -- Eeksypeeksy</p>
<p>Eeksypeeksy, you make a good point in that religious detractors deserve attention in an encyclopedic article about the religion. We tend to allow people to choose religion freely, but we tend to levy harsher criticism against new religious practices or groups (faith based groups organized since, say, 1700 or 1800 b.c.e, Latter Day Saints, Transcendentalists, Bruderhof). Many fear religious groups that establish their own form of society which functions in contrast or tandem with the capitalist society they're derived from. Where can we find balance on fairly airing views of the detractors while accurately portraying the tenants of the faith?</p>
<p>Islam, Catholicism, and Buddhism for examples allow individuals to hold and practice beliefs while living as citizens at large within greater national communities. Many only practice group worship one day out of the week (typically Saturday or Sunday). A non believer, more or less, shares the daily practices of a believer.</p>
<p>In contrast, religious communities like the Bruderhof offer a slightly more encompassing faith based message. While individual worshipers still hold relationships with the outside world, their status as individuals, their right to individual property ownership, and daily routines vary significantly from those of, say for illustration, (Non-Hassidic) Jewish worshipers.</p>
<p>Without addressing issues like an individual’s rights to choose a religion or those individuals right to reject divinity entirely, we see distinction between these examples. Based on sheer statistics (2500 Bruderhof versus Millions of, say, Protestants worldwide) the norm can be determined. While acknowledging the importance of constantly questioning our faith, as all divine beliefs deserve questions -- even atheism -- would an encyclopedic article about a religious community be accurate if it didn't give special attention to a disproportionately small number of believers versus a large number of detractors? This seems especially relevant in the article about the Bruderhof. Aren’t the criticisms of the group the same practices the current members embrace?AbbottStark 14:53, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Detractors" in this case are usually those who did not follow the way of life lived by the members of the Bruderhof but acted antagonistically toward it in some way. It is quite understandable to me, a former "Bruderhofer", that, when one disagrees with a way of life one might be asked to leave or even told to leave. This can happen in any church worth it's merit. When you make choices that affect the unity of the church as a group of believers it is often best to separate--and when that doesn't occur voluntarily, it is sometimes done by instruction. I found another church in which I attempt to serve the Lord, but maintain a friendly relationship with the Bruderhof. We have a common love: Jesus.AMerchant 01:40, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please be aware that as of Friday December 9, 2005 ALL Bruderhof owned and sponsored internet links went off-line and were replaced with a single page that said for information about visiting Bruderhof communities contact by writing the Bruderhof in Rifton, NY for American and German based websites and for England, contact the Robertsbridge, East Sussex site. For the Australian communities as of today - Dec. 10, only a blank page comes up. This list includes ALL the Bruderhof owned/sponsored links at the bottom of the article. What follows is the exact text from the American website page - www.bruderhof.org:</p>
<p>Bruderhof Communities</p>
<p>We welcome visitors at all our communities. To contact the community nearest you, write to:</p>
<p>Woodcrest 2032 Rt. 213 Rifton, NY 12471</p>
<p>845-658-8351 (USA)</p>
<p>Also - the email lists I am aware of - Daily Dig and Weekly Peace calendar arrived in my email yesterday with the note that they were the last issues. At the top of Daily Dig were quotes from Dorothy Day (of Catholic Worker fame) and Emmy Arnold to the effect that the time for words was past and the time for deeds had come. Both the previous issues of Weekly Peace Calendar (12/2/05) and Daily Dig (12/8/05) had their usual information on subscribing and unsubscribing at the bottom of the emails which leads me to believe that this was an extremely sudden decision - especially since Daily Dig comes out every day and just the day before the last issue there was NO indication of any upcoming change. What follows is the exact text from the last Daily Dig and Weekly Peace Calendar:</p>
<p>Your Last Dig</p>
<p>"The work is more important than the talking and the writing about the work." - Dorothy Day</p>
<p>"There have been enough words, enough sermons and books. What matters now is deeds." - Emmy Arnold</p>
<p>Dear Reader:</p>
<p>We will no longer be publishing online, so this will be your last Daily Dig. This is only the beginning, not the end. We want to thank you for your friendship over the years, and look forward to meeting you face to face. Now the real contact can begin. We welcome you to drop by any of our communities any time to join us in our daily life and work.</p>
