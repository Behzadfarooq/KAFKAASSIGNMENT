<p>I was introduced to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutalism.html" title="Brutalism">Brutalism</a> for the first time when I was working as an assistant chaplain at St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital Center in Chicago. The building has been described as a "giant concrete air conditioner". It struck me as pretty funny that a hospital would be built in a brutalist style!<br />

<li>The consistency should run the other way, with at least a date in the captions. Very informative to have the dates as the eye runs down the images. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 00:06, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is it necessary to duplicate the information? Since the list will be more exhaustive than the row of images, and any building in an image should also be in the list, the list seems the place to include that information, so that it can be included there for all structures (not just those in the images). I guess the only case where I could see duplicating either the year built or the architect in the image captions would be if we wanted to sort the images by either year or architect, but I don't necessarily see a need for that either. If we didn't have the list, or if the list was demerged into its own article, then I could see the sense in putting that info in the captions much more. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 22:40, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I decided to compromise. I think the condensed form of architect and year fulfills the desire for giving more meaning to the images without entirely duplicating information elsewhere in the article. So, you're welcome.

<p>I don't know if there is a WP convention on sorting lists of buildings, but I'm going by the following arbitrary rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the building is named after a person, use the initial of the person's last name.</li>
<li>If the building is an unnamed building, or if the entry indicates a group of buildings, from a larger campus, use the name of the campus owner (e.g. a school).</li>
<li>Include "university" etc. as part of the name.</li>
<li>If a group of buildings all have similar names with the exception of indications of where they are located, sort them in order of year built (especially if they were designed by the same person).</li>

<p>My best online research suggested (though not definitively) that Wes Corgan was the designer of the Rees Carillon.

<dd>Good luck, but due to the site's design I found it very hard to find any pictures that showcased the estate's Brutalism. From what I could see, you'd need to be inside the square to really appreciate it, and then you have to pick one particular angle from the inside to take a picture of, but no one angle will fully expose the variety of Brutalistic elements used in various portions of the lot. Perhaps a panoramic or partial panoramic from the inside might do it justice. Or maybe something taken from a roof of one corner. But I don't think one picture can capture the design, based on the pictures I've seen. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li>Not IMO. Much too much glass, focus on smooth and shiny, hardly any concrete or visible structure -- the glass facades and what not do what they can to <i>obscure</i> the nature of the building rather than exploit and embarass it. Modernist I think but much too technological and recent IMO, not sure the exact style, but it's been popping up since the mid 90s at least (e.g. <a href="http://www.campusrec.neu.edu/marino/images.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campusrec.neu.edu/marino/images.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li>Images on the web will probably uniformly show off the gleaming new, rather postmodern Marks &amp; Spencer, not the older building, which is now seen as a bit of an embarrassment. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:19, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, there's the High-Tech glassy extension in the foreground in the photos, but also the original concrete (w/ v. small windows) tower often seen in the background. Certainly looks Brutalist to me, even if the shape is a tad uniform and structural elements under-expressed compared to many classic Brutalist structures. Not sure if it's important enough to warrent inclusion though. <a href="../../../f/r/f/User%7EFrFintonStack_5040.html" title="User:FrFintonStack">FrFintonStack</a> 11:21, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Recently the attribution for Boston City Hall was changed from I.M. Pei to Kallmann and McKinnell. Granted, the text above the notable buildings section says "architect". Typically I would think to equate "architect" with "designer", but it seems this is not always the case. Regardless, it seems to me that the style of a building is determined based on the design, and therefore whoever designed the building should get the credit for its position as an example of a style.

<dd>I'm hard pressed to find a hard-and-fast rule as to what is Brutalism. To some extent, it seems to be a "you know it when you see it" style. Hunstanton for example. All sources insist it is brutalist, but if it is, it is in a philosophical way rather than an architectural style way, IMO.</dd>
<dd>A lot of what people label as brutalist looks a lot more like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internationalist.html" title="Internationalist">internationalist</a> done in concrete, or <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">modernist</a> with a bit of concrete or non-traditional shapes. Some label anything done in concrete as "brutalist".</dd>
<dd>And then there are those buildings that don't get called brutalist very often, but sure do look like it to me (e.g. 50 Queen Anne's Gate).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I would love to have you add info on the history of the roles Le C. and Jeanneret played. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>Yes I think I can add something on L.C. And yes the issue with Brutalism is that it is often in the eye of the beholder. One has to take, however, other things into consideration, as in the case of Safdi who during that period had a type of organic-geometric interest going. The other thing to mention is what could be called College Brutalism. Almost every university in the US it seems to me has at least on Brutalist building from the late 60s. There is a FANTASTIC one in Washington University in Seattle. I don't know what its name is though. Concrete of course.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 14:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no university in Seattle called Washington University. Do you by any chance mean the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Washington_e29d.html" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a>? I can't think what building you would mean there, though. Condon Hall, the former law school, is brutalist, but I can't imagine anyone considering it fantastic. Seig Hall, from that period, is pretty hideous, in that it integrated incongruous ornamental elements; most of the other buildings on campus from when brutalism was big (including several buildings around Red Square) certainly show its influence, but have brick façades. There are a few brutalist dorms. There could be something I'm not thinking of… Far and away, though, Seattle's notable brutalist achievement is <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway_Park_%28Seattle%29_59e9.html" title="Freeway Park (Seattle)">Freeway Park</a>. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:40, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes you are right. I was typing too fast. University of Washington, it is. I visited only briefly, so you may have a better take on this if you know the campus, but I saw it in the photo of the Charles Odegaard Library that is on the wikipedia <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Washington_e29d.html" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a> site. It is to the right of the library, though. I don;t know what building it is or who designed it, but as about as brutal as it gets. Looks like an underpass for a bridge.

<dd>I recall seeing some very brutalist-looking buildings while crawling through exit traffic after a UW graduation. I presume they were dorms. One in particular had grid-like ornamentation in concrete at the top (leaving empty squares to the sky). I don't know if I can describe it any better. Anyway, not knowing what hall it is makes it difficult for me to add it to the list. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>Ah, Kane Hall. Yes, that picture is on the abovementioned Red Square, and you are right: that one building, unlike the other buildings from that era around the square, is not entirely covered in brick. But I believe parts of it are: see <a href="http://static.flickr.com/53/156990877_d2e9e5f871_m.jpg" class="external free" title="http://static.flickr.com/53/156990877_d2e9e5f871_m.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://static.flickr.com/53/156990877_d2e9e5f871_m.jpg</a>: notice the part at the right. I'll probably be on the campus some time the next week or so, I'll try to get some pictures from various angles. But you are certainly right that the main entranceway is Brutalist. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I took several more pictures of Kane Hall. As you can see, most of it is covered in brick. Only the side facing onto Red Square is raw concrete, though the forms are basically brutalist.</p>
