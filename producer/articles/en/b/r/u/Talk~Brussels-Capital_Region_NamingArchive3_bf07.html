<h2><span class="mw-headline">Names survey</span></h2>
<p>This is a survey for which names the articles for the municipalities in the region of Brussels should have. The region is officially bilingual, French-Dutch, and several of the municipalities have different names in French and Dutch. The articles in question are given below, with their present title.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auderghem.html" title="Auderghem">Auderghem</a> (French name, Dutch: Oudergem)</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/o/l/Molenbeek-Saint-Jean_e35a.html" title="Molenbeek-Saint-Jean">Molenbeek-Saint-Jean</a> (French name, Dutch: Sint-Jans-Molenbeek)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Gilles%2C_Belgium_e506.html" title="Saint-Gilles, Belgium">Saint-Gilles, Belgium</a> (French name, Dutch: Sint-Gillis)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Josse-ten-Noode_b771.html" title="Saint-Josse-ten-Noode">Saint-Josse-ten-Noode</a> (French name, Dutch: Sint-Joost-ten-Node)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaarbeek.html" title="Schaarbeek">Schaarbeek</a> (Dutch name, French: Schaerbeek)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Agatha-Berchem_6cde.html" title="Sint-Agatha-Berchem">Sint-Agatha-Berchem</a> (Dutch name, French: Berchem-Sainte-Agathe)</li>
<li><a href="../../../u/c/c/Uccle.html" title="Uccle">Uccle</a> (French name, Dutch: Ukkel)</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermael-Boitsfort_daf2.html" title="Watermael-Boitsfort">Watermael-Boitsfort</a> (French name, Dutch: Watermaal-Bosvoorde)</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Woluwe-Saint-Lambert_e820.html" title="Woluwe-Saint-Lambert">Woluwe-Saint-Lambert</a> (French name, Dutch: Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This survey handles the issue whether both names should be in the article title, if so, how, and if not, which one. The first question is whether both names names should be in the title. The second question depends on the result of the first question: if the result is "one name", which one, and if it's "two names", which name comes first, and what separator ("-", " - ", "/", " / ", " or ", etc. etc.) is used. Because of the holidays I'd propose to let this survey run for a month, and use the first two weeks (until 6 January) for the first question. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 11:37, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first part of this survey has resulted in a clear majority for <b>one name</b> for the municipalities in the Brussels region. In the second part of the survey, the single article names will be discussed. Most contributors to the discussion are in favour of following common English usage, in conformity with the Wikipedia naming conventions. Everyone is invited to give their opinions on how common English usage should be determined. See the sections <a href="#If_one_name.2C_which_one" title="">#If one name, which one</a> and <a href="#English_usage_statistics" title="">#English usage statistics</a>. I propose to use the coming week (until 13 January) to answer these two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#What_one_name" title="">#What one name</a> to use for the municipality article titles. Dutch only, French only, alternating Dutch and French, English usage, other?</li>
<li><a href="#Criteria_for_English_usage" title="">#Criteria for English usage</a>: if “English usage” is chosen in Question 1, what would be the method to determine this, what is considered “decisive” and what would the fallback position be in case of “indecisiveness?”</li>
</ol>
<p>The second part of this survey has resulted in a clear majority for <b>English usage</b> for the municipalities in the Brussels region. The results of Google searches by <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> regarding the English usage show a significant lead for the French names for 10 municipalities, and undecided for <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Agatha-Berchem_6cde.html" title="Sint-Agatha-Berchem">Sint-Agatha-Berchem</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molenbeek-Saint-Jean_e35a.html" title="Molenbeek-Saint-Jean">Molenbeek-Saint-Jean</a> (see <a href="#Revised_Google_test" title="">#Revised Google test</a>). Add your comments, e.g. what name to choose for the two undecided municipalities, under <a href="#Discussion_and_conclusion" title="">#Discussion and conclusion</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 18:59, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The final result of the survey is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the following municipalities the French name has been chosen, in line with the most commonly used names in English:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/u/d/Auderghem.html" title="Auderghem">Auderghem</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest%2C_Belgium_9d19.html" title="Forest, Belgium">Forest, Belgium</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles.html" title="Ixelles">Ixelles</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Gilles%2C_Belgium_e506.html" title="Saint-Gilles, Belgium">Saint-Gilles, Belgium</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Josse-ten-Noode_b771.html" title="Saint-Josse-ten-Noode">Saint-Josse-ten-Noode</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaerbeek.html" title="Schaerbeek">Schaerbeek</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../u/c/c/Uccle.html" title="Uccle">Uccle</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermael-Boitsfort_daf2.html" title="Watermael-Boitsfort">Watermael-Boitsfort</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Woluwe-Saint-Lambert_e820.html" title="Woluwe-Saint-Lambert">Woluwe-Saint-Lambert</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Woluwe-Saint-Pierre_0d22.html" title="Woluwe-Saint-Pierre">Woluwe-Saint-Pierre</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for the following municipalities no significant preference in the English language has been found. After discussion, the Dutch names have been chosen:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek_7fed.html" title="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Sint-Jans-Molenbeek</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Agatha-Berchem_6cde.html" title="Sint-Agatha-Berchem">Sint-Agatha-Berchem</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This naming scheme requires the following moves:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles-Elsene_8f9b.html" title="Ixelles-Elsene">Ixelles-Elsene</a> → <a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles.html" title="Ixelles">Ixelles</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaarbeek.html" title="Schaarbeek">Schaarbeek</a> → <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaerbeek.html" title="Schaerbeek">Schaerbeek</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Woluwe-Saint-Pierre_-_Sint-Pieters-Woluwe_7d00.html" title="Woluwe-Saint-Pierre - Sint-Pieters-Woluwe">Woluwe-Saint-Pierre - Sint-Pieters-Woluwe</a> → <a href="../../../w/o/l/Woluwe-Saint-Pierre_0d22.html" title="Woluwe-Saint-Pierre">Woluwe-Saint-Pierre</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/l/Molenbeek-Saint-Jean_e35a.html" title="Molenbeek-Saint-Jean">Molenbeek-Saint-Jean</a> → <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek_7fed.html" title="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Sint-Jans-Molenbeek</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>One</b> for clarity, see discussion below. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 11:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>One</b> as <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> said, choice should be for the single name most commonly used in english, redirect pages for alternative uses etc. Long names are at best confusing.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 13:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>One</b> for several reasons: clarity (title and article), consistency with similar decisions elsewhere (South Tyrol, Finland…), and because two names don’t get rid of the problem (which one comes first?). <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 14:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>One</b> per above.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenfruitsmaak_e31a.html" title="User:Stevenfruitsmaak">Steven Fruitsmaak</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevenfruitsmaak_7b57.html" title="User talk:Stevenfruitsmaak">Reply</a>)</small> 16:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>One</b>. Surely we do not have to repeat the whole South Tyrol discussion? -- <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 16:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Two</b>. The region is equally bilingual, there are no English names, the Dutch names are the original ones, there are more French-speaking (45-50%) than Dutch-speaking (10-15%) people but many people speak neither French nor Dutch (30%) or speak both languages (10%), so for this exceptional case both names should be used. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 17:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Two</b>. As these municipalities all belong to the Brussels-<b>Capital</b> agglomeration, the mayors and council are elected by their own inhabitants but the municipalities are all well-known by nearly all Belgians of which 59% speak Dutch and only 40% speak French, and visited by so many of them (e.g. getting a visum at an Embassy, to work in the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_9235.html" title="Information Technology">IT</a> offices, at <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>, to walk or drive in the touristy <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonian_Forest_18b3.html" title="Sonian Forest">Sonian Forest</a> which expands over several of the municipalities, etc). It is not acceptable for Wikipedia to upset the inhabitants of the officially bilingual municipalities or the citizens of their country, or to get envolved in the French/Dutch controversies that are very much alive and politically exploited by both language groups, by enforcing either one language upon speakers of English: none except for the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Brussels_1314.html" title="City of Brussels">City of Brussels</a> (which keeps that name on Wikipedia) has a common or usual English name, thus any single language name as article title is bound to be a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. A single name does not add to 'clarity', especially as these municipalities are most often talked about with respect to their bilingual status, which is thus most <i>notable</i>, or for some municipalities with respect to their majorities of non-European origin. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 02:43&#160;(UTC)</span></li>
<li><b>One</b> No more South Tyrols; here we cannot even fall back on the language of the country as some tried to do in the South Tyrol.. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 00:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>One.</b> Per Caranorn. Trying to appease only the natives is not consistent with most naming conventions nor NPOV and is extremely unwiely. Flemings aren't supposed to have an encyclopedic monopoly on how to write about all things Flemish. Same goes for their immediate neighbors. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 16:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. It is unacceptable to let American English prevail <i>systematically</i> over British English although it is <i>always</i> the majority usage (for identical things, as is the case here). As ratios of American/English speakers match ratios in English language texts of French-name/Dutch-name being used, any 'one name' in always the same language of origin while for each municipality clearly both names are used in English language is equally unacceptable, largely for the same reasons, as not accepting only American titles. Two names would have avoided the problem that is now put to the voters, as how to ascertain which name to choose ('always the same language', not being acceptable) while any choice about 'this municipality French' and 'that municipality Dutch' will be arbitrary and based on disputable facts and POVs. How long would e.g. 2/3 French names and 1/3 Dutch names be maintained? It would continously become "improved" to whatever a future reader thinks best. Thus Dutch for one alternating with French for another municipality (e.g. suggestion above), may prevent this, it fullfills the arguments for clarity and simplicity that many used to choose 'one name', and still avoids discriminating against 1/3 of English speakers who use the other origin, as well as it avoids violating NPOV towards Flemish/Walloon controversies, and even respects the Belgian constitution and local official status that holds each name at equal basis without forcing anyone to use a particular name. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_7.html" title="Jan 7">7 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 03:12&#160;(UTC) <span style="color:#606060;">[moved here at 05:22 from <a href="#If_one_name.2C_which_one" title="">other section</a>]</span></span>

<dd>These argument have been mentioned before. But the NPOV part is very flaky. What about the Brusselers who speak the local dialect of Brussels? Should we take that into account too since looking at ratios is POV? Anyway, alternating is a reasonable option but not less POV. If we choose this option we'll have to be make sure contributors understand the issue and our solution. --<a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 17:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyone's arguments have been mentioned before. The only local dialect of Brussels is a dialect of Dutch (as comprehensively mentioned before), but is irrelevant [included in local inhabitants, not rarely as French-speaking because that is the only standard language some speakers know and can write, and some might well say <i>Saint-Josse</i> in the dialect as it has many French loanwords]. —<small>inserted 18:26</small> A few minutes ago, the <a href="../../../v/r/t/VRT_2fc0.html" title="VRT">VRT</a>-news showed a today's mass at Jette being celebrated in the dialect, which is very close to my own (see my user page).—</dd>

<dd>Any reader who would ever want to "improve" an article title is aware of the bilingual status of each municipality and is likely to check other articles. To be really sure, each talk page could have a box at top with all municipalities' article titles mentioned as a choice by consensus. As explained elsewhere as well, a 'follow <i>established English usage'</i> support is a false <i>choice</i> as it was never contested, but 'follow <i>English usage that is not established',</i> as for these municipalities, finally ends up here (or at the bilingual titles), or brutally violates Wikipedia guidelines. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_7.html" title="Jan 7">7 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 18:00&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>All I’m saying is whatever article names we choose, be it official bilingual or largest English usage, it will always be POV, by your reasoning. You’re forgetting that official names in French and Dutch are not NPOV but are just official names. Choosing to display only those in the title is as POV as one, because the official point of view is exactly that, a point of view. For example <i>Schoerebeik</i> is what Schaerbeek is called in local dialect. Schaerbeek is the spelling in French and in Dutch (for those who disagree with the spelling reform), etc... Therefore we must take a stand, make a choice, yours is to go bilingual (only official languages) and that of others is to go with what seems to be established usage in English. Either way, you’re right, we should leave notices in each article talk page so newcomers know where the article naming comes from. --<a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 23:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please read again "Alternating is not POV because it equally reflects each of two PsOV without letting one prevail. Hence <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>" (and the paragraph above): That was <i><b>my</b></i> comment signed as 18:00 UTC that Markussep at 21:02 UTC had interrupted as if those paragraphs could be his (though with extra indent): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=99169798&amp;oldid=99168378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=99169798&amp;oldid=99168378" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So I assume your comment about my reasoning was a mistake caused by his highly intolerable behaviour not showing you what I had clearly demonstrated.</dd>
<dd>Users of a particular language may disagree with a spelling reform, not users of a completely separate language. The Dutch spelling of <i>schaar</i> instead of <i>schaer</i> (meaning scissors) was absorbed a very long time ago. <i>Sjchoer(e)beik</i> [and not 'Sch'] belongs in a Brussels Wikipedia if you want to create one (after creating spelling rules for Brussels)&#160;;-)</dd>
<dd>I'm afraid you make your own mistake when you state "that of others is to go with what seems to be established usage in English": as I'm trying to tell for months, that is <i>my</i> position as well. But some of my opponents do not appear to me as understanding the full meaning of <i>established</i>: that has not yet happened to the usage in English for these municipalities. At best we did some original research trying to find out whether a particular name has as yet been established, but for each municipality we found that both the names occur in a ratio that makes those equally correct and commonly accepted, just like other things may have two correct names in English usage without one clearly being <i>the</i> commonly accepted one, enough as to let Wikipedia present it in a favorable position compared to the other. Especially for in English <i>rarely</i> used names, nothing else was to be expected. I have no complaints about the title of the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donation.html" title="Donation">Donation</a> article, which is clearly from French-language <i><a href="../../../../fr/d/o/n/Donation.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Donation">donation</a></i> as thousands of terms in English: those are <i>established</i> at least as well as "Brussels" and "City of Brussels" are. Only if <i>English usage</i> still needs to be determined by a consecutive series (how? what sources or Internet domains? what ratio's and by what probability? do other arguments as showing preference for one language or another play?...) of personal points of view that a number of others disagree with, such is WP:POV. If we would have found a 10:1 ratio looking through large numbers of closely scrutinized, and by all considered as representative, English texts using one particular name, it could hardly have been argued not to have been 'established' usage and that would have been our title. It simply was not the case at all. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_7.html" title="Jan 7">7 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:15-00:42&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Neither unfamiliar, nor mistaken: 'prevailing usage' = 'most occurring, dominant usage'; 'preffered' = 'more desirable usage'. Often this goes together and one could use one for the other (though even then it is sometimes inaccurately or uncarefully used), but in this case the different meanings are <i>not at all interchangable</i>.

<dd>And if American English <i>does</i> prevail, it <i>will be</i> "preferred", correct English, having the same status in the world that Oxbridge does in Great Britain; the reason for the present policy is that it hasn't.

<dd>Funny, I just Google-tested for Molenbeek (see <a href="#Revised_Google_test" title="">#Revised Google test</a>), and saw many more hits for Molenbeek (clearly referring to the municipality) than for the Dutch and French names. In general I'd prefer not to use a colloquial abbreviation as an article title (like "Den Bosch" for "'s-Hertogenbosch"), but Molenbeek might be a good exception, since French and Dutch are a draw. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 16:20, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I haven't followed your (plural) quite complicated search methods, I did not make a "subjective assumption" as you were so quick to assume. Looking for Molenbeek -Jean -Jans -.com (English language) gives more than 32,000 pages<a href="http://www.google.be/search?as_q=molenbeek&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=jean+jans+.com&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?as_q=molenbeek&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=jean+jans+.com&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, across a wide range of topics. This shows that the local people as well almost always use Molenbeek (name of the soccer team, name of the tennis club, and as I earlier indicated, main usage on the community website). Excluding .be as well (since we don't want the local usage, but the international one), I still get 22,000 pages<a href="http://www.google.be/search?as_q=molenbeek&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=jean+jans+.com+.be&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?as_q=molenbeek&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=jean+jans+.com+.be&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

Now, I don't care how <i>you</i> decide which webistes are acceptable and which aren't, but these "subjective assumptions" Google returns show me that in common usage, in English, outside Belgium / Belgian pages, Molenbeek is by far the most common name: add to that that there is no policy or guideline that indicates that we should use the official name instead of the most common one, and I don't see what you are complaining about. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:27, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>Fram</b></i>, one does not exclude the .com domain by putting ".com" on the line of terms to exclude, but by putting it in its own field of Google advanced search: your method excludes pages that have a <i>link</i> to the .com domain but not pages <i>on</i> the .com domain. That is why we cannot exclude 2 domains simultaneously (as you tried for .com and .be), nor limit a test to a set of domains (very unfortunately). I do not see <i>why</i> you tried to exclude the .be domain either, we are <i>not</i> testing 'English usage everywhere except in Belgium'; the only choices that make sense are accepting 'English usage anywhere' (including more contributions by non-native speakers of the language regardless their capacities and foreign influences) or picking only domains from countries mainly speaking English (so as to hopefully considerably eliminate the bias that comes from habits in other languages when using the name in English). Also the gross figure of 'nnn hits' is hardly usable: if you run through consecutive result pages (better put your number of hits shown per page higher first), you find that you do not get to see that many pages at all, and even less sites. We do not know anything about how these gross figures are generated by Google; inspection of data is absolutely impossible. Run through the results and you will find no more than about 503 pages, even less sites, instead of the (commercially) impressive 32,400 whatever (probably multiple hits per page, and more importantly including those on backup or mirror sites and especially on archived <i>consecutive versions</i> of the really shown pages — think of the '<a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayback_Machine_934e.html" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</a>').</dd>
<dd><i><b>Markussep and especially Fram</b></i>, for 'Molenbeek' one must scrutinize pages: not just FC Molenbeek or <a href="../../../r/w/d/RWDM_e4ab.html" title="RWDM">RWDM</a> but names of clubs and teams in general, always have simply "Molenbeek" even in their full official names - it would be hard to imagine junior league results like "F.C. Molenbeek-Saint-Jean - Saint-Josse-ten-Noode FC&#160;: 2 - 2". We are not discussing what title to use for the football team article. As there are far fewer pages mentioning the municipality than other 'Molenbeek' pages, it makes no sense to simply count a number of hits regardless what selection one can automate. I had taken care about that by requesting 'municipality' or 'municipalities' to be in a text and then had to do far less scrutinizing, but it would be even better not to eliminate these terms but only (-Jean -Jans - wiki -wikipedia -wikimedia -wikimiki) and to check the shown pages 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, etc (if there are too many) and exclude each of those that can neither be established as indeed referring to the municipality [e.g. a text mentioning "discharge rates at Mere station in the Molenbeek catchment" might appear to be about the municipality but context makes clear it is at the Molenbeek brook (153 hits with this rare term 'catchment' alone)] nor to be part of an obviously fixed name [club, team, organization, street,...], since a similar test with Jean or Jans does that elimitation [almost] automatically (though here too will be a few off-hits and scrutinizing is still required), and also because such fixed names are not <i>English usage</i> at all. It is not a comparison between 1) Molenbeek, 2) Molenbeek-S[ain]t-Jean, 3) S[in]t-Jans-Molenbeek, but between 1) and 2)+3) that determines whether Molenbeek is generally seen to be <i>sufficient</i> for the municipality, or not.</dd>
<dd>Note that it is not evident to accept 'Molenbeek' in an address (it must be the municipality and not the football team, hence the shortname suffices) or even where context shows it has to be that particular municipality in the Brussels-Capital region: one far more often uses shortnames within a clearly localized context, than when such context is not present. We are discussing the municipality on the region's talk page but the article <i>title</i> is not in context: it is stated within the article but the title can be searched for for an entirely different reason (football) or linked from anywhere. In fact, in football it is more notable than the municipality (definitely in English language, see hereunder), and thus the shortname <b>'Molenbeek' will sooner or later have to become a disambiguation page</b> instead of a redirect or an article title.</dd>
<dd><i><b>Note</b></i> that my 52 shortname/58 full name ratio was determined even <i>without</i> scrutinizing results (as already clear enough: scrutinizing would further eliminate shortnames). As our ratios deviate strongly, one must critisize the methods being used to obtain my and Fram's figures; as the methods are documented —<i>Marcussep's googling had another purpose and is for the shortname not at all documented nor does it show a figure</i>— we can verify correctness of each other's figures as well as find flaws in methodology - it is not <i>my word against yours</i>. Here above, I pointed out where your method fails to reflect the name of the topic of the article: the club referred to as 'Football Club Molenbeek' aka 'F.C. Molenbeek' or 'FC Molenbeek' aka 'Molenbeek' or the official street name 'Steenweg op Molenbeek' (even if <i>that</i> name would be translated to 'Molenbeek Road') or the brook after which the municipality was named, are other topics that might have their own articles if sufficiently notable. A search on the abbreviated names of the football clubs alone with Fram's method delivers 140 sites (or 179 shown pages or 896 whatever) for "FC Molenbeek" <small>(incl. <a href="../../../f/2E/c/F.C._Molenbeek_Brussels_Strombeek_8619.html" title="F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek">F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek</a> that now includes <a href="../../../r/w/d/RWDM_e4ab.html" title="RWDM">RWDM</a>, with stadion at Molenbeek)</small> + 50 sites (or 75 shown pages or 302 whatever) for <small>former or new</small> "<a href="../../../r/w/d/RWD_Molenbeek_15fa.html" title="RWD Molenbeek">RWD Molenbeek</a>", or <b><span style="color:#ff0000">254</span></b> shown distinct sports club pages without any doubt having been counted in Fram's 'test', while those names are more often shortened to 'Molenbeek' [it would be unreasonable to assume this not to occur in football and thus that figure may need to be about doubled, or about <b>508</b> thereto accountable pages in Fram's test], prove that his 'test' (447 sites or actually only <b><span style="color:#ff0000">503</span></b> shown pages or 32,400 whatever) was <b>mainly</b> about that <b>one</b> topic, (not to mention several other topics), instead of about a municipality. Thus so far, "Molenbeek" is <i>not</i> the common name for the municipality in English usage, let alone it being the more Encyclopaedical one. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_14.html" title="Jan 14">14 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 22:04 and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_15.html" title="Jan 15">15 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 07:41&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>Let me just say that "Run through the results and you will find no more than about 503 pages" shows that you don't really know how Google searches work either... Google only shows the distinct results <i>from the first 1,000 returned pages</i>, not for all 32,000 (or 1 million or whatever) pages. Search for "Wikipedia" or "Microsoft" and go through the results: they will also stop after a few 100<a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=microsoft&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=330&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=microsoft&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=330&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>Stop misleading readers. Everyone <i>can</i> read your search to exclude full names and to exclude most terms depicting other meanings for Molenbeek, but generally skip that technical part and continue to read your misleading conclusion as 90 out of 100 being about the municipality and simply saying Molenbeek. You say you checked 90 out of the <i>first 100</i> and suggest there a few hundred up to 1000 pages, but fail to say that <i>there are only 120</i> pages and thus <b>never more than 110</b> for 'Molenbeek' short for the municipality. You only proved (assuming you checked correctly) that there exist 90 pages that mention the municipality as 'Molenbeek', nothing about how many full names (<b>over 300</b> by your own earlier search), nothing about how many pages with 'Molenbeek' about football. My figures on your earlier search method <b>prove</b> that short 'Molenbeek' is more often used for a football club/team than for a municipality. That means that the title 'Molenbeek' cannot serve for the municipality regardless of your, my, or other voters' desires: the title goes to the clearly most common topic or to a disambiguation page (here it should be the latter, as it should link to several articles some of which already exist, and as both the football club and the municipality are quite common). You cannot disprove my earlier ratio of maximum 52 shortname versus 58 full name mentionings of the municipality, so accept facts. About Google: You merely confirm what I stated, we do <i>not</i> know how Google gets its gross number of hits.

<dd>My mistake; indeed <b>263</b> shortnames, which does not change the true conclusion that it is less than for the full names. 'Misleading' referred mainly to your conclusion reading as if 90 out of 100 would use the shortname, and such with an edit comment "Final reply to SomeHuman" ..."everyone" ... "can judge for themselves". Not exactly very WP:CIVIL compared with my tone earlier this morning. You did not even acknowledge the correct criticism on your search method but contrarily started picking on me by "that you don't really know how Google searches work either..." about the aspect that I had stated not <i>to be known</i>, but you abused these Google secrets to blow mist around no more than about 503 pages being verifiable. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_15.html" title="Jan 15">15 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 12:50&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>It was intended to be my final reply to you in this discussion, since it as fairly obvious that we couldn't reach an agreement, and that all arguments where given. I don't see how stating that it was intended to be my final reply is uncivil, not how stating that "everyone can judge for themselves" is uncivil. If all arguments are given, nothing needs to be said anymore, and everyone can judge for themselves. I don't see the problem. Furthermore, I did acknowledge your criticism, since I said (as you just quoted) that "you don't really know [...] <i>either</i>". The "either" would be meaningless unless I meant that I was wrong, but you were wrong as well. If I had stopped there, it would have been unfair picking on you: since I did indicate what aspect you didn't know, it was just a correction to your statement, just like you corrected mine. However, saying that someone is "misleading readers" is uncivil, and I clearly stated that 90 of the first 100 gave that result, not necessarily 90 out of 100 overall. I don't see where that is misleading. And replying to a complaint of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> by saying that someone is "abusing" Google secrets and "blowing mist" is perhaps not the best thing to do as well. It was exactly to avoid that the discussion would drag into such rather useless discussions that I had intended my second-to-last post to be my last in this discussion with you, but since you then gave clearly inaccurate results in your reply, I felt it necessary to rectify that. I'll not make that mistake again, so since all major arguments wrt this minor point have in my view been made, this is my last reply to you in this discussion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:21, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>SomeHuman, in response to your comment "Marcussep's [sic] googling had another purpose and is for the shortname not at all documented nor does it show a figure": my Google test <i>is</i> documented at <a href="#Revised_Google_test" title="">#Revised Google test</a>, see the underlined numbers in the table. Of course I rejected everything only referring to RWDM or a stream called Molenbeek etc. etc. There's loads of references to "the mayor of Molenbeek" and "the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek". For the domains .uk, .edu, .gov and .org combined I saw 12 valid hits for the French name, 12 for the Dutch name, and 53 for the short name. I call that decisive. But I don't automatically imply that the article should carry that name, that's to be discussed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 13:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Criteria for English usage</span></h3>
<p>Points for discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>what tools do we use to determine common English usage (Google, encyclopedias, polls)</li>
<li>how do we prevent bias in our data</li>
<li>what is a clear lead in English usage (51/49, 60/40, 70/30, etc.)</li>
<li>what if it is undecided, or difficult to determine (e.g. Forest/Vorst)?</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the discussions and investigations under <a href="#English_usage_statistics" title="">#English usage statistics</a>.</p>
<p>My suggestion for Google testing: search for both names simultaneously, English language, restricted domains (.uk, .edu, .gov, .org), no wikipedia, for instance <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?as_q=&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=sint-agatha-berchem+st-agatha-berchem+berchem-sainte-agathe+berchem-ste-agathe&amp;as_eq=wikipedia&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=.uk&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.nl/search?as_q=&amp;hl=nl&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=sint-agatha-berchem+st-agatha-berchem+berchem-sainte-agathe+berchem-ste-agathe&amp;as_eq=wikipedia&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=.uk&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Reject the hits that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were obviously not written in English</li>
<li>had the name only in an address</li>
<li>were very similar to another hit, e.g. from the same site, or mirrors</li>
<li>had the name only in combinations, e.g. Hallen van Schaarbeek, Cercle Philatélique de Berchem-Sainte-Agathe</li>
<li>had the name only as a motorway exit (part of the ring around Brussels is in Flanders, and has only Dutch road signs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Categorise the others in Dutch, French, and mixed. If the French name is used once, and the Dutch name several times, I call it Dutch, and vice versa.</p>
<p>My preference for the undecided cases would be going with the local majority, see <a href="#Facts" title="">#Facts</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 23:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I also vote to go with Google, which is probably more representative of current usage than any other source. I agree with the sampling method proposed above by Markussep (restrictive but fair). I vote to adopt the <a href="#Footnote" title="">p-value</a> as a “decisiveness” criterion rather than a set ratio (the p-value requires a larger ratio for scarce data but smaller ratios for abundant data).

Finally, in case the p-value comes out to be larger than 0.05 (<i>i.e.</i> indecisive), I would agree to go with the local majority, hoping that this would be easier to determine.

<dd>It only means that we can be 95% sure that name A is used <i>more</i> often than name B (which just confirms the undisputed expectation of French being more often used than Dutch) but this decisiveness by p-value does not mean that the ratio of usage of A is 20×, 10×, 2× or just 1.01× more often than B. I hold that if we can trust [with 95% probability] one name being used 10× more often than the other, such is an "established English name" (as City of Brussels) and if this name happens to coincide with the French name, so be it. But if we can trust [with 95% probability] that one name is used only 2× as often than the other, it is established that both names are being used in English though there is no "established usage in English" that allows making an NPOV <i>definite choice between the two names used in English</i>. I suggest that being 90% sure of a ratio of 5× more often usage is valid, but the p-value being used here says: <i>95% sure</i> (so even better) of <i>at least 1.000001×</i> more often (worthless as breaching NPOV by choosing for this particular POV). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_7.html" title="Jan 7">7 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 12:33-13:58&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<li>Any criteria for 'English usage' we could imagine so far, proved to be disputable and too arbitrary, thus to be a POV, while Wikipedia guidelines do not allow to accept a particular POV by majority voting. Markussep's <i>"preference for the undecided cases would be going with the local majority"</i> is the position the 40% French-speaking part of Belgium is currently using to try connecting Brussels to Wallonia, which is most strongly opposed by the 59% speakers of Dutch; it is the old "Keep it simple at just one language" and then "Let's take French" whereas <i>why</i> French <i>happens</i> to be the choice-of-the moment has varied over two hundred years, resulting <i>now</i> in a majority of French-speakers in the once only Dutch-speaking Brussels area and then that being used as the <i>reason</i> for the fixed outcome. Unfortunately, all checking of encyclopaedias and several methods of intensive Google counts make clear that <i>English usage</i> never indicates a municipality name of French or Dutch, but that for each municipality <i>both are being used in English</i>, most often in a 2:1 ratio which means that for every two English-speaking people using the French name, there is another equally gifted speaker of English who uses the Dutch name. That is the ratio for American English versus all other strains of English. We do not decide for a village in the US to write Scottish English even if that would be the <i>local</i> majority language. Using the 'most used' here where it is unacceptable to Wikipedia standards regarding the British, Australians etc, is a breach of the NPOV demanded above any other consideration by the Wikipedia guidelines. Therefore, <i>English usage</i> forces either bilingual titles, or for some municipalities the Dutch name and for others the French name as title. (In the latter case I strongly suggest alternating names for reasons explained in my such vote above.) — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_7.html" title="Jan 7">7 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 06:09&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<dd>I think it's not exactly neutral to go <i>against</i> common English usage (even if it is only 60/40) and local population (French/Dutch about 50/10 according to the VUB enquiry Diemietrie quoted), only because of political/historical considerations and the fact that Belgium as a whole has a 60% Dutch-speaking majority. But, that's my opinion. Let's find the English usage first. Any comments on my rejection criteria, other types of sites to reject, other domains to search (.ie, .au, .nz, .ca), weighting of the results? - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">User:Markussep</a> 12:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>The VUB figures do not give a precise ratio, it is between 50:30 and 70:10 but as far more native Dutch speakers had to learn French than the other way around (and very few natively French speakers become good enough at Dutch to say they are bilingual), and speakers of Dutch tend to speak still other languages more often than native speakers of French, both groups of 10% will be mainly Dutch speakers, say (50+1+3):(10+9+7) or 54:26, a ratio close to the 1.8:1 or 2:1 of French/Dutch names of municipalities by speakers of English. More important: the VUB has figures for 'Brussels', while the City itself and 6 other municipalities are not at stake, and thus cannot say <i>anything</i> about <i>these 12</i>.</dd>
<dd>Even if other sources would confirm a 55:25 ratio for our 12 municipalities, we know that at least 2 of the largest municipalities (Schaerbeek/Schaarbeek and Ixelles/Elsene) and a few others have a <i>very</i> high percentage of French speakers, thus there <b>must</b> be some municipalities where the balance is equal or even a Dutch-speaking majority is present.</dd>
<dd>It is then absolutely POV to say <i>we take an average of the whole region (or of the 12 municipalities), and apply <b>this larger so-called local</b> balance to each municipality, thus all French</i>; while refusing to say <i>we take an average of the whole country for which these municipalities have the capital functionality, and apply <b>that larger so-called local</b> 0.5:1 French/Dutch balance to each municipality, thus all Dutch</i>. Because we simply can't find reliable figures about several municipalities, and because we would write in American English about a municipality in the US (not even having a function as a capital for the US) where the majority would be speaking great Scottish English: <i>local</i> language is not a few blocks, but refers to the people for whom the place is not foreign. Therefore both languages are to be shown equally balanced if one accepts that <i>established usage in English</i> is not French alone and for some of the municipalities we cannot present objective, reliable, precise figures that prove French to be prevailing. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_10.html" title="Jan 10">10 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 18:39&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>I'm not sure whether the VUB study was for Brussels city or Brussels region, Diemietrie should know that. Your statement that if Schaerbeek, Ixelles and some other municipalities have a large French-speaking majority, other municipalities <b>must</b> have a Dutch-speaking majority is not very scientific, to say the least. Frankly, I'd be surprised if any of the municipalities had a Dutch-speaking majority. Better information lacking, we might use election results for an impression of the Dutch/French ratios. There are some problems there, because local elections often have bilingual list combinations (e.g. PS-SP.a), and in federal elections only Belgian nationals are allowed to vote. Not to mention the facts that the performance of individual politicians influences the results (especially locally I guess), and that AFAIK nothing stops a Dutch-speaking voter in the Brussels region to vote for a French-speaking party and vice versa. But it's the best we have so far. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 07:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The turnout for the federal elections of 2003 was 92%, and the turnout for the municipal elections was around 85%. I didn't find results of the federal election by municipality, only by canton, e.g.: Anderlecht (And.+StAg-Berchem), Ixelles (Ix.+Auderghem+Watermael-Boitsfort), St-Josse-tN (St-Josse+Etterbeek+Woluwe-StL+Woluwe-StP), Schaerbeek (Sch.+Evere), Molenbeek (Molenbeek+Ganshoren+Jette+Koekelberg), and Uccle (Uccle+Forest). Maybe the municipal elections are more useful then.

<dd>Markussep just once more puts words into my mouth: I stated there <b>must</b> be some municipalities where the balance <b>is equal</b> or even a Dutch-speaking majority is present; that is not unscientifical but simple arithmetic: with about 620,700 people in total, 55% French, 25% Dutch, 20% speaking neither, would mean 341,384 French-speaking and 155,175 Dutch-speaking. If only 5% of (77,511 + 111,946) or 9,472 Dutch speakers would live in 2 municipalities, it leaves 145,703 in all 10 others. For (77,511 à 90% French-speaking and 111,946 à 80% French-speaking [often as 2nd language]) we have 159,307 French-speakers in the 2 municipalities, leaving 182,078 in the 10 others: 182 thousand and 155 thousand are too close for a statistical probability to keep a majority in each of these 10 municipalities; especially as we know a few other municipalities to have a large majority of French speakers. Thus there <b>must</b> be municipalities where French-speakers do not outnumber Dutch-speakers. Theoretically, if one medium-sized municipality of about 45,000 inhabitants would have 90% French-speakers and 5% Dutch-speakers, the remaining nine would have 141,578 speakers of French outnumbered by the 143,453 Dutch; should we perhaps give 9 municipalities their Dutch name? Not that I think these figures to be sufficiently precise, but it demonstrates that local language at municipality level cannot give our final answers.</dd>
<dd>Elections do not demonstrate anything at all for us, people do not even always vote on a list of their proper language. And English usage even with a mere 50.01% majority was statistically decisive for only some municipalities. Hence since the beginning I urged for bilingual names, or as 'one' name has been decided, to alternate the names; for several or most municipalities however, we cannot ascertain which language is proper for the name, but deciding for some would not leave any objective guidance for the remainder. Therefore I suggested a choice based on what is practical for speakers of English (their word-order and all saints at front of the name) while fair towards the local inhabitants. Of course it would work (though I maintain that bilingual names would have been even better). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_11.html" title="Jan 11">11 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 16:59&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd><b>Alternating</b>: The imbalance between French and Dutch names in English is comparable with the imbalance between <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> and all other strains of English (2:1) that may seem to allow the article "truck" with a redirect from "<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorry.html" title="Lorry">lorry</a>", but is contrarily giving precedence to the minority usage of "draught" (British) with a redirect from "<a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkers.html" title="Checkers">checkers</a>" (American). Consequently, the people supporting <i>'one name'</i> here should be aware that only some municipalities can have the French name while others must have the Dutch name. (I think that is more confusing and hardly less 'simple' because in the future, contributors will start changing Dutch to French or French to Dutch names and thus this discussion will have to be repeated over and over again - thus only <i>two</i> names make life on Wikipedia more simple.) Contrarily, systematically choosing <i>'one language'</i> here must be matched with systematically making article titles in American English as te latter's <i>usage in English</i> is at least as clearly prevailing as that of the French names for the municipalities. As the latter is clearly forbidden by Wikipedia guidelines, (for the same reasons) the only consequent options we have are 'one name, alternating Dutch and French' of 'two names'. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_6.html" title="Jan 6">6 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 19:36&#160;(UTC)</span>

<li><b>English usage</b> Since this is an English encyclopedia, I agree with <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">User:Caranorn</a> that the best guideline is to conform to the name that Anglophones would normally use to call these municipalities, even if it takes some work to find out what it is. Other criteria, such as the existence of an English translation, usage by non-Anglophones, and especially historical considerations, which are the basis of many of the arguments advanced to date, do not work as well. Consider for instance <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> instead of Peking (English translation), <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> instead of Roma (local usage), and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongeren.html" title="Tongeren">Tongeren</a> instead of <i>Atuatuca Tungrorum</i> (historical name).<br />
The only method proposed in this discussion so far to gauge Anglophone usage is the one proposed by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">User:Markussep</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESeptentrionalis_0c85.html" title="User:Septentrionalis">User:Septentrionalis</a>. Granted, this is an imprecise method, and we may find better alternatives later (asking a representative number of Anglophones, for instance…). Unless proven grossly <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biased_sample.html" title="Biased sample">biased</a>, however, the ratio of 11:1 that was determined for <a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles.html" title="Ixelles">Ixelles</a> is decisive. For the statistically inclined, the <a href="../../../p/_/v/P_value.html" title="P value">p value</a> of such a proportion is 0.000, which is decisive at a level higher than 99.9%. An alternative Google search method, proposed in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBruges_f338.html#Bruges.2F_Brugge" title="Talk:Bruges">Talk:Bruges#Bruges/ Brugge</a>, yielded a proportion of 3.5:1 for Ixelles versus Elsene, which is just as decisive given the higher number of hits involved. This being said, I also agree that we should make sure that the bilingual character of Ixelles, the local usage of the two names, and historical considerations are all properly explained in the article introduction.<br />
Such decisions would need to be made individually for each one of the 12 municipalities that have different names in Dutch and French. In case of a tie, I would go for the <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biel_Bienne_1dcb.html" title="Biel/Bienne">Biel/Bienne</a> solution. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 16:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

See <a href="#Google_tests_by_SomeHuman" title="">#Google tests by SomeHuman</a> underneath yesterday's table. I had intended this search to deliver higher counts for the municipalities with so far too low figures for statistical analysis (elsewhere on this page, one already talks about the p-factor for Auderghem with 7 French hits versus a <i>single</i> Dutch hit and calls such 'decisive'), but contrarily to my expectations, in fact the municipalities that had seemed to have sufficient counts now show a ratio strongly deviating from yesterday's. It does show how careful we need to be as to gathering data by Google hits; many factors seem to be at work that would require nearly each page to be examined, which is impossible for significantly high numbers.

And perhaps we can use "Molenbeek" instead of the longer French or Dutch name, since everyone seems to call it Molenbeek anyway (even the official site of the municipality is at <a href="http://www.molenbeek.be/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.molenbeek.be/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, and the first text after the intropage says either "La vie à Molenbeek" or "Het leven in Molenbeek"). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Given the (in some cases perhaps not decisive) preference for French names in Google tests, and the majority (or <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plurality.html" title="Plurality">plurality</a>) of French speakers in the Brussels region, I lean towards picking the French names.

<dd>Fram, Encyclopaedic articles, when no English name is clearly established, should have as title the official name(s) of a municipality, not a colloquial one. I had thought about this too, but it would cause even more confusion because that colloquial style cannot be used for any of the other municipalities: Only Saint-Josse/Sint-Joost is quite common as well but still keeps a different version in each language. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_3.html" title="Jan 3">3 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 21:13&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>
<dd>Markussep, the guidelines do suggest to be guided by local situations, rather than choosing for "simplicity". Wikipedia guidelines however, cannot foresee everything. The total of all <i>these</i> municipalities' population is only a fraction of the people envolved because of their function (e.g. employment at and visits to one of the public offices and numerous head-offices of international and national private businesses and organisations incl. the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, embassies, etc) inherent for the capital of the country wherein the language balance is 3:2 the other way around and obviously matters to 10 times more citizens than the whole region and nearly 17 times the total population of the municipalities having two names (as the City of Brussels has a clearly established English name and other municipalities have only one name). Would most of these municipalities have been notable for the English Wikipedia or even have been mentioned in English texts if it were not for their capital function? — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_4.html" title="Jan 4">4 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 01:42&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>The Wikipedia criteria mentioned above are indeed clear, and in favour of English usage. The definition of “prevalent usage” can be made rigorous, as I have tried to explain elsewhere on this page (see <a href="#Footnote" title="">#Footnote</a>, for instance). I therefore have to disagree with the assessments that English preference is “mostly not decisive” or that “no English name is clearly established.” If despite all this, however, “ambiguity still persists” (as it seems), a vote is the prescribed solution of last resort. So we are on the right track… <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 02:24, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LVan, you're right about the English preference, I changed it in my post here. I'm a bit puzzled about the statistic criteria though. Suppose we find 110 million hits for the French name, and 90 million for the Dutch name, then your p-test will certainly prove that the ratio is not 50/50. But 55/45 is not a decisive preference, is it? Fortunately the difference is (a lot) bigger for most. Could you do your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=98323891&amp;oldid=98321045" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=98323891&amp;oldid=98321045" rel="nofollow">Elsene/Ixelles test</a> for the other municipalities too? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 11:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Markussep, in the example you propose, I would indeed call a difference of 20 million hits decisive (that’s a lot of hits!), even though the ratio is only 55/45. This is especially true if we count the hits for let’s say Ixelles without removing Elsene, as was suggested by SomeHuman and as I also have done so far. This search method adds a lot of bilingual hits on both sides of the proportion, thereby making it closer to 50/50. The alternative method that you suggested (specifically removing the other language term from the search), which is probably just as valid, would yield a lower number of hits but a more significant ratio.</dd>

<dd>There are indeed different possible interpretations of the word “decisive” – the one I propose makes a “proven” preference decisive. Any other definition of “decisive” (70/30? 3:1? 10:1?) runs the danger of being arbitrary or subjective, unless there is some accepted practice out there that I am not aware of (note that the accepted practice for votes is just majority + one). Given the tediousness of going through the Google data manually to ensure legitimacy, I would propose to wait for the results of the vote to come in before going through the other municipalities. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 23:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry LVan, I'm afraid you're making two essential mistakes:</dd>
<dd>Markussep's method of excluding pages mentioning the names in both languages not only excludes e.g. "in Oudergem (French 'Auderghem')" which might occur more often than "in Auderghem (Dutch 'Oudergem')" and then gives a false balance of usage <i>as English</i>; since the main issue of the survey is establishing whether one or both names should be used, this method already rejects precisely that second option. By eliminating pages with both names, the difference between counts remains exactly the same but the total number of counts diminishes and thus the p-factor of the figures will appear decisive while that might not be so. I have shown figures that revealed a most considerable bias.</dd>
<dd>There is nothing more arbitrary or subjective about finding 10:1 or 3:1 enough to accept an <i>established usage</i> in English, than to find 1.05:1 already enough. In fact, at the contrary: smaller differences can more easily change, causing an opposite balance; something that may easily change is definitely not what is called <i>established</i>. — We may 'establish' 1.05:1 or 3:1 but that is not at all identical to 'establishing' that one particular name is <i>established</i>.</dd>
<dd>The current survey result is not intended to say once and for all which names are from now on world-wide to be used in English. Wikipedia is not the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise.html" title="Académie française">Académie française</a>: no such thing exists for the English language, which is a naturally evolving language. The English Wikipedia should respect that aspect of the language, but the influence of Wikipedia itself on which name is going to be used in the future is too considerable for otherwise in English rarely used names, to make a decision. (Wikipedia articles may be read by far more people than many of the counted internet pages.) Only if a <i>sufficiently</i> established usage is demonstrated, Wikipedia's influence can be negligible and the decision NPOV (not only NPOV towards the people in Belgium but also NPOV towards the users of the names in the English language: nearly half, or <i>just</i> one out of three, or merely one in ten, may have to accept 'established' usage and therefore need to change their English usage). It may be hard or impossible to calculate exactly by how much the counts must differ to be sure that a name really is 'sufficiently established', but the lack of tools to objectively measure and precisely calculate results mustnot cause assuming that no such thing exists, and thus disregard it, which is what we do if we accept 50/50 plus 1 or another low imbalance. I'm sure you must be aware of this logical trap, for other readers I'll simply demonstrate it: While for a long time one could not measure the voltage of lightning, did it electrocute fewer people? Only if they already stayed away from tall trees. Or rather, only <i>fewer</i> if they were overly cautious.</dd>

<dd>I'm also afraid, LVan, that you (perhaps unconsciously) tend to obtain and/or publish objective data when it fits your personal viewpoint: You want to await the outcome of the votes <i>before</i> getting data. That means that the votes will be made without those data. If the votes go your way, you will not have to do more. If on the other hand, the votes do not go your way, then and only then will you obtain the data - with intend to turn the votes around (else the results would no longer matter so why would you do the work then).</dd>
<dd>I find this all the more disturbing because I had suggested the data for Ixelles/Elsene to be rather questionable because of strong variations between previous counts and my own, casting reasonable doubt on both the earlier and on my method or counts for Ixelles/Elsene, and precisely that municipality had by several counts shown the largest imbalance in favor of French. Then publishing the new results (in this case without details) of a job I had stated to be very tedious, but not those for the, also based on the earlier measurements, assumedly more balanced municipalities that with less high counts are less tedious to verify, might suggest you expect the data better to stay away from our eyes... This makes me wonder about the figures you have published. So far we have only your word at face value: you did not state how you went through the samples and decided which ones were relevant for this survey, nor how you decided that your samples could be held representative for the whole. We thus cannot check against conscious or unconcious bias, nor against logical errors, nor against plain mistakes. May I remind you that I published the tables with Google counts per domain <i>including</i> the precise way I obtained these, thus allowing logical criticism on my methods as well as providing the possibility for others to repeat and thus verify the counts.

<dd>For once I have to agree with you&#160;;-), my "exclusive" method rejects pages that have both names, which is not right if you want to know if the combined name is used outside wikipedia. Probably the best thing to do is search with as little restrictions as possible (excluding all ".com"s is not right IMO), and check for all hits (or a representative sample, and after checking if they're actually written in English) in what category they belong:
<dl>
<dd>only Dutch name</dd>

<dd>Dutch, with the French name once</dd>
<dd>French, with the Dutch name once</dd>
<dd>predominantly in combination (hyphen, slash, and which one comes first)</dd>

<dd>I'm curious if it will make a difference, if I have the time I will check it for a representative municipality (Ixelles is too francophile for you, isn't it?).

<dd>There is no need for that: the names will never occur as combination (unless perhaps in a few articles that handle the names encycopaedically or for some other reason need to be strictly NPOV). We do not suggest using a double name in normal writing, let alone speech. That is why I support Diemietrie's "/" separator rather than my earlier " - ", the latter might be misunderstood by a reader to concatenate terms that are part of one long name, while "/" never serves that purpose but is at the contrary generally used to show the writer lets one <i>choose</i> between two words: "It is your opinion/conviction that..." means "It is your opinion or your conviction, it is your prerogative to choose the one you prefer, that..." and also 'his/her' is normally used to clearly show one does not wich to suggest any preference, it does not suggest bisexuality. That is why I promote this usage for an encyclopaedic article title. Nobody expects "his/her", let alone "opinion/conviction", to occur as often as the separate words, it will not be the case for the municpalities either – but using that style for our titles still makes a lot of sence if we wish to express neutrality towards both names an express leaving it up to the reader to choose his preference: Putting a single name in the title, even when thereunder naming the two, especially in an encyclopaedia, is going to be interpreted as the title name being preferred or so notably more common that such is the established name in English. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_5.html" title="Jan 5">5 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 16:48&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>Wow – lots of unfounded assumptions on intentions in your message earlier this morning! SomeHuman, believe it or not, my intent was actually the opposite of what you suggest: I would have gone through the tedious work on English usage for the other municipalities only if one-name-English-usage was clearly favoured by the voters. If the vote came out for any other method, why bother since English usage would then be irrelevant? The order of events that seems fair and NPOV to me is the following: first propose and discuss the relative merits of various methods/processes/criteria (possibly with the help of one or two representative examples, as Markussep is proposing to do above), then vote to select the one method that appeals to most based on intrinsic merits, then apply it at large, getting whatever result comes out. At this point, as far as I know, we are only at Step 1 and 2 (discussion and vote)! As for the method I proposed at the bottom of <a href="#Encyclopedias.2C_Google_Scholar_and_Google_tests_by_Markussep" title="">#Encyclopedias, Google Scholar and Google tests by Markussep</a>, it is aimed at finding out (not prescribing) English usage, and it is explicit enough for <i>anyone</i> to try out on <i>any</i> of the municipalities.

<dl>
<dd>English usage would not have been irrelevant, as you and some others seem to find a small difference sufficient to pick only that one name. Large differences in usage would not even by me be disputed; one will occasionally read 'Stad Brussel' or 'Ville de Bruxelles' in English texts but we all agree on 'City of Brussels' as established name in the English language. You might have used extra data upon a bilingual solution in order to show a larger and therefore more meaningful unbalance. But anyway, the data should be available <i>before</i> people make up their mind, either way. (That has been the problem with Markussep's sudden survey; if one could not agree for one particular clear-cut proposal, the survey should have been <b>prepared</b> by consensus of the four contributors, so as to synthesize arguments and present these only when ready (with some statistics if needed) under the link from Requested moves, so readers would not make up their mind based upon the single-sided arguments of a single user that had become outnumbered, long before a lot of the relevant data became available. Putting the vote section at top of the link's destination, invited people who are unwilling to consider all argument still to vote - and that would then be for 'simplicity'.) Once people have taken and shown a position, they almost never change their mind even if they might easily have become otherwise convinced if they had been well-informed to start with.</dd>
<dd>I apologize about the severity of my remark on an undocumented method, there are a few things unclear but it's better documented than I remembered while I was taken aback by your statement about delivering data depending on the direction the votes would go. On the other hand, we do not know how Google selects its first batches of hits; I do not think we can simply assume the first nnn to be representative for a specific purpose, but have the impression that such is what you did to obtain the 'representative' samples that were then scrutinized. Indeed I had asked the Ixelles/Elsene data (and stated such here above), but I had also expected an outcome rather unfavorable for my stand in this debate, then leaving out the other municipalities, for which the lesser data seem more easily inspected, had worried me.

<dd>Markussep, in your <b>09:06</b> (UTC) comment, you again and knowingly misguided readers: The 'double naming plan' is not at all mine as you <i>know</i> all too well (Diemietrie's earlier Requested move that was never closed, and it had partially existed before but had been changed without discussion; the reopened <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_NamingArchive2_ee0a.html#Names_of_the_19_communities_.28again.29" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region/NamingArchive2">discussion</a>). You <i>know</i> very well that <i>I'm sure ... would have failed</i> is far from true: it is why you unilaterally started your own (this) survey the moment the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_NamingArchive2_ee0a.html#Names_of_the_19_communities_.28again.29" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region/NamingArchive2">discussion</a> came 3:1 against you, and why you obliterated my correction towards that 3:1 supported proper proposal on the Requested moves page (as shown under <a href="#Relist.3F" title="">#Relist?</a>); and you <i>know</i> that the earlier <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_NamingArchive1_bd5b.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region/NamingArchive1">#Requested move</a> had a 6:5 support, after which - as you <i>know</i> - Diemietries' improvement by using "/" instead of " - " had brought earlier supporters of your solution towards that already having had 6:5 support before. This all, with the current survey's votes that switch the balance your side having been made before anything but your view was visible for people called here by your unilateral Requested move <i>survey</i>, is what makes the current survey a mockery, hence my "persistent criticism" as also the mockery persists: you close the 'one' versus 'two' on the date you had chosen, while obviously there are still discussions going on and while most votes were made before the data became available and without having a proper overview of the arguments that are dispersed at a multitude of places (confusion created by <i>your</i> multi-section survey with the misleadingly 'simple' vote visible at top).</dd>
<dd>Caranorn, I do not at all think that <i>those who voted</i> are stupid or unable to read, but I know that some were quite likely to show up who would not read the <i>preceding</i> discussion that had gone on for 5 months, nor be aware of the 6:5 earlier Requested move not being closed, <i>before</i> they would make up their mind: they <i>can</i> read but they could not see the need, as things were presented simply and allowed voting while showing only the <i>new</i> 'discussion' section created by Markussep. I do state that contributors were misled. Please, if perhaps even you might not have taken a look at <i>everything</i>, take a look into the sections (incl. the links in 'Relist?')

I state that the context matters much more than ratios of general usage, an encyclopaedia or an employment offer have other requirements than daily usage.

<dd>Indeed we can often work our way around 'his/her' by e.g. "Candidates can send their curriculum to...", but you too must have seen the usage of 'his/her', and it cannot always be avoided. It cannot generally be avoided for the municipalities' names. Of course it refers to different entities just as in 'and/or', there are better examples as I assume you too realize. "Yet very often it is used to represent the concept or, especially in instruction books.", from <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_%28typography%29.html" title="Slash (typography)">Slash (typography)</a>. <i>My point</i> is that every reader of the English-language Wikipedia will interpret the slash as separating two alternate names, <i>one of which one may use</i>; and not as concatenating the parts to one name.</dd>
<dd>Suppose, an American writes a letter in English to a Belgian he knows to be natively French-speaking, he might mention "Woluwe-Saint-Pierre"; but when he knows the addressee to be Dutch-speaking and <i>realizes that both variants are correct in English</i>, he might write "Sint-Pieters-Woluwe". We should not stand in the way of such.</dd>
<dd>The usage of 'Molenbeek' is colloquial in Dutch and in French, and there is no reason to assume - and a likely impossibility to prove here - it to be less, let alone not, colloquial in English. I would prefer a language-neutral and short name too (as for Evere, Koekelberg etc) but it does not allow simply <i>assuming</i> an established non-colloquial usage of 'Molenbeek' for an article title in an encyclopaedia. Also simply 'Woluwe' is used colloquially exactly as 'Molenbeek', but it refers to the suburb formed by a series of parishes of which two are now making distinction between <i>two</i> municipalities. I hope you're not suggesting to call the article 'Woluwe' with separate sections for each.&#160;;-) — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_5.html" title="Jan 5">5 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 22:33&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">If two names, how</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>With a '/' between the French and the Dutch name. French comes first, as there are more French- than Dutch-speaking people. See e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biel_Bienne_1dcb.html" title="Biel/Bienne">Biel/Bienne</a> (bilingual German-French city in Switzerland) or the solution for the Brussels region on the German Wikipedia (<a href="../../../../de/s/i/n/Sint-Agatha-Berchem_Berchem-Sainte-Agathe_2e25.html" class="extiw" title="de:Sint-Agatha-Berchem/Berchem-Sainte-Agathe">de:Sint-Agatha-Berchem/Berchem-Sainte-Agathe</a> etc.). <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 17:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As Diemietrie suggests, always a fixed order which may well be French-name/Dutch-name. (I'm Dutch-speaking, the order is not nearly as important as omitting one in the titles: it is first the majority language of the present locals of most of these municipalities and then the majority language of the visiting or there working countrymen/women - or would many women be very upset by this last order.) Thus as I explained in the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_NamingArchive2_ee0a.html#Names_of_the_19_communities_.28again.29" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region/NamingArchive2">relevant discussion</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_21.html" title="Dec 21">21 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 23:42, <a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_22.html" title="Dec 22">22 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 04:48 and <a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_23.html" title="Dec 23">23 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 00:59. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 03:13&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<dd>I found this: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_with_slashes_in_title_56e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles with slashes in title">Wikipedia:Articles with slashes in title</a>. Generally, the slash is inevitable in these titles because they're an integral part of their name, e.g. the film <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Victoria_71af.html" title="Victor/Victoria">Victor/Victoria</a>. There are two bilingual examples in the list: <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biel_Bienne_1dcb.html" title="Biel/Bienne">Biel/Bienne</a> and the Belgian railways <a href="../../../n/m/b/NMBS_SNCB_4f45.html" title="NMBS/SNCB">NMBS/SNCB</a>. If it has to be two names in the title, then I'd prefer the slash, but I'd rather avoid this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 20:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In what list? Not a complete one since there may be <i>many</i> more. Just from this very talk page I picked three more Brussels' bilingual articles: <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Roue_Het_Rad_f8a0.html" title="La Roue/Het Rad">La Roue/Het Rad</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts-Loi_Kunst-Wet_metro_station_fc70.html" title="Arts-Loi/Kunst-Wet metro station">Arts-Loi/Kunst-Wet metro station</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crainhem_Kraainem_metro_station_ebc7.html" title="Crainhem/Kraainem metro station">Crainhem/Kraainem metro station</a>. Moreover, I have the impression that it causes few problems (none), and I'm not too sure that the municipalities would be much more notable for readers of this Wikipedia once this discussion subdues; why should such bilingual names, once accepted and moved, then be more controversial or confusing or not simple enough or less English?</dd>
<dd>As I half suspect some people in the current discussion to oppose to bilingual names for a part because they might consider asking for such a Flemish POV, the latter article about the metro station in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert/Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe mentions "Avenue de Kraainem/Kraainemlaan" with the current Dutch spelling in the <i>French</i> name. I checked it on a <a href="http://geowebgis.irisnet.be/webgis/geoloc?lngApp=FR" class="external text" title="http://geowebgis.irisnet.be/webgis/geoloc?lngApp=FR" rel="nofollow">map</a> <small>(behind 'rue' fill in 'Avenue de Kraainem' and push the button to the left underneath)</small>, it's indeed also in French spelled like that. But according to the article, the speakers of French had insisted the station with a single name Kraainem that had been common in French as well, on request of French-speakers to have been renamed towards the out-of-use old spelling of Dutch, Crainhem, like the spelling of municipality names Auderghem, Schaerbeek... Perhaps it can take away any doubts regarding Flemish POVs. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_6.html" title="Jan 6">6 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 01:02&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<ul>
<li>From <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>: "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature."</li>
<li>From <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>: "A redirect should be created for articles that may reasonably be found under two or more names (such as different spellings or former names)."</li>
<li>All municipalities in question are officially bilingual: French and Dutch.</li>
<li>There are no specific naming conventions for places in Belgium.</li>
<li>There are no names commonly used in English that are different from the French or the Dutch name.</li>
<li>The character "/" is not allowed in article titles, see <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html#Do_not_use_an_article_name_that_suggests_a_hierarchy_of_articles" title="WP:NC">WP:NC#Do not use an article name that suggests a hierarchy of articles</a>. <small>Correction by SomeHuman:</small> <i>perfectly</i> allowed in titles when not suggesting an hierarchy, as is here OK, see the link. Next are not exceptions but just samples of proper usage.</li>
<li>There are exceptions to this rule, for instance <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aoraki_Mount_Cook_8090.html" title="Aoraki/Mount Cook">Aoraki/Mount Cook</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biel_Bienne_1dcb.html" title="Biel/Bienne">Biel/Bienne</a>, see also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_with_slashes_in_title_56e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles with slashes in title">Wikipedia:Articles with slashes in title</a>.</li>
<li>Both names are commonly (or both rarely) used in English.</li>
<li>On average, there is a small (1.8 to 1 according to <a href="#Google_tests_by_SomeHuman" title="">#Google tests by SomeHuman</a>) preference for the French names in common English usage. Encyclopedia Britannica and Columbia use only French names in titles, Encarta uses Dutch (4#) or French (8#) names.</li>
<li>The majority of the local population is French speaking. - a) natively; b) as second[ary] language before Dutch. According to <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talentelling#Brussel_.2819_gemeenten.29" class="external text" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talentelling#Brussel_.2819_gemeenten.29" rel="nofollow">Dutch wikipedia</a> 70.6% of the regional population was French-speaking in 1947 (last official figure). A recent survey in 2001 conducted by the Free University of Brussels (VUB) shows 50% of the population has French as a mother tongue, 10% Dutch, 10% is bilingual Dutch-French, 10% bilingual with French and another language or Dutch and another language and 20% has neither French not Dutch but only one or more other languages as a mother tongue (source: Rudi Janssens (2002), Taalgebruik in Brussel. Taalverhoudingen, taalverschuivingen en taalidentiteit in een meertalige stad. Brussels: VUBPRESS).</li>
<li>As there still is the 'Molenbeek' (mill's or mills' brook) that gave its name to Molenbeek Saint-Jean/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek and the latter requires a redirect from its colloquial name 'Molenbeek', the top of the municipality's article should mention "'<i>Molenbeek' redirects here. For the brook by that name, see Molenbeek (brook)</i>" or in absence of the article clearly mention the brook's existence. Correction: the shortname 'Molenbeek' is also used for the former and possibly the new <a href="../../../r/2E/w/R.W.D._Molenbeek_7331.html" title="R.W.D. Molenbeek">R.W.D. Molenbeek</a> and for <a href="../../../f/2E/c/F.C._Molenbeek_Brussels_Strombeek_8619.html" title="F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek">F.C. Molenbeek [Brussels Strombeek]</a> and thus 'Molenbeek' could better be a disambiguation page than a straightforward redirect.</li>

<li>Many of these municipalities - other than the City of Brussels - have a considerable instream of day-long or week-long commuters from outside the capital region, at least 50% Dutch-speaking; and are wellknown and regularly visited for various reasons (request visa at one of the many embassies, sites and museum visits, walking or driving in the Sonian Forest, ...) by Belgian citizens in numbers representative for the respective major languages [known to be 59% Dutch-speaking and 40% French-speaking].</li>

<li>In the article on Brussels and its suburbs on the Wikipedia in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans_language.html" title="Afrikaans language">Afrikaans</a> (see table <a href="#How_Wikipedias_in_other_languages_tackle_this" title="">#How Wikipedias in other languages tackle this</a>), I spotted&#160;: "In die laaste tyd begin Franstalige ouers egter hul kinders ook na Nederlandstalige skole stuur; die groot persentasie van minderbevoorregtes (veral kinders van immigrantegroepe) wat Franse skole toe gaan maak hulle nou minder aantreklik.", that is <i>Recently however, French-speaking parents start[ed] to send their children to Dutch-language schools as well; the large percentage of underprivilegeds (mostly children of immigrant groups) that go to French[-language] schools, makes these now less attractive.</i> If so, where do English-speaking inhabitants send their children to? I think some English education is provided, but are such schools for free, do English-speakers in an international city as Brussels perhaps wish their children to have contact with native people, and/or to learn a 'foreign' (here native) language <i>properly</i>; as thus children may well have been send to French-language schools, do they now send their children to schools that may currently be seen as of higher standards? Will the assumed imbalance remain in favor of French usage of the names of the suburbian municipalities (where the lower level schools are, and where most speakers of English reside)? Do the larger immigrant groups in a poorer municipality send their children to schools in richer muncipalities where English-speakers usually reside? — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_6.html" title="Jan 6">6 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 01:55&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<dd>If native speakers of English teld to send their children to a Dutch-language school whereas they formerly had send their children to a French-speaking school, not only the children but also the parents become far more clearly aware of their municipality's name in Dutch and probably that for other municipalitie as well. These municipalities' names are rarely used in English thus the influence may easily turn the balance between French and English names in English usage. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_6.html" title="Jan 6">6 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 19:19&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>My mistake indeed. I had heard of the 'Evenaarsprovincie' which was never called 'Evenaar' in Dutch language, hence my assumption that it referred to the only country that I knew to be Equateur in French, some diplomats do move around the world during a career. Fortunately, my erroneous assumption between parenthesis had little influence as that particular page was kept for the counts, as the rest of my remark shows. But I did scratch the false part from the table (still visible but no longer presenting it as valid).

<dd>Hi Diemietrie, Google results are more useful if you search exclusively, i.e. Auderghem without Oudergem and vice versa: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=-auderghem+oudergem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=-auderghem+oudergem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Oudergem</a> 14.8k, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=auderghem+-oudergem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=auderghem+-oudergem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Auderghem</a> 58k. I've changed it for all of them. Another thing you can do (using "Taalhulpmiddelen" or "Language Tools" in Google) is search for pages in specific countries. Same search for US: <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=auderghem+-oudergem&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.nl/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=auderghem+-oudergem&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Auderghem</a> 971, <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=-auderghem+oudergem&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.nl/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=-auderghem+oudergem&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Oudergem</a> 290. But if I look at the present figures, I see decisive usage of the French name for Auderghem, Ixelles, St-Gilles, Schaerbeek, Uccle and Watermael-Boitsfort, 4 draws, and decisive usage of the Dutch name for Sint-Agatha-Berchem. Actually the difference there is so large I wonder if the town has a different name in French. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 21:26, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have called the googling for St-Gilles, Schaerbeek, and Watermael-Boitsfort a lead, rather than decisive; but with the encyclopedias agreeing, insofar as they say anything, they are probably the better choices. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:08, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Without restriction to specific domains, Google searches are utterly irrelevant for the purpose of determining English usage, even when the language is set to select pages in English. Especially the .com gives the most dubious results but too many to inspect each source individually, which would absolutely be required. See under <a href="#Facts" title="">#Facts</a> the table for the domains that by their nature are most likely to deliver useful data in proper English. The problem however is a very meagre number of hits in the most suitable domains: too few to have reliable statistical data though it is obvious that the English language shows no clear prevalence, the balance goes mainly from 1:1 to 1:4 (Ixelles/Elsene even slightly higher and Auderghem/Oudergem disregarded as 1 more hit could bring it at 1:4) and averages just under 3:1 but for the most relevant domains (.ac.uk, .gov.uk, .gov and .edu), the overall balance is under 2:1. This means that in English, both the French and the Dutch names occur as equally correct and with a balance that is too feeble to pick a preferenced one. At least, the <i>usage in English</i> appears not sufficiently apparent to be a determining factor for either one name on Wikipedia. In fact, the influence of Wikipedia on the .org domain and indirectly further onwards, could well have a larger influence on which usage will come to prevail in English [and may already have had such influence], than what is found so far - such would not be acceptable, it is better to state both names entirely equally (as I suggested, the French may well be mentioned first, but none omitted). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_27.html" title="Dec 27">27 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 01:20&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Note about Markussep's table at top of this section: By explicitly excluding the name in the other language, the searches have a clear built-in bias: The Flemish being a relative minority in Brussels, and their respect for the bilingual status or not wishing to appear <i>flamingant</i>, causes them to often mention the other language as well; the speakers of French are usually less careful and simply mention the French name. Proof is found by searching e.g. ['Uccle Ukkel' (23.6K)]: by replacing 'Uccle' (211K) with 'Uccle -Ukkel' (188K) brings the French-language figure <b>12% down</b>, replacing 'Ukkel' (58.7K) with 'Ukkel -Uccle' (35.5K) brings the Dutch-language figure <b>40% down</b> - the arbitrary choice to exclude one language exaggerated the balance <b>from 3.6:1 to 5.3:1</b> in favor of French; e.g. by replacing '"saint-gilles"' (50.5K) with '"saint-gilles" -sint-gillis' (37.2K) brings the French-language figure <b>26% down</b>, replacing '"sint-gillis"' (27.7K) with '"sint-gillis" -saint-gilles' (13.3K) brings the Dutch-language figure <b>52% down</b> - Markussep's choice brought the balance <b>from 1.8:1 to 2.8:1</b> in favor of French.<br /></dd>
<dd>Also, a search without domain selection catches all French sources that have been translated by speakers of French and all Dutch sources that have been translated by speakers of Dutch; the search may thus largely measure the number of speakers of French versus the number of speakers of Dutch worldwide and has little to do with establishing usage in the English language: other terms do not become proper English because of the usage by non-native speakers either. This assumedly strong influence might be proven by doing similar searches on the .ac.uk, .gov.uk, .gov, .edu (mainly native English/American sites). (The more restrictive searches in the table under <a href="#Facts" title="">#Facts</a> showed rather few pages having both names of a municipality.) — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_27.html" title="Dec 27">27 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 02:19&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<p>Hi SomeHuman, some comments on your impressive work:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm sure you will get more (relevant) hits if you don't restrict yourself to pages that contain "municipality" or "municipalities". If you need something to weed out false hits, try "brussels" or "belgium".</li>
<li>about your built-in bias comment on my exclusive searches (e.g. uccle without ukkel): I think this is the only way to determine differences in usage. By using both you'll probably pick up many pages that mention the other name only once, and maybe some translation lists.</li>
<li>I agree that the differences (French vs. Dutch) are not overwhelming, but they're certainly significant for a number of municipalities (Auderghem, Ixelles, St-Gilles, Schaerbeek, Uccle and Watermael-Boitsfort). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Auderghem versus Oudergem: 7 to 1, p-value is 0.035, decisive</li>

<dd>All the other data from the same table (except Laeken) show p-values larger than 0.05 and would therefore require more data before we can say anything.

<p>Hi Markussep, I still see little decisive cases here. I agree that apart from Ixelles, Saint-Gilles and Sint-Agatha-Berchem may be considered decisive as well. But Schaerbeek and Watermael-Boitsfort only have a firm lead over the Dutch names (not even 2:1), while in the case of Auderghem/Oudergem and Uccle/Ukkel encyclopedias do not agree (Encarta uses the Dutch name here). So still 9 out of 12 municipalities aren't decisive in my point of view. For the two sub-municipalities of Brussels city, based on Google search only, I would call <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=laeken+brussels+-laken&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=laeken+brussels+-laken&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Laeken</a> 169k decisive over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=laken+brussels+-laeken&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=laken+brussels+-laeken&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Laken</a> 14.4k and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=haren+brussels+-haeren&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=haren+brussels+-haeren&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Haren</a> 38.6k decisive over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=haeren+brussels+-haren&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=haeren+brussels+-haren&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">Haeren</a> 0.6k. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 22:41, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reply to Markussep: 1) The term 'municipality' was mainly chosen because I was interested in finding pages written by someone who knows his subject (assuming the term <i>usually</i> relates to the searched municipality), leaving out incidental mentionings, of a name repeated from some source of for our goal dubious origin, or connected with specific people (e.g. the birthplace of a famous person could swing the balance considerably) etc. 'Brussels' or 'Belgium' could not serve this purpose. 2) I wanted to establish usage mainly by native speakers of English (or living in a major country with this native language, thus the domains choice - .org was added as I needed to get some higher counts for relatively serious sites, though that domain tells little about the country of origin). It does not matter that a same page may be listed under Dutch <i>and</i> under French, your mutual exclusion would be relevant if you wanted to establish the notability of municipalities but that has hardly been a topic on this talk page. In fact it was necessary to allow both names because also this option is being considered for Wikipedia and their counting for each would bring the ratio towards a level that supports such possibility, fair enough for pages that mention both names. For establishing main usage in English, the shown strong bias is certainly not desired. 3) The significance of ratios could not be determined for the municipalities that had very low counts [incl. Auderghem/Oudergem and Uccle/Uccle that are 2 out of the 4 withheld by LVan]; and my new table for all domains except .com and thus more significant numbers, throws the earlier ratios in the bin even for the least expected municipalities (see once more under <a href="#Facts" title="">#Facts</a>). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_28.html" title="Dec 28">28 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 00:38&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Comment for LVan: As I understand it, you use the term 'decisive' as having a 20:1 chance of one language having prevalence over the other; in other words, it can be decided that the ratio is not 50/50. Even with a 70/30 ratio established however, this does not necessarily mean that it can be decided that in English one term will maintain that ratio. The balance may swing quickly, e.g. an important meeting [cf. the Laeken Declaration] and for these rarely mentioned municipalities even far lesser causes. Whether this would make the 70% or the 30% becoming dominant cannot be decided. As for now, while 30% of speakers of English write the term in a particular way, should we decide to present the other way as the 'mainly' established spelling, in fact causing that spelling to become <i>the</i> established one? This is a very different question from being 50/50 undecided or not. Personally, I would not consider 70/30 a sufficient ratio to determine whether a particular term outranks the other one. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_28.html" title="Dec 28">28 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 01:33&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Hi SomeHuman, thank you for engaging me on the stats and also for your work done on pointing out the dangers of using data without having a good look at them (I acknowledge I was a bit hasty myself in that respect in the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBruges_f338.html" title="Talk:Bruges">Bruges</a> talk page). Like you, I looked at the Google results in more detail and I was also astounded at the number of repeats and illegitimate results that came out regardless of what keywords are specified. The example I took was Auderghem/Oudergem, the first one in the list and the one that was mentioned as a subsection above. Looking at the UK pages for Auderghem, adding the keywords Brussels and Belgium as suggested by Markussep, and not removing Oudergem as you suggested, I got <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUK&amp;q=Auderghem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUK&amp;q=Auderghem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> 175 “raw” hits. Checking manually one by one for those that were not part of addresses, or written in wikis, or written by obvious non-Anglophones, or from a site already obtained earlier (lots of those!), I got only 19 legitimate hits. The same procedure for Oudergem got me 8 legitimate hits out of <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUK&amp;q=Oudergem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUK&amp;q=Oudergem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> 16 “raw” hits. For the US pages, the number of “raw” hits was <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=Auderghem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=Auderghem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> 722 and <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=Oudergem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?lr=lang_en&amp;cr=countryUS&amp;q=Oudergem+Brussels+Belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> 324 for Auderghem and Oudergem, respectively. I had the courage to go only through the first half of those in each case and got 27 and 18 legitimate hits, respectively. The total number of legitimate hits for the UK and the US is therefore 46 for Auderghem and 26 for Oudergem, and I could have had a few more if I had gone through the second half of the US data. Note how close these numbers are from your second table (coincidence?). The p value of this ratio is 0.012. I didn’t have time to do work on the other municipalities yet…</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now for the stats… Your understanding is perfectly fine; my interpretation of “decisive” is indeed whether we can or cannot say, with a 1:20 chance of error, that English usage prefers one name versus the other. Using a manual check of the data, as described above, would limit wild swings in the data since a major event in Laeken would add only 1 data point per Anglophone author describing it. But this is indeed a danger for rare data: the 7 to 1 decisive results for Auderghem in your first table would have suddenly become indecisive had Oudergem got one more hit. The way the data is obtained then becomes critical… With the current 46 to 26 ratio, however, this danger has disappeared. Also regarding the 70/30 zone of comfort, it is usually not needed as soon as we have a reasonable amount of data (some people got to be president of the US with a lot less of a margin!) <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 04:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We, who try to establish a proper choice, are not appointed by politicians. Fortunately, we can choose for <i>both</i> names simultaneously at equal level if all the arguments pro and contra a single or which single name are about in balance. Having two equally enpowered presidents was not an option, but making up the rules as one sees fit at the time of coming to a decision, has clearly been proven not to gather deep respect from any observers.

Of these 23 hits, I rejected the ones that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were obviously not written in English</li>
<li>had the name only in an address</li>
<li>were very similar to another hit, e.g. from the same site, or mirrors</li>
<li>had the name only in combinations, e.g. Hallen van Schaarbeek, Cercle Philatélique de Berchem-Sainte-Agathe</li>
<li>had the name only as a motorway exit (part of the ring around Brussels is in Flanders, and has only Dutch road signs)</li>
</ul>
<p>I categorised the others in Dutch, French, and mixed. If the French name is used once, and the Dutch name several times, I call it Dutch, and vice versa. For .uk, the result was: 23 hits, 10 rejections, 3 Dutch, 6 French, 4 mixed. For .edu: 3 hits, 2 rejected, 1 French. For .gov: 1 hit, rejected. For .org: 58 hits, 5 Dutch, 13 French, 3 mixed, 37 rejected. Totals: 85 hits, 50 rejected, 8 Dutch, 20 French, 7 mixed. Maybe someone else will get other results, there were some hits I wasn't too sure about, e.g. lists of towns. I allowed them if Brussels and Antwerp were shown with their English names. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 21:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Markussep, thank you for going through this. Maybe we should structure the second part of the vote into two questions:
<ul>
<li>Question 1. what “one name” (Dutch only, French only, alternating Dutch and French, English usage, other)?</li>
<li>Question 2. for those who choose “English usage” in Question 1, what would be considered “decisive” (a few options could possibly be proposed) and what would the fallback position be in case of “indecisiveness?” <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 21:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>SomeHuman for alternating (no idea if he's serious about that)</li>
<li>Stevenfruitsmaak for Dutch</li>
<li>you, me, Caranorn, David Edgar and probably Septentrionalis for English usage</li>
<li>Diemietrie, Fram, Eugène van der Pijll, Westermarck, AjaxSmack and TobyJ haven't indicated their preferences yet</li>

<p>In the table below I list the results of my revised search for Dutch and French according to the method I explained at the beginning of this paragraph (with Berchem-Ste-Agathe as the example). I also searched for abbreviated saints (St and Ste). In case there were too many hits to hand-check them all I took a representative sample, and divided the results by the sample fraction (e.g. 66/222 for Molenbeek). For Molenbeek .org I took hits nr. 1,4,7,11,14,17 etc. Legend: NL=Dutch name, FR=French name, mix=mixed use, rej=rejected (see criteria above).

<dd>Given your decisive results for Auderghem, Forest, Ixelles, Schaerbeek, Uccle and Watermael-Boitsfort, I'm not going to test them anymore. I see clear leads for the French names for all municipalities except Berchem-Sainte-Agathe (my test pass, your test fail), Saint-Josse-ten-Noode (my test fail, your test pass), and Molenbeek (basically 50/50). Maybe we get more decisive results if we include more domains (.net, .info, .eu, .int?). For Molenbeek the short name is used a lot apparently, we may have to vote about that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 09:50, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with your conclusions and steps forward (can’t comment, however, on the choice of new domains to test). As a general observation, it seems that English usage for those municipalities located to the NE of Brussels (near Koekelberg and Ganshoren) is less well established than for the other ones. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 18:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are great results: as clear as we are going to get and, by the way, coinciding with the original Google tests published in the table above, in <a href="#Encyclopedias.2C_Google_Scholar_and_Google_tests_by_Markussep" title="">#Encyclopedias, Google Scholar and Google tests by Markussep</a>. I would propose to use the full Dutch names for <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek_7fed.html" title="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Sint-Jans-Molenbeek</a> (I agree with <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> that the shorter ”Molenbeek” name would eventually be better on a disambiguation page) and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Agatha-Berchem_6cde.html" title="Sint-Agatha-Berchem">Sint-Agatha-Berchem</a>, and the French names for the other municipalities.

<dd>What do you mean with your last line? It's true that a 10-2 French-Dutch ratio would correspond more or less with the local population, if that's what you mean.

<dd>Sorry, I should have been more explicit on the geographic argument… I just observed that the two municipalities for which English usage is less well established happen to be located close to each other and close to three municipalities for which there are no French names: Anderlecht, Koekelberg, and Ganshoren (see <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels-Capital_Region_8ac9.html#Municipalities" title="Brussels-Capital Region">Brussels-Capital Region#Municipalities</a>), all of them on the North-East side of Brussels. This may all be just coincidence, but it may also be reflecting a larger percentage of Dutch usage locally (hard data would be welcome!), hence my suggestion to adopt the Dutch names for those municipalities. This solution dispels the notion that all should automatically be in French while giving justice to English usage where it is clear. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 23:32, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's coincidence indeed (you mean north-west, don't you?). We could also just leave them as they are, Molenbeek French, and Berchem Dutch.

<dd>The figures might be different for other municipalities: Ixelles/Elsene is certainly not known as a municipality that had for a long time significantly resisted to become French-speaking. Note that for several of the other municipalities, the French name is simply the Dutch name that is spelled as it used to be in Dutch, or a very obvious translation like 'Sint-Pieter(s)' -&gt; 'Saint Pierre', whereas Elsene got its very own French name Ixelles. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 04:47&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>
<dd>Three remarks: 1) The region is <i>very young</i>, its officially bilingual status is too. Thus there will be more sources in English found that derive information from older sources, with French immensely prevailing. 2) There used to be a time that "Malines" was much more common in English than "Mechelen", a city that was always Dutch-speaking. Now the native name clearly prevails in Google searches; but for the municipalities in the bilingual region, the current situation with respect to languages is much more recent. 3) The current French majority has come to existence only during an officially unilingual French period in which the French-speakers in Belgium were clearly politically dominant, this situation has, without intention to get it the other way around, recently changed with a considerably economically stronger Flanders than Wallonia - significance and speed of according changes in language balance in the bilingual municipalities of the country's capital region are as yet an open question. It is however very unlikely that a historical balance of the names used in English is going to remain, as none of these names have become more than very rarely used in English, unlike the mentioned Malines which usage did change most considerably. [For all clarity, the city of Mechelen had earlier been commonly known in English as "Mechlin" and that had quickly changed to "Malines" as well.] It is however, most unlikely that in any foreseeable future, any one of these municipalities could become officially unilingual, and unlikely that the number of Dutch-speaking inhabitants that survived as a minority would further diminish while now having much more favorable circumstances. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 04:35-05:52&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Discussion and conclusion</span></h4>
<p>The results of the <a href="#Revised_Google_test" title="">#Revised Google test</a> indicate that 10 out of 12 municipalities are significantly more often called by their French name than by their Dutch name in English usage. For three of these municipalities, the article titles are currently not their French names:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The only municipalities that did not show a significant preference for either Dutch or French are Sint-Jans-Molenbeek/Molenbeek-Saint-Jean and Sint-Agatha-Berchem/Berchem-Sainte-Agathe. A previous suggestion for undecided cases was to use the name in the local majority language. This may be difficult to determine. For instance, there haven't been linguistic censuses since 1947. Local election results may help, as federal election results are not given by municipality. If it proves to be impossible, we could vote about the names for these two (using simply "Molenbeek" has been suggested by some participants).</p>
<p>The present city council of Molenbeek (<a href="http://www.molenbeek.be/NL/conseilNL.htm#b" class="external text" title="http://www.molenbeek.be/NL/conseilNL.htm#b" rel="nofollow">NL</a>/<a href="http://www.molenbeek.be/fr/conseilfr.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.molenbeek.be/fr/conseilfr.htm" rel="nofollow">FR</a>) consists of 27 French-speaking (PS, cdH, Ecolo, MR, FN) and 4 Dutch-speaking (SP.A, VB) councillors, that's 87% French. For St-Agatha-Berchem it's a bit more complicated, because there are list combinations (LBR = list of the mayor, and the two socialist parties PS+SP.A). However, if the language of the street names in the addresses of the councillors (see <a href="http://www.berchem.irisnet.be/site/citoyennete/conseilcomm/fr?set_language=fr&amp;cl=fr" class="external text" title="http://www.berchem.irisnet.be/site/citoyennete/conseilcomm/fr?set_language=fr&amp;cl=fr" rel="nofollow">FR</a>/<a href="http://www.berchem.irisnet.be/site/citoyennete/conseilcomm/nl?set_language=nl&amp;cl=nl" class="external text" title="http://www.berchem.irisnet.be/site/citoyennete/conseilcomm/nl?set_language=nl&amp;cl=nl" rel="nofollow">NL</a>) is a good indication, it could be 19 French and 8 Dutch, that's 70% French.</p>

<dd>As Caranorn <small>13:17, 11 January 2007</small> and I, SomeHuman <small>2007-01-11 16:59</small> had pointed out, election results are meaningless for our purpose for several reasons but mainly because these do not represent the language of the local voters - who cares what language 27 people speak. Furthermore it is a peculiar intellectual bend to disregard artificial <i>official</i> bilingual names, but then choose for the at the same time worked out artificial <i>official</i> system of representation to find what you like to be local usage.<br />
Anyway, 'local usage' is nonsense as I already explained several times because the Wikipedia naming convention, after English usage, resorts to 'local usage' which happens to be mainly on a <i>country</i> level (as opposed to English usage) and not on a mere municipality level. These are not in a country's outskirt as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommunes_of_South_Tyrol_781c.html" title="Talk:Communes of South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> bordering <i>another</i> country, but form <i>the country's central capital</i> region at the middle of the Brussels agglomeration. Suppose no English usage of '<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>' would have been established, we would never ask "How do the people inside that place call it?" but we'd ask "How do the Thai call it?". We never inspect whether the name <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_Daeng_ddbf.html" title="Din Daeng">Din Daeng</a> is even used therein or in the whole of Bangkok municipality or province; just if it is common in Thai, the main language of the country. It is equally incorrect to look at the artificial regional level because even this slightly broader kind of 'local usage' would then have to include their other immediate neighbours within the Brussels agglomeration, comprising also the considerable population of Flemish municipalities —around the <i>official boundaries</i> of the <i>officially bilingual</i> region— that would have <i>mainly</i> (in Flemish part of <a href="../../../b/h/v/BHV_701b.html" title="BHV">BHV</a>) or <i>only</i> (to the East) Dutch-language representatives, and in both chiefly Dutch-speaking inhabitants. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_16.html" title="Jan 16">16 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:05&#160;(UTC)</span>
<dl>
<dd>Markussep's opening statement of this section is once more, and repeatedly, incorrect: For 10 out of 12 municipalities it may have been shown that counts were <i>decisive</i> to establish English usage of <i>at least 50%</i> by the French name. <i>At least 50%</i> is definitely not <i>significantly more</i>. I had argued before that one should determine what can be considered 'significant' to allow saying 'this is main English usage' and as other comparisons (American/British) had shown 2:1 not to be enough for Wikipedia, 3:1 could have been reasonable and clearly <i>significantly more</i>. Then the p-value [probability of statistical reliability] would have to be calculated for that ratio instead of on a 1:1 ratio so as to know for which municipalities we could decisively determine that English usage; it would have shown <i>significantly more French</i> for much less than 10 out of 12; for all others <a href="../../../n/c/3A/WP%7ENC%7ECITY_dd78.html#Europe" title="WP:NC:CITY">WP naming conventions</a> directs clearly to 'local usage'.<br />
This would have brought us for at least 10, possibly all, municipalities to 'local usage' which according to my <small>23:05 UTC</small> comment here immediately above would by normal WP interpretation of 'local usage' have delivered (for undisputedly 2:1 Dutch speakers in the country) (nearly) all Dutch names. As this might be seen just as POV as getting them (nearly) all French by the currently by WP-voters most supported but highly disputable interpretation of 'English usage', having either bilingual names (locally normal NPOV but deprecated by <a href="../../../n/c/g/WP%7ENCGN_6405.html#Multiple_local_names" title="WP:NCGN">WP Multiple local names</a>) or else <a href="#What_one_name" title="">alternating Dutch/French, 6 municipalities by each language name</a> would have been acceptable NPOV decisions. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_16.html" title="Jan 16">16 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:43 - <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_17.html" title="Jan 17">17 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 00:16&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>SomeHuman, you know the outcome of our votes (single name, determined by common English usage) and you had your chance to contribute to the criteria for the latter. I think it's far too late to start pushing your ideas again, against consensus. If you want to propose using Dutch names for Molenbeek and St-Ag-Berchem, fine, but don't start questioning the whole process again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 19:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>As explained above in <a href="#Revised_Google_test" title="">#Revised Google test</a>, I would favour using the full Dutch names for the two undecided municipalities. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 23:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As LVan pointed out, it appears to make a geographically coherent sense to show those two with a Dutch title (of course the full names), and as Markussep noted, 10/2 approaches the language balance on regional level; it may seem to be better than other names for only those 2 municipalities. For reasons I explained here above, too many subjective and contradictory decisions were necessary for the entire outcome, to have confidence for a long-lasting self-evident result or one that can convince future contributors. We'll have to wait and see... — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_20.html" title="Jan 20">20 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 12:23&#160;(UTC)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So then we have one more move (in addition to the three above):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/l/Molenbeek-Saint-Jean_e35a.html" title="Molenbeek-Saint-Jean">Molenbeek-Saint-Jean</a> → <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek_7fed.html" title="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Sint-Jans-Molenbeek</a></li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Time to move some pages?</span></h4>
<p>Hi. I'm working on the backlog at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, and I'd like to close out as much of this move request as possible. I can see that we've decided to go with one name per article title, and to go with common English usage, which leaves the problem of determining what that is. Above, I read that most cases are decidable, with the only three in need of moves being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles-Elsene_8f9b.html" title="Ixelles-Elsene">Ixelles-Elsene</a> → <a href="../../../i/x/e/Ixelles.html" title="Ixelles">Ixelles</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaarbeek.html" title="Schaarbeek">Schaarbeek</a> → <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schaerbeek.html" title="Schaerbeek">Schaerbeek</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It sounds like those need to be moved, seven others need to be left alone, and two are still undecided. That's a total of twelve. Do I have those details correct, and are those three pages ready to move? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you take responsibility to accept English usage having been 'decided' according to Wikipedia standards, see my 2nd comment in the <a href="#Discussion_and_conclusion" title="">above section</a>? Anyway, I think it's best to perform the moves only when the names are decided for all 12 municipalities. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_17.html" title="Jan 17">17 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 00:03&#160;(UTC)</span>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not trying to take responsibility for anything that hasn't achieved some kind of consensus yet. I hadn't seen the comment that you indicated, but seeing it now, I think this discussion has some more days left in it. I'll relist the request at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, in the interest of clearing the backlog, and probably see you again in five days. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 06:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Personal comment:</b> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_languages.html" title="Romance languages">Romance languages</a> are closely related to its <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> child, and it is more than likely for people speaking such language, to have access to and understanding of a French-language source, than would be the case for more different and for the large majority of these people unintelligible languages of germanic origin, or would be the case for even less related groups of languages; also sheer geographical distance puts Catalan, Spanish and Portugese closer to French.<br />
English is a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_languages.html" title="Germanic languages">germanic language</a>, though of all those none other has incorporated as many words of romance language origin. Nearly all native speakers of <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourgish.html" title="Luxembourgish">Luxembourgish</a> (a language comparatively rarely written) are quite able to read French, one their country's major languages, and have France and the French-speaking part of Belgium as close neighbours and relatively litte contact with distant Flemish or Dutch people, hence have less obviously access to Dutch-language sources than to French ones. Because the Dutch language is far less a world language than French, even people speaking another related language such as <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> do not generally bother to learn Dutch.<br />
It is then revealing that the non-<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_languages.html" title="Romance languages">romanic</a> Wikipedias opted for systematically bilingual titles, as I promote for this English-language Wikipedia. There is only one single <i>article</i> in a non-romanic language with only one name for the municipality; it happens to be the Dutch name. It appears safe to assume that the degree of establishing one particular name for any of these municipalities in German (or even <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesian_language.html" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian</a>, a native dialect of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_language.html" title="Malay language">Malay</a> and the only official language of a <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">former colony of the Netherlands</a> for which the Belgian municipalities hardly mattered), is not all too different from such in English. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_5.html" title="Jan 5">5 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 20:46&#160;(UTC)</span></p>

<p>As for now, 6 people have voted for one name in the title, but only 1 has made clear what name he wants the title to have. If people don't vote for the second question (if one name, which one? - if two names, how?) this survey has little use, as it remains unclear how the result should be implemented. What can be done about this? <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 15:12, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What can be done is to wait for January 6, when voting on the second question opens. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugène van der Pijll</a> 16:38, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What also can be done is to determine the options to choose from in the second vote. For the "one" case there are some obvious options:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>all French</li>
<li>all Dutch</li>
<li>name most used in English (my preference, but what if there is no clearly preferred name, and how is it determined?)</li>
<li>local majority language (but how is it determined, census?)</li>

<dd>Since 1947, there hasn't been any census about language in Belgium. In fact, because of the tensions the census results on language gave in the past, language censuses are banned forever when the 'language border' (<i>taalgrens</i>, <i>frontière linguistique</i>) was fixed "once and for all" in 1962. So the last option is very difficult to determine. We only know there are more French-speaking people than Dutch-speaking people in Brussels, but the exceptional situation is that none of these two linguistic groups have a majority, according to the survey of the VUB (Free University of Brussels).</dd>
<dd>The name most used in English would be the best solution if only one name has to be chosen. But this is also very difficult to determine, because most names are not very common in English at all (otherwise there was no discussion or survey needed...). I think the choices here will always be based on arbitrary methods of determination.</dd>
<dd>That's why I think everyone who votes should choose for a concrete solution rather than a vague preference for "one name". Of course my first preference is also to choose one name for articles. No one likes long-winded names. But the question here is: what's realistic in this specific case? When most of the voters for one name do not make clear how they want their votes to be implemented, it seems to me as if these votes only show a simple preference for articles with one name, rather than a contribution to a solution for this problem.</dd>
<dd>Maybe that's the result of the way this survey is set up. Maybe it would be better to make a survey with only concrete options and make clear before the survey starts how these options will be implemented, particularly how the name most commonly used in English will be determined. Now we run the risk this survey produces more questions than answers. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 13:23, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I prefer one single name because double names are ambiguous and confusing, especially for people who are not familiar with the region, and don't speak French or Dutch.

<dd>The Dutch names are the original ones. In some cases the French name is only the old spelling of the Dutch name! The Brussels region had a Dutch-speaking majority untill the first half of the 20th century. Since Belgium was founded in 1830 as an officially unilingual French state (although with a Dutch-speaking majority!), many people in the Brussels region gradually switched from Dutch to French. This process continued untill circa 1970, when Dutch and French communities got their own institutions (schools, public centers, libraries, etc.). <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 17:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you mean a) the City of Brussels [which established English name is not part of the discussion about the titles] as well as the other 18 municipalities? b) usage by 1. inhabitants incribed in the registers for having their <i>main</i> residence there, 2. inhabitants renting a place there where they stay <i>during the week</i>, 3. people <i>living or working there</i>.

<dd>Furthermore, which precedence is to be given (provided there is no established English name, which is likely for these in English rarely mentioned municipalities: a Google search on rarely used names does not find established names but does original research): a) the local name of the municipality <i>officially</i> or <i>by de facto majority</i>; the name local on municipality level or on <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_and_communities_of_Belgium_9e1a.html" title="Regions and communities of Belgium">community</a> level (with identical <i>official</i> but inverse majority-based result); c) a position that does not make Wikipedia envolved in and an accomplish to local, inter-regional and national heavy disputes that are currently still going on with strong political consequences for the whole country? — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 05:17&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>You're right that there are several definitions for "inhabitants". I'd go with people actually registered in the municipality, I don't think commuters contribute much to local culture. Regions and communities will not bring us further because the Brussels region is part of both the Dutch and French speaking communities. That Brussels isn't part of Wallonia is irrelevant. Let's not exaggerate the severity of the language conflict, I've never heard of Dutch or French speaking schools and institutions being torched etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You do not think commuters to contribute much to local culture. Which local culture then, because a) the typical commuter employment of the capital area is a main source of income for the locals, as in several municipalities the unemployment rate is very high (immigrant non-EU majorities) and the "locals" in the other communities are on the opposite scale of the social ladder, substantially rather recently arrived (from other Belgian regions, from EU countries, from still other countries) and for a part [NATO, European Community, the many embassies] came to live there temporarily. Thus selecting 'inhabitants' as determining culture is POV and then using such for language orientation for article titles is a violation of WP:NPOV. b) Your remark while addressing me, about the irrelevance of Brussels not being part of Wallonia, is misplaced as I never mentioned such [though probably shows which region <i>you</i> feel Brussels should belong to]; but I did mention the communities which you wave away while precisely the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_and_communities_of_Belgium_9e1a.html" title="Regions and communities of Belgium">communities</a> are the institutions entitled to <i>finance, organize or supervize cultural elements</i> in the Brussels-Capital region (that has no such authority) and thus the communities nearly alone determine what is culturally available - and the Flemish Community contributes substancially more to this region's culture than represented by this regions minority of Dutch-speaking inhabitants, not only for pure national political reasons but simply because all the Flemish people are represented to the world by their <i>capital</i>. Indeed there have not been incidents of torched schools, financed by each community for its language; which shows a degree of civilisation so as to resolve conflicts in a non-violent way by creating an officially complex situation, in particular the bilingual character of these municipalities. Is it then not about time that Wikipedia respects that? — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_24.html" title="Dec 24">24 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 12:09-12:19&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>"Is the use of Dutch increasing lately?" Yes and no. There are several groups of inhabitants using Dutch in the Brussels region. The traditional Flemish community (10% of the population according to the VUB-survey) is more or less stable in number. However, since the 1990s the use of Dutch language institutions is increasing very rapidly because of the good quality and reputation of especially Dutch language education, which attracts more and more students of unilingual French-speaking background and also of ethnic minorities. Currently the Dutch language education network has a 'market share' of over 20% (nursery and primary schools even nearly 25%) and the ambition is to make it 33% within the next 15 years. As a result, an increasing percentage of the population will be able to speak Dutch on a native level, if not being totally bilingual. On the other hand, the number of people with Dutch as a mother tongue shrinks rapidly as the native bilingual Brusselers with their typical Brabantic (Dutch) dialect as a mother tongue fall away. Most of them never took part in the Flemish community and as a result, their children have 'frenchified'. Good example of this extincting group is the present mayor of Brussels city, Freddy Thielemans: he is of mixed Brussels, Flemish and Walloon descent, his mother tongue is the original Dutch dialect of Brussels, he speaks French and Dutch fluently and appears regularly in Flemish media, but is member of the Parti Socialiste, the French-speaking social democrats, and takes part in the French-speaking community. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemietrie_081e.html" title="User:Diemietrie">Diemietrie</a> 14:57, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>Moved Markussep's section "Brussels survey" here from <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman's talk page</a></small><br />
I reverted your revertion of my attempt to make the voting section more intelligible. As I stated in the introduction, only <b>very brief</b> explanations were supposed to go with the votes. A little discussion about the explanations is fine, but the discussion was much too long for that place, and you topped it with a complete detailed scheme of why every municipality should be named as such. Do you think potential voters would have found the "follow english usage" votes after those lengthy discussions about alternating names? Or was that your intention? How would you have liked it if I had done the same, but favouring my preference? And what's the point of removing the section in the introduction where I explain what the options are, and where the details are discussed? If I wasn't assuming good faith, I'd think that you were deliberately obscuring the "follow english usage" votes in order to make people think your solution is the only one, besides the apparently not so popular "all dutch" and "all french" solutions. I hope you will act more constructively than that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 18:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another comment: you may want to add a <b>single line</b> to the voting section about what exactly you mean with "alternating". People might think you want to change the titles from French to Dutch and vice versa periodically. I can think of something ("one half of the municipalities French name, other half Dutch name, details to be discussed subsequently") but since it's your proposal, I'll let you add it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 18:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You had not started the discussion and only when at a one against three stance, you took on <i>your</i> survey, and then also destroyed the proper Requested move I proposed in strict accordance to consensus. You took charge over all the line, never seeking advice for proceedings; your lead asking to have a vote followed by "a <b>very</b> brief explanation" favored once more the 'Keep it simple' attitude which is your end of the stick; I nevertheless kept it as brief as possible in the one paragraph of my vote: there are far more arguments but I only explained the main one that as second choice allows 'alternating' to be my vote.</dd>
<dd>I cannot help other users and yourself to have started and to have been keeping on commenting my sufficiently brief essential explanation. Only when that already had brought the 'English usage'-vote section out of sight, I followed <i><b>your</b></i> invitation in the lead "If you have another suggestion, make it here." Thus my suggestion for the respective alternating names (which is in the smallest possible character size and reduced line-height), was not and cannot possibly have been what you accuse me of in your edit comment: <i>"obvious attempt by SomeHuman to make his proposal more prominent than the other ones"</i>. But your reaction was to move not only that suggestion away from the place that you alone had indicated, and not only also the discussion underneath my initial vote, but even the essential explanation of my vote itself, out of sight <i>AFTER</i> you had been contributing to that discussion: clearly you thought that someone just might <i>see</i> my suggestion <i>before</i> making a vote, and precisely that is what you at any price and against your own procedure rules and your earlier actions, prevented. And then changed the lead invitation to match your today's opinion.</dd>
<dd>I revert that and things stay where they are, not where you want to store it out of sight: <b>This is not <i>your</i> personal talk page.</b> You have no right to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:refactor">refactor</a> an article talk page moving people's contributions towards what you feel best at your whimses.

<dd>I object to your interpretation of the events. It's true that you and Diemietrie found consensus between the two of you, but you two are not very representative for wikipedia users since you're from Flanders and Diemietrie is Dutch (so am I). And again, the third vote pro is only wishful thinking on your side, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=96929052&amp;oldid=96912465" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=96929052&amp;oldid=96912465" rel="nofollow">Moyogo's reply</a>. I don't claim to be perfectly objective either, so IMO it makes perfect sense to invite more people, also because the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#Requested_move" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">previous move request to bilingual names</a> failed.
<dl>
<dd>Would you care to read the last sentence of Moyogo's reply from your link here above... And that reply came <i>after</i> your unilateral 'survey'; consensus was clearly reached including Moyogo since "Those changes have been waiting to be made for a while. It's time the people who think the current situation is wrong change it instead of blaming others for doing POV. --moyogo 08:19, 22 December 2006 (UTC)" and thus most clearly did not want you to stall by a survey about all possible and impossible directions and options either. And again:

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>&#160; made clear that a proper request to move – if not an immediate move – was immanent since not only the principle but also the precise type of bilingual naming had been determined. Your starting that bewildering survey after Moyogo's far from enthousiastic but very decisive comments, was not intellectually honest – neither towards the 3 that had come to a consensus, nor towards new readers who by the multi-threaded survey were kept unaware of that definite consensus. Furthermore, that January 2006 request to move towards bilingual names was opposed by 4 and supported by 5 users, which is not a failure but it seems that no-one bothered to close.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, my explications and proven facts in this section this morning and now here above, clearly indicate that relisting Markussep's multi-threaded survey would not be as appropriate as a proper and precise request to move (thus <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;oldid=96092506#2006-12-23" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;oldid=96092506#2006-12-23" rel="nofollow">this</a></b> but without showing the striked-through survey of Markussep, and now mentioning <i>There is no English name for any municipality around Brussels; nor can a French or a Dutch name singularily be established for usage in English. For most municipalities, the French name is slightly more often (1.8:1) found than the Dutch name in English texts, and is therefore consistently placed first in the titles.</i> - as such was proven by the survey and several users had come with such simplistic <i>usage in English</i> argument that it misses the point of that part of the problem). Personally, I'm not to keen on immediately listing because this would most likely cause another merry-go-round; better keep the current 'survey' in the 'Backlog' section of Requested Moves for a few more days. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_2.html" title="Jan 2">2 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 18:11&#160;(UTC)</span>
<dl>
<dd>That's still no response to my point that this shouldn't be decided by two Belgians and two Dutchmen. I count 5 oppose and 6 support on that previous survey, and that <i>is</i> too little support for a move. And you probably missed this part of the previous discussion: "Concluding, I think that a survey about the subject is a good idea.

<dl>
<dd>Be serious, that remark by Diemietrie came well before any consensus had seemed likely as there had remained a 2:2 tie. But you awaited many more comments and only days later at the 3:you outcome, suddenly without consulting you started the then inappropriate survey.</dd>
<dd>Indeed there were 5:6 votes in favour of bilingual names, not 4:5 as I accidentally typed. But whether that could not sufficiently support the moves is another matter: many titles had been bilingual before and had been moved unilaterally without discussion, thus a minute difference could well be decisive.</dd>
<dd>You keep blowing smoke in front of the readers' eyes: 1) as long as we keep in mind that this is the English Wikipedia, nationalities do not matter as most native speakers of English will not be as interested in or aware of the many aspects regarding the topic, they were not kept out but had simply never joined – in your survey, so far I was the only one who attempted to find texts written mainly by native English speakers [though it can still be translations that are likely to be guided by their source's language with respect to a municipality name] by searching typical domains, so as to come to a more reliable idea of the balance between French and Dutch names in English by British and American speakers; and 2) you already know my response to your incorrect statement that we <i>decided</i>: we <i>proposed</i> by requesting the moves towards the clear-cut set of titles that had become the result of the discussion – see <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#Requested_moves_for_its_municipalities" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">Requested moves for its municipalities</a> and you alone decided to obliterate that proper proposal from the Requested moves page. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_2.html" title="Jan 2">2 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:24-23:45&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

But your "nothing more to say" is lead by once more a false accusation trying to discredit your opponent: my <i>first</i> comment in this section already included: "the <i>survey</i> has revealed some interesting research results in the '<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#Facts" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">Facts</a>' subsection and comments in particular in the '<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#Auderghem.2FOudergem" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">Auderghem/Oudergem</a>', '<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#Discussion" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">Discussion</a>', '<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#If_one_name.2C_which_one" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">If one name, which one</a>' and '<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBrussels-Capital_Region_8123.html#English_usage" title="Talk:Brussels-Capital Region">English usage</a>' subsections," - that looks like my recognizing added value. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_3.html" title="Jan 3">3 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 21:35&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> The generally accepted method for measuring the decisiveness of a proportion is the statistical <a href="../../../p/-/v/P-value.html" title="P-value">p-value</a>. In the particular case of proportions, the p-value is equal to the probability that a proportion equal (or more extreme) to that observed was obtained by luck of the draw (because of chance sampling), assuming an underlying reality of 50:50. The classical example is that of the perfectly unbiased coin (the underlying reality of 50:50): from 24 flips of a coin showing 17 tails and 7 heads (in any order), would this result be considered decisive in demonstrating that this coin favours tails rather than being unbiased? In that particular case, the one-tailed p-value can be calculated from statistical tables (or software) to be 0.032; in other words, there is a 3.2% chance that this proportion could have been obtained by luck of the draw from a perfect coin, or equivalently that we would be mistaken if we were to say that this coin favours tails. The widely accepted threshold used by statisticians, and by decision makers in many different fields, is 5%: any risk of mistake smaller than 5% is accepted. Therefore, the decision here would be to consider that the coin indeed favours tails, with the understanding that this kind of decision would be incorrect 1 time out of 20 (5%).<br />
The current debate offers an excellent example of application. If properly compiled data were to show for instance 17 Anglophone Google hits for Name 1 versus 7 Anglophone hits for Name 2 (these would need to be manually reviewed, unbiased, uncontested data), the p-value would be 0.032 and I would call these results decisive, with the understanding that I have a 3.2% chance of being wrong. If it had been let’s say 0.062, I would have abstained and called the proportion not decisive until more proper data can be found. Note, to be complete, that the more hits there are, the lower the p-value and the less chances we have of being wrong: if we had had 34 tails and 14 heads (same proportion as 17 versus 7), the p-value would have been 0.003 instead of 0.032.<br />
This does not change anything to the questions of accuracy, non-bias, or general legitimacy of using the Google tool for assessing English usage. If it is decided, however, that Google is indeed a good tool and that proper data can be obtained from it, the question of decisiveness is an easy one. The power of statistics is that even seemingly infrequent usage (17 versus 7) is often enough to be decisive. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a>, 27 December 2006<br />
If interested, try the following on-line free calculator, <a href="http://www.wessa.net/rwasp_hypothesisprop2.wasp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wessa.net/rwasp_hypothesisprop2.wasp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, where the “Sample size” is the total number of hits (taking both sides together) and the “Proportion” is the ratio discussed above (one side over total). The other fields should be left alone. You will notice slight differences with the results mentioned above – this is because of the different underlying distributions used by the various software packages. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a>, 4 January 2007</li>
