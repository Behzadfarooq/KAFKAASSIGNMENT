<li>It's not private slang; it's in Brewers (1894 &amp; 1956 edn's), for example, and I'm fairly sure I've seen it in Kipling (although I can't immediately find a cite). If memory serves it's been relatively archaic since the first part of the century, though - it derived from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> being one of the world's largest manufactories, and thus producing a lot of what we'd think of as "made in China" tat today. Hence "brummagem goods" were likely to be cheap, flashy, &amp;c. That said... is it encyclopedic? I can't see it being much more than a dictionary definition, although I'll try fleshing it out a bit. No vote on what to do with it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 14:33, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>I think I'll concur with <b>merge and redirect</b>; a description makes sense in the context of the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> page, and if it doesn't seem right we can spin it off again. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 15:28, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's content here, it just needs unstubifying into a proper article; or, folding into the actual <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> article. I'd suggest the later myself - no need for it to be a completely different article.</li>
<li>I think the rewritten article is a <b>keep</b>er. Good work Shimgray&#160;:). <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 17:20, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

American Heritage picks up the counterfeit coin origin. The article I've linked to has some more odds and sods, if Shimgray wants them. Yes, simply putting "showy", "shoddy" would be a dictdef, but explaining how it came to mean that is encyclopaedic.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:24, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>I've re-inserted and rewritten some of the stuff on the pejorative meaning of the word. Nick, an encyclopaedia isn't a forum for promotion of a city, and it ought to record the way words are <i>actually used</i>, not the way you would like them to be used. Look up "Brummagem" in any dictionary (the OED, for example, defines it as "counterfeit; cheap and showy". You and I know that's not the whole story of Birmingham's manufacturing history, but it is part of it. Anyone finding one of the multitude of references to "Brummagem ware" in 19th century literature and looking it up in Wikipedia ought to be able to tell what the author meant, and erasing the negative connotations of the word isn't useful. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 11:28, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

There is a very well-known meaning of the word "Brummagem" which you seem to be determined to erase from history - reporting facts (as an encyclopaedia needs to do) is not the same as advocating a particular point of view.

<p>Sorry y'all, I work full time away from a computer and so I may not get chance to reply instantly just to let you all know, that is.. the thousands of wikipedians that are grosely offended by my edits to Brummie and Brummagem.</p>
<p>I agree that the word Brummagem has been described as cheap goods in ALL dictionaries since I can remember but surely that is where Wikipedia is absloutely shoulders above such set in stone fuddy duddy entries of the British Language, I knew this meaning to be a smaller part of the story of the word and so I discovered that Brummagem or Brumicham was actually a local term to Birmingham and it's many visitors took away the name and with it their conceptions of the city (then town), I have added these brief "run downs" on the page as a general overall consensus, the negative explanation of the term is explained also which i took great pains to investigate I can asure you, the city was regarded as the workshop of the world in the 19th century with a daft amount of skilled workmen, scientists and inventors and out of these there were many immitators who flocked to the city and tryed to copy the skilled workers to make their fortune, out of such a cocophony of hammers and thoughts came genius and also... shit! that is where Brummagem was misused by a certain few which was documented, the skilled workers eventually didn't even know of the use of such terms and even if they did they would have had NO way of contesting. All very boring really, regardless, Brummagem originally was a Birmingham term and I have never heard it used as a reference to cheap goods though I have heard of a Brummagem Hammer (screwdriver) from a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> of all people, shocking!&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:27, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You haven't just added material to this and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brummie.html" title="Brummie">Brummie</a>, you have also removed other people's work without discussion or reaching a consensus. Your preferred version of the page (and I'm glad to see you haven't done your usual trick of reverting it) contains no mention whatsoever of the negative connotations of the word. Wikipedia, as you've been told several times, is not about promoting a partisan view of any subject. I feel the page as it stands reflects both the meaning of the word you'll find in dictionaries and literature, and balancing information about the origin of the word and the industrial heritage of Birmingham. If you're happy with the way the page is now (I certainly am), shall we leave it that way? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 13:16, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry Andy... mmm... I can see what you are saying but I just think that the quotations bit is irrelevant to the article, should we list every persons quotation on 'scouser' or 'cockney', Brummagem is listed in most dictionaries as cheap and showy goods which was totally unfounded, now to my mind this is where wikipedia excells, it is or should be unbiased and mostly fact, a quotation about a community is a personal opinion by a single individual, not neccessarily fact. The article already addresses that out of a vast variety of excellent goods cheap crap was also produced, it's innevitable that if you use a spoon every day and it works you don't give it two thoughts but should it break then you go and buy a spoon from the same company for a similar budget you have no right to complain, Brum had thousands of manufacturers good and bad, mostly good.&#160;:) 195.92.67.209 00:00, 2 May 2005 (UTC) Nick</p>
<dl>
<dd>But this is nonsense - the word Brummagem <i>means</i> cheap and showy. It's in dictionaries; the concise OED to hand lists it with only an etymological reference to the city, and Brewer's does much the same <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/81/2571.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/81/2571.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's in encylopedias; there's a link to the '11 Britannica above. It's not "a single opinion", it's quotations to illustrate the use of the term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Birmingham used to have a huge number of factories producing - well, producing the sort of stuff people refer to as "made in Taiwan" these days, not so much low-quality as seen as a little bit tacky. It's inevitable that "Brummagem goods" became shorthand for this sort of thing; it was <i>famous</i> for it. Certainly this usage had overtones of provincial dismissal to it, but that only served to cement the use of an existing concept.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue with the quotation may be a valid one - personally I think it's large and out of place, and I'll try and find a pithier one - but removing <b>the definition of the word</b> simply because you don't like it is just silly. The page as you left it has an extensive summary of why Birmingham became known for its manufactories, but then leaps straight to saying it produced counterfeit groats and a lot of jewellery. As it was before, it actually explained the use of the term - without this, 50% of the page is pretty much meaningless and should be on <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> if elsewhere. It's perfectly sensible to explain that Birmingham produced a lot of good material, and was in many cases renowned for it - it's not sensible to try and ignore literary warrant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And to forestall one objection made in edit summaries - no, this isn't some dislike of Birmingham. My sole experience of the place was changing trains there, a couple of years ago, and it seemed a perfectly nice place... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 00:24, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the quotation isn't perfect, it's one which came immediately to hand (and it does illustrate quite nicely the dual "showy <i>and</i> counterfeit" meaning). The "provincial dismissal" issue is why I landed myself in all this - I was reading <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Blackwood_0422.html" title="Algernon Blackwood">Algernon Blackwood</a>'s "Sand", and there is an unpleasant character in that story (crude, unspiritual, duplicitous) who Blackwood makes a point of stressing is from Birmingham. Being a bit of a chauvinist I bristle at that sort of thing, and went to look at what Wikipedia had to say on the subject - I wasn't surprised (given the incompleteness of the project) that there wasn't anything here, but I was horrified to discover that it <i>had</i> been here but had been removed, and removed in a way contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. There's an interesting social history of denigration of people from industrial cities, or with particular accents, or in particular occupations (trade and manufacturing), and pretending that it doesn't happen isn't going to make it go away. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 12:26, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My dear Andrew, by replicating here in wikipedia nonsense which you have read in a book which was written by a person who was sadly ignorant to Birmingham and her (not just industrial) prowess (regardless of when the book was written) you are simply perpetuating the myth that the city is somehow inferior to other British cities, whilst I understand your shortcomings are not deliberate I cannot let wikipedia be "damaged" by your lack of understanding of how an encyclopedia works, never mind... you are learning all the time&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:21, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You see Andy... my opinion as a human being is just as valid as your own opinion, and just as valid as any other human being ever to walk this earth regardless of what they have achieved, I am here to question the use of the term Brummagem, originally meaning Birmingham, I wish to reclaim that term. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:00, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>p.s. Shimgray, I agree with what you say that the description of Brummagem means such things in UK dictionaries however, my aim is to question this and not just take as fact something I read that has (to my knowledge) never been discussed with objection as is happeneing here... right now... we know by my own investigations that Birmingham was home to the largest <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter_2be6.html" title="Gun Quarter">Gun Quarter</a> in Europe and maybe the world, Birmingham was also home to an immense <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery_Quarter_1d87.html" title="Jewellery Quarter">Jewellery Quarter</a> which was reknowned for excellence, the city had its own assay office, the city gave the poor of the world the freedom to write in the form of the mass produced steel knib, the cheap crap evolved as a by product of the extremeley superior exports of that city like the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_engine.html" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celluloid.html" title="Celluloid">celluloid</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic.html" title="Plastic">plastics</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroplating.html" title="Electroplating">Electroplating</a> which is why I believe the reference to the city producing cheap tat is about as applicable as if one were to use it in reference to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>.&#160;:| <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:39, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you need to stop for a second and remember what this is - this is the <b>Brummagem</b> article, not the <b>Birmingham</b> article. The page on Brummagem should discuss what the word means; the page on Birmingham should discuss the city. Look at, say, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_tape.html" title="Scotch tape">scotch tape</a> - the word "scotch" there is used to mean "cheap". Do we need to include a lengthy explanation of how Scots aren't really as thrifty and cheapskate as generally represented, or a discussion of the Scottish economy as a counterpoint? Of course not - but it is appropriate to include a note saying how the name was derived. It just gets silly trying to cover this with caveats - it doesn't need to be discussed with objectivity, because it's a word and we're noting what it means. We're not here to change the world, we're here to record it.</dd>

<dd>Shimgray??? This is indeed the Brummagem article and it is a name given to Birmingham by the inhabitants of that city, it is another name for my home town, the fact that it was used in olden times by certain people to describe cheap and showy goods is relevant to the article which is why I included it but in a more p.c. way, it came about as a result of millions of items of all types of quality some of which were crap and hence it is not fair to simply say Brummagem means crap, I have never heard anyone say this, the only people not from Brum that use the term Brummagem refer to Birmingham itself, no connotations? The dictionary use of the word is infact out-dated and a misrepresentation. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 15:26, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Birmingham was, for a period, the proverbial workshop of the nation; mass-produced items were associated with Birmingham; the term stuck. That's really all we need to say.

<dd>I agree which is what was there before untill Andy seemed to want to add quotations highlighting some passage from an old book with negative connotations to the word, I am sure there are many negative quotes I could find for other UK cities, the reason why I feel strongly about this is because Brummagem means Birmingham, what some boffin in London in the 19th century used the term for is worth noting but not focusing on, Brum is where my family are from and the facts speak for themselves regarding Brummagem wear, from the most innovative brilliant goods to the mass produced cheap showy stuff, it is not clear cut and can be easily misinterpreted. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 15:26, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should also note that far from being Nick's "own investigations", there is a very large literature on Birmingham's industrial heritage and I can recognise at least one of the major sources for Nick's material (though he is rewriting it in his own words). Birmingham's manufacturing history is not something hidden and unknown, although Nick may only have come across it recently. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 09:36, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, condesending, talk to ME Andy NOT over my head that is extremely rude. I have been researching the term Brummagem and it means Birmingham, what someone in another part of the country who was fortunate enough to be in a position to express his/her opinions un-challenged regarding Brummagem a hundred years ago is actually quite irrelevant IMO and not clear cut enough to simply say Brummagem means cheap and showy, to one man it may have to another it may not but we will only have heard the opinion of the man who felt strongly enough to express it, the evidence to suggest that Brum products were in fact of fine quality is actually just as relevant to the article and fair to the great industrialists of days gone. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 15:26, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is plenty of stuff already in the article about the quality of some of Birmingham's industrial products (in fact, far too much, as others have pointed out - most of it is entirely irrelevant to the word "Brummagem"). The usage of the word to mean "cheap fake" is not some sort of aberration, it's the main sense in which the word is used outside Birmingham (and to a large extent inside Birmingham too, as I know). I'm going to tidy up much of the nonsense you've added recently, since you seem to be incapable of doing it yourself. Nobody ever referred to the high-quality goods from the jewellery quarter as "Brummagem", for example (if you're going to dispute this, please provide references). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Andrew Norman</a> 09:28, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nick has made statements such as "I admit it exists in many dictionaries doesn't mean its 100% correct" and " nonsense which you have read in a book which was written by a person who was sadly ignorant to Birmingham". But the point with Wikipedia is that if any of us disagree with book definitions, that's tough. A book is a verifiable source and that's what Wikipedia entries are supposed to reflect - not the personal views of editors. If you're certain a source is biased, the only way to deal with it is to find other sources to clarify the situation. 195.92.67.68 03:17, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I need to put my thinking cap on to address this properly but at the moment after a day at work... I think my point is, why should the thoughts of an author (whoever they may be) be any more or less important than my own, I am just as real and from my own experiences and research Birmingham made goods on the whole were/are of a very high standard and would have no doubt ranged from the cheap and tacky to the highest calibre, how can we know that the author didn't have an unfair bias towards the people of Birmingham? the other thing I am questioning is why was Birmingham/Brummagem tarred with a cheap/tawdry connotation in the Oxford Dictionary? You only have to take a look at the main <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> article to gain an perspective of the highly skilled workers from the 1600's onwards from creating many world wide wire gauges to supplying arms to armies of the world.

<dd>Point taken if we're talking an individual novelist. Dictionaries, however, are the result of massive collective research on a vast corpus of texts. Example: The Times leader, January 29th 1838, finds Sir Robert Peel being snide about the sincerity of an opponent: "Sir Robert Peel, who knew the sort of Brummagem stuff he had to deal with, treated the pledge and him who made it with utter indifference". If the Oxford lists it, you can be sure it was representative of English usage at the time. And that's what Wikipedia has to reflect: documented usage in sources generally viewed as reliable - however unfair or inaccurate you feel that usage may be. I urge you to read and work by the guidelines cited above. They're what make Wikipedia a credible source as an encyclopaedia, and not just a collection of personal soapboxes by people pushing their own agendas. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.67.65.html" title="User:195.92.67.65">195.92.67.65</a> 19:11, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realise that Wikipedia cannot simply exist on random peoples additions and edits alone and I also can imagine the extensive work and effort that goes into researching a word for any dictionary, the first and most common use of the word Brummagem is as the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Dictionary_b263.html" title="Oxford Dictionary">Oxford Dictionary</a> states, another meaning for Birmingham itself. Birmingham being the city, inclusive of its inhabitants, i.e. <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brummie.html" title="Brummie">Brummies</a>. I can accept that no problem at all.</p>
<p>Next we come to the meaning of the word that came about in the time (roughly) of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, Brummagem - counterfeit, fake, cheap. Ok I accept that many thousands of items were produced in Brum around this time, it was a massive industrial town, with thousands of people striving to make a living, after flocking from placed around the UK to a city with no major river or port, amazingly (to the credit of those people) areas like the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter_2be6.html" title="Gun Quarter">Gun Quarter</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery_Quarter_1d87.html" title="Jewellery Quarter">Jewellery Quarter</a> blossomed (although not with an easy ride), the city was awash with invention and skilled tradesmen, so much so that other countries capitalised on Brummagem workers in such trades as pen manufacture in the Easterbrook company in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.A._a0be.html" title="U.S.A.">U.S.A.</a> and gun manufacture from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> to the states.</p>
<p>Why then did (from what I have read so far) the South East use the term Brummagem to mean something that it was not as much as it was?.</p>
<p>Maybe there was no one to fight the corner for the hard working people of Brum, maybe they were all too busy making "cheap crap"&#160;;) to be arsed to argue the toss. I don't personally agree with the negative connotation of this word and I feel it a duty the skilled people of the city past and present to either reverse it or at the least create a neautral article on wikipedia, Brummagem = a city of people of all walks of life, many unskilled, many skilled across the ages, why should brum be any different to london, manchester and so on?. The interpretation of the word that Andrew is trying to exploit is too closely associated with the original true meaning of Brummagem, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, lets cut to the chase...</p>
<p>what Andy (or whoever) wants the article to say is that people from Birmingham were/are manufacturers of cheap shit. I have read evidence and included it here on wikipedia to completely destroy that myth, take a wander around <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> for this evidence. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:27, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's late at night, I really should be working, but... what gives you the right to "correct" the English language? I've a search window open here to Lexis-Nexis, which is a large database of newspaper articles. I've fed it the word "Brummagem". I get a decent number of hits. Many of those are for the "Brummagem Magazine", or in the Birmingham Evening Mail or Birmingham Post (which seem to mention that fine publication every issue, just about).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"what gives you the right to "correct" the English language?"</i> ~ erm... Brummagem has always meant Birmingham in my book, from my great grandparents to present day, what gives the English language (whoever that is???) the right to sully the name of my own city? A bit harsh IMO. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:00, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there are plenty of others... an article in the Grauniad quoting it in the "tawdry" sense, an article in the Sunday Times complaining that "there are brummagem displays all over Scotland.". In fact, virtually every use of the word I could find <i>not</i> in a Midlands local paper used it in the "dictionary" sense, not the sense meaning Birmingham. (There were some exceptions, mostly letters or editorials... and the latter usually in the Guardian, which still has a strong non-London core).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact still remains, Brummagem originally meant Birmingham. I am confident that there will be thousands of articles of many newspapers etc that have all kinds of connotations of Cockney, Scouser, Mancunian, Glasweigian etc, etc. Birmingham was a mass producer of goods of all quality. Brummagems = Birmingham people, what other people (across the ages) use that word for is not relevant to the Brummagem page IMO, otherwise we could look at all the negative meanings for the people of other cities in the UK. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:00, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For comparison, take the word "Embra" (Edinburgh); about as many hits, <i>but almost all are in central Scottish newspapers</i>. The conclusion we can quickly draw from those two is that both are locally used names, perfectly good for that (although 'Embra' does get dismissive overtones, especially in the Herald...) - but Brummagem has a second, fairly common, use outside Birmingham. Simply saying "this is outdated and wrong" is futile, because the word <i>isn't meaning Birmingham any more</i>. When someone talks about a Brummagem display, they mean to say it's tacky, not to say "it's tacky like you'd see in Birmingham".</dd>

If I say "I went dutch", I don't mean I suddenly started speaking a Germanic language - no, I mean I paid half the bill. It doesn't have anything to <i>do</i> with the Netherlands any more, except that it probably originated as a vague insult. Likewise with Birmingham; you might want to consider if anyone ever actually thinks of Birmingham when they use Brummagem to mean "tacky". By now, it's virtually a seperate word spelled the same... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 01:05, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I believe this is relevant as you seem insistant on adding your little negative quotation about Brummagem (birmingham), what it means/meant to someone else is not relevant in my opinion although I admit it exists in many dictionaries doesn't mean its 100% correct, maybe there are too many quotations here full stop, anyway I am sure we are mature enough to work this out, don't you just love Wikipedia&#160;:). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 18:07, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>I agree that the quotation isn't perfect, it's one which came immediately to hand (and it does illustrate quite nicely the dual "showy and counterfeit" meaning). The "provincial dismissal" issue is why I landed myself in all this - I was reading Algernon Blackwood's "Sand", and there is an unpleasant character in that story (crude, unspiritual, duplicitous) who Blackwood makes a point of stressing is from Birmingham. Being a bit of a chauvinist I bristle at that sort of thing, and went to look at what Wikipedia had to say on the subject - I wasn't surprised (given the incompleteness of the project) that there wasn't anything here, but I was HORRIFIED to discover that it had been here but had been removed, and removed in a way contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. There's an interesting social history of denigration of people from industrial cities, or with particular accents, or in particular occupations (trade and manufacturing), and pretending that it doesn't happen isn't going to make it go away. --Andrew Norman 12:26, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</i> ~ after reading this again, I feel even more strongly that you (Andy) have an alterior motive for contributing to this article&#160;:). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:49, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I first visited wikipedia the Brummagem article was quite poor, pardon my savagery but I saw it as a boil on the bottom of the Birmingham article that needed sqeezing, I believe this zit has now been well and truly zapped and with so much history of the word there is a much more balanced article. I don't often see this word on wikipedia but... a sincere <b>thanks</b> to one and all, if this place were eniterly one sided (which it truly isn't) then it would surely become a graveyard for the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomaniac.html" title="Megalomaniac">megalomaniacs</a> (A psychopathological condition characterized by <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delusional.html" title="Delusional">delusional</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasies</a> of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">wealth</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a>, or <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipotence.html" title="Omnipotence">omnipotence</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 23:22, 15 May 2005 (UTC) (thanks to <a href="../../../g/-/m/G-man.html" title="G-man">G-man</a> for showing me how to sign so easily&#160;:).</p>

<p>On returning to this article I think that the intro is still missleading a bit, as far as I can see the initial negative usage of the word Brummagem was due to the counterfeit groats made there, every city across the UK would have made good and bad wares, the fact that Birmingham mass produced virtually everything imaginable due to the city's close links with the Industrial Revolution is obviously going to lead to a cross section of goods. I would not call <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadbury.html" title="Cadbury">Cadbury</a> chocolate and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin.html" title="Austin">Austin</a> cars (pre WWII) cheap and shoddy or even counterfeit not to mention many of the firms in the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery_Quarter%2C_Birmingham_6d6d.html" title="Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham">Jewellery Quarter</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter%2C_Birmingham_ef2b.html" title="Gun Quarter, Birmingham">Gun Quarter</a> who seem to have been the main employers in the city during the era the term seems to have been used.

<dd>Indeed we can. I have a lot of extra information about the use of the word "Brummagem" throughout the ages to mean shoddy, mass-produced, deceptive rubbish. Birmingham had a <i>particular</i> reputation for producing trash. It's referenced, encyclopedic information, and I'll be adding it to the article and removing anything you add which is <i>not</i> referenced (i.e. anything you add at all, on past form). Or you can leave the article alone. You are not going to be allowed to go back to spreading brummagem rubbish all over Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 16:34, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Birmingham had a</i> particular <i>reputation for producing trash. It's referenced, encyclopedic information</i> - that's right, precisely my point. Birmingham did indeed have a reputation amongst certain people for mass produced trash, but that was a by-product of a city that produced everything imaginable and of every level of quality, it is unfortunate that the good stuff was ignored by some and their focus was on the crap, maybe snobbery came into it somewhere down the line. Birmingham was a fast evolving industrial sprawl full of working class people, some of particularly low skills and others highly trained in their field, from authors to inovators. To label everything to do with one city (in this instance Brummagem) as cheap trash is/was an insult to the skilled workers who manufatured, for instance, some of the finest British Jewellery in the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery_Quarter%2C_Birmingham_6d6d.html" title="Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham">Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham</a>. Yes, there was a large amount of cheap mass produced affordable items for the working classes from buttons to toys but (often using cheap materials but of considerably high quality manufacture) at the same token, fine period examples of such items were also made.</dd>

<dd>Brummagem is a place with a rich history, Brummagem Ware was an insulting snipe at everything that looked cheap and tacky or fake regardless of where it was made, as the article suggests it was actually a sweeping statement and much Birmingham ware was/is of the highest callibre (read the article), the fact that it's negative use seemed to stick is a seperate debate and a seperate issue and YES it is partly founded. There are other meanings of place names that I am sure would not be acceptable for instance: anything Irish is often refered to as back to front or not making sense, is this included on the article about Ireland, and Bristols meaning... etc, I am not suggesting the article be changed and the suggestion of whitewashing is unfounded, the history is still there and the brummagem ware article is on going and quite interesting&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 18:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree also, seperation of positive and negative usages would count as POV forking... I'm not suggesting this though am I, please read my comment above Tearlach. The word Brummagem far pre dates any other meaning of the word positive or negative, any negative assosiation with old Birmingham relates specifically to a selection of the things made in that place and not the town itself and this should be represented in two seperate articles, to suggest all things of Brummagem origin (maybe even the people, this is unclear?) are fake and inferior is laughable, articles such as Gun Quarter, Pen Trade, Jewellery quarter etc shed a little light on this long perpetuated misconception. I do believe that there was a proportion of truth in such claims, however as I have said before the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_a_thousand_trades.html" title="City of a thousand trades">city of a thousand trades</a> made everything imaginable (jokes aside) and from every end of the scale of quality. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 22:48, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Forgive me, I skimmed through the rest of the discussion seeing if I could pick up on any mention of this so far, but as in total it's longer than the actual article (itself very good i must say, I feel I learnt something), it qualifies for a rather large tl;dr...</p>
<p><br />
ANYWAY. Would it be worth, at all, linking some part of the discussion to ... well... West Bromwich? Nearby "town" (ok, part of the Brum-Wolvo-Walsall-etc conurbation) located, as one might expect, somewhat to the (north-)west of the city centre. About as far out as the other major suburbs. The similarity between Bromwich and a number of the other mentioned historical names is far too good to ignore and lends them some weight against the argument that the area was named for the quality of the goods it produces, instead of the more obvious and creditable idea of it being t'other way round.</p>
<p><br />
Or indeed Castle Bromwich, which is roughly to the northeast, closer in and could be considered in the southern shadow of M6 junction 5, if it wasn't at a higher altitude even to the elevated section.</p>
