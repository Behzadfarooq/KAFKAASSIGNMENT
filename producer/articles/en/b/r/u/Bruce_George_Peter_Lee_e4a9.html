<p>The son of a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a>, Lee was brought up in children’s homes and suffered from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital.html" title="Congenital">congenital</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spastic.html" title="Spastic">spastic</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disability.html" title="Disability">disabilities</a> in his right <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limb.html" title="Limb">limbs</a>, which left him with a limp in his right leg and a compulsion to hold his right arm across his chest. As an adult, he worked as a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labourer.html" title="Labourer">labourer</a>. In 1979 he legally changed his name from Peter Dinsdale to Bruce Lee, as a homage to the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">martial arts star of the same name</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_George_Peter_Lee_e4a9.html" title="Edit section: The Hastie fire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Hastie fire</span></h2>
<p>It was only after a fire in Hull on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, killing three young brothers that police began looking for an <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arsonist</a>. They found their man in Lee, but when he started to confess to countless other fatal fires, a whole new chapter opened.</p>
<p>The fire trapped Charles Hastie, 15, and his brothers Paul, 12, and eight year old Peter, as well as their mother, Edith, and another brother, Thomas. All were asleep in the house when the blaze began.</p>
<p>Charles rescued his mother by forcibly pushing her out of an upstairs window, but he could not help his other brothers, two of whom were in the same bedroom as him. Charles consequently suffered almost complete burns and died the next day, while Paul and Peter fought for life in Pinderfields Hospital in <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield.html" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Yorkshire_4693.html" title="West Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>, which housed the nearest specialist burns unit. Peter died two days after the fire while Paul battled for nine days before also succumbing to his burns. Their mother survived, almost certainly because she was thrown out of the window by Charles, while Thomas was rescued with minor injuries from a back bedroom - he slept there with his mother because he suffered from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscular_dystrophy.html" title="Muscular dystrophy">muscular dystrophy</a> - where the flames were less severe. The fire also killed the family dog.</p>
<p>Charles, Paul and Peter also had three sisters - 16-year-old Angeleena, 11-year-old Nicola, and Peter's twin Sophie - who were staying with relatives elsewhere in the area that particular night. Their father was a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> inmate at the time and was consequently granted immediate release on compassionate grounds.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraffin.html" title="Paraffin">paraffin</a> on the floor of the front porch, noticed by fire officers who had extinguished the blaze, police were called in. They set up a makeshift incident room in a local disused church hall and began talking to local people about the fire and the family. They were surprised and shocked by a rather unfussed response from the neighbourhood regarding the brothers, despite the severity of the fire which led to their agonising deaths. The indifference of the neighbourhood came to a climax at the joint funeral for the boys in January 1980 when a grief-stricken Edith Hastie issued an outburst to the gathering crowd over their lack of sympathy for the loss of her sons. The three boys were buried together in one grave at the Northern Cemetery in Hull.</p>
<p>Once the police had established that the Hasties were known as a "problem" family, responsible for petty crime and vendettas, they began looking for an arsonist who may have been seeking a form of revenge. Lee was one of many teenagers who volunteered to be questioned routinely about the fire. Six months after the inquiry began, he confessed in great detail about pouring paraffin through the letterbox and setting it on fire as a revenge mission against Charles Hastie, with whom he had been in a homosexual relationship. Lee said the 15-year-old had threatened to go to the police (as he was a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_%28law%29.html" title="Minor (law)">minor</a>) unless Lee gave him money.</p>
<p><a name="Confessions" id="Confessions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_George_Peter_Lee_e4a9.html" title="Edit section: Confessions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Confessions</span></h2>
<p>During questioning - and to the complete surprise and horror of the police - Lee then went on to confess to starting nine more fatal fires in Hull over the previous seven years. None of the fires was treated with suspicion at the time; <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquest.html" title="Inquest">inquests</a> recorded <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misadventure.html" title="Misadventure">misadventure</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdict.html" title="Verdict">verdicts</a> and arson was never considered. A total of 23 people had died in the blazes, ranging from a six-month-old baby, through a young mother and her three small sons, to 11 elderly men in a residential home. Countless more were burned or suffered smoke inhalation, or received injuries during the act of escaping.</p>
<p>Lee claimed that most of the fires were started at random because he loved fire, and he rarely considered whether he was endangering life when he started them. Only the Hastie fire and two others were at houses owned by people he knew and against whom he bore a grudge.</p>
<p>Investigating officers then proceeded to drive Lee around the city of Hull to the locations he had specified, whereupon Lee then pointed out the buildings in question. Although Lee couldn't be particular with dates or chronology, research later showed that fires had indeed been started at each of the dwellings he had signalled. Lee said that when he heard of many of the deaths he had caused, he sought solace in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> but was not persuaded to stop or confess.</p>
<p>As if to test Lee's story and rule out any prospect of him being merely a well-informed <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_%28psychology%29.html" title="Fantasy (psychology)">fantasist</a>, officers deliberately took him to a dwelling where a high-profile fire had occurred but a criminal conviction had already been secured. Lee immediately ruled out his involvement - he said he'd never been anywhere near the area - and police knew then that he was being truthful about his vast and extraordinary range of fatal blazes.</p>
<p>Despite initially saying he was not sorry for the deaths he caused, as killing wasn't on his mind when he began the majority of the fires, Lee later offered apologies for his actions while awaiting trial.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_George_Peter_Lee_e4a9.html" title="Edit section: Guilty of manslaughter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Guilty of manslaughter</span></h2>
<p>In October 1980, Lee was charged with a total of 26 <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder_in_English_law_fc7c.html" title="Murder in English law">murders</a>, along with alternative offences of manslaughter, as well as eleven counts of arson and two of causing <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grievous_bodily_harm.html" title="Grievous bodily harm">grievous bodily harm</a> (he had admitted in interview to starting a fire in which a young mother and her daughter suffered severe burns but survived.)</p>
<p>At his trial at Leeds Crown Court in January 1981, Lee denied every murder charge but pleaded guilty to 26 counts of manslaughter, as well as the arson attacks. The pleas were accepted. He was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_Health_Act_1983_46bc.html" title="Mental Health Act 1983">Mental Health Act</a>, with the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> stating that Lee was a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopath.html" title="Psychopath">psychopath</a> and a danger to the public.</p>
<p>One person who did not live to see Lee's conviction was Thomas Hastie Snr, father of the three boys whose deaths began the inquiry which led to the end of Lee's spree of fires. He died in a motorcycle accident in July 1980, which also injured daughter Nicola, who was his passenger. Two months later, Edith Hastie gave birth to another son.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_George_Peter_Lee_e4a9.html" title="Edit section: Prolific - but poor publicity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prolific - but poor publicity</span></h2>
<p>Lee was initially taken to Park Lane Special Hospital in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. He was later transferred to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rampton_Secure_Hospital_d563.html" title="Rampton Secure Hospital">Rampton Secure Hospital</a> where he remains to this day. It is not known whether he has been earmarked for release at any time. He became the most prolific killer in the UK yet got next to no national publicity at the time because, firstly, he was convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, and, secondly the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Sutcliffe_9c46.html" title="Peter Sutcliffe">Yorkshire Ripper</a>'s trial, a much more high profile case, was ongoing at precisely the same time. The fact that the Ripper's existence was known throughout his offending time, while Lee committed killings by fire without ever raising suspicion, also affected the contrast between the publicity levels of the two cases. But the fact was that at the moment he finished pleading in court, Lee had admitted killing 26 people; more than the Ripper, the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Neilson_28f0.html" title="Donald Neilson">Black Panther</a> and the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors_Murderers_af8b.html" title="Moors Murderers">Moors Murderers</a> put together.</p>
<p>In 1983, a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_inquiry.html" title="Public inquiry">public inquiry</a> concluded that the fire at the residential home was accidental and that Lee was not responsible for it, nor therefore its consequences of killing eleven men. Senior fire investigation officers backed the inquiry's conclusions. Lee's eleven relevant manslaughter convictions were duly later quashed on the grounds that such contrary evidence made the convictions uneasy. This reduced Lee’s killing record to a total of 15 people, still more than any other British killer of similar time, and he never ceased to claim responsibility for the residential home blaze.</p>
<p>Whenever retrospective articles or documentaries discuss the UK’s worst killers, Lee’s name still never comes up, possibly due to his own youth and mental restrictions; the lack of any murder convictions; and the fact that nobody doubted that most of the fires were started for fire’s sake – i.e., he wouldn’t have cared if most of the dwellings he ignited had been unoccupied. It’s also for this reason that people are reluctant to place Lee in the category of serial killers, in that it was the cause rather than effect which gave him his thrills.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_George_Peter_Lee_e4a9.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>The detective in charge of Lee’s case, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superintendent_%28police%29.html" title="Superintendent (police)">Superintendent</a> Ronald Sagar, later launched a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> action against <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a> after they published articles suggesting Lee’s statements had been not entirely voluntary. The paper later withdrew the allegations and offered an apology, with the case finally <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlement_%28law%29.html" title="Settlement (law)">settling out of court</a> in 1987. Mr. Sagar, now retired and awarded with an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">MBE</a>, publicly stated in his critically-acclaimed book on the case, <i>Hull, Hell &amp; Fire</i>, his hope that Lee will one day be deemed fit and safe enough to be freed. That said, it seems very unlikely that Lee will ever be released.</p>
<p>In 2005, Lee was permitted to marry his fellow Rampton patient Anne-Marie Davison, which caused dismay to his victims' families, who were subsequently assured that while Lee was legally entitled to marry, he and his new wife were not entitled to consummate the marriage.</p>

He was doused down by wet towels fetched by a neighbour but died in hospital eight days later, never able at any point to speak about the incident. No other fire damage beyond the settee and surrounding linoleum was found. There had been unconfirmed reports of clothes drying by the fire and the inquest concluded that these had caught light, but Lee later confirmed that he was friends with the son of the woman in the next flat, and he sneaked in to set fire to his victim because he had struck him two days earlier in a row about the pigeons he kept.</i></dd>

She grabbed both children and took them to a neighbour and waited for the fire brigade, only then remembering the baby upstairs when someone casually asked if anyone else was in the house. She was unable to get back in at this point. The inquest concluded that as the fire had started in the understairs cupboard, the little boy therein must have started it himself with some matches he had secreted away.

Despite this, the fire spread through the first floor and to the second, trapping more residents. Much was made later of work done by a plumber earlier that day which had involved the use of a blowtorch directly below the room where the fire started, although experts said that there were no faults with the plumber's work or tools and the plumber himself vehemently denied any errors on his part.</i></dd>

The man of the house woke his wife, their two daughters and their guest's two sons, all of whom were asleep in the back bedroom, and ushered them into the front room to leave via the window. Two of the children were helped out, but then there was no sign of the others. The little boy, with considerable thoughtfulness, had gone back to try to help the handicapped girl and both had become overcome by the smoke as a consequence. The inquest supposed that the man asleep in the lounge had left a cigarette burning, despite there being little evidence to support this. The little boy was later recommended for a posthumous bravery award.</i></dd>

She came out with her baby son and handed him to the neighbour and then went back inside to fetch the other three, but was trapped and eventually engulfed by the blaze. Her husband escaped from the stairs and the front door.
