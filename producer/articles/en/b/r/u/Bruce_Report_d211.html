	    <p>The <b>Bruce Report</b> is the commonly given name to two reports of the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> Corporation (the former local authority area for the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> city), the <i>First Planning Report</i>, which was published in the closing stages of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> and the <i>Clyde Valley Regional Plan</i>. They were authored by City Engineer Robert Bruce, hence their common name. Contained within the report were a series of initiatives designed to transform the city over the following fifty years, some of which were put into practice, whilst some were not. Its importance to the development of the city can be seen in the fact that the present day <a href="../../../m/8/_/M8_motorway.html" title="M8 motorway">M8 motorway</a> was built out of proposals contained within the report, and that much of the resettlement of the city's population to new towns and new housing schemes came from recommendations it made. The present day city would be entirely different if these initiatives had not been pursued, and would have been different still if the entirety of Bruce's suggestions had been taken up.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Report_d211.html" title="Edit section: City Centre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">City Centre</span></h2>
<p>Central to the report's recommendations were a set of radical proposals to virtually wholesale demolish the city centre and replace it with a set of modern buildings. Earmarked for demolition were many of what are now regarded as some of the most architecurally important buildings which give modern Glasgow much of its character. Included in Bruce's proposals for demolition were the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_School_of_Art_5f2c.html" title="Glasgow School of Art">Glasgow School of Art</a>, designed by the renowned architect <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh_e635.html" title="Charles Rennie Mackintosh">Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a> and the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_City_Chambers_2119.html" title="Glasgow City Chambers">Glasgow City Chambers</a>, the very civic heart of the city. Bruce justified this on the basis of desiring to create a new "healthy and beautiful city" based on modern architecture. Ultimately these proposals were not acted upon and less draconian measures were sought for the city centre.</p>
<p><a name="Rehousing_Glasgow.27s_Slum_Population" id="Rehousing_Glasgow.27s_Slum_Population"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Report_d211.html" title="Edit section: Rehousing Glasgow's Slum Population">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rehousing Glasgow's Slum Population</span></h2>
<p>A proposal that was taken up though was Bruce's suggestion that Glasgow's slum housing be torn down and those who previously lived in it should be rehoused in many new homes on the periphery of the city, on a much less densely populated basis. This involved relocating some 550,000 of the city's population, a massive undertaking. Bruce's recommendation was followed through when from the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> Glasgow's slum clearance programme was instigated and in part achieved by the creation of new housing schemes such as <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castlemilk.html" title="Castlemilk">Castlemilk</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumchapel.html" title="Drumchapel">Drumchapel</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easterhouse.html" title="Easterhouse">Easterhouse</a>, all of which are on the edge of the city. He also recommended the creation of the new towns, such as <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Kilbride_96c1.html" title="East Kilbride">East Kilbride</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbernauld.html" title="Cumbernauld">Cumbernauld</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irvine%2C_Scotland_86af.html" title="Irvine, Scotland">Irvine</a>.</p>
<p>However, Bruce's recommendation for rehousing Glasgow's impoverished slum communities was only partly followed through. He wanted all of Glasgow's citizens to be rehoused within the city boundaries, but those that were moved to the new towns were it was decided to fall outwith the jurasdiction of the Glasgow Corporation. This meant a drastic reduction in the city's population, indicated by the fact that it has declined from its <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> peak of almost 1.1 million to today's population of roughly 0.6 million. This despite the fact that geographically the urban spread of Glasgow is now over a much larger area, although this fact does indicate that Bruce's suggestion of a city less densely populated was taken up.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Report_d211.html" title="Edit section: Transport">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
<p>Bruce's proposals did not just relate to housing though. Glasgow's transport infrastructure was also a target for change.</p>
<p><a name="Roads" id="Roads"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Report_d211.html" title="Edit section: Roads">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roads</span></h3>
<p>Bruce proposed the creation of a system of arterial motorways into the city which would converge into a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Inner_Ring_Road_08dc.html" title="Glasgow Inner Ring Road">Glasgow Inner Ring Road</a>. The motorways that would converge would be a Renfrew Motorway, a Monklands Motorway, a Maryhill Motorway as well as a motorway linking to the Southeast of the city and beyond. The proposals were not acted on for a long time, until the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> when the initiative began. The Monklands and Renfrew Motorways were completed as what is now known as the <a href="../../../m/8/_/M8_motorway.html" title="M8 motorway">M8</a>, creating the northern and western flanks of the ring road. However, the resultant demolition of buildings and carving of a motorway through long standing communities caused such protest that the rest of the Inner Ring Road intitative was shelved.</p>
<p>Currently though the <a href="../../../m/7/4/M74_motorway.html" title="M74 motorway">M74</a> is due for extension into the city centre to meet the M8 motorway, which would see the creation of another part of Bruce's plan, albeit on a marginally different route than that which he proposed. His initial plan called for the utilisation of part of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Green_8593.html" title="Glasgow Green">Glasgow Green</a> for this part of the ring road project. This route has not been used for the proposed M74 extension into Glasgow, and will rather pass through the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorbals.html" title="Gorbals">Gorbals</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/v/Govanhill.html" title="Govanhill">Govanhill</a> areas of the city.</p>
<p>Bruce's report recommended that the Eastern flank of the Inner Ring Road be constructed along the route of Glasgow's High Street. Again this would have necessitated the demolition of many properties, and was shelved. There are signs though that the present day <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Glasgow_37fa.html" title="City of Glasgow">City of Glasgow</a> council are prepared to try and create some form of ring road by the creation of an alternative route for the Eastern flank, known as the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_East_End_Regeneration_Route_306d.html" title="Glasgow East End Regeneration Route">Glasgow East End Regeneration Route</a>, which will be a road not of motorway standard, but which will link the M74 to the M8 through the East End of Glasgow.</p>
<p>There are no signs that the Maryhill Motorway plan will be implemented in any way, leaving Bruce's proposals for a ring road with four arterial routes running off it short of one of these routes.</p>
<p><a name="Rail" id="Rail"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Report_d211.html" title="Edit section: Rail">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rail</span></h3>
<p>As well as recommending changes to Glasgow's road network, Bruce also suggested alterations to Glasgow's railways. At the time of the Bruce Report, the city had four major railway stations, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Central_railway_station_eb4d.html" title="Glasgow Central railway station">Central</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Enoch_railway_station_88a6.html" title="St Enoch railway station">St Enoch</a> both of which mainly served southbound destinations; <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Queen_Street_railway_station_1fd2.html" title="Glasgow Queen Street railway station">Queen Street</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buchanan_Street_railway_station_934e.html" title="Buchanan Street railway station">Buchanan Street</a> both of which mainly served northbound destinations.</p>
<p>Bruce proposed a rationalisation of mainline services. He suggested that all four stations be demolished, and a new <i>Glasgow North</i> station be created roughly on the site of Buchanan Street (albeit it would have been over a larger area than that station) to replace Buchanan Street and Queen Street. As well as that station, a <i>Glasgow South</i> station would be necessary to replace services from Central and St Enoch. This station would have roughly been on the site of Central. Bruce's plan then called for the utilisation of Queen Street's site as a new bus station, with the retention of the low level railway station there for suburban services and to serve the new bus station.</p>
<p>These plans were never acted upon however, and all four stations remained in place until the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> when the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeching_Axe_f2ab.html" title="Beeching Axe">Beeching Axe</a> was imposed on rail services across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. This spelt the end for both Buchanan Street and St Enoch stations (as well as low level services from Central, although they were reintroduced in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>), although the other two stations remain in operation to this day.</p>
