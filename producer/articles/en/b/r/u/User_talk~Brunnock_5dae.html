<p>I understand that you think that you have sourced your statement on the British Empire. We are all familiar with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>.</p>
<p>Please take into consideration that no one but you thinks that your citations are sources for this statement. Let's take a break while you ponder this. Sprotch 11:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. The links you provided to back up your claim of the UK being a "Hyperpower" are outdated. They refer to a time a very long time ago. To me it seems like you have a bias for the statement and links. No one else seems to agree with them and since this is a place for All Users, then you should stop restoring outdates, bias links and statements. The Hyperpower Wiki is not your personal toy.</p>

<p>FYI -- I think you will find the "Age of Discovery" category to be somewhat controversial/POV. On this page, and other pages dealing with native peoples, a percentage of editors consider this period an "Age of Conquest" or "Age of Genocide" or "Age of Colonization". Discovery and exploration don't have an acceptable connotation to them.

<dd>It may be part of that, but only to an outsider. And then only at a push: the Spanish were minor players in what became a papal-supported war for national liberation. Kinsale was the decisive battle of the Nine Years War (1594-1603) which almost bankrupt the Elizabethan state. In Ireland Kinsale was, more importantly, the crucial battle which ended two millenia of Celtic civilisation and ushered in the British conquest of the entire island. That is the importance of it having an entry. As such, its significance for modern Ireland was far greater than was that of the 80 Years War for modern Spain.</dd>

Dear Sean Brunnock,</p>
<p>1. If you, for whatever reason, have any issues with me please could you direct them to me 2. I struggle to see why you are highlight my use of 'whilst' as it is a very common word taht I use appropriately 3. If I wanted to make a fake entry (sockpupperty I think it may be called) I would manage a much better effort than that I have recently read 4. I am not throwing accusations about but I am getting a little suspicious about what the real situation is here</p>

<p>I'm adding events to them that I believe are important events. They appear to me like very incomplete summaries of important events of those centuries.

<dd>I don't think it's a difference of opinion. Venus figurines are not pottery. I have cited 14 references which state that Jomon pottery is the oldest yet found. Those citations can be found at the top of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a>. I don't think there's a single historian or archaeologist in the world that considers Venus figurines to be pottery.

<p>Hello Both, I've just posted a note on my talk page (<a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">Nick</a>) saying that it might be better to discuss this matter on the appropriate mediation page, but seeing that Sean has started the discussions on this page I'm perfectly happy that they should continue here. In response to what Sean has written above, I'd ask you both to look carefully at what I wrote, see the history section of my last edit to the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> article. I chose the words I used very carefully, out of respect for Sean's views and to try and avoid problems like those that arose last year. You will see that I was most careful not to write anything that could possibly be construed as suggesting that the Venus figurines were pottery. In fact the words I used were <i>The earliest ceramic objects found so far are figurines discovered at Dolni Vestonice in modern-day Czechoslovakia.</i> I'm very puzzled that this could be interpreted as meaning that the figurines were <i>pottery</i>. Regards, Nick. <a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">Nick</a> 10:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Both, again, There is evidently a time-difference between us, so to try and speed things up I'll add the following to my response to what Sean wrote above. It is my personal opinion that the Venus figurines might quite reasonably be described as <i>pottery</i> (this view was also shared by most of the contributors to the debate that took place on the Pottery talk page last year). It is Sean's view that the Venus figurines can not be described as <i>pottery</i>, on the grounds that only pots can be pottery and that as a result things called <i>pottery figurines</i> can not exist. I hope that I have represented Sean's views fairly here. It happens that in the academic record there are many references to <i>pottery figurines</i>, a Google search on the term produced many hits; three of the ones from the first two pages are shown below. However, I also believe that what exists between Sean and myself is a difference of opinion and I realised some time ago that this difference was probably irreconcilable. This was why I wrote using the words I did, in an attempt to find a <i>way round</i> the problem. See: <a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17360089" class="external text" title="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17360089" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7316(194501)10%3A3%3C295%3APPFFI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7316(194501)10%3A3%3C295%3APPFFI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-097X(199105%2F08)282%2F283%3C153%3APFTDOA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-097X(199105%2F08)282%2F283%3C153%3APFTDOA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23" rel="nofollow">3</a> Regards, Nick. <a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">Nick</a> 17:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, reading the book excerpts Sean provided at <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a>, they all say that the oldest known pottery was found in Japan. One of sources also says that the oldest ceramics found are the Venus figurines, while not refer to them as pottery. So why do the sources Nick provided all refer to the figurines as "pottery figurines" in the title? I'm a little confused, if pottery is <i>ceramic ware</i> and this figurines are ceramic, why wouldn't they they be considered pottery? Now I dont think I saw Nick's sources say that the figurines are the "earliest known pottery" making me think that Nick made the judgement himself which seems reasonable when his sources refer to the figurines as 'pottery' and are dated older than the Japanese findings. Still, if archaelogists understand that this figurines are pottery why would they say that the earliest pottery is the one found in Japan? From my understanding Saun sourc only see ceramic vessels and pots as pottery. So why don't all official sources refer to pottery as just that? Such as my dictionary. Can you guys expand on this issue? — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 22:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Is that a term that doesn't yet have an article Pottery figurines? I'll still wait for Nick to expand on his position more but based from the information provided so far I'm beginning to agree that <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> isn't the place to mention this Venus figurines as being the "first instances of pottery", probably better off mentioned on the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramics.html" title="Ceramics">ceramics</a> article as "oldest know ceremic figurines". — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 00:37, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, indeed quite a complicated situation. I can't help but wonder why your alone in this dispute. You said you didn't want to get into an edit war, but seems this case was started by a revert. Was this the last straw and you had to do something? Have users tried to enter the information about the figurines before or is this basically the first time?

<dd>I first became aware that Venus figurines were in the Pottery article during February of last year. An editor changed the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_invention.html" title="Timeline of invention">Timeline of invention</a> and used the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> article as the source of his information.

<dd>In March, I rewrote the History section of the pottery article with proper citations. To date, it's the only part of the pottery article that has any citations (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pottery&amp;diff=45403986&amp;oldid=44955642" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pottery&amp;diff=45403986&amp;oldid=44955642" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>).

I thought that after I posted 12 citations pointing out that Jomon pottery is the oldest then that would be the end of that dispute, but the debate continues. Some editors may have nationalistic or racist reasons for wanting to "prove" that Europeans and not Japanese invented pottery. This is not an isolated situation. I've run into a very similar debate on <a href="../../../r/o/c/Talk%7ERocket_344f.html" title="Talk:Rocket">Talk:Rocket</a> with editors who have changed the definition of rockets in order to prove that Europeans and not Chinese invented rockets. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 11:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Both, First off, I agree very strongly that the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> article is not the place to say that the Venus figurines are the first instances of pottery and in my last edit of the article you will see that I described them as being the <i>earliest known ceramic objects</i>. I think that Sean might not object to this description of them. Sean?</p>
<p>Sean wrote the words that follow (they are still in the article as it presently stands): <i>Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery</i>. This makes Sean's position clear; he holds the honest opinion that the statement he made is correct and I respect this, even though I do not agree with him. Sean's statement suggests that there is a universally-accepted definition of the term <i>pottery</i> that excludes figurines, which I do not believe is the case. At the risk of boring everyone to death, let me re-state what I think should happen. Since Sean and I are never going to agree on a definition of the term <i>pottery</i>, let us then re-write the history section of the article to avoid the problem. This is what I was trying to do in my last edit of the article. Alternatively, it might be possible for the article to reflect both of the opposing views, though I think that finding any sort of agreement on the wording to be used would be difficult.</p>
<p>The reason I think the section in question is due for a re-write is largely explained above. I think that Sean's statement, quoted above, must not be allowed to stand unchallenged. I know that Sean believes it to be correct, but there are other opinions on the matter and I think it is only fair that these should be represented too. Or, as I have suggested, the section should be re-written in a neutral tone that bypasses the problem. Regards, Nick. <a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">Nick</a> 11:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I guess it all comes down to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If pottery is defined only as "ceramic vessels and pots" then mentioning Venus figurines in the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> article might not make too much sense. I hope Nick, for the sake of his arguement, can provide sources indicating pottery has a much broader definition. I'm sure there are plenty of books and journals on pottery (specifically) if anyone bothers to search for them. I'm also sure most mention archaelogical findings (history) of pottery and when they date back to. If this books mention Venus figurines than I see no harm in mentioning them at <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a>. If they do not, then why mention them when the books don't? Now when I say books/journals I'm not talking about ones that are topic specific such as "Ancient japanese pottery" or "Venus figurines", I'm talking about the broad "Pottery <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">for Dummies</a>" type if you will, something on the overall subject. Ones both of you (if not already) are aware of how this books describe the "history of pottery" then I think it be quite easy to see who was right or wrong in this dispute. — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 16:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Materials scientists do define pottery differently from archaeologists. Materials scientists define pottery as anything made from fired clay. This is a relatively recent redefinition. I don't think that this definition should be applied to the history of pottery. When it comes to the history and archaeology of pottery, I think that the tradition definition should be used.

Currently, there's a note attached to the Pottery article which states that archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels with links to some archaeology related websites which verify this. If Nick will agree to stop deleting that note, then I don't care what he does with the rest of the article. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 18:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There's already note in the pottery article to that effect. That should suffice. Materials scientists define pottery as anything made of fired clay. Great, but that has nothing to do with ancient pottery. If Nick or another editor starts claiming that materials scientists classify Venus figurines as pottery (which is not documented anywhere as far as I know), then that gives the racists and revisionist historians an excuse to claim that Europeans and not Japanese invented pottery.</dd>
<dd>I think that Nick should acquaint himself with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. So far, none of his edits contain any citations. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 23:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I definetely agree that <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing sources</a> is the most important step in solving a content dispute. I asked my last question because I though your previous response sounded a little strange - <i>If Nick will agree to stop deleting that note, then I don't care what he does with the rest of the article.</i>. Getting back to the problem, You have said that "material scientists" claim a different position. I don't think it would adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> if we excluded a group of people. So we can try to split the article or another solution (probably better) is to clearly tell the reader all this things you have already told me: Who defines pottery as what.

<p>I think that these discussions are becoming unduly complicated. For me, the problem is Sean's statement that <i>Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery.</i> This is a very strong statement that in my view presents a personal opinion as fact. It is also written in a far from neutral voice.</p>
<p>If you search the scholarly literature (Google -&gt; More -&gt; Scholar) the term <i>pottery figurines</i> brings up twenty-two pages of hits and many of the articles found are written at least in part by archaeologists. Under Sean's definition of the term <i>pottery</i> the <i>pottery figurines</i> that are the subject of these papers do not exist; but they <i>do</i> exist and I don't see the point of trying to deny this.</p>
<p>It would be possible to write something like the following: <i>The term pottery lacks a universally agreed definition. On the one hand the term is sometimes taken to exclude all wares except for vessels, but on the other hand it is sometimes taken in a broader sense to include such things as, for example, figurines, statuettes and tiles.</i> But I don't think this would be the best way to handle the problem.

<dd>You misunderstood my earlier suggestion, so I will try to confirm these:
<ul>
<li>I support the inclusion of the Jomon finds. I think Nick does as well. This is in agreement with you so I do not think you need to be confrontational.</li>
<li>I did not write "Venus figurines are considered pottery" I wrote “Information about the differences of opinion on if <b>figurines</b> are pottery or not “ This does not mention the Venus figures</li>
<li>Nick has recently been editing the whole of the pottery article. He did include some new parts, and I did not agree with them all. But with his additions and minor edits by myself the article was improved. Allowing him to carry on (I think Wikipedia advises somewhere writers to be bold) could help the article to carry on improving. I do not know him, but in my recent exchanges with him he seems to value input.</li>
<li>The article needs to be neutral. This is why it should the different useages of term Pottery should be included. I am sure these could be cited. How about letting him, and others, try to improve the article. I am sure everyone accepts that citations must be included.</li>

<p>Hello Sean, what is your final sticking-point on this matter? May I take it that you will accept no compromise on the wording that you used <i>("Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery")</i> that in any way leaves open the possibility that other views might exist? If this is the case, then, as I wrote above, perhaps it is now time for us to call on our mediator to give his views on whether or not the statement should remain in its present form.

<p>Hello Sean, you ask me to cite my sources and cite other points of view, so perhaps we are getting somewhere at last. I wish to see the article cover the figurines from Dolni Vestonice, in no great detail and without referring to them as <i>pottery</i>, because I think that the people who use Wikipedia would expect to find them mentioned in an article on pottery. Most of our readers will not, I think, make the fine distinction between pottery and other ceramic materials that you do. I note, incidentally that you have deleted all reference to the figurines in the article as it stands, except for the note containing the statement about figurines not being pottery. Now if you are happy that I should re-write the part of the article dealing with the figurines in a neutral voice, putting forward an alternate view and citing a reference for it, would you find this acceptable? The reference I have in mind is a paper by Stephen Chrisomalis of the Department of Anthropology at McGill University. I quote it here: <i>In the case of pottery, Childe argues, "A moulded lump might easily have fallen into the fire and been baked hard. Apparently an intelligent mammoth-hunter at Dolni Vestonice (Moravia) noted the result of such an accident and repeated it deliberately" (Childe 1963 [1953]: 48). What is more amazing is that Dolni Vestonice is an Upper Paleolithic site, where pottery appears to have existed millennia before its rediscovery in Jomon period Japan and elsewhere.</i> The book of Childe's to which he refers is <i>Childe, V.Gordon. 1963 [1953].

<p>I am not an authority on all matters, in fact this isn't my area of expertise (big suprise there). As a mediator I tried to get both of you to come to an agreement, that failed and you seek for me to take a side. To be honest, it's very hard for me to take a side on this matter. I agree very much what Sean is saying it terms of citing sources, this is the most important aspect in solving this dispute. The problem is it seems both of you have at least some sources that back up your view. I would like to advise Nick, not to remove or modify information but discuss your changes first. Sean, from what you have told be there appears to be a <i>recent</i> group you call "material scientists" who have their own definition of pottery. It would be wrong agains't <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to exclude their definition. Both of you should respect each others views, if "pots and vessels" is the standard historic archealogical definition, well let the article state that. Also I would advise both of you stop making accusations at each other that the other has a secret agenda, that leads no where. Since you Nick strive to include more information to the article, clearly present your case while sourcing it. Something in the sense of <i>"I would to include information A because source A says this to be true"</i>. Anyone has to be clearly in denial in order to reject clearly presented information. I think there was a lack of that before. When someone opposes your view and going ahead and including it is just provocation rather than a resolution. We are not here to present the <i>truth</i> (per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), if Venus Figurines are indeed pottery, this will definetely be stated somewhere. If it's stated no where, it's just an opinion and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Myself, I can't tell you if Venus Figurines are pottery or not but books and journals can. — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 01:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">User:N.Hopton</a> STATEMENT OF POSITION</b></p>
<p>These discussions have become very confusing so I would like to present a summary of my present position on the issues in question. Sean might care to do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Firstly,</b> from what Sean has written above it is clear that his main interest in the Pottery article is to ensure that it presents the strong, clear and unchallenged view that the ceramic vessels of the <a href="../../../j/o/m/Jomon.html" title="Jomon">Jomon</a> period are the world's earliest pottery. This is because he is using the article as a weapon in a war of words that he is waging elsewhere. He believes that any edits to the article that represent views different from his own will undermine his position in this war and he deletes them. I do not believe it is proper that the content of Wikipeda articles should be determined by such considerations.</p>
<p><b>Secondly,</b> to defend his view that the vessels of the Jomon period are <i>without question</i> the world's oldest, Sean has deleted from the article any reference to a group of twenty-five thousand year old ceramic figurines found in the Czech Republic (one of these figurines is the so-called “Venus of Dolni Vestonice”) beyond a footnote baldly stating that <i>“Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery”</i>. I believe that this statement is not written in the neutral tone required and is opinionated. The statement is also oddly phrased, taking the first part <i>“Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels”</i> one would expect it to continue <i>“earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered by archaeologists to be pottery”</i>. As written, the statement uses a trick to carry the reader from the specific to the general.</p>
<p><b>Thirdly,</b> I argue strongly for the inclusion of the figurines found at Dolni Vestonice in the Pottery article, on the grounds that they are considered by some authorities to be pottery (see the Chrisomalis reference quoted above) and that even if they are not pottery they are regarded by some authorities as being <i>precursors to pottery</i> (I have references for this too). My personal view is that the figurines might with some degree of justice be described as pottery, but of course this depends on how the the term <i>pottery</i> is defined.</p>
<p><b>Fourthly,</b> so far as I remember, I have never referred to the figurines as <i>pottery</i>, I have only ever used terms like <i>ceramic objects</i> and, in fact, it is of no personal interest to me whether or not the figurines are called <i>ceramic objects,</i> or <i>pottery</i> or <i>precursors to pottery</i>. However, I do insist that the article should be balanced and present the whole picture, and that very strong statements to the effect that the earliest pottery wares are those of the Jomon period and that the Czech figurines are not pottery have no place in the article.</p>
<p><b>Fifthly,</b> Sean and others have rightly taken me to task for being lax about providing references. As it happens, a lot of the work that I have been doing on the Pottery article has been editing other peoples' efforts and trying to improve its structure. It is a fact, I'm afraid, that most of the original editors have not provided references for much of what they wrote and I am reluctant to try and supply these. I also have problems sometimes in knowing when a reference is required but I will look up the policy on this and do my best to comply with it in future.</p>
<p><b>Sixthly,</b> in the discussion above Sean has said <i>Nick, you have to cite your sources. Cite the other points of view. At the same time, don't delete citations that you don't agree with</i>. Well now, what I deleted was the contentious statement that <i>“Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery”</i>, sorry to quote it again. This statement was not where it should have been, in the body of the article, but in a footnote. When I deleted it, the citations went too, which was not perhaps the most diplomatic thing to do. Taking encouragement from Sean's words <i>(Cite the other points of view)</i> what I propose to do in the next few days is to start editing the history section of the article, doing just this.</p>
<p><b>Finally,</b> I'd like to thank our mediator Tutmosis for his participation in this exercise, I'm sure it's never an easy job.</p>

<dd>I would like to adress your point about where you quote Sean as saying: <i>“Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels ... earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery”</i>. If you agree with that statement then there is no point in putting the Venus Figurines into this article, since they are not <i>vessels</i>. if the statement is false and you can cite proof, then it's another story. — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 20:29, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Nick, I looked at that Chrisomalis paper you mentioned. It was paper he wrote as a first-year grad student. It was never published. He simply posted it to his personal website. You need to cite a more reliable source. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 21:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Taking Tutmosis's question first, I think if you look back over our discussions, in particular at the second point in my position statement above, it will be evident that I do not agree with Sean's statement. I will rehearse my reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The statement is opinionated, contentious, lacks a neutral point of view and was written to serve a purpose in a war about who made the earliest pottery.</p>
<p>(2) The statement is misleading, it refers only to how archaeologists define the term <i>pottery</i> and is intended to create the impression that <i>all</i> archaeologists define the term in this way, without providing references to support this claim.</p>
<p>(3) The statement uses a trick to lead the reader from the specific <i>Since archaeologists define pottery as ceramic vessels</i>, to the general, <i>earlier examples of ceramics such as the Venus of Dolni Vestonice are not considered pottery</i>. In other words, just because because archaeologists might use a term in a certain way, that usage is the general one. Even if we accept the doubtful notion that <i>all</i> archaeologists are united on a common definition of the term <i>pottery</i> who is to say that the definitions provided by, say, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicographers.html" title="Lexicographers">lexicographers</a> are wrong? A collection of dictionary definitions of the term has recently been posted by <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeapotgeorge_498b.html" title="User:Teapotgeorge">User:Teapotgeorge</a> on the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a> page and I commend this to you; it demonstrates beyond question that there is no unanimity on definitions of the term <i>pottery</i>.

<p>Regarding Sean's comments on the paper by Chrisomalis, I have to say that I think he's clutching at straws here. I found this paper by doing a search on the <i>Google Scholar</i> search engine. It was originally a document in PDF format on a site that has now disappeared (this eventuality is covered in <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReferences_0313.html" title="Wikipedia:References">Wikipedia:References</a>) but that was converted to HTML by Google and cached by them. I think it odd that Sean should take issue with the paper on the grounds that it was written by a first-year grad student. Correct me if I am wrong, but I take it that a <i>first-year grad student</i> is someone with a first degree who is working for a doctorate. Why should a scholarly paper written by a such a student be judged by Sean to be unreliable? Only because it says something he doesn't like the look of, I think. The document was, of course, published. How on earth could I have found it had it not been? Discussions with Sean are always a joy, we are now set for a torrent of words on definitions of the term <i>published</i>, round and round we go. Regards, Nick. <a href="../../../n/2E/h/User%7EN.Hopton_e227.html" title="User:N.Hopton">Nick</a> 13:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nick, I have cited 12 verifiable and reliable references which state that Jomon pottery is the oldest yet found. That was over 10 months ago. I think this debate has gone on too long. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 13:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Sean, Chrisomalis wrote this paper and <i>published</i> it on a web site. How else would you describe the action of putting a scholarly paper on a web site? One thing we do agree on is that the debate has gone on for too long, this mediation process has evidently broken down, so now we must be thinking about the next stage. I hope that our mediator <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> will express an opinion on whether or not he considers that further progress is possible here. If further progress is not, in his opinion, possible, perhaps he would tell us where we go from here. I think we are probably beyond mediation and must now be thinking in terms of arbitration.

<dd>Well I did provide my long opinion above. My primary suggestion to progress forward is for you both to speak more to each other. As of now both of you seem quite uncommunicative. If you Nick want to include a mention of Venus figurines into the article then please cite sources. The situation about the definition of pottery is also something both you seem to be avoiding. Per recent discussion at <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a> if archaelogical definition is "pots and vessels" while the more general one is "ceramic ware" then you should discuss how to rewrite the article to satisfy both views. — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 18:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Tutmosis. I have been reading the debate, and adding the occasional comment. I have also received personal abuse so I know this is a sensitive subject. I would like to suggest that there are two separate sections:
<ul>
<li>Definition of pottery. There are differences across fields of study. Sean has acknowledged this (archaeologists and Materials scientists). I can see no reason why an article on Pottery should be exclusive to a single field, and exclude all others. There have been many sources cited already for the different definitions. These could be rationalised into a short summary, which acknowledges the different useages.</li>
<li>Inclusion of the Venus figurines seems to be more sensitive. Sean appears to object to any mention of them. Nick appears to favour some form of inclusion. I see that Sean has recently criticised a citation that describes Venus figures as being pottery. To me it seems a good citation but could you, Tutmosis, advise on this?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> it is an excellent one.

<dd>Hi Sean. Well I am getting confused. There is debate here and over at the Pottery talk pages but I did find this from Tutmosis <i>Sean, from what you have told be there appears to be a</i> recent <i>group you call "material scientists" who have their own definition of pottery. It would be wrong agains't <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to exclude their definition.</i>Thanx<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheriac_f82b.html" title="User:Theriac">Theriac</a> 20:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So there you are <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a>, you suggested that we should re-write the article to reflect both views and Sean has rejected your suggestion, maintaining that his <i>archaeological definition</i> should be used. By this he means that <i>only</i> his archaeological definition should be used, unless I misunderstand him. Sean might care to clarify this point. In reply to Sean, I'd say that if you insist that <i>only</i> your <i>archaeological definition</i> should be used, then it is unlikely that further mediation will be of much use.

<dd>I think Nick is overreacting. WBardwin rewrote the definition of pottery citing the ASTM. This is the material scientists' definition of pottery. The current definition does not mention the archaeologists' definition. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> 20:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see an ASTM standard listed in the references but it doesn't appear to be cited anywhere. I'm not sure that it was <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">User:WBardwin</a> who tried to define pottery in terms of ASTMs, he's a potter I believe. Anyway, I'm not sure what this has to do with anything.</p>
<p>Above, I wrote "Sean has rejected your suggestion, maintaining that his <i>archaeological definition</i> should be used. By this he means that <i>only</i> his archaeological definition should be used, unless I misunderstand him. Sean might care to clarify this point". Would you care to clarify this point, Sean?

<p>I said both definition should be stated since both of you or at least Sean acknowledge there are 2 definitions: archaeological and "material". The article, from what I understand is already written from the "any ceramic material" perspective. So maybe adding a mention that for a long time it was only know as "ceramic pots and vessels" before the definition was expanded by "material scientists" to include anything ceramic (all per what Saun told me). Regarding the Venus figurines, it all depends if archaeologists or who ever is involved in studying them classify them as "pottery". If they do then it would be reasonable to clearly state something like <i>"The first ceramic object were the Venus figurines while the first ceramic pots and vessels were found in Japan."</i> I haven't closed the mediation and wasn't planning on, I'm waiting for both sides to settle their differences. I'll be following the dispute until then. — <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a> 00:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a>, regarding your suggested wording <i>"The first ceramic object[s] were the Venus figurines while the first ceramic pots and vessels were found in Japan."</i> yes, yes and yes again! But you have to understand that Sean will <i>never</i> accept any such statement in the article. Regards, Nick.</p>
<p>I have just posted a call for opinions on the matters being discussed here, on the Pottery talk page <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a> in the hope that this might help us to make some progress.

<p>Hello Nick, Sean, Teapotgeorge, Tutmosis.</p>
<p>I have been reading through the talk pages here and over at Pottery (and there is a lot!). But there is also much good stuff. I have picked some citations out from the pages, and some from books. I am not claiming this to be my own. I have tried to make a summary but which covers both sides. I suggest this as the start of the whole article:</p>
<p><b>Pottery</b> is (1) the ware made by potters; (2) a ceramic material, (3) a place where pottery wares are made; (4) the business of the potter</p>
<p>More specific definitions lack universal agreement, with some writers advising “it can have various meanings and so has been avoided whenever possible [1]” Published definitions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"All fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products." [2]</li>
<li>"China, earthenware and any article made from clay or from a mixture containing clay and other materials" [3]</li>
<li>"A class of ceramic artefacts in which clay is formed into containers by hand or in molds or with a potter's wheel, often decorated, and fired"[4]</li>
<li>"The term pottery includes many varieties of ware from the crudest vessels of prehistoric times to the most beautiful decorated porcelains, stoneware and earthenware; it also includes many articles such as large grain-jars used in ancient times for storing corn and other dry materials, wine-jars and modern sanitaryware and the large tanks for containing corrosive acids. Many kinds of earthenware, stoneware and porcelains are used for scientific and experimental purposes as well as electrical apparatus (insulators, switch-bases, sparking plugs and bases or frames for electrical heating appliances)" [5]</li>

<p>Thanks for this very helpful posting <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheriac_f82b.html" title="User:Theriac">Theriac</a>. It helps to make clear the fact that the term <i>pottery</i> can have a narrow meaning and also broader ones. As you know, I contend that the broader meaning should also be represented in the article. I also believe that this was the view of everyone who contributed to the great debate held on the Pottery talk page last year, except for Sean.

<p>I doubt your removal of pottery discovered in China 10,000 BCE ago,if you read carefully the reference,there are more ancient pottery excavated in China than Japan in 10,500 BC.There's no conclusion the the techniques of pottery spreading from Japan to other parts of Asia.So donn't try to make the conclusion.--<a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsyrie_4e02.html" title="User:Ksyrie">Ksyrie</a> 07:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
