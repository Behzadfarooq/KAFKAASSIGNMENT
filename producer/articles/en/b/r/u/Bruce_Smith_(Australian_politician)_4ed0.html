<p><b>Bruce Arthur Smith</b> <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Counsel_71f6.html" title="King's Counsel">KC</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">28 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> - <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">14 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>) was a long serving <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Australia_b3a4.html" title="Politics of Australia">politician</a> and leading political opponent of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_policy_64ef.html" title="White Australia policy">White Australia policy</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotherhithe.html" title="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, Smith was the fifth of seven sons of wealthy ship owner William Howard Smith and his second wife Agnes. The family immigrated to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1854 where Smith was educated at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_College%2C_Melbourne_d7f7.html" title="Wesley College, Melbourne">Wesley College</a> and studied law at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Melbourne_c667.html" title="University of Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> before leaving for England where he was called to the Bar in 1877.</p>
<p>Returning to Melbourne the next year, Smith was admitted to the Victorian Bar and on 15 January 1879, married Sara Jane Creswell, who bore him four sons and three daughters. Developing an interest in politics, Smith unsuccessfully stood for the Victorian electoral district of Emerald Hill in February 1880, before moving to <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1881, where he won a Legislative Assembly by-election for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Gundagai_81f1.html" title="Electoral district of Gundagai">Gundagai</a> in 1882.</p>
<p>Resigning from parliament in April 1884, Smith returned to Melbourne to run his father's business, Wm Howard Smith and Sons Ltd. In March 1885 Smith founded the Victorian Employers' Union, serving as its inaugural president until 1887, and the Victorian Board of Conciliation. Union leaders favourably commented upon his willingness to work with unions to achieve consensus, an attitude missing in fellow employers.</p>
<p>In 1887, Smith published <i>Liberty and Liberalism</i>, a defence of classical <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> liberalism in politics and economics and an attack against what he considered the increasing interference by the state. Additionally, Smith later wrote books on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Australia_c872.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a>, the dangers of socialism and a volume of verse.</p>
<p>After an argument with his father in December 1887, Smith sold all his shares in Howard Smith to his brother Edmund and resigned from the board. Disinherited by his father, Smith returned to Sydney to continue his career as a barrister and founded the New South Wales Employers' Union.</p>
<p>Elected as the member for Glebe in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in February 1889, Smith was almost immediately promoted by <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_New_South_Wales_283b.html" title="Premier of New South Wales">Premier</a> <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Parkes_48e2.html" title="Henry Parkes">Henry Parkes</a> to Secretary for Public Works, and later, Treasurer. Smith proved to be a hard working minister but abrasive figure, frequently clashing with Parkes and accused of threatening to "shoot down" striking maritime workers "like bloody dogs". He did not seek re-election at the 1894 election.</p>
<p>In 1898 Smith unsuccessfully contested Glebe for the National Federal Party and served as a member of the party's Federal Executive finance committee and as editor of their newspaper <i>United Australia</i> from 1900 to 1902.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Australia_75d3.html" title="Federation of Australia">Federation of Australia</a> on 1 January 1901, Smith successfully contested the newly created federal <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Parkes_%281901-69%29_714a.html" title="Division of Parkes (1901-69)">Division of Parkes</a> at the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_1901.html" title="Australian legislative election, 1901">inaugural Australian federal election</a> as a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Trade_Party_021b.html" title="Free Trade Party">Free Trade Party</a> representative. He campaigned strongly against the idea of restricting non-white immigration, believing it to be racial discrimination; in doing so Smith was the only candidate to completely oppose what would become the White Australia Policy (<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Fisher_3176.html" title="Andrew Fisher">Andrew Fisher</a> argued that any <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanakas.html" title="Kanakas">Kanaka</a> who had converted to Christianity and married should be allowed to remain in Australia).</p>
<p>In parliament, Smith often clashed with his Free Trade colleagues, particularly party leader <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Reid_%28Australian_politician%29_7707.html" title="George Reid (Australian politician)">George Reid</a>, over his refusal to toe the party line. While considered one of the most conservative members of parliament for his opposition to tariffs, social welfare provisions and "meddling legislation", Smith was a strong supporter of the women's movement and was known as parliament's preeminent political economist and one of its finest debaters.</p>
<p>While a member of parliament, Smith continued to act as a barrister and was made a King's Counsel in 1904. Additionally, he served on numerous commercial boards, including as a director of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd, and held senior positions with community organisations such as New South Wales president of the British Empire League in Australia and state president of the Association for the Protection of Native Races.</p>
<p>Smith retired from politics at the 1919 election, having spent almost all his period in federal parliament in opposition. He was offered the role of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives_60a1.html" title="Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives">Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives</a> twice but declined in order to concentrate on other matters.</p>
<p>Physically, the urbane Smith was a distinctive looking man; tall, stout, double-chinned and the owner of a fine example of a waxed <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">moustache</a>.</p>
<p>In 1925 he retired to <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowral%2C_New_South_Wales_fe2e.html" title="Bowral, New South Wales">Bowral, New South Wales</a>, where he died in 1937. Survived by two daughters and a son, Smith was buried beside his wife in the Bowral Church of England cemetery.</p>
<p>Smith was considered an anachronism by the end of his political career but his stature has been revived in recent years, thanks in part to the recent republishing of <i>Liberty and Liberalism</i>. Prominent historian <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Windschuttle_618e.html" title="Keith Windschuttle">Keith Windschuttle</a> refers to Smith as "one of the outstanding intellectuals of Australian history", adding "were anyone to write a proper history of ideas in Australia, Smith should figure prominently."</p>
