<p>So...what specifically needs to be worked on? ~~ Shiri 18:13, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Expand the lead section, fact check and maybe add inline references, more sound samples, maybe move discography to its own page, general copy-edit, move trivia into article proper, add a references section and add more images, if possible. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 20:11, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of that's done, except that image without a source needs to be replaced. How do you go about getting sound samples, praytell? ~~ Shiri 01:28, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I made a few tweaks, removing one paragraph (see below). I do highly recommend inline references. There are some claims that will probably be objected to if this article is nominated for featured-status, like <i>His eloquence in expressing Everyman's problems has earned him a huge fan base within America's middle class</i> (I've removed "within America's middle class" since it isn't sourced and seems out-of-place amid claims that he appealed to the working ma, but even without that, the sentence should be changed to direct quote (cited) from someone prominent). Moving the discography to its own page is great, but generally you're supposed to leave a summary behind. For that section, I think just a list of his studio albums and the years they were released would be good, leaving all the details to the other page. The "current members of the E-Street Band" section is a list and should probably be expanded to include former members as well (with the dates of their tenure) A couple sentences on the E-Street Band would also be good in that section (explaining who has remained constant, who has played with the band the longest, that kind of thing). Sound samples have to be uploaded (see <a href="../../../s/o/u/Wikipedia%7ESound_2435.html" title="Wikipedia:Sound">Wikipedia:Sound</a>). If you have an mp3 of a song, it's easy and there is free software available to convert the file to <a href="../../../o/g/g/Ogg_vorbis.html" title="Ogg vorbis">ogg vorbis</a> and clip a 20sec-or-so section that can be uploaded under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. I've got a number of springsteen mp3s and can upload some in the next day or two, if you can't/don't want to do that -- it's not hard to do though. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 06:20, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed the following because it should really be sourced. It implies that Republican fans were offended by his partisanship and claims that many of them forgave him (but presumably some still harbor a grudge. It also claims to know the reasons the fans forgave him and then makes an absurd claim (there are numerous modern performers whose music is "widely relevant", the important distinction being that Springsteen is do damn popular). I have no problem with going into more detail on Springsteen's recent political activity, but we shouldn't be presuming the motivations for people's behaviors and such without citing sources. <i>Despite his overt partisanship, however, Springsteen was forgiven by many of his <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> fans, many of whom said they found Springsteen's passion for America and personal struggle consistent with their own ideology.

<dd>I agree the removed paragraph was no good. I've added a paragraph that says the impact of this political involvement remains to be seen, which I think is true. If you read, say, rec.music.artists.springsteen you'll see that a lot of people were turned off by the VFC business ... but they may come back anyway assuming the new album and tour are apolitical. I've also tried to indicate that Springsteen's audience has become more homogenuous and affluent over the years.</dd>

<dd>Ugh, this is a total mess.

<p>&gt;The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. &gt;Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, not only due to some sexually explicit &gt;content, but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics.</p>
<p>Is this actually true? I know that Starbucks said it was about the Mature Audiences warning, and it wouldn't surprise me if politics played in...but has any credible source, either from Springsteen/Columbia/Sony or any commentator other than the people who made this entry, claimed that liberal or anticorporate politics played into it?</p>
<p>Yes because he made a reference to it in Cleveland '05. Also Bruce is also very against "selling out", he roasted U2 at their Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Nomination for the special U2 iPod.</p>

<p>&gt;Whether Springsteen's stance causes a reduction in his fan base (now an older, more affluent demographic) remains to be seen as of 2005.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, last night at the Springsteen concert in Boston, John Kerry was in the audience with his wife. He arrived about 10 minutes before Bruce came onstage and received a standing ovation from the crowd, while a small handful of people (5-10) booed. Granted, Boston is Kerry's home base, but audience reaction was overwhelmingly in favor of him. Acarvin 15:34 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Doesn't mean much. Boston has always been a Bruce strongpoint. But Bruce has apparently had trouble selling D&amp;D tour tickets in other parts of the country ... fallout from the Kerry support? lack of interest in a gloomy solo show? overexposure after two recent high-profile band tours? Hard to know, probably all of the above. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 16:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The teleprompter reference is relevant, because it limits his facial interaction with the audience – he's always looking down at the stage when he sings now, with a semi-closed-eyes face so as not to make it too obvious. It also somewhat limits his ability to improvise ... he can't do something that the teleprompter operator isn't ready for. As for when he started using it, I took notes during multiple shows on both T of L Express and Other Band, and it was definitely the latter. Many fans noticed it on the Other Band tour, especially those seated to the side or in back of the stage. It was also discussed on the "Bruce Party Line", the telephone-based precursor to Bruce internet groups. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 19:17, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought it was reported that the resolution was killed in committee when Republican members (who made up the committee's majority) refused to vote for passage. Granted, no official reason was reported to the press, but the bipartisan vote is rather glaring. (It echoes a similar move in the GOP controlled Texas state legislature regarding Willie Nelson; the Republican members there were more vocal and unambiguous about their reasons for turning down Willie, who was seen as a Democratic supporter.)</p>

<p>Should there be an entire section on the touring phenomena. There are references of course, but so much of Bruce Springsteen's identity as an artist is tied to the live experience, it likely requires a section of its own. Likewise, I think the article (which is very very good) would be improved with information on how bootlegs helped build his reputation/career in the early days, evidence of Bruce's seemingly contradictory approaches to bootleggers, etc. I'm not prepared at this time to work on these passages, but suggest they would be good next steps to making an outstanding article even better.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be interested in helping out; there's a fair amount of material re Bruce's cases in the Fourth Circuit (I think it was the fourth) in the '70's, interesting stuff.

<dd>I've toyed with the idea of treating concerts as a separate section. The trouble is that doing so breaks the chronological connection with the rest of the article, e.g. in the 1990s section you'd read about the <i>Ghost of Tom Joad</i> album, but in the new section you'd read about the solo tour that followed it and the material that was played and "STFU" and whatnot. Since the sensibility of the album and tour were closely linked, splitting them apart might cause the thread of his career to be lost. As another approach, a very few artists known for their stage spectaculars have separate articles on each of their tours — see <a href="../../../m/a/d/Template%7EMadonna_ebd4.html" title="Template:Madonna">Template:Madonna</a> and <a href="../../../u/2/_/Template%7EU2_9816.html" title="Template:U2">Template:U2</a> for the best examples — but doing that seems like overkill for Bruce. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 20:40, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Interesting point about the chronological structure of the article and how a separate section on touring might break the structure. Perhaps it should be a few notes on each tour...there might also be merit in including tour info from the fan perspective, for example, the long lines for tickets in the 70's, the move to larger venues, the man in black, the pit, jailbaits, holding the line on ticket prices vs. how Bruce's peers charge their fans, etc, etc...its all part of the experience in so many ways. Anyway, maybe if I keep typing ideas here and reading other thoughts I might take a first stab at this, and may enlist a writer friend who is also a rather active fan.

<p>Bruce Springsteen is not only one the truely great artists of rock music but also one of the best bootlegged artists of all time. Through the many high quality live shows you can trace his development as a great stage performer and see how he developed songs, chopping and changing them, before they appeared on official releases. There really should be a link to Brucelegs. [20:44, 31 August 2006 TonkaTom]</p>

<dd>Springsteen is probably best known for the multi-million selling Born in the U.S.A.(1984), and the massively successful world tour that followed it. The title track was a tribute to Springsteen's buddies that had experienced the Vietnam War, some of whom did not come back. The song was widely mis-interpreted on release as nationalistic, with the co-opting by the major party candidates for president being the foremost example. (The campaigns obliged, but the song was already linked with Reagan, especially, in the minds of many. In later years, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only with acoustic guitar to more explicitly make clear the song's original meaning.)</dd>

<p>I added a New York Post report of a split with Scialfa that has been referenced by some other web pages. Wasted Time promptly deleted it - something he seems to do a lot, judging from his Talk page - with the comment "it is not Wikipedia's role to include gossip page rumours". I respectfully invite him to explain here for readers of the article: 1) On what basis he claims to pronounce on Wikipedia's role, and 2) What, in his unimpeachable judgment, would be a legitimate source documenting a change in the subject's marital status. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 23:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) See the top-most box on this discussion page? It says: "This article must adhere to the biographies of living persons policy as it directly concerns one or more living people. Poorly sourced, potentially libellous material must be removed immediately." That's exactly what this <i>New York Post</i> gossip page is - weakly sourced material that (if untrue) defames Springsteen's character. 2) If Springsteen's or Scialfa's publicist or management officially confirms a separation or divorce action, then it can be added to the article. Not before then. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 02:40, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The fact that there was a controversy about the status of his marriage is a fact. An article appeared in the New York Post on a certain day alleging something to which Springsteen responded. There are ways to write this so that it does no appear as though the allegation is being endorsed. To ignore it is an attempt to whitewash history - something that happens frequently on Wikipedia, it seems, espcially by people who happen to be fans of some celebrity.</p>

<p>This is a very poor picture of Bruce Springsteen, mainly because his face is in darkness, and it seems very unprofessional as he is talking (hence his open mouth).</p>
<p>It does not relate to his music and I believe that the last picture was better, or a better one could be found.</p>

<p>The first photo is one of the worst of Bruce ever taken! I can't believe that no one has uploaded a better one. I'd rather have an album cover like Born To Run for the introduction to the page than what is there now. It makes Bruce look like a joke. --Jstrap 19:47, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is "slightly ridiculous" is your emotional investment in the current photo. I have to chuckle at your vigilant censoring of any attempts to improve it. Personally, I'd rather have a slightly blurry picture that at least looks like him than a more clear picture that is ridiculous. But that's just me (and everyone else who has tried to fix this).

The images you have replaced the current with have been either copyvios or blurred. There's no "censorship" here, just common sense. Care to educate us all in why the current image is so bad, anyway?

You seem to be alone in thinking it's good - it's a topic on this talk page because it's so bad and even Wasted Time says it's horrendous. You're best sticking to the "free" argument, not defending the picture on its merits! Let's just say it would be hard to come up with a worse picture. Everyone I've directed to the article has laughed out loud and prefer the slightly blurry picture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BruceSpringsteen2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BruceSpringsteen2.jpg" rel="nofollow">BruceSpringsteen2.jpg</a> that's more in keeping with the quality of the article. It at least looks like Springsteen. It's hard to take the article seriously with that picture there. But seeing as it's a matter of personal pride to you to keep it ...

<dd>It's not. That's been sort of the point - I'm not 'defending' the image I uploaded, I'm defending the article it's on. I don't believe that a blurred camera phone image is "in keeping with the quality of the article" - and I'm wondering at this stage whether we're talking about the same photo anymore. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sis/10175721/" class="external text" title="http://flickr.com/photos/sis/10175721/" rel="nofollow">This photo</a> seems perfectly acceptable: it's clear, it's free and it's blatantly Springsteen, odd mid-photo facial expression or no. My point is that an unfocussed low-resolution shot is detrimental to the article's credibility - this isn't a personal attack on you or anyone else. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> hasn't expressed the sentiments you seem to attribute to him, either. Anyway, I won't be dragged into further discussions about this - if you want to make it your crusade to replace the current one, be my guest - but good luck finding one that fits to the harsh requirements of Wikipedia and the article's quality. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalaeologus_47ce.html" title="User:Palaeologus">Palaeologus</a> 23:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>YES, that is correct</p>
<p>~~TheMountaineer Joseph would be a Confirmation Name adopted by Catholic youth as they are confirmed as adult members of the Church. A birth certificate would not contain this name. Many ignore their confirmation name completely. Some because they get to choose their own name use it as a first name.I'm guessing because Mom being Italian would have influenced the choice of Joseph</p>

<p>I've finished the move from an unordered list to an album cover gallery, a la <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> - and am currently doing the same for <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagles.html" title="Eagles">The Eagles</a>. However - I'm wondering if it's worth creating a further 'Compilations' gallery to house the 'Greatest Hits' and 'Essential Bruce Springsteen' albums... almost doesn't seem worth it, and the albums seem to be made up mostly of studio-recorded songs anyway.

<dd>Are these galleries legit on fair use grounds? I thought album covers could only be used in the article about that specific album, and not elsewhere. As for your question, I would mix them all together chronologically, as that helps 'tell the story'. The <i>Live/75-85</i> album was really the end of an era for Bruce, and so it needs to be seen in sequence. The 1995 <i>Greatest Hits</i> was a placeholder because a couple of album projects had failed, same thing, needs to be seen in sequence. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 15:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I would refer you to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> article, there seems to be some discussion there about the covers. There's also been a number of illustrative covers on this page for a period of time which have been unchallenged. It seems to me that the gallery is 'fairer use' than random covers used as illustration for the article. The galleries have been put their in good faith, as I'm attempting to bring the article closer to FA status, a la The Beatles article. As for your sentiments about the chronology of the gallery, I can see your point of view - but it'll be interesting to see some other people's opinions on this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalaeologus_47ce.html" title="User:Palaeologus">Palaeologus</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalaeologus_a7fa.html" title="User talk:Palaeologus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Palaeologus_a520.html" title="Special:Contributions/Palaeologus">contribs</a>) 10:24, November 4, 2006.</small></dd>

<p>Fair-use image galleries are generally frowned on. I was picking album cover fair use images and trying to write fair use rationales for them, and I have a hard time giving a rationale for the use of the "Born in the USA" cover -- the best I could come up with was something like "It is being used to illustrate one of Bruce Springsteen's albums, all of which are being illustrated in the article." I'm removing the gallery: having one or two album cover images to illustrate Bruce's recordings is one thing -- including ALL of them is another. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is quite true. Springsteen's first band was called Child but he decided to change it to Steel Mill because there was another group in the area that also went by Child. After his stint with the Steel Mill Band he formed the Bruce Springsteen Band. Several members of the E Street Band also played in some of these earlier bands like Steve van Zandt, Danny Federici, and Gary Tallent. <a href="../../../j/e/i/User%7EJeick_979d.html" title="User:Jeick">Jeick</a> 01:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this true? I couldn't find the referenced NY Times article anywhere online, and I also couldn't find any other references to this contest anywhere else online.

<p>I have also tried to search for this and I doubt that it is legit.
