<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_McAvaney_95ed.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>After five years service as a public service clerk, McAvaneyâ€™s media career began in 1976 at Adelaide radio station <a href="../../../5/d/n/5DN_8e5d.html" title="5DN">5DN</a> where he called horse races and hosted a sports show. Two years later he moved to television joining ADS7 to read sport news and produce the weekly Racetrack show.</p>
<p>His first big break came in 1980 when colleague <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Roberts_d48f.html" title="Sandy Roberts">Sandy Roberts</a> went to the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_Summer_Olympics_f7d0.html" title="1980 Summer Olympics">Moscow Olympics</a> for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Seven_5b2a.html" title="Channel Seven">Channel Seven</a> and Bruce was chosen to host the Adelaide end of the telecast.</p>
<p>In 1983 he joined Melbourne's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Ten_c189.html" title="Channel Ten">Channel Ten</a> to read sport news with then cadets <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_McGuire_1e95.html" title="Eddie McGuire">Eddie McGuire</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Quartermain_7e42.html" title="Stephen Quartermain">Stephen Quartermain</a> working under him.</p>
<p>The following year he went to the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> Olympics to commentate track and field events and be the secondary host.</p>
<p>McAvaney co-hosted Ten's telecast of the 1988 Seoul Olympics to public and critical acclaim, coming runner-up to Sandy Roberts in the 1989 Penguin Award for "Best Presenter in the field of Summer Olympic Presenting for an Australian commentator working for Channel 7, for the year of 1988" and an award from the Glenelg local council, the "Putting Glenelg on the map" award.</p>

<p>McAvaney's reputation of Australia's "Mastercaster" grew during his time at Seven where he became the face of the network's sports coverage from the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cup_8497.html" title="Melbourne Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>, World Athletics, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">AFL</a>, Motor Racing, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Open_bdfe.html" title="Australian Open">Australian Open</a> Tennis, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Masters_5e66.html" title="Australian Masters">Australian Masters</a> Golf and the Olympics.</p>
<p>A stickler for detail and knowledgeable on all sports, McAvaney did himself no harm when he said the following of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flo_Jo_38de.html" title="Flo Jo">Flo Jo</a> - "Impossible, no female could run that fast." and he also cast doubt on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Johnson_57b3.html" title="Ben Johnson">Ben Johnson</a> on the 1988 Olympic record. Johnson was later proven to be dope-fuelled and doubt has also been cast on Flo Jo, especially after her untimely death in 1998.</p>

<p>In 2001, when Seven lost the rights to broadcast AFL, McAvaney stopped working as an AFL commentator. However, he continued his role at the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a> as host of <i><a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportsworld.html" title="Sportsworld">Sportsworld</a></i> and anchor of major sports events.</p>

He also returned to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stawell%2C_Victoria_662d.html" title="Stawell, Victoria">Stawell</a> with the station and called a memorable <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stawell_Gift_3fd0.html" title="Stawell Gift">Stawell Gift</a> final which was won by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Ross_dbb3.html" title="Joshua Ross">Joshua Ross</a> in 2005. After The Insiders was axed in the station's financial crisis he quit.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a>/<a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consortium.html" title="Consortium">consortium</a>'s winning bid for the 2007-2011 <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> television broadcasting rights in January 2006, McAvaney has returned to his role as a football commentator.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_McAvaney_95ed.html" title="Edit section: Memorable moments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Memorable moments</span></h2>
<p>McAvaney's excitement has been a major part of Australian sporting moments from calling Channel 10's coverage of Empire Rose's Melbourne Cup, to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy_Freeman_a792.html" title="Cathy Freeman">Cathy Freeman</a>'s gold medal in the 400m at the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Olympics_9adc.html" title="Sydney Olympics">Sydney Olympics</a> in 2000.</p>
<p>When Freeman crossed the moment, McAvaney let fly with the superlatives and was overcame with emotion when he said "what a moment, what a legend" to which athletics legend <a href="../../../r/a/e/Raelene_Boyle_1285.html" title="Raelene Boyle">Raelene Boyle</a> replied "what a relief".</p>
<p>He has said he rates nine-time Olympic gold medalist <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Lewis_d209.html" title="Carl Lewis">Carl Lewis</a> as among the finest athletes he has seen and five-time gold medalist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Johnson_%28athlete%29_939e.html" title="Michael Johnson (athlete)">Michael Johnson</a> gave McAvaney his shoe following his victory in the 400m at <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> in 1996 as a sign of respect.</p>
<p>He was the lone caller when legendary AFL full-forward <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Lockett_2c24.html" title="Tony Lockett">Tony Lockett</a> kicked his 1300th career goal to become the all-time greatest goalkicker in the game's history, while playing for <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney Swans</a> at the <a href="../../../s/c/g/SCG_f4cb.html" title="SCG">SCG</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>The public perception was he had a football love-affair with great players such as North Melbourne star <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Carey_4570.html" title="Wayne Carey">Wayne Carey</a> and Essendon player <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hird_bbf9.html" title="James Hird">James Hird</a> and was synonymous for scream "Caaaary", when the star centre-half forward took a mark or kicked a goal. He is also commonly lampooned for his use of the word special.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Moorcroft_e2d8.html" title="Gary Moorcroft">Gary Moorcroft</a> took mark of the year for <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Football_Club_46a8.html" title="Essendon Football Club">Essendon</a> against <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a> at Telstra Dome in 2001, McAvaney remarked "that will go around the world on <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>" - and it did.</p>
<p>In an interview in 2002, McAvaney said the chance to front the coverage of a <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> in which Australia was involved would top of his career as a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcaster.html" title="Broadcaster">broadcaster</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makybe_Diva_dede.html" title="Makybe Diva">Makybe Diva</a> won the Melbourne Cup for the third time in succession in 2005, McAvaney dubbed it "the greatest victory in the history of the race".</p>
<p>In May 2006, he listed his top three sporting moments of all time as:</p>
<p>1. <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makybe_Diva_dede.html" title="Makybe Diva">Makybe Diva</a> winning a third Melbourne Cup 2. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Johnson_57b3.html" title="Ben Johnson">Ben Johnson</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Lewis_d209.html" title="Carl Lewis">Carl Lewis</a> in the 100m final at <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul_Olympics_c41a.html" title="Seoul Olympics">Seoul Olympics</a> 3. 1971 <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Ali_cb93.html" title="Mohammad Ali">Mohammad Ali</a> v <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Frasier_9887.html" title="Joe Frasier">Joe Frasier</a></p>
<p>In the Summer Olympics of 2004, over come with emotion after the win of Hicham El Guerrouj in the Men's 1500m Athletics Event, he quoted, "But he's coming back the champ, El Guerrouj is coming back...he is a legend. He has gone from the greatest never, to the best of all time."</p>

<p>Along with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Benaud_f1e5.html" title="Richie Benaud">Richie Benaud</a>, McAvaney is probably the most commonly impersonated sports commentator in Australia.</p>
<p>Popular impersonator <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Birmingham_f3e8.html" title="Billy Birmingham">Billy Birmingham</a>, of <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Man_9f8b.html" title="Twelfth Man">Twelfth Man</a> fame, featured McAvaney on his Bruce 2000 single released following the Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Startin_7ad9.html" title="Andrew Startin">Andrew Startin</a> also features his take on McAvaney in many of his show, including multiple times on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Nine_8100.html" title="Channel Nine">Channel Nine</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Footy_Show_4e2a.html" title="The Footy Show">The Footy Show</a> , while actor/comedian <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Sitch_2eb3.html" title="Rob Sitch">Rob Sitch</a> produced a memorable performance of McAvaney on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> television's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Show_%28Australian_TV_series%29_458d.html" title="The Late Show (Australian TV series)">The Late Show</a></i> in 1992.</p>

<p>In 2002, McAvaney hit back at a rumour he claimed had dogged him and his family for two years - that he was gay and living with a big-name athlete.</p>
<p>He told a <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Limited_72a3.html" title="News Limited">News Limited</a> newspaper the talk had been "upsetting and weird".</p>
<p>"And stressful and a long way off the mark," he said. "Which made it easier in one way, but more frustrating in another.</p>
<p>"It was incredibly frustrating because it was damaging and there was no truth, in any way, shape or form, to any of the stuff. It was that far out there I was almost laughing sometimes. That made it a bit easier; it was silly.</p>
<p>"I don't know where it originated and I'm not sure what motivated it, but I'm also aware that there are other people in the media or in the public eye who've suffered the same thing, but they get on with it.</p>
<p>"The only thing I actually worry about in the end is that my family situation - my wife and particularly my children - are safe and well and happy." McAvaney added that being branded gay did not carry the slur it once did. "It's nothing," he said. "It just isn't factual."</p>
