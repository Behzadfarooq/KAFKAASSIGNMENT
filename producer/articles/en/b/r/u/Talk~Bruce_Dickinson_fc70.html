<p>I created a new section entitled "Bruce Dickinson's Solo Albums" and included the following information for it:</p>
<pre>
   * Tattooed Millionaire
   * Balls To Picasso
   * Alive In Studio A
   * Skunkworks

<p>Removed one link I had previously added because the particular design of the website at the link was very messy and ugly in my opinion.

<p>I notice there's a link at the top of the Bruce Dickinson wiki page to a Bruce Dickinson wiki page in another language which has his solo albums listed and each linked to pictures and descriptive information.

<p>Removed an anonymous user's (listed by IP address only in history for 'cowbell') contribution of: "Bruce Dickinson is also famous for his love of cowbell. This was once saterized in a Saturday Night Live sketch" I am aware of this SNL sketch with a character named Bruce Dickinson but as far as I could see it beared little to no resemblence to the acutal Bruce Dickinson of this article. I am not aware of Bruce Dickinson being famous for "his love of cowbell" If this can be proven then please point out a publication where Bruce Dickinson himself mentions this somehow, otherwise it is assumed that this cowbell comment was either added as a joke or in error. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonslave_507b.html" title="User:Demonslave">Demonslave</a> 15:07, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A user at 83.77.143.6 cleared the External Links section, after I had restored it following a user at 83.78.102.143 clearing it a day before. These two events follow a patten which I believe is connected to a frustrated user who couldn't keep several links in external links to maidenfans dot com listed. As I explained in my comments in History for the article page of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Dickinson_67d9.html" title="Bruce Dickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a>, only ONE link to a domain in External Links is needed, especially when it's a fan page. After I had removed duplicate entries the external links section started to be cleared which is clearly vandalism. I'm writing this here as a warning, my next step will be discussing this with an admin to decide whether or not to ban IP addresses of the vandals if this continues. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonslave_507b.html" title="User:Demonslave">Demonslave</a> 18:31, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Plus, maidenfans dot com is already listed on the Iron Maiden band page (where the user was adding duplicate entries as well and I had to remove them for a few days) whereas this page is devoted to Bruce Dickinson and should be Bruce centric. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonslave_507b.html" title="User:Demonslave">Demonslave</a> 18:59, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recently I´ve reverted the edits from a (surely) Bruce Dickinson fan like myself. He wrote in the introduction that Bruce "were probably the best heavy rock singer ever". While I myself think it is true, I know it is based on personal taste solely. I can´t remember someone who didn´t like Bruce´s voice, even my girlfriend (who did not like heavy rock) think he is superb, but again it is solely a personal point of view. I think it is not what we strive for in wikipedia, so I reverted the edits to the previous one. Anyone have a different opinion over this matter? Should the previous comment be restored?

<p>This statement is solely based on personal taste. It most certainly doesn't represent a neutral point of view. To leave it as such would be wrong.</p>

Removed "aboce average" guitarist and drummer and changed to "acclaimed". "aove average" is POV and sounds like a school report. "Acclaimed", in my view, is acceptable to an encyclopedia. Curphey 21:25, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed 'Olympic standard' from the line referring to Bruce's fencing talents. He was a reasonably good foilist but never got close to that sort of elite level. Not sure of exact figures, but I believe he was in the top 100 of the UK rankings without ever reaching the top 50. (bear in mind that the UK are not (then or now) among the world's leading fencing countries) The exaggeration of Bruce's fencing ability is somewhat of an urban myth among Iron Maiden fans, so anyone wishing to dispute this edit please find evidence from a fencing source (as opposed to a Bruce/Maiden fan site)</p>

<dd>Please, remember to sign your posts! (just write ~~~~ after your post will put your name (or IP if not logged) plus the date and time of the edits.

<dd>I see. Thanks. I'd advocate an article for the producer with a disambig at the top of this article, only to eliminate confusion between him and this Bruce; the producer may be insignificant at present, but he is notable because of the "more cowbell" sketch. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 19:17, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Oh! It´s a great deal of stupidity not to recognize Dickinson´s legendary status. It´s something no one would ever contest. Unless someone is really not well meant. According to All Music Guide <i>he is the most acclaimed and instantly recognizable vocalist to emerge from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement of the early-'80s</i>. It´s clearly not POV, it could be argued it´s original research, but I really did not think it hurts too much to label him <b>the legendary vocalist of Iron Maiden</b>. To the contrary, I think it´s much worse to deny him the status he actually attained (and deserves). <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 02:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Notwithstanding, the lead sentence can do without the figurative <i>legendary</i> attribution; regardless of what you, I, and other fans think he deserves, such a label is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>, inappropriate, and damages the credibility of the article. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 08:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not POV. Perhaps original research. Anyway I rephrased it. The problem is that it´s hard to find exactly the term legendary in an online reliable source. Dickinson has a legend status, but since I was not able to find a reliable source using the exact term, the use of it in the article would be an interpretation of another work or article, which is not meant to be in wikipedia (original research). In magazines I´ve read it very, very often: The legend Bruce Dickinson, the legendary Maiden vocalist, etc. But if I do cite a magazine without online articles then I really think someone will challenge that only because he is not able "reach" the source. Sometimes the enforcement of wikipedia policies should come with common sense: see <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Stewart_6ea5.html" title="Mike Stewart">Mike Stewart</a> article. He is the uncontested greatest <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboarding.html" title="Bodyboarding">bodyboarder</a> of all time. He paved the ground for what bodyboarding is today. Anyway it´s very hard to find online resources about him, since he is a much private person. Someone stumbling onto his article will never be able to recognize how important this man was and still is to bodyboarding because someone would argue that using legendary for him was not approppriate... In fact, not using the label is what I would call inapproppriate. The same happens with Bruce Dickinson (see that I´m not saying that he is the best metal vocalist ever, I´m not a mindless Dickinson fan. I´d rather vote <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Gildenl%C3%B6w_3b06.html" title="Daniel Gildenlöw">Daniel Gildenlöw</a> from <a href="../../../p/a/i/Pain_of_Salvation_fc57.html" title="Pain of Salvation">Pain of Salvation</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Allen_d4fa.html" title="Russell Allen">Russell Allen</a> from <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_X_03aa.html" title="Symphony X">Symphony X</a> for best metal vocalist.

<p>Dickinson airlifted 200 British citizens who had fled war torn Beirut, Lebanon back to the UK on July 20, 2006. He picked up the evacuees in Cyprus on a Boeing 757 and flew them back to London's Gatwick Airport.</p>
<p>could somone please cite the above</p>
<p>(Different contributor) Please note - this has been widely reported in respectable newspapers and therefore is probably true (!) but in fairness someone pointed out somewhere that Bruce is a First Officer, not a Captain, so it's unlikely that he airlifted 200 passengers by himself ... The basic story was reported on the official IM website, but I've never seen any expansion on the story from an Iron Maiden or Bruce source. 212.159.59.41 12:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The actual story is the UK Foreign Dept charted a number of available aircraft to airlift UK citizens from Lebanon and Cyprus. One of the chartered aircraft was a 757 from Astraeus Airlines with Bruce serving as first officer. So the reported story is kind of correct but somewhat twisted. And as stated, as first officer qualified on 757 he is allowed to fly the aircraft in commercial service but he is not allowed to command the fligth.Hdw 03:41, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dickinson speaks good or fluent Spanish, evidenced by the Spanish version of "Man of Sorrows" on the Accident of Birth bonus disc. and how does that mean he speaks it somone could have just translated it for him and he sung it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.61.211.137 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.61.211.137_6f26.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.61.211.137">contribs</a>) 2006 August 17.</small></p>

<p>Yesterday (26-Aug-06) I wrote up several paragraphs of my memories of Bruce at Oundle -- I was in Sidney House during the same era. I guess some of the details have not appeared in the public domain before, and they are not entirely wholesome. But I am aghast this morning to see that they have all been removed and described as 'vandalism' by a no doubt well-intentioned fan. I do not have the time to play wiki-ping-pong to try to get these additional paragraphs reinstated. But I feel that removing these paragraphs is an act of censorship of the truth, or at least my memories of the truth. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThegn_106b.html" title="User:Thegn">User:Thegn</a></p>

<dd>I have no other source I can quote besides my own memory. If it helps, I was the provider of the school photo used in this article. I also supplied this photo to the UK's Channel 4 in the late 80s or early 90s when 'The Word' did a short article about Bruce. Maybe the correct procedure is that Bruce's biographer can contact me, then the write-up can appear in a future edition of his biography, and then it can be quoted as a source for the Wikipedia article. I feel that the article as it stands suggests that Bruce was largely subjected to violence at school. This, to my knowledge, was not true except on the rugby field, and there were plenty who suffered worse in that sport than Bruce. The bullying that Bruce was subjected to was almast entirely psychological. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThegn_106b.html" title="User:Thegn">User:Thegn</a></dd>
