<p>"<i><b>The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides</b></i>" <i>George Orwell</i>, from his essay <i>Politics and the English Language</i> 1946 <a href="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><i>“Democracy, shouldn’t be regarded in a simplistic, binary manner. There is no single characteristic according to which a nation definitely is or definitely is not democratic. There are, instead, a number of basic characteristics which go into making a viable democracy, and a nation may have some but not all of them. In addition, a country may do well on some of the characteristics it has, but do worse on others".</i><a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/202431.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/202431.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>"Wikipedia is an international, collaborative project. Probably, as we grow, nearly every view on every subject will (eventually) be found among our authors and readership. To avoid endless edit wars, we can <b>agree to present each of these views fairly, and not make our articles assert any one of them as correct</b>. And that is what makes an article "unbiased" or "neutral" in the sense we are presenting here. To write from a neutral point of view, one presents controversial views without asserting them; to do that, it generally suffices to present competing views in a way that is more or less acceptable to their adherents, and also to attribute the views to their adherents."</dd>

The plan amounts to a statement of goals rather than a blueprint for US action, many analysts say.

A harsh criticism, but regardless, it fundamentally is based on the premise that electoral power in Cuba rests with the local councils.

The Communist leadership believes that traditional democracies in Latin America often become military dictatorships or become subject to government corruption, which renders their democratic institutions meaningless. In theory, the Cuban government avoids dictatorship and corruption by creating a strong, centralized political structure that makes every effort to incorporate the opinions of the people when making policy decisions. This, to their way of thinking, qualifies Cuba as a democracy and not a totalitarian government. However, Castro makes all major decisions, without popular referendums."</i></li>

<li>Susan Babbitt writes in an article called Cuba, <a href="http://www.selvesandothers.org/view1338.html" class="external text" title="http://www.selvesandothers.org/view1338.html" rel="nofollow">Democracy and the armed owl</a> in the <i>"Journal on African Philosophy" that "When people on the left claim that Cuba is not democratic, they generally cite a number of reasons. One, of course, is that there exists a single-party political system. Another is that there is no U.S. - style free press. 1 <b>But we might wonder why democracy, which means rule by the people, must necessarily involve these two features</b>. Perhaps, the arguments are that the single-party system and the absence of an American-style free press are such that in fact the people are prevented from taking control of their own destiny, of ruling themselves. But if this were the case, it would seem that the arguments should involve some discussion of what it means for a people to rule itself and, given a defensible articulation of this notion, evidence that the kind of one-party system that exists in Cuba does not fulfill its responsibility. Indeed, it would seem to be important to discuss what it means, in fact, for there to be “a people”. Often, I have noticed, well-intentioned North American liberals come to Cuba and claim as a result of their investigations that “the people” are dissatisfied with Cuban socialism. But it is not clear why those who are not members of the Communist Party should have more of a claim to being “the people” than the large number who are. <b>And even if we could be sure about what the majority thinks, it is not clear how, without begging some questions about real interests, this can provide evidence that Cuba is or is not democratic</b>"</i></li>

The authorities do what they can to make it as easy as possible. Where I stay in Havana's Vedado, there are three polling stations within ONE BLOCK of my door. What we would call election precincts, they call circumscriptions. <b>It's a secret ballot there as it is here.</b> One big difference is that the Cuban system isn't automated. The ballots are hand-counted. The ballot boxes are guarded by elementary school children who belong to the Young Pioneers. In Cuba candidates don't spend any money. Indeed, they're forbidden to spend money and the only literature is a single sheet which lists their individual qualifications. Candidates make personal appearances, but campaigning and debating US-style doesn't occur. "</i></li>

The mandat varies in important ways from the Lockean traditions that spawned bourgeois democracy. The central idea here is that representatives should be truly accountable and responsive to their constituents. Thus, for example, it matters less what a delegate thinks than what his constituency thinks. Also key in understanding the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are the ideas of the centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society."</i></a></li>

Reich to the US Senate Committee on Commerce. Though in this testimony, Mr. Reich describes <i>"...moving towards a more open or representative government."</i> Which again implies that the Bush administration believes that the Cuba has, albeit inadaquate, a representative government now. Also, this testimony included the statement of the USA '<i>"...assesment that Cuba has at least a limited, developmental biological weapons research and development effort"</i> The overall hostile content of this Bush Administration statement calls into question, certainly the neutrality, and also credibility of this 'not a democracy statement'. Also, according to the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Science_Monitor_56ce.html" title="Christian Science Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a> the Bush Administration has subsequently (Sept.8, 2005) distanced itself from this testimony<a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/intervention/cuba/2005/0908splitview.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/intervention/cuba/2005/0908splitview.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.</li>

Cuba, we have had an embargo on Cuba for 37 years. It is the only non-democracy in the hemisphere. There has been very little evidence that there's any interest on the part of Mr. Castro in significant liberalization, <b>economic or political</b>. And at this stage of the game, to end that embargo would be to send, I think, just the wrong signal. So in each situation, you have to decide what is the best course topursue with respect to your objectives."</i> Note, that again the US policy groups <b>economic</b> and <b>political</b> together, a clear implication that the US form of acceptable democracy is 'market oriented democracy' as opposed to 'socialist democracy' practiced in Cuba.</li>

<dd>Reverend Lucius Walker Jr. "<i>"The world tells us that Cuba is a dictatorship. If Fidel Castro is a dictator, he is the only dictator who is elected. Anyone running for office is nominated by people in a town meeting. Nobody nominated is allowed to put forward more glossy material than another. That means that a Bush would have no better chance of swaying public opinion than anybody else. ...[Cuban elections are] the most democratic in the world. There’s no ability to buy elections, no possibility for the type of corruption that has occurred in Florida. ... [Cuba has] a democratic system that should be adopted by more countries in the world. If we would look at the Cuban system, it would be useful."</i></dd>
