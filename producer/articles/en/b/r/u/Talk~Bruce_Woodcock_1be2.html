<p>There hasn’t been any news on Bruce for a while. His website hasn’t been updated for half a year, he hasn’t made any public appearances for quire a while and hasn't responded to e-mails. Anyone know what’s up? <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocVM_56ad.html" title="User:DocVM">DocVM</a> 23:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was dead for a while. But now I'm alive again. Actually I've been so busy consulting I haven't had any time to update the website for public consumption. My email box is filled with spam. But I just got back from GDC and hopefully I'll be able to put together something new. SirBruce 17:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBruce_Woodcock_1be2.html" title="Edit section: Suggested Changes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suggested Changes</span></h2>
<p>While I think the entry is very good overall, there are some changes I think would improve the article.</p>
<p>Where it says:</p>
<p>eventually leaving in 1997 with $250,000 in stock options. He started to maintain a presence on the Yahoo! financial message boards as he closely tracked the performance of Network Appliance, helped the company's fortunes, and built his own portfolio to $3 million.[1]</p>
<p>I don't think my personal wealth is really all that relevant to my notability; in fact, the article quoted was really not about the money I had made, but my status on the Yahoo finance boards. Indeed, it is this sort of activity that's far more relevant to my subsequent interest in MMOGs. I think instead the entry should be revised to remove the dollar figures and instead focus on my emerging status as a micro-celebrity, also known as a brand champion or brand ambassador.</p>
<p>In the Public Speaker section, add:</p>
<p>What the Market Research Tells Us - Where MMOs are Going and How Are we Going to Get There (Speaker), Austin Game Conference, September 6, 2006</p>
<p>In the References section:</p>
<p>Change Biography to point to the new one: <a href="http://www.gameconference.com/speakers/brucewoodcock.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gameconference.com/speakers/brucewoodcock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gameconference.com/speakers/brucewoodcock.html</a></p>
<p>Remove the higher entry for "Network Appliance's Knight of the Message Boards", since it's already listed lower down in chronological order.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to make these changes (in lieu of me doing it myself) is welcome to do so.</p>

<p>This article seems a little.. politically correct might be the term. I remember SirBruce from the LumTheMad forums and jokingly recall his title of 'The Man Most Banned From Forum Boards', not to mention the WW2O controversy things. While I don't remember the exact details of everything that happened, perhaps someone else could come up with counterpoints to the situations I've mentioned? It doesn't seem right for all the good to be posted without all the bad. I'll see what I can remember and find out. PratzStrike 08:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Additional viewpoints would be great. One of the main sticking points so far, is that "controversial" information, especially about someone who's living (as opposed to a historical figure) on Wikipedia has to be referenced, meaning it has to be linked to an outside source somewhere that <i>isn't</i> a message board or blog. So Lum's forums, in general, can't really be used as a source. &#160;:/ Check the Wikipedia policies at <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> for more details. If you can find other sources though that verify the participation or controversy, then I fully agree, that would be an excellent addition to this article. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 10:57, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd just like to add that I have no problem with controversies being added, but as Elonka said, she would prefer them to be sourced. I think it would be fair include a general blurb that I also became notable for butting heads with various people on the LtM/SND/P2P and other such forums, but I don't know if there's really a need to go into specifics since individual controversies probably never rose to a sufficiently notable level. SirBruce 03:00, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Given the no blog/no message board rule for sourcing, Bruce is probably in the clear, since message boards (and Usenet prior) were the 'scenes of the crime' as it were. Since I have personal experience from the time and can act as a hopefully NPOV source I'll add a brief sentence. Feel free to edit as appropriate. SJennings 15:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll also note that the no blog/no message board rule has been heavily relaxed due to circumstances like this one where we're describing something that happened on blogs and message boards. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you went a little further than butting heads, Bruce. You were highly entertaining, but you had a talent for getting under peoples' skin. I don't think I ever saw Lum get that frustrated with anyone else who wasn't actively trying to get banned.</p>
<p>I also think a mention of your post-response style might be useful. "SirBrucing a post" was a commonly understood term on the message boards I frequented after LTM went away, and it's an adequate descriptive term with a colorful history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.32.147.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.32.147.124_f10c.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.32.147.124">contribs</a>) 19:56, August 10, 2006.</small></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Louisans" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Louisans" rel="nofollow">Category:St. Louisans</a> people associated with the town of Sullivan should be included in the category, but the two other notable Sullivan people, Bottomly and Harney, are not listed in the category. However, Sullivan does fall within the geographic boundary defined for the category. Given this, I have no problem being added to the St. Louisans category, and I think if there needs to be a change, it should be a redefinition of the St. Louisans category to represent only a much smaller area.

<dd>City limits aside, how do you regard yourself? Someone from Missouri? Or someone from St. Louis?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 23:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does it matter? I regard myself as a lot of things that don't meet the defined Wikipedia criteria for those categories. SirBruce 23:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would say it matters, because it would help in the discussion about who <a href="../../../s/t/2E/Category%7ESt._Louisans_678e.html" title="Category:St. Louisans">Category:St. Louisans</a> should apply to. As you're from one of the areas on the borderline, your opinion can help to clarify Wikipedia guidelines on this matter. Though it might be a violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> for you to edit your own bio, you are as welcome as anyone else on the internet to participate in Wikipedia policy discussions. So perhaps I should rephrase the question: "To a typical resident of Sullivan, Missouri, do you they regard themselves more as "from Missouri", or "from St. Louis"?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 23:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
