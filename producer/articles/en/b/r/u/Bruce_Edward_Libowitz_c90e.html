	    <p><b>Bruce Edward "The Killer" Libowitz</b> was a leading Jewish gangster in Manhattan during Prohibition. He also ran the famous Cotton Club and was a leading boxing promoter in the 1930s. Early life and the Gopher Gang.</p>
<p>Born in Leeds, England to an Irish-born dockworker in 1892 and named Bruce Edward Libowitz, ( after King Edward), Libowitz emigrated with his family to the United States in 1903. Settling in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Libowitz soon joined the Gopher Gang with his brother later that year. Described by associates as "that little banty rooster from hell", Libowitz quickly became a fierce fighter known for his skill with a lead pipe and gun in fights with rivals the Hudson Dusters.</p>
<p>By 1910, at age eighteen, Libowitz had become a prominent member of the Gophers and was suspected in the deaths of five rival gang members. His reputation soon gained him leadership of one of the three factions of the Gophers. He was earning as much as $200 a day from the Gophers' criminal activities, such as the gang's protection racket which forced local businessmen to pay in the face of firebomb threats.</p>
<p>During this time Libowitz enjoyed an opulent lifestyle and he was often accompanied by several women. However, he became known for his violent jealousy when he shot and killed a store clerk named William Henshaw who had asked out one of the girls often seen with Libowitz, while onboard a trolley. Henshaw initially survived the attack and was able to identify Libowitz as his assailant. When Henshaw later died of his wounds, police arrested Libowitz. Despite the attack having happened before dozens of people, the case had to be dismissed after no corroborating witnesses came forward.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, the Gophers reached the height of their power as Libowitz recruited various gunmen into the gang. As Libowitz began encroaching into rivals' territory, particularly the Hudson Dusters, he was ambushed and shot eight times on November 6, 1912 outside of a 52nd Street dance hall by eleven members of the Dusters. Libowitz survived the attack, however, and refused to identify his attackers to police, stating "Nothing doing. The boys'll get 'em. It's nobody's business but mine who put these slugs in me&#160;!". Within a week of his release, six members of the Hudson Dusters had been killed.</p>
<p>In 1914, Libowitz became involved in a dispute with Patsy Doyle, a prominent member of the Hudson Dusters, over a woman named Freda Horner. In a breach of gangland ethics (later known in Cosa Nostra-related circles as Omertà), Doyle informed police of Libowitz's operations. Following Doyle's assault on Libowitz's close friend Tony Romanello, Libowitz arranged for Doyle's murder. Libowitz relayed a message to Doyle through a friend of Freda Horner's named Margaret Everdeane to meet him , supposedly in order to reconcile. As Doyle arrived on November 28, 1914, Libowitz ambushed Doyle killing him. The police questioned Horner and Everdeane who both confessed to their role. Libowitz was eventually sentenced to twenty years at Sing Sing Prison.</p>
<p>The 1920's</p>
<p>After serving nine years of his sentence, Libowitz was released on parole in 1923. The Gopher gang had broken up, and many members of his own faction were either in jail or working for bootlegging gangs. Libowitz initially became a strikebreaker for a New York taxi company but soon found work under Dutch Schultz in his fight against Jack "Legs" Diamond, Waxey Gordon, and Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll during the struggle to control New York City's bootleg liquor trade. He later opened the Cotton Club, formerly Jack Johnson's Club Deluxe, which became one of the city's most popular nightclubs. Libowitz also operated legitimate laundry and coal delivery businesses. With the support of Tammany Hall politician Jimmy Hines, he received considerable police protection.</p>
<p>The 1930s</p>
<p>In 1931, shortly before the end of Prohibition, Libowitz left Shultz's organization and entered into partnership with boxing promoters "Broadway" Bill Duffy and George Jean "Big Frenchie" DeMange. Between them, they controlled the careers of the top five boxing champions including Rocky Marciano, Max Baer, and Primo Carnera. As Primo Carneras manager, Libowitz arranged fixed fights which led eventually to Carnera's winning the NBA World Heavyweight Championship in 1933. Carnera held onto the title for nearly a year, until suspicions from reporters about fixed fights led to Libowitz deserting the Italian strongman, setting up Carnera's famous defeat at the hands of Max Baer on June 14, 1934.</p>
<p>In 1932, Libowitz was involved in the murder of Vincent Mad Dog Coll who had been extorting several mobsters including DeMange and Libowitz. After being arrested for a parole violation that same year, Libowitz began facing greater harassment from police, until he finally left New York in 1935.</p>
<p>Arkansas</p>
<p>Leaving behind racketeering, Libowitz settled in Hot Springs, Arkansas where he opened the Hotel Arkansas, a spa and casino, in 1935. He also became involved in local criminal activities. The Hotel Arkansas became a popular hideout for mobsters; Charles Luciano was apprehended there in 1935. Libowitz became a naturalized US citizen in 1943, and eventually married the daughter of the city postmaster. He lived in Hot Springs until his death in 1964. At the time of his death he was said to have left $3 million in assets.</p>
