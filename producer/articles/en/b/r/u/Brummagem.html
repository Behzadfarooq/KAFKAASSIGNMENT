<p><b>Brummagem</b> (and historically also Bromichan, Bremicham and many similar variants, all essentially Bromwich·ham) is a local dialect name for the city of <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>It gave rise to the terms <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brum.html" title="Brum">Brum</a> (a shortened version or Brummagem) and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brummie.html" title="Brummie">Brummie</a> (inhabitants of the city, their accent and dialect, and frequently <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28county%29_3cb5.html" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands</a> accents in general).</p>
<p><b>Brummagem</b> and <b>Brummagem Ware</b> are also terms for cheap and shoddy imitations, in particular when referring to mass-produced goods. This use is archaic in the UK, but persists in some specialist areas in the USA and Australia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brummagem.html" title="Edit section: 18th century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">18th century</span></h2>
<p>During the 18th century Birmingham was known by several variations of the name "Brummagem".</p>
<p>In 1731, an old "Road-book" said that "Birmingham, Bromicham, or Bremicham, is a large town, well built and populous. The inhabitants, being mostly <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_%28metalwork%29.html" title="Smith (metalwork)">smiths</a>, are very ingenious in their way, and vend vast quantities of all sorts of iron wares."</p>
<p>Around 1750, the "<a href="../../../e/n/g/England%27s_Gazetteer_340a.html" title="England's Gazetteer">England's Gazetteer</a>" described Birmingham or Bromichan as "a large, well-built, and populous town, noted for the most ingenious artificers in boxes, <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckle.html" title="Buckle">buckles</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/t/Button.html" title="Button">buttons</a>, and other iron and steel wares; wherein such multitudes of people are employed that they are sent all over <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>; and here is a continual noise of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammer.html" title="Hammer">hammers</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/v/Anvil.html" title="Anvil">anvils</a>, and <a href="../../../f/i/l/File.html" title="File">files</a>."</p>
<p>The town was renowned for its miscellany of metal and silver industries, some of these manufacturers used cheap materials and were of poor quality and design. The poorer quality "Brummagem ware" was beginning to give the better more skilled metal workers of the town a bad name, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Boulton_56ab.html" title="Matthew Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> of the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_Society_b88e.html" title="Lunar Society">Lunar Society</a> and several toy makers and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silversmith.html" title="Silversmith">silversmiths</a> realised this and campaigned to have the town's first <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assay_Office_7496.html" title="Assay Office">Assay Office</a> constructed, great opposition came from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Goldsmiths_1142.html" title="Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths">Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> but Royal assent was given for assay offices in both Birmingham and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> on the same day. Eventually this filtered out much of the poor workmanship of silver and jewellery in Birmingham keeping mainly the higher quality produced jewellery which ultimately allowed the town to become one of the most important Silver manufacturing centres in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It is thought by some, including historian <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Chinn_c47e.html" title="Carl Chinn">Carl Chinn</a>, that around this time Mathew Boulton favoured "Birmingham" over "Brummagem" to cut loose from the previous negative connotations with the word.</p>

<p>By the 19th century Birmingham had become one most important players in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Boulton_56ab.html" title="Matthew Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> had taken part in the first British trade missions to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and the city was one of the most advanced, diverse and productive manufacturing centres in the modern world. Birmingham was sometimes referred to as The Toyshop of Europe, Workshop of the world or <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_a_thousand_trades.html" title="City of a thousand trades">City of a thousand trades</a>. The <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_pen_trade.html" title="Birmingham pen trade">Birmingham pen trade</a> prospered and areas such as <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter%2C_Birmingham_ef2b.html" title="Gun Quarter, Birmingham">The Gun Quarter</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewellery_Quarter%2C_Birmingham_6d6d.html" title="Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham">Jewellery Quarter</a> existed with high standards of production set out by institutions such as the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Proof_House_6e67.html" title="Birmingham Proof House">Birmingham Proof House</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Assay_Office_ce5f.html" title="Birmingham Assay Office">Birmingham Assay Office</a>, the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Mint_0c82.html" title="Birmingham Mint">Birmingham Mint</a> also became renowned globally for its high quality coins as did <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadburys.html" title="Cadburys">Cadburys</a> for its chocolate and workers welfare and rights.</p>
<p>With such a vast array of items being produced it was inevitable that not all would have been of high quality, the advances of the industrial revolution enabled machines to mass produce cheaper items such as buttons, toys, trinkets and <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costume_jewelry.html" title="Costume jewelry">costume jewellery</a>, a proportion of these gave rise to a pejorative use of the word "Brummagem ware" although - such items were not exclusive to the city.</p>
<p>The significant button industry gave rise to the term 'Brummagem button': the 1836 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pickwick_Papers_72b0.html" title="The Pickwick Papers">The Pickwick Papers</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> mentions it as a term for counterfeit silver coins, but Samuel Sidney's 1851 <i>Rides on Railways</i> refers to it as "an old-fashioned nickname for a Birmingham workman".</p>
<p>By the late 19th century, "Brummagem" was still used as a term for Birmingham. Some people still used it as a general term for anything cheap and shoddy disguised as something better. It was used figuratively in this context to refer to moral fakery: for instance, the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">Times</a></i> leader, January 29th 1838, reported Sir <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Peel_d3b1.html" title="Robert Peel">Robert Peel</a>'s slur on an opponent: "[he] knew the sort of Brummagem stuff he had to deal with, treated the pledge and him who made it with utter indifference".</p>
<p>The negative use of the word was included in several dictionaries around the world. It was used figuratively in this context to refer to moral fakery: for instance, the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">Times</a></i> leader, January 29th 1838, reported Sir <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Peel_d3b1.html" title="Robert Peel">Robert Peel</a>'s slur on an opponent: "[he] knew the sort of Brummagem stuff he had to deal with, treated the pledge and him who made it with utter indifference".</p>
<p>"Carts were passing to and fro; groups of Indians squatting on their haunches were chattering together, and displaying to one another the flaring red and yellow handkerchiefs, the scarlet blankets, and muskets of the most worthless Brummagem make, for which they had been exchanging their bits of gold, while their squaws looked on with the most perfect indifference." (J. Tyrwhitt Brooks, <i>California</i>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13001/13001.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13001/13001.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).</p>
<p>"The equipages were generally much more gorgeous than at a later period, when democracy invaded the parks, and introduced what may be termed a "brummagem society," with shabby-genteel carriages and servants." (Rees Howell Gronow, <i>The Reminiscences of Captain Gronow</i>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/grnow10.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/grnow10.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</p>
<p>"The furs, fossil ivory, sheepskins and brick tea brought by them after voyages often reaching a year and eighteen months, come, strictly enough, under the head of raw products. Still, it is the best they can bring; which cannot be said of what Europe offers in exchange — articles mostly of the class and quality succinctly described as "Brummagem." (Description of a trade fair, <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13655/13655.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13655/13655.txt" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</p>
<p>The term was not always used with negative meaning, Jeffrey Farnol wrote: <i>"A belt, now," he suggested mournfully, "a fine leather belt wi' a steel buckle made in Brummagem as ever was, and all for a shillin'; what d'ye say to a fine belt?"</i> ('The Broad Highway'<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/jeffrey-farnol/broad-highway/16/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.online-literature.com/jeffrey-farnol/broad-highway/16/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</p>
<p>and The Rev. Richard H. Barham: <i>"He whipp'd out his oyster-knife, broad and keen</i> A Brummagem blade which he always bore, To aid him to eat, By way of a treat, The 'natives' he found on the Red Sea shore;</p>
<p>He whipp'd out his Brummagem blade so keen, And he made three slits in the Buffalo's hide, And all its contents, Through the rents, and the vents, Come tumbling out,-- and away they all hied!" <i>('The Ingoldsby Legends' <a href="http://www.exclassics.com/ingold/ing48.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exclassics.com/ingold/ing48.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></i></p>
<p>However, as shown by James Dobbs' song <i>I can't find Brummagem</i> (see below), it remained in use as a geographical name for the city.</p>
<p>The Birmingham politician <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Chamberlain_64d0.html" title="Joseph Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> was nicknamed 'Brummagem Joe' (affectionately or satirically depending on the speaker). See, for instance, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, Aug 06, 1895: "'Chamberlain and his crew' dominated the city ... Mr Geard thought it was advisable to have a candidate against 'Brummagem Joe'".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brummagem.html" title="Edit section: Modern usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern usage</span></h2>
<p>"Brummagem" remained a staple of British political and critical discourse into the early 20th century: <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, August 13, 1901 quoted a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> speech by a Mr MacNeill, "The initiative of the Bill... had the "Brummagem" brand from top to bottom. It was a mean attempt, inspired by the absurd and vulgar spirit of Imperialism, to subsidize the Crown with a parvenu title, and a tawdry gewgaw reputation".</p>
<p>A <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punch_magazine.html" title="Punch magazine">Punch</a></i> book review for December <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> said: "But, to be honest, the others (with the exception of one quaint little comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, too full of snakes and hidden treasure and general tawdriness—the kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one used to associate chiefly with the Earl's Court Exhibition. Mrs. PERRIN must not mingle her genuine native goods with such Brummagem ware".</p>
<p>By the late 20th century and 21st century, British usage had shifted toward a purely geographical and even positive sense. The Housing Design Awards 1998 said of one Birmingham project, City Heights, "this gutsy Brummagem bruiser of a building handles its landmark status with ease and assurance". In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> "Notes from the touchline" sport report, March 21, 2003, journalist Frank Keating used the headline "World Cup shines with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_words.html" title="Australian words">dinkum</a> Brummagem" to praise the performance of Birmingham-born Australian cricketer <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Symonds_3d27.html" title="Andrew Symonds">Andrew Symonds</a>.</p>
<p>A particular activist in reclaiming the term as a traditional name reflecting positive aspects of the city's heritage is historian <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Chinn_c47e.html" title="Carl Chinn">Carl Chinn</a> <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">MBE</a>, Professor of Community History at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Birmingham_7145.html" title="University of Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>, who produces <i>Brummagem Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>In the USA, the negative usage appears to have been longer-lasting. <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Scott_Fitzgerald_ccfe.html" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>'s 1922 novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beautiful_and_Damned_7e75.html" title="The Beautiful and Damned">The Beautiful and Damned</a> uses the word twice: "It was one of the type known as 'tourist' cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman ... a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive". <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Seldes_d2da.html" title="Gilbert Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a>, in his 1924 book <i>The Seven Lively Arts</i>, wrote in praise of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krazy_Kat_dd6c.html" title="Krazy Kat">Krazy Kat</a>: "everything paste and brummagem has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed".</p>
<p>Currently US collectors of political memorabilia use "brummagem" to refer to imitations.
