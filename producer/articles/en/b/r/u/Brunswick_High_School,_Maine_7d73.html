<p>Brunswick High School's dress code does not require students to wear uniforms. For the most part teachers are fairly laid back in terms of kids wearing hats in class; however, they do occasionally tell boys to pull their pants up. There are also certain rules about wearing shirts with drug references, but teachers donâ€™t usually read their pupils t-shirts or enforce it in any way.</p>

<p>The band is currently under the direction of Ray Libby, and the chorus under Darren Avery. They have both lead many students to participate in activities such as the District Three Jazz Festival, and the Maine All-State festival. Mr. Libby, in addition to his three band classes and the Jazz Band, also takes his band to sporting events where they play in the pep band for Brunswick. During classes he occasionally has them take playing tests on the computers with a program called Smart Music.</p>

<p>Pamela Leddy is the play director at Brunswick High School. She puts on a play in the fall and a musical in the spring. For the 2006-2007 school year she put on The Diary of Anne Frank as the play, and is putting on <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guys_and_Dolls_da75.html" title="Guys and Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a>.</p>

<p>Every morning there are announcements that ring out over Brunswick High on the PA system. Some teachers turn on the television to watch the student read the announcements. At the start of year certain students sign up for "Morning Announcements Program" where they not only read the Announcements of the television every morning, but they learn how to run the cameras and programs on the computer. There are no reading capability requirements so the readers of the announcements are not always the best in the world, and they end up butchering countless names and reading perfectly simple announcements completely incorrectly.</p>

<p>Brunswick High School has a long-time vicious rivalry with neighboring city of Bath's, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_High_School_803b.html" title="Morse High School">Morse High School</a>. The rivalry dates back to the early 1900's. The Brunswick/Morse rivalry is one of the oldest and well-known in the state.</p>
<p>Brunswick also has a rivalry with neighboring city of Tospham's, Mt. Ararat High School. This rivalry is known as the "Battle of the Bridge", hence the fact that the two towns are connected by one bridge. There is also an annual football game dubbed "Battle of the Bridge" between the two teams. In this rivalry game, Brunswick has defeated the 'Rats for as long as anyone can remember.</p>

<p>The cafeteria is a source of food for many Brunswick High students. In the middle of the cafeteria there is a large serving table that has salad dressings, ketchup, mustard, some pickles, and a few other things that students like to put on their lunches. Next to that there previously sat a table at which there was 3 loaves of bread, two jars of peanut butter, and two jars of jelly. Students would come in, take some bread, make their own sandwiches, and eat them; However, the school, for no apparent reason, randomly got rid of it. The 2006-2007 school year started and the students came into lunch prepared for their usual, but were bewildered as to where and why the sandwiches had gone. The bread club was formed in protest to the lack of peanut butter and jelly sandwich's in the lunch room and is now building momentum as a club.</p>
