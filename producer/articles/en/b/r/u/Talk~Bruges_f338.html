<p>"Brugge (a name probably signifying <i>landing stage</i>)"</p>
<p>Probably not. <i>Brugge</i> is just old <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_dialect.html" title="Flemish dialect">Flemish dialect</a> for the word <i>brug</i>, which means <i>bridge</i> in English. Brugge is also know as the <i>Venice of the north</i> because the town has a lot of canals, and, as a consequence, an awful lot of bridges. Hence the name.</p>
<p>I agree. The modern Dutch for <i>bridge</i> is <i>brug</i> and the plural is <i>bruggen</i>. In Afrikaans, decended from Dutch, <i>bridge</i> is also <i>brug</i> and <i>bridges</i> can be either <i>brûe</i> or <i>brugge</i>. Perhaps in the old dialect it did mean "landing stage" but in the modern decendant languages it is certainly more like "bridges".</p>
<p>&gt; I do not agree. Brugge is not an old <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish.html" title="Flemish">Flemish</a> word, but it's an old Scandinavian word which indeed means landing stage, or more accurate 'fordable place'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBruges_f338.html" title="Edit section: Medieval buildings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval buildings</span></h2>
<p>There is no such thing in Bruges as truly "medieval" architecture. First, one could dispute the termini ab quo and ad quem of the Medieval Ages, in this case, I would say that the terminus ad quem would be the late 15th century.</p>
<p>Second, most buildings date back well after the 15th century. Most were build in the 17th - 20th century. But the 19th century defined the current 'architectural look' of the city. Yet, truly "medieval" buildings are probably the churches (Saint Salvator, Our Lady Church, Jerusalem Church, etc.) although these were constructed and heavily modified over time.</p>
<p>Even the belfry was erected in several phases and it's current state doesn't resemble how it looked in i.e. the 14th century (to be exact, the belfry burned down in 1281 and was reconstructed later on).</p>
<p>Other monuments like those around the 'Burg' date back to the 18th and 19th century and the former 'Medieval' Sint-Donaas church that would dominate the Burg, was demolished during the French Revolution.</p>
<p>So, in retrospect: Bruges is rather a palette of different architectural styles from different periodes then a truly "medieval only" city. A faux feature that's being played out quite well nonetheless in order to attract tourists worldwide.</p>

<p>Downes51 recently altered all refs from "Bruges" to "Brugge", with the comment "<i>Nobody refers to Brugge as Bruges except Francophones and those English who know no better.</i>" Maybe, but this <b>is</b> <i>English</i> wiki and I would argue its first audience is English speaking. Everyone I know here in Britain refers to the town as "Bruges" and when looking for info would expect it to be listed under that name and use it in its text. A minority of Brits are aware of the language issue in Belgium. Those who are aware, try to be respectful (helped by the widespread comprehension of English), but still refer to "Bruges" - much in the same as we refer to "Munchen" as "Munich", "Roma" as "Rome", etc. I argue that it's improper to impose a relatively unfamiliar and unused term, without debate and consensus; it's just unfortunate that our original perception of Flanders was through Francophones. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 18:48, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I'm puzzled that you cancelled my edits changing Bruges to Brugge (pronounced Brooker). For the last 5 years I've lived in Flanders on and off, and it's a simple fact that I've never heard it called Bruges, neither will you see Bruges on a road sign anywhere within Belgium. It is also a fact that referring to Flanders (ie Flemish-speaking) towns by their French names is very irritating to local sensibilities. Calling Brugge "Bruges" makes as much sense as calling London "Londres"! <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDownes51_41f7.html" title="User:Downes51">downes51</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Several points on this:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Francophiles can call London what they like - if the French for London is Londres, that's ok, I have no right to comment on or criticise French usage</li>
<li>This is English language Wilipedia: "Bruges" is the English for "Brugge", as Munich is for Munchen, Rome for Roma, Dunkirk for Dunkerque, etc</li>
<li>I was in Bruges this year and when we were spoken to in English, "Bruges" was used</li>
<li>The official municipal English-language website refers to "Bruges"</li>
<li>I'm sure that all Belgian main road signs are bilingual as in Bruges/Brugge, Ypres/Ieper, Namur/Namen, etc - but I can't argue on this one</li>
<li>Have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages:_B" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages:_B" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>Flemish colleagues tell me they speak Dutch, not Flemish. They were <b>very</b> definite about this.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>No offence is intended, I just get irritated when told how to use my own language. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 19:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>No offence intended either (and not taken). We are just going to have to disagree about this. But in relation to your above points (1) I'm sure you mean Francophones not Francophiles, but in any event my intention was to point out how silly it would be for we Brits to refer to our capital as Londres! The French can use whatever word they like amongst themselves. (2 and 3) You are right, but we are all wrong. Mumbai was Bombay until very recently for example. The process of public education cannot start early enough and this is as good a place as any. (5) You will just have to take my word for this.... in Flanders the road signs are all in Flemish (or Dutch if you prefer!), and in the Ardennes (Wallonia) they are all in French. Even in Brussel which is technically in Flanders (in fact it's the capital but French speakers are probably more abundant) you will see no road signs in any other language than Flemish. And the instant you cross the boundary from Vlaams-Brabant to Brabant-Wallonie the signs directing you to 'Namen' suddenly change to Namur. Driving north the signs change from Anvers to Antwerpen. It's just the way it is. In the 1970s when I used to travel on these roads for the first time the signs were bi-lingual. But what used to happen was that Vlaams-speakers would use black paint to obliterate the French placenames. And then the French-speakers would do the same with the Flemish words with the result that all the road signs ended up completely black! It seemed quite funny really, but the political settlement arrived at since then has (IMO) arrived at a workable compromise. I'm new here, hope this isn't too long. <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDownes51_41f7.html" title="User:Downes51">Downes51</a></dd>

<dd>Usage in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> is not relevant here since this is an English encyclopedia. This being said, the guideline of using the English version of a city’s name when it exists may not always be the best one to follow either, as exemplified by <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> instead of <a href="../../../p/e/k/Peking.html" title="Peking">Peking</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechelen.html" title="Mechelen">Mechelen</a> instead of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechlin.html" title="Mechlin">Mechlin</a>. In both those examples, usage by Anglophones is what counts rather than the existence of an English translation. Although there is no good measure for usage, the “Language Tools” offered by Google could be used as a substitute. Warning: just specifying “pages written in English” is not sufficient as there are still many non-English pages that are somehow picked up. By specifying both “pages written in English” <i>and</i> “pages located in” a mostly Anglophone country (UK, USA, Ireland, Australia…), we get a better and more detailed picture. Not quite perfect yet as we pick up other meanings of the word such as Mr. Bruges and Mr. Brugge, but in this case these are luckily very few (Gent would be more problematic as that word has many more meanings in English than <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a>).

<dd>These results vary from hour to hour and have to be taken with a grain of salt. In a rough sense, however, they seem to indicate that in Britain and Ireland, usage of the word “Brugge” is lagging quite a bit behind “Bruges”, while in the US, both words are used roughly equally. Based on this, I would stick with Bruges for now and revisit the question from time to time… As for <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, the same method of measuring English usage shows it beating Bombay by a wide margin. <a href="../../../l/v/a/User%7ELVan_aaa8.html" title="User:LVan">LVan</a> 02:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Downes51 wrote, "Even in Brussel which is technically in Flanders (in fact it's the capital but French speakers are probably more abundant) you will see no road signs in any other language than Flemish." This is very incorrect: Brussels used to be a Dutch-speaking place in <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Brabant_49e1.html" title="Duchy of Brabant">Brabant</a> at a time that 'Flanders' was not yet generalized for Dutch-speaking Belgium; and is not part of the current <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Region_b0db.html" title="Flemish Region">region Flanders</a> either, it is a region on its own which is <i>officially</i> bilingual. Thus despite of its present near-90% majority of French-speaking inhabitants, every official road sign and official publication is in both French and Dutch. Indeed, the capital of Flanders (region and community) is <i>outside</i> the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Region_b0db.html" title="Flemish Region">Flemish Region</a>; though the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Community_3929.html" title="Flemish Community">Flemish Community</a> comprises the matters for speakers of Dutch in the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels-Capital_Region_8ac9.html" title="Brussels-Capital Region">Brussels-Capital Region</a>. Originally, <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechelen.html" title="Mechelen">Mechelen</a> was the capital of the Flemish Region; like nearly half a millenium earlier for the capital of the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundian_Netherlands_08f1.html" title="Burgundian Netherlands">Burgundian Netherlands</a>, the capital was moved to Brussels: Flanders wished to express its holding on to the Flemish Community in Brussels. Brussels is also the capital of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Community_of_Belgium_b647.html" title="French Community of Belgium">French Community</a> though not of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallonia.html" title="Wallonia">Wallonia</a> which has <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namur.html" title="Namur">Namur</a> as capital.</dd>
<dd>I'm rather pleasantly surprised at LVan's statistics for so far I almost never heard 'Brugge' from an English mouth. On the other hand, times change: my own home town in its most famous 16th century used to be known in England only as 'Mechlin'; when as such forgotten except by the most well-informed, early tourists in the '<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle_%C3%89poque_1c61.html" title="Belle Époque">Belle Époque</a>' learnt about it as 'Malines', its French name. Nowadays, the latter has become obsolete and the city is again best known and now also usually spelled by its native name 'Mechelen' which speakers of English pronounce the way they say 'Mechlin'. It looks like such is going on for Bruges becoming Brugge though as LVan indicated, we should not lead but follow practice. The statistics however do indicate that the article introduction must mention e.g. <b>Bruges</b> by its <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> name, or at present also in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> often called <b>Brugge</b> by its native <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a> name which assumedly used to signify <i>landing stage</i>, is ...

<dd>Well that just shows what I know then. They must just all be <i>unofficial</i> road signs I see when driving in the Brussel area. I checked some of them today... I wish somebody would take them down! More seriously, LVan put his finger on it when he said "Usage in Flanders is not relevant here since this is an English encyclopedia." What I have been on about, and maybe it's a foolish <i>idee fixe</i> on my part, is the absurd situation whereby English speakers use a French word to name a city where French is merely understood (I nearly said tolerated) rather than spoken. And there is a practical aspect too, namely that anybody driving in Belgium hoping to find a road-sign pointing to Bruges is not going to be able to find it. We've probably done this to death now, I don't expect to contribute further on this matter, which doubtless will be a relief to many. <a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDownes51_41f7.html" title="User:Downes51">downes51</a></dd>

We are coming up with the silliest arguments here due to a Dutch/French issue some contributors have, that would not occurs in other articles outside of the Belgian linguistics realm. Since when are road signs in English in Belgium? Bruges is English, just like <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flushing%2C_Netherlands_376a.html" title="Flushing, Netherlands">Flushing</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a>, ... and has been for centuries.

Hence the names of travel guides like the Lonely Planet<a href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=2951&amp;affil=lpdp" class="external autonumber" title="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=2951&amp;affil=lpdp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Rough Guide<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rough-Guide-Brussels-Including-Miniguides/dp/1858286832" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rough-Guide-Brussels-Including-Miniguides/dp/1858286832" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, Eyewitness<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brussels-Eyewitness-Travel-Guides-Publishing/dp/0789495600" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Brussels-Eyewitness-Travel-Guides-Publishing/dp/0789495600" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> or the New York Times / Frommers<a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/belgium/bruges/overview.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/belgium/bruges/overview.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Travel guides will <i>probably</i> try to use the most common, best known name, not some obscure old French variation which their audience does not use... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't suggesting we use the archaic <i>Brugges</i>. I’m just saying Bruges might not be from French but from Dutch, with an evolution similar to the French name through centuries. --<a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 14:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In a perfect world each city 'd have the same name in all languages. It would make life very easy and it would be quite entertaining if we could hear the english and french desperately trying to pronounce "Brugge" (with its soft "g") the same way as we Flemings do (just kidding&#160;;-)</dd>
<dd>Seriously, it is not a perfect world, and since "Bruges" is the name the English use for "Brugge", the name in the English wiki should be "Bruges", just like the Dutch page on London should be "Londen" and the page on Paris "Parijs".</dd>
<dd>I too am Flemish, and although I see the french imperialist nature from up close every day (meaning that by refusing or being incapable to learn/speak the language of the Flemish town they move to, they slowly turn it into a French speaking one), I don't think that the fact that Bruges is an originally French name matters here.</dd>
<dd>And oh, one more thing. I live just outside Brussels, and ALL the official road signs in Brussels are in fact bilingual by law. Exclusively Flemish road signs in Brussels would result in catastrophy because the french speaking population would be unable to read any of them *LOL* 81.88.110.49 14:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
