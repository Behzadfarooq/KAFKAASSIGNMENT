<p>Chatwin was born on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">13 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> at his maternal grandparents' house in <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dronfield.html" title="Dronfield">Dronfield</a>, near <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. His mother, Margharita (<i>née</i> Turnell), had left the family home at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnt_Green_5af7.html" title="Barnt Green">Barnt Green</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, and moved to her parents home when Chatwin's father, Charles Chatwin, went away to serve with the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_Reserve_4a0f.html" title="Royal Naval Reserve">Royal Naval Reserves</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He spent his early childhood living in West Heath in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> (then in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>), where his father had a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">Law practice</a>. He was educated at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlborough_College_dfdc.html" title="Marlborough College">Marlborough College</a>, in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiltshire.html" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>After leaving Marlborough College in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, Chatwin reluctantly moved to London to work as a porter in the Works of Art department at the auction house <a href="../../../s/o/t/Sotheby%27s.html" title="Sotheby's">Sotheby's</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Thanks to his sharp visual acuity, he quickly became Sotheby's expert on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionist.html" title="Impressionist">Impressionist</a> art. He later became a director of the company.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> he began to suffer from problems with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of artwork entailed by his job. He consulted eye specialist <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Trevor-Roper_cd4a.html" title="Patrick Trevor-Roper">Patrick Trevor-Roper</a> who discovered that Chatwin had a latent <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabismus.html" title="Strabismus">squint</a>. He recommended that Chatwin take a six month break from his work at Sotheby's. Trevor-Roper had been involved in the design of an eye hospital in <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addis_Ababa_a075.html" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, and suggested Chatwin visit east Africa. In February <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, Chatwin left for the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> On his return, Chatwin quickly became disenchanted with the art world, and turned his interest instead to archaeology. He resigned from his job at Sotheby's in the early summer of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chatwin enrolled at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Edinburgh_53c2.html" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> to study archaeology in October 1966.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>, he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome, and spent only two years in the city, leaving without taking a degree.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Chatwin was hired by the <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Times_Magazine_841c.html" title="Sunday Times Magazine">Sunday Times Magazine</a></i> as an adviser on art and architecture.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> His association with the magazine cultivated his narrative skills and he traveled on many international assignments, writing on such subjects as <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algerian</a> migrant workers and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Wall_of_China_a878.html" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall of China</a>, and interviewing such diverse people as <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Malraux_ebba.html" title="André Malraux">André Malraux</a><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>, in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadezhda_Mandelstam_d849.html" title="Nadezhda Mandelstam">Nadezhda Mandelstam</a><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>, in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>In 1972, Chatwin interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer <a href="../../../e/i/l/Eileen_Gray_0d9b.html" title="Eileen Gray">Eileen Gray</a> in her <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> salon, where he noticed a map of the area of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> called <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patagonia.html" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> which she had painted.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> "I've always wanted to go there," Bruce told her. "So have I," she replied, "go there for me". Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and reached Patagonia a month later.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> When he arrived there he severed himself from the newspaper with a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegram.html" title="Telegram">telegram</a>: "Have gone to Patagonia". He spent six months there, a trip which resulted in the book <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Patagonia_a094.html" title="In Patagonia">In Patagonia</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>), which established his reputation as a travel writer. Later, however, residents in the region came forward to contradict the events depicted in Chatwin's book. It was the first, but not the last time in his career, that conversations and characters that Chatwin reported as true, were alleged to be just fiction.</p>
<p>Later works included a fictionalised study of the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_trade.html" title="Slave trade">slave trade</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Viceroy_of_Ouidah_14bd.html" title="The Viceroy of Ouidah">The Viceroy of Ouidah</a></i>, which he researched with extended stays in the West African state of Benin. For <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Songlines_bd7e.html" title="The Songlines">The Songlines</a></i>, Chatwin went to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> to develop the thesis that the songs of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Aborigines</a> are a cross between a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_myth.html" title="Creation myth">creation myth</a>, an <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas.html" title="Atlas">atlas</a> and an Aboriginal man's personal story. <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_The_Black_Hill_e8f6.html" title="On The Black Hill">On the Black Hill</a></i> was set closer to home, in the hill farms of the Welsh Borders, and focuses on the relationship between twin brothers, Lewis and Benjamin, who grow up isolated from the course of twentieth century history. <i><a href="../../../u/t/z/Utz_%28novel%29.html" title="Utz (novel)">Utz</a></i>, his last book, was a fictional take on the obsession which leads people to collect. Set in <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>, the novel details the life and death of Kaspar Utz, a man obsessed with the collection of <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meissen.html" title="Meissen">Meissen</a> <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porcelain.html" title="Porcelain">porcelain</a>. Chatwin was working on a number of new ideas for future novels at the time of his death in 1989, including a trans-continental epic, provisionally titled "Lydia Livingstone".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Chatwin_950c.html" title="Edit section: Style and influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Style and influence</span></h2>
<p>Chatwin is admired for his spare, lapidary style and his innate story-telling abilities. However, he has also been strongly criticized for his fictionalized anecdotes of real people, places, and events. Frequently, the people he wrote about recognized themselves and did not always appreciate his distortions of their culture and behaviour. Chatwin, however, was philosophical about what he saw as an unavoidable dilemma, arguing that his portrayals were not intended to be faithful representations; as Nicholas Shakespeare, his biographer, argues: 'He tells not a half truth, but a truth and a half.'</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of many of his friends, Chatwin married Elizabeth Chanler on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">26 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> He had met Elizabeth at Sotheby's where she worked as a secretary. Chatwin was <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> throughout his entire married life, a circumstance that Elizabeth knew and accepted. They had no children, and after fifteen years of marriage, she asked for a separation and sold their <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmhouse.html" title="Farmhouse">farmhouse</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> However, towards the end of his life they reconciled.</p>
<p>Chatwin was known as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialite.html" title="Socialite">socialite</a> in addition to being a famous travel author. His circle of friends extended far and wide and he was renowned for accepting hospitality and patronage from a powerful set of friends and allies. Penelope Betjeman - wife of the poet laureate <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Betjeman_ea3c.html" title="John Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> - showed him the border country of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and thereby helped to contribute to the gestation of the book that would become <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_The_Black_Hill_e8f6.html" title="On The Black Hill">On the Black Hill</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Tom Maschler, the publisher, was also a patron to Chatwin during this time, lending him his house in the area as a writing retreat.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Later, he visited <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Leigh_Fermor_4a9b.html" title="Patrick Leigh Fermor">Patrick Leigh Fermor</a>, in his house near Kardamyli, in the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnese.html" title="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Chatwin developed <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. He was one of the first high-profile sufferers of the disease in Britain and although he hid the illness - passing off his symptoms as <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungal_infection.html" title="Fungal infection">fungal infections</a> or the effects of the bite of a Chinese <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat.html" title="Bat">bat</a>, a typically exotic cover story - it was a poorly kept secret. He did not respond well to <a href="../../../a/z/t/AZT_8980.html" title="AZT">AZT</a>, and with his condition deteriorating rapidly, Chatwin and his wife went to live in the South of France at the house that belonged to the mother of his one-time lover, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper_Conran_f15e.html" title="Jasper Conran">Jasper Conran</a>. There, during his final months, Chatwin was nursed by both his wife and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Conran_ca96.html" title="Shirley Conran">Shirley Conran</a>. He died in <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice.html" title="Nice">Nice</a> in 1989 at age 48.</p>
<p>A memorial was held in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Orthodox_fe07.html" title="Greek Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> Church in West London on the same day that a <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatwa.html" title="Fatwa">fatwa</a> was announced on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_Rushdie_d1a4.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, a close friend of Chatwin's who was in attendance. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Theroux_26c6.html" title="Paul Theroux">Paul Theroux</a>, Chatwin's one-time friend and fellow-writer, wrote about this event in an issue of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granta.html" title="Granta">Granta</a>, condemning Chatwin, also, for failing to acknowledge that the disease he was dying of, was AIDS.</p>
<p>Chatwin's funeral was also attended by the novelist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Amis_4f64.html" title="Martin Amis">Martin Amis</a> who describes the memorial in his essay <i>Salman Rushdie</i>, from the anthology "Visiting Mrs. Nabokov".</p>
