<li>"Without (the split-finger fastball), I would've been, at best, a Double-A player. If they told me it would hurt my arm if I threw it, I'd do it all over again." - Sutter</li>
<li>"I remember going through the minor leagues with <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Krukow_03cc.html" title="Mike Krukow">Mike Krukow</a>. All we wanted was to pitch one day in the major leagues.

If we gave up 100 home runs, we figured that we would have stuck around awhile." - Sutter (However, Sutter only gave up 77 home runs)</li>
<li>"You never think that giving up two home runs to the same guy helped you get in the Hall of Fame.
