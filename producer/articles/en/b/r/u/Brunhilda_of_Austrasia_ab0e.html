<p>She was possibly born about 543 in <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo%2C_Spain_b164.html" title="Toledo, Spain">Toledo</a>, the Visigothic capital, the daughter of the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoth.html" title="Visigoth">Visigoth</a> king <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanagild.html" title="Athanagild">Athanagild</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingonde_the_Visigoth_c0a6.html" title="Ingonde the Visigoth">Ingund</a>, his queen. She was the younger of his two daughters. She was only eleven years old when her father was elevated to the kingship (554). She was educated in Toledo as an <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arian Christian</a>.</p>
<p><a name="First_marriage" id="First_marriage"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunhilda_of_Austrasia_ab0e.html" title="Edit section: First marriage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First marriage</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../5/6/7/567.html" title="567">567</a>, she was married to king <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigebert_I_1ac9.html" title="Sigebert I">Sigebert I</a> of Austrasia, a grandson of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_I_25db.html" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> who had sent an embassy to Toledo loaded with gifts. She joined him at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metz.html" title="Metz">Metz</a>. Upon her marriage, she abjured Arianism and converted to orthodox <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sigebert's father, <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clotaire_I_4190.html" title="Clotaire I">Clotaire I</a>, had reunited the four kingdoms of the Franks, but when he died, Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. According to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_of_Tours_cdfe.html" title="Gregory of Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>, Sigebert's marriage to a Visigothic princess was a criticism of his brothers' choices in wives. Instead of marrying low-born and promiscuous women, Sigebert contracted a princess of education and morals.</p>
<p>In response to Sigebert's noble marriage, his brother King <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilperic_I_0a29.html" title="Chilperic I">Chilperic</a> of <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soissons.html" title="Soissons">Soissons</a> sent to Spain for Brunhilda's sister, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galswintha.html" title="Galswintha">Galswintha</a>. Gregory of Tours suggests that he proposed because he envied his brother's marriage to Brunhilda.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, Galswintha ordered him to purge his court of prostitutes and mistresses and he soon grew tired of her. He and his favourite mistress, one <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fredegund.html" title="Fredegund">Fredegund</a>, conspired to murder her within the year. He then married Fredegund. Brunhilda so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister—and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated—that the two queens persuaded their husbands to go to war.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Sigebert persuaded their other brother, the elder <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guntram.html" title="Guntram">Guntram</a> of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundy.html" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, to mediate the dispute between the queens. He decided that Galswintha's <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dower.html" title="Dower">dower</a> of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux.html" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges.html" title="Limoges">Limoges</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahors.html" title="Cahors">Cahors</a>, <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/a/B%C3%A9arn.html" title="Béarn">Béarn</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigorre.html" title="Bigorre">Bigorre</a> should be turned over to Brunhilda in restitution. However, Chilperic did not easily give up the cities and Brunhilda did not forget the murder. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germain_of_Paris_5d29.html" title="Germain of Paris">Germanus</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Paris_faf9.html" title="Bishop of Paris">Bishop of Paris</a>, negotiated a brief peace between them. Between <a href="../../../5/6/7/567.html" title="567">567</a> and <a href="../../../5/7/0/570.html" title="570">570</a>, Brunhilda bore Sigebert three children: Ingund, Chlodosind, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childebert_II_4dbc.html" title="Childebert II">Childebert</a>.</p>
<p>The peace was then broken by Chilperic, who invaded the Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournai.html" title="Tournai">Tournai</a>. The people of Paris hailed Sigebert as a conqueror when he went there with Brunhilda and their children. Germanus wrote to Brunhilda, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of Germanus' life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitry.html" title="Vitry">Vitry</a> with poisoned daggers (<a href="../../../s/c/r/Scramasax.html" title="Scramasax">scramasaxi</a>, according to Gregory). Brunhilda was captured and imprisoned at <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouen.html" title="Rouen">Rouen</a>.</p>

<p>When, after disobeying his father's direct orders, Merovech, son of Chilperic and Audovera, went to Rouen on pretext of visiting his mother, he fell in love with the widowed Brunhilda. Thus he strengthened his chances of becoming a king. His stepmother was determined that only her sons should succeed as kings, and she eliminated her husband's sons by other women. They were married by the bishop <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praetextatus.html" title="Praetextatus">Praetextatus</a> to prevent a scandal, though the marriage was contrary to canon law, as Gregory is quick to note,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> she being his aunt. Quickly, Chilperic besieged them in the church of St Martin on the walls. Eventually he made peace with them, but he took Merovech away with him to Soissons.</p>
<p>In an effort to nullify the marriage, Chilperic had Merovech <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonsure.html" title="Tonsure">tonsured</a> and sent to the monastery of <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Mans_de31.html" title="Le Mans">Le Mans</a> to become a priest. Merovech fled to the sanctuary of St Martin at Tours, the church of Gregory (who is thus an eyewitness to these events),<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> and later <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne_%28region%29.html" title="Champagne (region)">Champagne</a>. He finally returned to Tours in <a href="../../../5/7/8/578.html" title="578">578</a>, and when his bid for power failed, he asked his servant to kill him.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Brunhilda now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childebert_II_4dbc.html" title="Childebert II">Childebert II</a>, but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire briefly to the court of Guntram of Burgundy before obtaining her goal. At that time, she ruled Austrasia as queen. Not being a fighter, she was primarily an administrative reformer, with a Visigothic education. She repaired the old Roman roads, built many churches and abbeys, constructed the necessary fortresses, reorganised the royal finances, and restructured the royal army. However, she antagonised the nobles by her continued imposition of royal authority wherever it was lax. To reinforce her positions and the crown's prestige and power, she convinced Guntram, newly heirless, to adopt Childebert as his own son and heir. This he did in <a href="../../../5/7/7/577.html" title="577">577</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> In <a href="../../../5/7/9/579.html" title="579">579</a>, she married her daughter Ingunda, then only thirteen, to the Visigothic prince <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermenegild.html" title="Hermenegild">Hermenegild</a>, allying her house to that of the king of her native land. However, Hermenegild converted to Catholicism and he and his wife both died in the ensuing religious wars which tore apart the Visigothic kingdom in Spain.</p>
<p>Brunhilda ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in <a href="../../../5/8/3/583.html" title="583">583</a>, at the traditional Merovingian majority of thirteen.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunhilda_of_Austrasia_ab0e.html" title="Edit section: Relations with King Guntram">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relations with King Guntram</span></h3>
<p>The conflict with Fredegund flared up once more upon the death of Chilperic. Now in the regency in Neustria, Fredegund was in a position to renew the war with her old enemy. Firstly, however, Brunhilda had to deal with her own internal enemies.</p>
<p>Many of the dukes opposed strongly her influence over her son, the king. Three of them—Rauching, Ursio, and Berthefrid—conspired to assassinate Childebert; however, their plot was found out. Rauching was killed and Ursio and Berthefrid fled to a fortress. Upon this, Guntram immediately begged for Childebert, Brunhilda, and Childebert's new sons to take refuge at his court. This they did and soon Ursio and Berthefrid were killed. In <a href="../../../5/8/7/587.html" title="587">587</a>, Guntram, Childebert, and Brunhild settled the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pact_of_Andelot_76d8.html" title="Pact of Andelot">Pact of Andelot</a><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> securing for Childebert the Burgundian succession and a continuing alliance of the two realms for the rest of Guntram's life.</p>
<p>In that same year, King <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reccared_I_99e3.html" title="Reccared I">Reccared I</a> of the Visigoths sent embassies to both Childebert and Guntram, the former accepting them and consolidating an alliance and the latter refusing to see them for some reason or another. Thus, when Brunhilda and Childebert negotiated a marriage for the king's sister Chlodosind with the king of Spain, it was rejected by Guntram and abandoned. In <a href="../../../5/9/2/592.html" title="592">592</a>, Guntram died and Childebert, as per the treaty, succeeded to his kingdom, immediately making war on Clotaire of Neustria.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunhilda_of_Austrasia_ab0e.html" title="Edit section: Second regency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second regency</span></h3>
<p>Upon Childebert's death in September or October <a href="../../../5/9/5/595.html" title="595">595</a> at the age of only twenty-six, Brunhilda attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theudebert_II_d789.html" title="Theudebert II">Theudebert II</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theuderic_II_a9b7.html" title="Theuderic II">Theuderic II</a>, respectively. Though she attributed the death of Childebert to Fredegund, the latter died in <a href="../../../5/9/7/597.html" title="597">597</a> and the direct conflict between her and Brunhilda ended. Peace would elude the Franks, however, for many years more as the conflict raged between the two queens' descendants.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../5/9/9/599.html" title="599">599</a>, Brunhilda's eldest grandson, Theudebert, at whose court she was staying, exiled her. She was found wandering near <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcis.html" title="Arcis">Arcis</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne_%28region%29.html" title="Champagne (region)">Champagne</a> by a peasant, who brought her to Theuderic. The peasant was rewarded with the bishopric of <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxerre.html" title="Auxerre">Auxerre</a>, as the legend goes. Theuderic welcomed her and readily fell under her influence, which was inclined to vengeful war with Theudebert at the time. Soon the brothers were at war.</p>
<p>It is at this point that Brunhilda begins to display that ruthlessness which led to her especially violent demise. Brunhilda first took to herself <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protadius.html" title="Protadius">Protadius</a> as lover and, desiring to promote him to high office, conspired to have <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berthoald.html" title="Berthoald">Berthoald</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_the_palace.html" title="Mayor of the palace">mayor of the palace</a>, killed. In <a href="../../../6/0/4/604.html" title="604">604</a>, she convinced Theuderic to send Berthoald to inspect the royal <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa.html" title="Villa">villae</a></i> along the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seine.html" title="Seine">Seine</a>. Clotaire, probably alerted by men of Brunhilda's bidding, sent his own mayor <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landric.html" title="Landric">Landric</a> (ironically, a former paramour of Fredegund) to meet Berthoald, who had only a small contingent of men with him. Realising that he had been the victim of courtly plotting, Berthoald, in the ensuing confrontation, overchased the enemy till he was surrounded and killed. Protadius was promptly put in his place.</p>
<p>Brunhilda and Protadius soon persuaded Theuderic to return to war with Theudebert, but the mayor was murdered by his warriors, who did not wish to fight to assuage to ego of queen. The man who ordered Protadius' execution, Duke Uncelen, was soon arrested by Brunhilda and tortured and executed. He was not the first ducal victim of the queen's revenges.</p>
<p>It was also during these later regencies that <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desiderius.html" title="Desiderius">Desiderius</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Vienne_6330.html" title="Bishop of Vienne">Bishop of Vienne</a> (later Saint Didier) publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in <a href="../../../6/1/2/612.html" title="612">612</a> before her and Theuderic, with whom she hired three assassins to murder the bishop at the village now called <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne_a1ba.html" title="Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne">Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne</a>.</p>
<p>In that year, at the battle of <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolbiac.html" title="Tolbiac">Tolbiac</a>, Theuderic defeated and captured Theudebert, whom the queen was now claiming was in fact the son of a gardener, and brought him and his royal paraphernalia to his Brunhilda, who had him put up in a monastery. She probably had him murdered (along with his son Merovech) to allow Theuderic to succeed to both thrones unhindered. This he did and died of <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysentery.html" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> in his Austrasian capital of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metz.html" title="Metz">Metz</a> in late <a href="../../../6/1/3/613.html" title="613">613</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunhilda_of_Austrasia_ab0e.html" title="Edit section: Third regency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Third regency</span></h3>
<p>The successor of Theuderic II was his bastard son <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigebert_II_ac83.html" title="Sigebert II">Sigebert</a>, a child. The mayor of the palace of Austrasia, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warnachar.html" title="Warnachar">Warnachar</a>, fearing that at his young age he would fall under the influence of his great-grandmother, brought him before a national assemby, where he was proclaimed by the nobles, who did homage to him over both his father's kingdoms. Nonetheless, he could not be kept out of the hands of Brunhilda. Thus, for the last time in a long life, she was regent of the Franks, this time for her own great-grandson.</p>
<p>But Warnachar and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Rado_%28mayor_of_the_palace%29.html" title="Rado (mayor of the palace)">Rado</a>, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, along with <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepin_of_Landen_d8c7.html" title="Pepin of Landen">Pepin of Landen</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Arnulf_2511.html" title="Saint Arnulf">Saint Arnulf</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Metz_0eb8.html" title="Bishop of Metz">bishop of Metz</a>, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda and the young king and joined with Clotaire, promising not to rise in defence of the queen-regent and recognising Clotaire as rightful regent and guardian of Sigebert. Brunhilda, with Sigebert, met Clotaire's army on the <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisne.html" title="Aisne">Aisne</a>, but the dukes yet again betrayed her: the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrician.html" title="Patrician">Patrician</a> Aletheus, Duke Rocco, and Duke Sigvald deserted her and she and her king had to flee. As far as the Orbe they got, hoping to enlist the aid of certain German tribes, but Clotaire's minions caught up with them by the lake <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuch%C3%A2tel.html" title="Neuchâtel">Neuchâtel</a>. The young king and his brother Corbo were killed. Thus ended the long and bloody feud between Austrasia and Neustria, and reuniting the two kingdoms, Clotaire then had the entire realm of the Franks. Clotaire accused Brunhilda of the death of ten kings of the Franks<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>and many churchmen, including Desiderius. According to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liber_Historiae_Francorum_9860.html" title="Liber Historiae Francorum">Liber Historiae Francorum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted on to a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally she died.

<p>In 576, Sigebert's brother Guntram founded a bishopric that was suffragan of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienne.html" title="Vienne">Vienne</a> at <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurienne.html" title="Maurienne">Maurienne</a>, which belonged to the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">Diocese</a> of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a>. The Bishop of Turin protested this to Brunehaut for more than twenty years but even when <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_I_367c.html" title="Pope Gregory I">Pope Gregory the Great</a> supported his complaint in 599, Brunhilda dismissed it. In general, however, she protected the church and treated Gregory with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her; in 597 he wrote to her about interdicting <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> rites such as <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_worship.html" title="Tree worship">tree worship</a>. Gregory of Tours was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbanus.html" title="Columbanus">Columbanus</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbot.html" title="Abbot">abbot</a> of <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxeuil.html" title="Luxeuil">Luxeuil</a>, whom she eventually exiled to Italy, where he founded <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbio.html" title="Bobbio">Bobbio</a>.</p>
<p>Brunhilda was buried in the Abbaye de St. Martin at <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autun.html" title="Autun">Autun</a> that she founded in <a href="../../../6/0/2/602.html" title="602">602</a> on the spot where the bishop of Tours had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey was destroyed in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a> and Brunhilda's <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcophagus.html" title="Sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> is now in the Musée Lapidaire in <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avignon.html" title="Avignon">Avignon</a>.</p>
<p>Brunhilda commissioned the building of several churches and the abbey of St. Vincent at <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laon.html" title="Laon">Laon</a> (founded in <a href="../../../5/8/0/580.html" title="580">580</a>). She is also credited with founding the castle of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruniquel.html" title="Bruniquel">Bruniquel</a> and having a Roman road resurfaced near Alligny-en-Morvan (where the name of a nearby hill <i>Terreau Bruneau</i> is believed to be derived from hers). The part of Mauves-sur-Loire known as <i>la Fontaine Bruneau</i> is named after Brunehaut who may have cooled herself with the fountain's water when she suffered <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_exhaustion.html" title="Heat exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a>.</p>

<p>Many scholars have seen Brunhilda as inspiration for both <i><a href="../../../b/r/y/Brynhildr.html" title="Brynhildr">Brunnhild</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriemhild.html" title="Kriemhild">Kriemhild</a></i>, two rival characters from the <a href="../../../n/i/b/Nibelungenlied.html" title="Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a>. Kriemhild married <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siegfried.html" title="Siegfried">Siegfried</a>, who in many respects resembles Sigebert, Brunhilda's husband. There is remblance between a multitude of characters and events in the Nibelungenlied and those of the latter half of the sixth century in Merovingian Gaul. As Thomas Hodgkin remarks:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Treasures buried in long departed days by kings of old, mysterious caves, reptile guides or reptile guardians - are we not transported by this strange legend into the very atmosphere of the Niebelungen Lied? And if the good king Gunthram passed for the fortunate finder of the Dragon-hoard, his brothers and their queens, by their wars, their reconciliations and their terrible avengings, must surely have suggested the main argument of that most tragical epic, the very name of one of whose heroines, Brunichildis, is identical with the name of the queen of Austrasia.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></td>
