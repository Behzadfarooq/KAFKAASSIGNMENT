<dd>The wikipedia does have its copyright rules plastered all over, and we tend to think that it would be common sense not to post someone else's work to the site. Sorry if everyone comes out as being a little harsh, the members and admins don't like having the wiki in legal trouble, or caught "borrowing" (taking down the reputation).

<p>Hi. I'm not sure what the purpose of your recent edit of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Bancroft_50c9.html" title="Anne Bancroft">Anne Bancroft</a> was.

<p>Hello, I have no idea why it was deleted: I never saw it. If shouldn't have been speedied on grounds of nobility — that should have gone to VFD. Be careful with the kind of articles you add: both <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourmet_Guides_c488.html" title="Gourmet Guides">Gourmet Guides</a> and Personal Best Inc. can be construed as publicity, and if they were to appear in VFD, I would have to vote delete. Can you find any similar articles in wikipedia? Some articles are also very short, such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dornemann_5e63.html" title="Michael Dornemann">Michael Dornemann</a>. You're not against a time limit here! You're much better off spending half an hour or more researching and writing <i>one</i> good article than creating several very small ("substub" - an article that is even shorter than a stub) pages.</p>
<p>A good tip for notability: can you insert wikilinks within the article without having to create them? An example: yesterday, I created the article <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_Bridge%2C_River_Tyne_b022.html" title="Swing Bridge, River Tyne">Swing Bridge, River Tyne</a>. Every wikilink on that page is to an existing, developed article.</p>
<p>Feel free to give me a shout if you have any questions. Enjoy wikipedia! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 09:41, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not an admin, so I don't have access to the wonderful array of information about deleted articles. If you use material from other websites, you should rewrite them. It will enhance the article and make it conform to wikipedia standards.</dd>
<dd>Sometimes copyright infringements will be spotted immediately, sometimes they will take a while to be identified. The copyvios that escape being found are those which conform to wikipedia style. I always do a copyvio check if I see an article with a style very different to the rest of wikipedia! The safest thing to do is always rewrite, and add the website as a reference.</dd>
<dd>The problem with the other two articles that you mention is more to do with advertising. Can you find any other articles on wikipedia about shops which sell cookbooks? An article about <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, however, is going to be of interest to far more people.</dd>
<dd>You are right - there is no automatic system of mentoring newbies. There are newbie message boards, put the paradox is that you won't know that they are there untill you're not a newbie anymore! I'm happy to answer any queries. It might be worthwhile just cooling off a little before adding more articles — lurk a while, or make small edits to existing articles, and get a sense of the environment.</dd>
<dd>Out of interest, who pointed youin my direction? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 15:46, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This was the initial problem with <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourmet_Guides_c488.html" title="Gourmet Guides">Gourmet Guides</a>. It did not express notability: in its original state, it look like advertising and did not mention any historical relevance. I've now added an appropriate category.</dd>
<dd>Notability is an issue of common sense: you're writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable <i>to me</i> than Wal-mart, but who, other than me, actually cares? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 16:17, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. If you cheched the history, JPS wanted this article to be merged in the main article: which it was. Therefore, it was a candidate for deletion. I already got slammed that this article was too short. Check my talk section.

<dd>I suppose that the problem is that Wikipedia is inconsistent. There's a page somewhere explaining this, but I can't for the life of me find where it is. I'll see if I can track it down sometime in the near future. I didn't find other copyrighted contributions that you may have made because I didn't go looking for them. If you removed them without anyone finding them, then you've already done what's necessary.

<dd>Hey, I guess we are going to get into a battle over On2! Why did you put the copyright violation back on and not the original content? I acknowledge it was a copyright violation and want it changed back but you are hanging some stupid sign on the article for what? Please change it back to the original content and stop this discussion-article-war. What is the purpose of hanging a copyright violation on it after the fact: because you have some rule about it that has to be followed? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrux_6f2f.html" title="User:Brux">Brux</a> 16:09, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article's a copyright violation. That means it'll have to be rewritten on the /temp page, which will be moved to the article page when the copyvio is removed, as described in the template.

<dd>There was. I remember it but didn't copy it anywhere - not realizing its importance. How I remember it was it mentioned the President and CEO Douglas McIntyre which I thought was cool and that I had not included. The name McIntyre rang a bell because he was a name of publishing company in Vancouver BC where I lived back in the 80's. It described On2 as a firm working with media-compression. Its first sentence was that its stock is traded on Amex under ONT. So I am not crazy. The only time I saw it was when NatursRoma flagged me with the copyright violation in the middle of an edit and the system came back with a message saying the article had been modified while I was making modifications. When I did some refreshes I got the original content but never saw it again.

<dd>Nope. That is my version that I was working on. This origianl content was in wiki format. This article version is not. And I said how it started (i.e. traded on Amex) and what it included (President and CEO...). There was original content and it is gone so I can move it to the /temp. Why don't I rewrite it? Because I can only remember what I remember. There was more which I don't remember.

<dd>Now it sits at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> for at least 7 days, and then it gets deleted (unless it turns out not to be a copyvio, which seems unlikely). If anybody rewrites it on /temp that will get moved to the main article. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 16:57, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me try to answer a few of your questions. I did not flag <a href="../../../o/n/2/On2.html" title="On2">On2</a> as a copyright violation with the intention of getting into a personal dispute with you. I found the article because I was looking at a list of recently created pages (which you can see at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>). I am interested in mathematics, and because "On2" is very similar to "onto", a term used in mathematics, I was curious about what the article was. I was a little reluctant to put up the tag immediately, because I realized that you were probably still editing the article, but I decided that the sooner the copyrighted information was removed, the sooner a non-copyrighted article could be written. Because you seemed to be a relatively new user, I reasoned that you had not maliciously added the copyrighted information, and added <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks_4240.html" title="Template:Nothanks">Template:Nothanks</a> to your talk page in order to ask you not to add copyrighted material. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 20:41, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
