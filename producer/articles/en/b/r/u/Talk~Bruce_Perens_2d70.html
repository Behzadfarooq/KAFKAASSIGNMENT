<p>About the cerebral palsy. My son (Stanley, born April 2000), has been going through his own motor issues, fortunately MUCH less severe than mine, but they force me to consider that my own CP diagnosis may have been incorrect. - <i>Bruce</i></p>

<dd>I had an email communication from Rob Malda at one time in which he revealed that I was the highest moderated individual on Slashdot. It is no longer possible to keep score since Slashdot established a cap on their moderation totals. I did once achieve about 46 moderation points on replies to a single story, and would have equalled the "karma cap" of 50 if I hadn't hit Slashdot's own comment-posting limit first. - <i>Bruce</i></dd>

<p>I removed the unsubtantiated and POV text about him "continuing a long running trend resigning from projects." One example does not a long-running trend make.

<dd>I object to the GFDL license applied to the wikipedia, and believe that - because of the flaws in the license - it is unlawful to host the wikipedia on a computer running any contemporary operating system. This could be fixed simply enough, but I get stuff like "we're more interested in producing good content that arguing over licenses". That would be fine except that the legal problems are going to hit you folks eventually, regardless of what you are interested in. You folks could have been a Free Software project. Or at least an Open Source project. You are neither. You blew it because of a few sentences and arrogance, and it persists through stubborness and arrogance. - Bruce.</dd>

<dd>FSF have a draft written for a new version of the GFDL. Wikipedia is licensed under version 1.1 "or any later version". So we should influence FSF in whatever way we can (which is difficult) to make it a good GFDL.

<p><br />
The "few sentences" I wrote about are in the GFDL text. No, you didn't write it, but you also didn't amend it to cancel out its problems.</p>
<p>The worst problem I know of with the GFDL is this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as I can tell, that provision is so broad that it could easily be interpreted to prohibit storage on a system with <b>login security</b> or even file modes controling read permissions. This is not FUD.</p>
<p>It may be that RMS meant it to read that way. He has historicaly been opposed to login security, and used to say that every computer should include a guest login. I haven't heard him talk about this lately, so perhaps he has moderated that stance. It made it almost impossible for him to read web pages for years, as he couldn't keep an internet-connected system that he approved of from being cracked to pieces.</p>
<p>There is also an issue that the GFDL allows one to designate invariant sections for what are essentially rants. Richard wanted these to be where he explained his version of history in GFDL documents. While I sympathize with Richard's plight - the fact that what is properly the GNU project is usually referred to by the name of the kernel hosting the rest of the software - I don't believe that this justifies invariant sections. Nor do I see why the FSF should stand behind a license that prohibits modifications.</p>
<p>The copyright statement and license should not be altered without permission of the copyright holder, because that is where the terms for copying of the work are set. But that is the only legitimate excuse for anything being invariant in a Free / Open work that I know of.</p>
<p>There are other problems with the GFDL. Google for the Debian project's issues regarding the GFDL and you'll get tons of information. They've put a ton of analysis and argument into this, over several years. And unfortunately FSF has <i>not</i> been forthcoming with a new version.</p>
<p>You can correct the problem by adding a preamble to the GFDL specifically for the wikipedia, prohibiting invariant sections, restricting the scope of the DRM language, and you should look at Debian's concerns for other things to address. Do not alter the GFDL text, write a preamble. The GFDL is copyrighted and you may not edit it directly. - <i>Bruce</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree - the GFDL is a highly problematic license. On the other hand, there's now a million pages of Wikipedia licensed under it, so getting a new project with a new license started could be a tricky sell. What other options are open to us? It sounds as if the Wikimedia foundation could stipulate a few things that would ameliorate the problems you outline, and the FSF are very slow-moving and may yet wake up to the problems with the GFDL, though they probably won't put any thought into the problem until GPL3 is finished. What should be done now? — ciphergoth 08:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is no need for a new project, or even really a new license. You only need a clarifying preamble. IMO you would not be changing <i>the intent of the license</i> as used by the Wikipedia. I would suggest that you have your attorney write a clarifying text and <i>post it for opposition by current article authors</i>. If someone objects, you have the choice of addressing his objection in your text or allowing him to remove his work before the change is adopted. I find it difficult to think of a <i>reasonable</i> objection to this clarification, so I don't expect you'd have much trouble. - <i>Bruce</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for getting back to me Bruce. On the upside, we have always prohibited invariant sections on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>). I was not even aware of the "DRM restriction", but you are quite right a literal reading (and with contracts what other sort is there?) makes this a very problematic phrase. It will be interesting to put the idea of changing the pre-amble to our pro bono lawyer team and see if they think it is a flyer for this sort of change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have read about the Debian team's issues with the GFDL before and they did not overlap greatly with Wikipedia - many of the problems relate to the apparent incompatibility between the GPL and GFDL which happily are not a big a problem for us right now (there are few people that re-distribute our software AND the content - they usually do one or the other). Thanks again for the food for thought. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 15:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One reason the Debian team is important is that they are interpreting the GFDL against the <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines_91a0.html" title="Debian Free Software Guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, which is essentially the same as the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Source_Definition_afef.html" title="Open Source Definition">Open Source Definition</a>. And it would be nice to be able to say the Wikipedia is legitimately Open Source. They also have some non-DFSG-related issues with the license. Another chouce would be to label the Wikipedia as compliant with the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> idea. I don't believe that would be appropriate, because there are texts with restrictions against editing and commercial-use restrictions under the Creative Commons umbrella. - <i>Bruce</i></dd>

<p>I can understand why the comment about it being "unlawful to host the wikipedia on a computer running any contemporary operating system" was called FUD. I highly doubt that any judge would ever rule such a thing to be the case (frankly I find it rather unlikely such a case would ever be brought). Adding a clarifying preamble to make such a judgement even less likely wouldn't hurt, I suppose.</p>
<p>As for the GFDL problem with invariant sections, that doesn't render Wikipedia any less free, because Wikipedia itself has no invariant sections. It only weakens the copyleft, because derivatives of Wikipedia might have invariant sections. To use an analogy, if Wikipedia was released under the BSD license, it wouldn't be copylefted, and derivatives could have all kinds of restrictions - but Wikipedia itself would still be free.</p>
<p>Considering that Wikipedia has no invariant sections, we're really talking about rather minor tweaks and clarifications to put Wikipedia into compliance with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.</p>
<p>There are problems with the GFDL, and it would be nice if at least future contributions could be licensed under a better license, such as CC-BY. I doubt it's going to happen, though.</p>

<p>I can see your point, but on the other hand, given that his one article-space edit so far is autobiographical it's sort of fair enough to let people know that he's editing his own article. I think his edit is just fine and should stand; I just think of that template as one way to be extra-cautious about autobiography. And it only says "has edited Wikipedia" in the text of the template; many other people carrying this template have made very few edits, and some have (usually much less reasonable) beefs with Wikipedia.

<dd>The template. He made one article space edit and a few to this talk page. I think it is a stretch to call him a wikipedian. Kotepho 21:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fight to eliminate Morse Code proficiency testing for Amateur Radio licenses, which was the mission of No-Code International and the concern of much of the Amateur Radio world, has ended. We won. The U.S. gave up code testing, as did most countries. I hear Russia still wants its code tests, but that's about the only country I know of that does. - Bruce <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.245.138_0570.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.245.138">64.81.245.138</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.81.245.138.html" title="User talk:64.81.245.138">talk</a>) 05:17, 19 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I'm not sure what your intention is with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Perens&amp;diff=117077925&amp;oldid=116837846" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Perens&amp;diff=117077925&amp;oldid=116837846" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> but I am unsure how noting that all the photos of him on flickr show him with the same tie adds anything to the article. Furthermore, merely linking to pictures of him on flickr does not represent a legitimate source as it's just a series of pictures.

<dd>That was a lousy edit, but Perens does seem to always were a tux tie. I'm sure he has more than one, and I've no idea who knots it for him, or whether it's done wrong all the time, but it wouldn't be terrible to point out that this is a trademark of his style.

<dd>Yeah I'd be fine with saying it's his trademark style, though we would really be better with a reference to source who said that so it doesn't seem like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. We certainly can't say it's the only tie he has though, because I have seen a picture of him wearing another one! <a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimt_36f5.html" title="User talk:Wimt">Will</a> <small><font color="red">(aka <a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimt_5387.html" title="User:Wimt"><font color="red">Wimt</font></a>)</font></small> 22:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FYI: I have four of those ties. I tie them in a half-windsor, as far as I'm aware. For me a Tux tie is like wearing a tartan tie would be for a Scott or a regimental rep tie would be for a... uh, I guess that's British. But none of that belongs in the Wikipedia, until some alternate reality in which I become a fashion model! - Bruce <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.245.138_0570.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.245.138">64.81.245.138</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.81.245.138.html" title="User talk:64.81.245.138">talk</a>) 05:54, 29 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
