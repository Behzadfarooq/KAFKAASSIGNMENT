His 36 years of service make his the 2nd-longest umpiring career in major league history, trailing only <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Klem_651d.html" title="Bill Klem">Bill Klem</a> (37 years). On August 16, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_baseball.html" title="2006 in baseball">2006</a> he umpired his 5,000th game between the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> at <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenway_Park_891e.html" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a>, second on the all-time MLB list to Klem's 5,374.<sup id="_ref-USAToday0815_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USAToday0815" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a brief semi-pro playing career, Froemming became the youngest umpire in professional baseball in 1958 at age 18, working his way up through the minor leagues to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a> before joining the NL staff in April 1971. While in the minor leagues, his work had caught the attention of skilled observers such as Hall of Famer <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jocko_Conlan_aec0.html" title="Jocko Conlan">Jocko Conlan</a>. Froemming became one of the NL's six crew chiefs in 1988. He also <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referee.html" title="Referee">refereed</a> high school basketball games, and was recommended for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> by <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_McGuire_d740.html" title="Al McGuire">Al McGuire</a>, but declined the opportunity when NL umpire <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Barlick_0c90.html" title="Al Barlick">Al Barlick</a> helped him in his advancement to the major leagues.<sup id="_ref-Dwyre_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwyre" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>He has worked in 5 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>: <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_World_Series_630f.html" title="1976 World Series">1976</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_World_Series_c31e.html" title="1984 World Series">1984</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_World_Series_3a84.html" title="1988 World Series">1988</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_World_Series_e722.html" title="1990 World Series">1990</a> (Games 3-4) and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_World_Series_47c7.html" title="1995 World Series">1995</a>.

With his tenth appearance in the LCS in 2000, he broke the record he had previously shared with <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Harvey_%28umpire%29_8bce.html" title="Doug Harvey (umpire)">Doug Harvey</a>; <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Crawford_e4c9.html" title="Jerry Crawford">Jerry Crawford</a> tied the record in 2003, and broke it with his 11th LCS in 2005. (Froemming and Crawford share the record of 10 NLCS, as Crawford's 11th was in the American League.)</p>
<p>He has also officiated in a record 8 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Division_Series_faed.html" title="National League Division Series">Division Series</a>: <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_National_League_Division_Series_0e90.html" title="1981 National League Division Series">1981</a> (East Division), <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_National_League_Division_Series_06de.html" title="1995 National League Division Series">1995</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_National_League_Division_Series_4376.html" title="1996 National League Division Series">1996</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_National_League_Division_Series_c0fe.html" title="1998 National League Division Series">1998</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_National_League_Division_Series_62c9.html" title="1999 National League Division Series">1999</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_National_League_Division_Series_bbbb.html" title="2001 National League Division Series">2001</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_National_League_Division_Series_8f44.html" title="2002 National League Division Series">2002</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_National_League_Division_Series_84af.html" title="2003 National League Division Series">2003</a> (also all in the NL). He was the home plate umpire for the playoff games to determine the NL wild-card team in both <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_baseball.html" title="1998 in baseball">1998</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_baseball.html" title="1999 in baseball">1999</a>. He also umpired in the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star Game</a> in 1975 (played at <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Stadium_afbb.html" title="County Stadium">County Stadium</a> in his hometown of Milwaukee) and 1986, calling balls and strikes for the second contest.</p>
<p>Through the 2005 season, he has umpired a record 107 career postseason games, surpassing the mark of Klem, who worked in 104 games (all in the World Series). He has officiated in 22 World Series games, 52 NLCS games and 33 NLDS games.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_baseball.html" title="2001 in baseball">2001</a>, Froemming was the second base umpire for the <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-hitter.html" title="No-hitter">no-hitter</a> pitched by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Smith_445a.html" title="Bud Smith">Bud Smith</a> of the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. That game marked the record 11th time he had umpired in an official no-hitter; he had previously shared the record of 10 with <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_O%27Loughlin_2c48.html" title="Silk O'Loughlin">Silk O'Loughlin</a>, Paul Pryor and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_McKean_7a46.html" title="Jim McKean">Jim McKean</a>.

He was also calling balls and strikes on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a>, when Cubs pitcher <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milt_Pappas_84dd.html" title="Milt Pappas">Milt Pappas</a> had a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_game.html" title="Perfect game">perfect game</a> with two out in the ninth inning before <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_on_balls.html" title="Base on balls">walking</a> the 27th batter; Pappas then completed the no-hitter, but later criticized Froemming for wasting his chance at immortality. The umpire notes, "It's gotten ugly now. Right after the game, he said the 3-2 pitch had missed, but as time has gone on, that pitch has gotten better and better."<sup id="_ref-Dwyre_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwyre" title="">[2]</a></sup> Froemming did eventually work a perfect game, as the first base umpire for <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Mart%C3%ADnez_2f0c.html" title="Dennis Martínez">Dennis Martínez</a>' gem on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_baseball.html" title="1991 in baseball">1991</a>. Two days earlier, he also umpired in what would have been a 12th no-hitter, but Montreal's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Gardner_%28baseball_player%29_35d6.html" title="Mark Gardner (baseball player)">Mark Gardner</a> surrendered three hits in the 10th inning and lost; under current guidelines, baseball does not recognize games of nine hitless innings as no-hitters if hits are given up in extra innings.</p>
<p>In April 2001, Froemming was the home plate umpire for the first game at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_Park_9238.html" title="Miller Park">Miller Park</a> in his hometown of Milwaukee. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>, he was the plate umpire in the famous game between the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> that involved a large brawl initiated by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Varitek_f1d6.html" title="Jason Varitek">Jason Varitek</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Rodriguez_76fe.html" title="Alex Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a>. The game was won by the Red Sox on a dramatic <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walk-off_home_run.html" title="Walk-off home run">walk-off home run</a> by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Mueller_101c.html" title="Bill Mueller">Bill Mueller</a> off Yankees closer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariano_Rivera_a9af.html" title="Mariano Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a>.</p>
<p>Froemming is known for his extremely loud and enthusiastic strike call. He has worn uniform number 6 since the late 1970s, and kept the number when the umpiring staffs of the AL and NL were merged in 2000. <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> sports editor Bill Dwyre has described him as as "one of the game's true characters and legends," also calling him the prototypical umpire: "If Hollywood did a movie, they'd send 27 yuppies to study him.<sup id="_ref-Dwyre_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwyre" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A commanding presence on the field who has been fined by National League and Major League Baseball on more than one occasion for his public comments and behavior, Froemming has acknowledged that "The one moment I would take back if I could" was in January 2003 when he referred to an umpire administrator as a "stupid Jew bitch" during a dispute over a relatively minor conflict over travel arrangements to Japan; the comment was made at the end of a voice-mail message, apparently after Froemming thought the call had ended.<sup id="_ref-USAToday0815_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USAToday0815" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was given a 10-day suspension without pay for the incident, which he accepted gracefully after making a public apology. Froemming was also fined in 1996 for going into the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>' clubhouse before a game in New York against the Mets to get <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Piazza_66e3.html" title="Mike Piazza">Mike Piazza</a>'s autograph.<sup id="_ref-USAToday0130_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USAToday0130" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1986, Froemming appeared in a commercial for <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a> hamburger, the <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDLT_6587.html" title="McDLT">McDLT</a>.</p>
<p>Froemming has been assigned to supervise <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Winters_2e76.html" title="Mike Winters">Mike Winters</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Wegner_e144.html" title="Mark Wegner">Mark Wegner</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Runge_5f60.html" title="Brian Runge">Brian Runge</a> in 2007. Brian Runge is the son of Paul Runge, who served on the NL staff from 1973 to 1997; Froemming has recalled that he used to baby-sit for Brian.<sup id="_ref-Dwyre_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwyre" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li><i>"It's great to see a young umpire like that. He's a nice boy, conscientious, hardworking, a million-dollar heart. And guts. They told me that he put an announcer out of the ball park one night in Tulsa. The announcer made some remark or other over the public address system about the umpire. Froemming stopped the game, turned to the announcer and said, 'Get out.' When I heard about that, I said, 'This is something. I'd like to see that, making an announcer leave the ball park.'"</i> - Jocko Conlan, in his 1967 autobiography <i>Jocko</i></li>
