<dd>Rudy, thanks for your comment. My edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Brussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8295535" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Brussels-Capital_Region&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8295535" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> were intended to express that the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Community_3929.html" title="Flemish Community">Flemish Community</a> and the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Community_of_Belgium_b647.html" title="French Community of Belgium">French Community of Belgium</a> are institutions on the political front at least. I am not denying that many inhabitants of Brussels may identify themselves with the political institutions, but that is more on the sociological front. On this front, Brussels contains many communities: let's say the community of French-speaking inhabitants, the community of Dutch-speaking inhabitants, the catholic community, the gay community, the community of European Union civil servants, the wikipedian community, and so on and so forth... Like every modern city in the world which is composed of many communities, I do think.</dd>

<dd>Dear, my question was maybe not properly worded. It was not about the sociologigal aspects of the very diverse brussels population, but specifically about the political fact (that 100% pf the current flemish politicians in brussels support being part of the Flemish Community), and about the cultural and institutional reality (as laid down in the constitution). So, my qustion was why we should not first alk abot the most general thing, being that brussels has basically two 'cnstituent' ethnic groups, Flemings and French-speakers? More detailled information should, as far as I understood general Wikipedia guidelines, and common practice in encyclopedia, be referred to later parapgraphs or more specialised articles. E.g. the correct information that you added appears perfectly on its place under the subtitle 'Institutions'. As you did not give any reason (nor when cutting out hat information), nor later, I re-instated that bit of factual information that, as far as I can assess is indeed crucial in understanding brussels.</dd>

<dd>The problem with classifying Brussels inhabitants into communities is that it does not fit with the legal reality. As far as I know, Belgian ID cards do not mention in which community you are belonging. You can considered yourself as belonging to the both community or none of these communities. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 16:31, Dec 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

To my humble opinion, these two expressions legally refer only to administrative and political institutions which have certain competencies in the domain of culture and education for instance. One inhabitant of Brussels may be speak Dutch and attend a cultural activity funded by the "French Community of Belgium". Or the other way around. It is possible of course to talk about sociological, cultural, linguistic or religious communities, but almost every modern city presents such a diversity of communities. As a conclusion, I mean that there is no need to mention that the Flemings in Brussels belongs to the community of Flemings (of Flanders, Belgium and the world). It is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28rhetoric%29.html" title="Tautology (rhetoric)">tautology</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for implicitelt ("according to me ") acknowleddging that this is just a personal opinion. I invite you to consider the objective and verifiable fact that ALL Flemish politicians in Brussels, as well as the 99% of its entire socio-cultural and political organisations (except for very few) consistently stress that they are Flemings andf want to remain so. Moreover, in terms of <b>political communities</b>, 99% of the votes in brussels are given to political parties that all belong very spcifically to just one of the two communities, and that ALL are also active either in Wallonia, or in Flanders, being the 'heartland' of either community. Even the French-speaking FDF, now part of the MR, is not a truly 'brussels' party as it gathers support only from French-speakers, and not from any Flkeming in brussels! As such, many speak of Brussels as as 'bridge' between the two communities. So, whenever this article wants to he complete and scientifcally correct, this objective reality MUST be mentionned (especially given the fierce atempts of some French-speakers to isolate the Flkemings in Brussels from the others.</dd>

Brussels is a (rather old) <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a>, in the sense of "an agglomeration including suburban and satellite areas". Strictly speaking, it is arbitrary to draw a clear boundary between what falls within "Brussels" and what falls outside "Brussels", no matter how controversial this may seem in Belgium. The opposite is true for the (rather young) "Brussels-Capital Region", defined by the recent amended <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_constitution.html" title="Belgian constitution">constitution</a> as a clear geographical, politicial, administrative and linguistic entity. Brussels was there before Belgium existed and will certainly be there for long. The Brussels-Capital Region is 15 years-old only, and might only be a temporary political arrangement. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 07:17, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I get the difference right, we simply disagree. I'm not suggesting we blur the differences but I'm suggesting we put the content of both pages in one place. The content of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels-Capital_Region_8ac9.html" title="Brussels-Capital Region">Brussels-Capital Region</a> should not be bigger than just politics and demographics. <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> should have historical, political, demographical and geographical information. Right now there's just gonna be redundant information. Does Paris have <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and Paris Department? No, they are both merged. The political entity Paris Department is merged into <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, the city we all know. I think it makes total sense to include the political entity of Brussels in the article about Brussels. But we have the right to differ, I won't go ahead and force what seems obvious to me. What's even weirder is that the fr and nl wikis have only 2 articles, but Brussels -&gt; the City of Brussels (the municipality) and Brussels-Capital Region. I'm not sure it makes sense to point to just a part of Brussels when someone would want an article about the whole city (not just the municipality). ---<a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 13:17, 2005 Mar 20 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section about institutions does not reflect the reality, which is much more complex, with reserved seats for the Flemish minority in the regional parliament etc. It is obvious for people who are informed of the situation, but the present article leads others to confusion.

Brussels is a de facto French-speaking city, where a de jure bilingual French/Dutch regime is imposed as a halfway house between the current largely French-speaking reality and the Flemings' desired Dutch monolingualism. — <small>64.103.37.71 • <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.103.37.71.html" title="User talk:64.103.37.71">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.103.37.71_e37d.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.103.37.71">contribs</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jun_7.html" title="Jun 7">7 Jun</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 10:40 (UTC) <span style="color:#909090;">(was unsigned, undated)</span></small></p>

<dd>My personal experience (based on hunderds of discussions with EU-nationals from many countries, and with often booth Flemings and Belgian French-speakers included) is that most Flemings here in Brussels are nicely monolingual, and thus give the superficial observer an overly pessimistic view of the number of Flemings around. However, once you start getting to know those folks a bit better, you start finding out there are much more Flemings living in brussels then what you 'hear' at first.</dd>
<dd>This confusing impressions of superficial observers correspond with the statements of a few Flemings that were very sharp. They pointed out that even on the Flemish national holiday (somewhere in June), many Flemings institutions and especially cultural centres and individuals prefer not to show their flags, some out of fear for violent reactions from French-speaking radicals, some because they don't want to "provoke" the French-speakers, some for a combination of these and other reasons. Once, I even heard a priest sitting in the council of a local centre state this. No wonder, with such a cowardly attitude that all those christian churches are losing appeal and followers (sorry for the stingy remark, could not help). --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 22:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Official manifestations of Flemishness are not done in a spirit of "this is also our city" but rather in a spirit of "this is our city alone" (cf. Flanders unilateral decision to appoint Brussels its capital even though the city/region is also the political and cultural centre of gravity for French speakers in Belgium - and is legally no more Flemish than French-speaking according to the Beglian constitution). It is this attitude I believe that leads to a defensive reaction on the part of French-speakers, when they not the Flemish are the de facto majority. If Flemings spoke in line with the correct Belgian legal reality i.e. that Brussels is a bilingual city at the heart of Belgium officially equally Flemish and French-speaking, they would find less hostility to manifestations of Flemishness among French-speakers. But as it is, these manifestations in their current form are correctly perceived as agressive. Flanders consistently speaks in a way that denies the legitimacy of a French-speaking population in Brussels. I visited Ghent on the Flemish national day a couple of years ago - not a Vlaamse Leeuw in sight... so why is it used in Brussels? — <small>64.103.37.72 • <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.103.37.72.html" title="User talk:64.103.37.72">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.103.37.72_4342.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.103.37.72">contribs</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jun_9.html" title="Jun 9">9 Jun</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 10:24-10:28 (UTC) <span style="color:#909090;">(was unsigned, undated, and got afterwards interrupted by other contributors (mainly Lucas Richards) - thus this comment is found once more severely fragmented though partially rephrased hereunder and now put in italics for clarity)</span></small></p>

<dl>
<dd>Knowing several French-speaking as well as Flkemish politicians from Brussels, I have heard this claim also. However, when I attend those manifestations, and when I see the policy of the respective cultural authporities (COCOF for the French-speakers and VGC for the Flemings), it appears just the other way round! Nearly all Flemisgh manifestations underline the multi-ethnic status of Brussels, with both French-speakers and Flemings as the two 'native' communities, and lots of other migrant minorities, whereas such an openess is clearly not the stadard for manifestations organised by the COCOF. This statement therefore appears to me a very partisan point oif view. No wonder it is an anonymous one. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 13:41, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hold on. Multiculturalness is something else. Flanders uses "multiculturalism" to dilute French in Brussels. "French is spoken, yes but so is Arabic etc." I don't advocate the use of French over Flemish in a Belgian context. I think we just need to be honest that Brussels is the capital of Belgium in a legal and real sense - and to assert anything else risks disenfranchising some of its inhabitants. — <small>64.103.37.69 • <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.103.37.69.html" title="User talk:64.103.37.69">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.103.37.69_65d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.103.37.69">contribs</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jun_13.html" title="Jun 13">13 Jun</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 08:31 (UTC) <span style="color:#909090;">(was unsigned, undated)</span></small></p>

<dd>As several other contributors to the French and English languages pages on this and related topics already pointed out:</dd>
<dd>* According to the Belgian constitution, all regional and community authorities have a very large autonomy. As part of that, they all enjoy the full right to chose their capitals theirselves. ALL of them did this, and none consulted with the other one. So, the fact that you blame Flanders, for something that ALL French-speaking federal governements did to, appears wholly partisan, and not objective as required by Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>* There is only one known case where an institution from one of the regional/community governements did not respect the territorial limits established in the Belgian constitution, being when the Walloon export agency located it's office outside Wallonia, in Brussels. That choice is quite understandable of course. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 13:41, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're missing the point. You actually agree with me. I mean that Brussels as Flemish capital is only meaningful as far as Flanders chose it to be so (yes, like the French community, although the French-speakers refer to it as the Belgian capital first and foremost). However, other capital status' which Brussels has are more meaningful outside of a strictly legal sense: - Belgian capital: The two main communities are present there. All people in Brussels who are not nationals of other countries are nationals of Belgium. Road names are in the 2 main languages etc. - EU capital: All Europeans have a right to live and work there and all the officially registered local "nationals" are Europeans. A majority of the people in Brusses are EU and a majority of the people living in Brussels would agree that Brussels is European and in Europe. BUT - Flemish capital: Brussels only houses the Flemish institutions - and has a historical reality as part of a Dutch/Low German/Germanic-speaking region. A majority of the people in Brussels are not Flemish and a majority of the people living in Brussels would deny that Brussels is Flemish or in Flanders.</p>

<dd>Dear why insist on a non-issue? You suggest that 'most' Flemings and/or official Flemish institutions would have an 'exclusive' claim on Brussels. However, this is a groos lie! Flemings just want to enjoy their rights in Brussels as legally recognised inhabitants and as the original population of this city! So the fact that other capital functions have a wider geographical scope appears irrelevant to me. In a democracy, even minorities have guaranteed rights. And those Flemings don't deny they're a minority. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 11:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I mean that the Flemish are an actual - if not legal - minority in Brussels. As a result, when they assert that Brussels is their capital it is offensive to French-speakers because what then is the capital of the French-speaking majority that inhabits the city?
<dl>
<dd>Wouw, do you realise the implication of what you said here? This means that ALL minority groups (as the protestants and muslims in belgium, as the Greens, ...) should keep a low profile in order not to provoke the overly sensible majority-members. I really don't see why it would be offsenive when Flemings want to be part of Brussels. After all, this city is French-majority only since less then one century?. The first 3/4 of its history, it was a flemish-only city, and it was Frenchified by brute discrimination as from the french period only! --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 11:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Flemish people asserted the unity of Belgium and Brussels as a jointly Flemish-French city at the heart of it - and (important) that they saw the French-language culture that is present in Brussels is a positive thing that should continue to exist and which also has historical legitimacy, they would see a much more positive reaction. I am English speaking by the way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On what basis do you think that this is the Flemish point of view? It looks to me that you are quite ignorant about this! your description is more or less that what the french-speaking press and politicians pretend it is. However, that is a groos distortion from reality. having several Flemish AND French-speaking friends, this massive gap in perception has become clear to me.</dd>

<p>Does Brussels need a Flemish identity? Is it not enough that the Dutch language is co-official. Saying it is Flemish rather than Dutch speaking, what does that mean? Do Brussels people behave in a Flemish way. Flemish people drink beer and like tennis and football, like French speakers. What is "Flemish" about Brussels? The architecture of the main square? Do buildings have nationality or language? Brussels has its own identity.</p>
<p><i>Flanders consistently speaks in a way that denies the legitimacy of a French-speaking population in Brussels. I visited Ghent on the Flemish national day a couple of years ago - not a Vlaamse Leeuw in sight... so why is it used in Brussels?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi there, just wanted to add my 2 cents:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1st cent: are there any extremists among the French-speakers (I mean extremist towards Flemish people)? Could someone explain this to me?</li>
<li>2nd cent: i fail to see how flemish people were "original population of this city". Wasn't <i>brusseleer</i> that used to be spoken in Brussels? To my knowledge there was no (stupid) fight between flemish and walloons in brussels before the second world war, thus no criterion to name people "flemish" or "walloons" except the language. Then is <i>brusseleer</i> a variation of dutch or french? To me: neither of them...</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope those comments will not make our friend Lucas angry, I just ask questions to help the discussion to be a little more precise for people not familiar with the topic. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulien_Tuerlinckx_0f8c.html" title="User:Julien Tuerlinckx">Julien Tuerlinckx</a> 17:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Nen Brusseleer" is a male and "een Brusseles" a female inhabitant of Brussels (ethymological name Broekzele, clearly Dutch language) and they spoke "Brussels", the Dutch-language dialect of Brussels that belongs to the Brabantian (also named Brabantic) dialect group of the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Brabant_49e1.html" title="Duchy of Brabant">Duchy of Brabant</a>. The term 'Flemish' used to be limited to the neighbouring <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countship_of_Flanders_bdac.html" title="Countship of Flanders">Countship of Flanders</a> but in relatively more recent times came to be used for all related dialects, including the Brussels dialect (as the term 'Flamand' that <i>by the French speaking south</i> had possibly been generalized even earlier because to them it all sounded the same); by the time Belgium became regionalized, 'Flemish' had become quite common for al Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium, and 'Flanders' encompassed the whole area, including Brussels as far as the native language still went. By the regionalization, 'Flanders' as far as it is used for a synonym of the 'Flemish Region', lost Brussels but there are still native speakers of the Dutch language dialect - this explains partially why the region chose its capital there, stating they won't abandon them. This is also institutionally correct as the powers of the Flemish Community do extend to the Brussels-Capital Region. There is still no French-language dialect <i>of Brussels</i>, one hears standard French [in the Belgian style, e.g. 70='septante' 90='nonante', not 'soixante-dix' and 'quatre-vingt-dix'] or such with varying influences by several Walloon dialects. French influence in Brussels started by the French nation state occupying the country, followed by a short episode under Dutch control (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Netherlands_4038.html" title="United Netherlands">United Netherlands</a>), separation from which was most unanymously supported by speakers of French, though also speakers of Dutch (Catholic) had problems with the Dutch king. Early independent Belgium was strictly French-speaking for all official matters. Army officers had to be (natively) French-speaking; the death of many Flemish soldiers in World War I could have been avoided if some officers would have understood Dutch/Flemish or could have given understandable commands. That was one of the more prominent causes that started an 'emancipation' of Flanders on a wider scale. But by then the capital that housed so many official institutions had become completely dominated by speakers of French, including many of native Dutch-speaking origin who had to send their children to French-speaking schools so as to offer them a future, which explains why lots of French-speakers in the Brussels area, have a typically Flemish family name. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_19.html" title="Dec 19">19 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 03:57-04:19&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>
