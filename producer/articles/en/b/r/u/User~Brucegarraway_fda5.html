<p>Currently a resident of the Hawthorn Glen Community, Snellville City Councilman Bruce Garraway, 35, was born in Paterson, New Jersey to Warren and Bonnie Garraway. Garraway’s father was a professional engineer for the State of New York Department of Transportation. Garraway's mother stayed at home to raise her three boys.</p>
<p>The oldest of three brothers, Bruce grew up in Syracuse, N.Y., and graduated from Oklahoma Baptist College in Oklahoma City, Okla. with a Bachelor’s Degree in secondary education, majoring in history. He then moved to Knoxville, Tenn. and earned a Master’s Degree in Education Administration from Crown College. While working on this degree he met his wife, Rebekah, and in 1996, they were married in Powell, a suburb of Knoxville.</p>
<p>The youngest of three children, Rebekah, 29, was born and raised in Knoxville to Willis and Charlotte Shankles. Rebekah has helped out in the family business as far back as she can remember. Her father is a retail business owner and the holder of several real estate/ business properties. Her mother stayed at home and nurtured her family.</p>
<p>After committing themselves to marriage, Bruce and Rebekah moved to Gwinnett so Bruce could take a position teaching with Forest Hills Christian School, a private Christian school. Rebekah accepted a position as an office manager with The Howard Payne Company, a family owned business.</p>
<p>Bruce and Rebekah are proud parents of a beautiful little girl, Emily Rebekah.</p>
<p>They are both members of Killian Hill Baptist Church where they actively are serving in various ministries. They both are involved in the nursery, Rebekah sings in the choir and Bruce ushers.</p>

<p>Bruce was recently selected for inclusion in the ninth &amp; tenth edition of Who's Who Among America's Teachers Award for 2005, 2006. Who's Who honors a select 5% of our nation's teachers each year and less then 2% are included in more then one edition. Bruce's students are clearly sending a message of how special he is to them, a tribute bestowed on very few teachers.</p>
<p>Bruce has also been recently selected for inclusion of the 2006 National Honor Roll's Outstanding American Teachers Award. This organization was developed to recognized educators who have made a positive difference in their student's lives. The National Honor Roll firmly believes that the future is in the hands of our children and those teachers who help children reach their full potential make the greatest contribution to society.</p>
