<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theoretical_physics.html" title="Theoretical physics">theoretical physics</a>, <b>BRST Quantization</b> is a relatively rigorous mathematical approach to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantizing.html" title="Quantizing">quantizing</a> a <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_theory.html" title="Field theory">field theory</a> with a <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_symmetry.html" title="Gauge symmetry">gauge symmetry</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantization.html" title="Quantization">Quantization</a> rules in earlier QFT frameworks resembled "prescriptions" or "heuristics" more than proofs, especially in <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-abelian.html" title="Non-abelian">non-abelian</a> QFT, where the use of "ghost" fields with superficially bizarre properties is almost unavoidable for technical reasons related to <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renormalization.html" title="Renormalization">renormalization</a> and anomaly cancellation. The BRST <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersymmetry.html" title="Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a> was introduced in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and was quickly understood to justify the introduction of these <a href="../../../f/a/d/Faddeev-Popov_ghost_00a4.html" title="Faddeev-Popov ghost">Faddeev-Popov ghosts</a> and their exclusion from "physical" asymptotic states when performing QFT calculations. Work by other authors a few years later related the BRST operator to the existence of a rigorous alternative to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_integral.html" title="Path integral">path integrals</a> when quantizing a gauge theory.</p>
<p>Only in the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, when QFT was reformulated in <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber_bundle.html" title="Fiber bundle">fiber bundle</a> language for application to problems in the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donaldson_theory.html" title="Donaldson theory">topology of low-dimensional manifolds</a>, did it become apparent that the BRST "transformation" is fundamentally geometrical in character. In this light, "BRST Quantization" becomes more than an alternate way to arrive at anomaly-cancelling ghosts. It is a different perspective on what the ghost fields represent, why the Faddeev-Popov method works, and how it is related to the use of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian mechanics</a> to construct a perturbative framework. The relationship between <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_invariance.html" title="Gauge invariance">gauge invariance</a> and "BRST invariance" forces the choice of a Hamiltonian system whose states are composed of "particles" according to the rules familiar from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_quantization.html" title="Canonical quantization">canonical quantization</a> formalism. This esoteric consistency condition therefore comes quite close to explaining how <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quanta.html" title="Quanta">quanta</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermions.html" title="Fermions">fermions</a> arise in physics to begin with.</p>

The equivalent transformation and many of its properties were independently discovered by I. V. Tyutin.

<p>From a practical perspective, a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_field_theory.html" title="Quantum field theory">quantum field theory</a> consists of an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_principle.html" title="Action principle">action principle</a> and a set of procedures for performing perturbative calculations. There are other kinds of "sanity checks" that can be performed on a quantum field theory to determine whether it fits qualitative phenomena such as <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quark_confinement.html" title="Quark confinement">quark confinement</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymptotic_freedom.html" title="Asymptotic freedom">asymptotic freedom</a>. However, most of the predictive successes of quantum field theory, from <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_electrodynamics.html" title="Quantum electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a> to the present day, have been quantified by matching <a href="../../../s/-/m/S-matrix.html" title="S-matrix">S-matrix</a> calculations against the results of scattering experiments.</p>
<p>In the early days of QFT, one would have to have said that the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantization.html" title="Quantization">quantization</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renormalization.html" title="Renormalization">renormalization</a> prescriptions were as much part of the model as the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian_density.html" title="Lagrangian density">Lagrangian density</a>, especially when they relied on the powerful but mathematically ill-defined <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_integral.html" title="Path integral">path integral</a> formalism. It quickly became clear that QED was almost "magical" in its relative tractability, and that most of the ways that one might imagine extending it would not produce rational calculations. However, one class of field theories remained promising: <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_theories.html" title="Gauge theories">gauge theories</a>, in which the objects in the theory represent <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivalence_classes.html" title="Equivalence classes">equivalence classes</a> of physically indistinguishable field configurations, any two of which are related by a <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_transformation.html" title="Gauge transformation">gauge transformation</a>. This generalizes the QED idea of a local change of phase to a more complicated <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_group.html" title="Lie group">Lie group</a>.</p>
<p>QED itself is a gauge theory, as is <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>, although the latter has proven resistant to quantization so far, for reasons related to renormalization. Another class of gauge theories with a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Abelian_96ef.html" title="Non-Abelian">non-Abelian</a> gauge group, beginning with <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yang-Mills_theory_feac.html" title="Yang-Mills theory">Yang-Mills theory</a>, became amenable to quantization in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely due to the work of <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_D._Faddeev_3662.html" title="Ludwig D. Faddeev">Ludwig D. Faddeev</a>, Victor N. Popov, <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryce_DeWitt_45e7.html" title="Bryce DeWitt">Bryce DeWitt</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerardus_%27t_Hooft_a2f2.html" title="Gerardus 't Hooft">Gerardus 't Hooft</a>. However, they remained very difficult to work with until the introduction of the BRST method. The BRST method provided the calculation techniques and renormalizability proofs needed to extract accurate results from both "unbroken" Yang-Mills theories and those in which the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higgs_mechanism.html" title="Higgs mechanism">Higgs mechanism</a> leads to <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking.html" title="Spontaneous symmetry breaking">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a>. Representatives of these two types of Yang-Mills systems—<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chromodynamics.html" title="Quantum chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroweak_theory.html" title="Electroweak theory">electroweak theory</a>—appear in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Model_84d9.html" title="Standard Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particle_physics.html" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a>.</p>
<p>It has proven rather more difficult to prove the <i>existence</i> of non-Abelian quantum field theory in a rigorous sense than to obtain accurate predictions using semi-heuristic calculation schemes. This is because analyzing a quantum field theory requires two mathematically interlocked perspectives: a Lagrangian system based on the action functional, composed of <i>fields</i> with distinct values at each point in spacetime and local operators which act on them, and a <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_system.html" title="Hamiltonian system">Hamiltonian system</a> in the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirac_picture.html" title="Dirac picture">Dirac picture</a>, composed of <i>states</i> which characterize the entire system at a given time and field operators which act on them. What makes this so difficult in a gauge theory is that the objects of the theory are not really local fields on spacetime; they are right-invariant local fields on the principal gauge bundle, and different local sections through a portion of the gauge bundle, related by <i>passive</i> transformations, produce different Dirac pictures.</p>
<p>What is more, a description of the system as a whole in terms of a set of fields contains many redundant degrees of freedom; the distinct configurations of the theory are <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivalence_classes.html" title="Equivalence classes">equivalence classes</a> of field configurations, so that two descriptions which are related to one another by an <i>active</i> gauge transformation are also really the same physical configuration. The "solutions" of a quantized gauge theory exist not in a straightforward space of fields with values at every point in spacetime but in a <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quotient_space.html" title="Quotient space">quotient space</a> (or <a href="../../../c/o/h/Cohomology.html" title="Cohomology">cohomology</a>) whose elements are equivalence classes of field configurations. Hiding in the BRST formalism is a system for parameterizing the variations associated with all possible active gauge transformations and correctly accounting for their physical irrelevance during the conversion of a Lagrangian system to a Hamiltonian system.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/s/BRST_Quantization_193d.html" title="Edit section: Gauge fixing and perturbation theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gauge fixing and perturbation theory</span></h3>
<p>The principle of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_invariance.html" title="Gauge invariance">gauge invariance</a> is essential to constructing a workable quantum field theory. But it is generally not feasible to perform a perturbative calculation in a gauge theory without first "fixing the gauge"—adding terms to the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagrangian_density.html" title="Lagrangian density">Lagrangian density</a> of the action principle which "break the gauge symmetry" to suppress these "unphysical" degrees of freedom. The idea of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_fixing.html" title="Gauge fixing">gauge fixing</a> goes back to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenz_gauge.html" title="Lorenz gauge">Lorenz gauge</a> approach to electromagnetism, which suppresses most of the excess degrees of freedom in the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four-potential.html" title="Four-potential">four-potential</a> while retaining manifest Lorentz invariance. The Lorenz gauge is a great simplification relative to Maxwell's field-strength approach to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_electrodynamics.html" title="Classical electrodynamics">classical electrodynamics</a>, and illustrates why it is useful to deal with excess degrees of freedom in the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_representation.html" title="Group representation">representation</a> of the objects in a theory at the Lagrangian stage, before passing over to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian mechanics</a> via the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legendre_transform.html" title="Legendre transform">Legendre transform</a>.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian density is related to the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to a unit timelike horizontal vector field on the gauge bundle. In a quantum mechanical context it is conventionally rescaled by a factor <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/8/e/58e893d717aa5b3e80ce1b89237e36c6.png" alt="i \hbar" />. Integrating it by parts over a spacelike cross section recovers the form of the integrand familiar from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_quantization.html" title="Canonical quantization">canonical quantization</a>. Because the definition of the Hamiltonian involves a unit time vector field on the base space, a horizontal lift to the bundle space, and a spacelike surface "normal" (in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minkowski_metric.html" title="Minkowski metric">Minkowski metric</a>) to the unit time vector field at each point on the base manifold, it is dependent both on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connexion.html" title="Connexion">connexion</a> and the choice of Lorentz frame, and is far from being globally defined. But it is an essential ingredient in the perturbative framework of quantum field theory, into which the quantized Hamiltonian enters via the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_series.html" title="Dyson series">Dyson series</a>.</p>
<p>For perturbative purposes, we gather the configuration of all the fields of our theory on an entire three-dimensional horizontal spacelike cross section of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> into one object (a <a href="../../../f/o/c/Fock_state.html" title="Fock state">Fock state</a>), and then describe the "evolution" of this state over time using the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interaction_picture.html" title="Interaction picture">interaction picture</a>. The <a href="../../../f/o/c/Fock_space.html" title="Fock space">Fock space</a> is spanned by the multi-particle eigenstates of the "unperturbed" or "non-interaction" portion <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/6/a/36a00b2dae922834f79134851ee837b8.png" alt="\mathcal{H}_0" /> of the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian.html" title="Hamiltonian">Hamiltonian</a> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/5/0/350860cf68ca8fd18af87b6ee9044fc7.png" alt="\mathcal{H}" />. Hence the instantaneous description of any Fock state is a complex-amplitude-weighted sum of eigenstates of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/6/a/36a00b2dae922834f79134851ee837b8.png" alt="\mathcal{H}_0" />. In the interaction picture, we relate Fock states at different times by prescribing that each eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian experiences a constant rate of phase rotation proportional to its <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> (the corresponding <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eigenvalue.html" title="Eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a> of the unperturbed Hamiltonian).</p>
<p>Hence, in the zero-order approximation, the set of weights characterizing a Fock state does not change over time, but the corresponding field configuration does. In higher approximations, the weights also change; collider experiments in <a href="../../../h/i/g/High-energy_physics.html" title="High-energy physics">high-energy physics</a> amount to measurements of the rate of change in these weights (or rather integrals of them over distributions representing uncertainty in the initial and final conditions of a scattering event). The Dyson series captures the effect of the discrepancy between <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/6/a/36a00b2dae922834f79134851ee837b8.png" alt="\mathcal{H}_0" /> and the true Hamiltonian <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/5/0/350860cf68ca8fd18af87b6ee9044fc7.png" alt="\mathcal{H}" />, in the form of a power series in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coupling_constant.html" title="Coupling constant">coupling constant</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i></span>; it is the principal tool for making quantitative predictions from a quantum field theory.</p>
<p>To use the Dyson series to calculate anything, one needs more than a gauge-invariant Lagrangian density; one also needs the quantization and gauge fixing prescriptions that enter into the <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman_rules.html" title="Feynman rules">Feynman rules</a> of the theory. The Dyson series produces infinite integrals of various kinds when applied to the Hamiltonian of a particular QFT. This is partly because all usable quantum field theories to date must be considered effective field theories, describing only interactions on a certain range of energy scales that we can experimentally probe and therefore vulnerable to ultraviolet divergences. These are tolerable as long as they can be handled via standard techniques of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renormalization.html" title="Renormalization">renormalization</a>; they are not so tolerable when they result in an infinite series of infinite renormalizations or, worse, in an obviously unphysical prediction such as an uncancelled <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_anomaly.html" title="Gauge anomaly">gauge anomaly</a>. There is a deep relationship between renormalizability and gauge invariance, which is easily lost in the course of attempts to obtain tractable Feynman rules by fixing the gauge.</p>

<p>The traditional gauge fixing prescriptions of continuum electrodynamics select a unique representative from each gauge-transformation-related equivalence class using a constraint equation such as the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenz_gauge.html" title="Lorenz gauge">Lorenz gauge</a> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/4/0/f4060cd1ac64291eaff698db21c216b3.png" alt="\partial^\mu A_\mu = 0" />. This sort of prescription can be applied to an Abelian gauge theory such as <a href="../../../q/e/d/QED_0565.html" title="QED">QED</a>, although it results in some difficulty in explaining why the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_identities.html" title="Ward identities">Ward identities</a> of the classical theory carry over to the quantum theory—in other words, why <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman_diagrams.html" title="Feynman diagrams">Feynman diagrams</a> containing internal longitudinally polarized <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_photons.html" title="Virtual photons">virtual photons</a> do not contribute to <a href="../../../s/-/m/S-matrix.html" title="S-matrix">S-matrix</a> calculations. This approach also does not generalize well to non-Abelian gauge groups such as the SU(2) of Yang-Mills and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroweak_theory.html" title="Electroweak theory">electroweak theory</a> and the SU(3) of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chromodynamics.html" title="Quantum chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a>. It suffers from <a href="../../../g/r/i/Gribov_ambiguities.html" title="Gribov ambiguities">Gribov ambiguities</a> and from the difficulty of defining a gauge fixing constraint that is in some sense "orthogonal" to physically significant changes in the field configuration.</p>
<p>More sophisticated approaches do not attempt to apply a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_function.html" title="Delta function">delta function</a> constraint to the gauge transformation degrees of freedom. Instead of "fixing" the gauge to a particular "constraint surface" in configuration space, one can break the gauge freedom with an additional, non-gauge-invariant term added to the Lagrangian density. In order to reproduce the successes of gauge fixing, this term is chosen to be minimal for the choice of gauge that corresponds to the desired constraint and to depend quadratically on the deviation of the gauge from the constraint surface. By the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stationary_phase_approximation.html" title="Stationary phase approximation">stationary phase approximation</a> on which the <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman_path_integral.html" title="Feynman path integral">Feynman path integral</a> is based, the dominant contribution to perturbative calculations will come from field configurations in the neighborhood of the constraint surface.</p>
<p>The perturbative expansion associated with this Lagrangian, using the method of functional quantization, is generally referred to as the <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub>ξ</sub></span> gauge. It reduces in the case of an Abelian U(1) gauge to the same set of <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman_rules.html" title="Feynman rules">Feynman rules</a> that one obtains in the method of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_quantization.html" title="Canonical quantization">canonical quantization</a>. But there is an important difference: the broken gauge freedom appears in the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_integral.html" title="Functional integral">functional integral</a> as an additional factor in the overall normalization. This factor can only be pulled out of the perturbative expansion (and ignored) when the contribution to the Lagrangian of a perturbation along the gauge degrees of freedom is independent of the particular "physical" field configuration. This is the condition that fails to hold for non-Abelian gauge groups. If one ignores the problem and attempts to use the Feynman rules obtained from "naive" functional quantization, one finds that one's calculations contain unremovable <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomalies.html" title="Anomalies">anomalies</a>.</p>
<p>The problem of perturbative calculations in QCD was solved by introducing additional fields known as <a href="../../../f/a/d/Faddeev-Popov_ghosts_2ef8.html" title="Faddeev-Popov ghosts">Faddeev-Popov ghosts</a>, whose contribution to the gauge-fixed Lagrangian offsets the anomaly introduced by the coupling of "physical" and "unphysical" perturbations of the non-Abelian gauge field. From the functional quantization perspective, the "unphysical" perturbations of the field configuration (the gauge transformations) form a subspace of the space of all (infinitesimal) perturbations; in the non-Abelian case, the embedding of this subspace in the larger space depends on the configuration around which the perturbation takes place. The ghost term in the Lagrangian represents the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_determinant.html" title="Functional determinant">functional determinant</a> of the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobian.html" title="Jacobian">Jacobian</a> of this embedding, and the properties of the ghost field are dictated by the exponent desired on the determinant in order to correct the functional measure on the remaining "physical" perturbation axes.</p>

<p>In the BRST formalism, one sets aside the gauge <i>group</i> action on the fields and focuses on an approximation linear in its gauge algebra, which is known in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representation_theory.html" title="Representation theory">representation theory</a> as the Ward operator <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i>(δλ)</span>). The Ward operator on each field may be identified (up to a sign convention) with the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_derivative.html" title="Lie derivative">Lie derivative</a> along the vertical vector field associated with the parameter <span class="texhtml">δλ</span> of the Ward operator. The <b>BRST operator</b> <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> on fields resembles the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Exterior_derivative.html" title="Exterior derivative">exterior derivative</a> on the gauge bundle, or rather to its restriction to a reduced space of alternating forms which are defined only on vertical vector fields. On 0-forms <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/f/3/ef3e0a2cb4c4e71296bf9ae00ac26fce.png" alt="X \in {Pl}_0" /> the Ward and BRST operators are related (up to a phase convention introduced by Kugo and Ojima, whose notation we will follow in the treatment of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_vector.html" title="State vector">state vectors</a> below) by <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i>(δλ)<i>X</i> = δλ<i>s</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>X</i></span>.</p>
<p>Like the exterior derivative, the BRST operator is <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilpotent.html" title="Nilpotent">nilpotent</a> of degree 2, i. e., <span class="texhtml">(<i>s</i><sub><i>B</i></sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 0</span>. The variation of any "BRST <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exact_form.html" title="Exact form">exact form</a>" <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>X</i></span> with respect to a local gauge transformation is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/d/f/9dffe2129c14ef5f555930a768c7551b.png" alt="[i_{\delta\lambda},\, s_B] s_B X = i_{\delta\lambda} (s_B s_B X) + s_B (i_{\delta\lambda} (s_B X)) = s_B (i_{\delta\lambda} (s_B X))" />, which is itself an exact form. This implies that its integral over each (compact) fiber of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is zero.</p>
<p>More importantly for the Hamiltonian perturbative formalism (which is carried out not on the fiber bundle but on a local section), adding a BRST exact term to a gauge invariant Lagrangian density preserves the relation <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>L</i> = 0</span>. As we shall see, this implies that there is a related operator <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> on the state space for which <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/6/a/96a398066b10f7282e048cfb80beb2b5.png" alt="[Q_B,\, \mathcal{H}] = 0" />—i. e., the BRST operator on Fock states is a conserved charge of the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_system.html" title="Hamiltonian system">Hamiltonian system</a>. This implies that the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_evolution_operator.html" title="Time evolution operator">time evolution operator</a> in a Dyson series calculation will not evolve a field configuration obeying <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/e/3/de3c5bb081f2a6d97e35ae5d86985787.png" alt="Q_B |\Psi_i\rangle = 0" /> into a later configuration with <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/b/4/bb4b71f85403ed3b9945b5ef6305cd5b.png" alt="Q_B |\Psi_f\rangle \neq 0" /> (or vice versa).</p>
<p>Another way of looking at the nilpotence of the BRST operator is to say that its <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image.html" title="Image">image</a> (the space of BRST exact forms) lies entirely within its <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kernel.html" title="Kernel">kernel</a> (the space of BRST closed forms). (The "true" Lagrangian, presumed to be invariant under local gauge transformations, is in the kernel of the BRST operator but not in its image.) The preceding argument says that we can limit our universe of initial and final conditions to asymptotic "states"—field configurations at timelike infinity, where the interaction Lagrangian is "turned off"—that lie in the kernel of <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> and still obtain a unitary scattering matrix. (BRST closed and exact states are defined similarly to BRST closed and exact fields; closed states are annihilated by <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span>, while exact states are those obtainable by applying <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> to some arbitrary field configuration.)</p>
<p>We can also suppress states that lie inside the image of <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> when defining the asymptotic states of our theory—but the reasoning is a bit subtler. Since we have postulated that the "true" Lagrangian of our theory is gauge invariant, the true "states" of our Hamiltonian system are equivalence classes under local gauge transformation; in other words, two initial or final states in the Hamiltonian picture that differ only by a BRST exact state are physically equivalent. However, the use of a BRST exact gauge breaking prescription does not guarantee that the interaction Hamiltonian will preserve any particular subspace of closed field configurations that we can call "orthogonal" to the space of exact configurations. (This is a crucial point, often mishandled in QFT textbooks. There is no <i>a priori</i> inner product on field configurations built into the action principle; we construct such an inner product as part of our Hamiltonian perturbative apparatus.)</p>
<p>We therefore focus on the vector space of BRST closed configurations at a particular time with the intention of converting it into a <a href="../../../f/o/c/Fock_space.html" title="Fock space">Fock space</a> of intermediate states suitable for Hamiltonian perturbation. To this end, we shall endow it with <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladder_operators.html" title="Ladder operators">ladder operators</a> for the energy-momentum eigenconfigurations (particles) of each field, complete with appropriate (anti-)commutation rules, as well as a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positive_semi-definite.html" title="Positive semi-definite">positive semi-definite</a> <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_product.html" title="Inner product">inner product</a>. We require that the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_product.html" title="Inner product">inner product</a> be <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular.html" title="Singular">singular</a> exclusively along directions that correspond to BRST exact eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. This ensures that one can freely choose, from within the two equivalence classes of asymptotic field configurations corresponding to particular initial and final eigenstates of the (unbroken) free-field Hamiltonian, any pair of BRST closed Fock states that we like.</p>
<p>The desired quantization prescriptions will also provide a <i>quotient</i> Fock space isomorphic to the <b>BRST cohomology</b>, in which each BRST closed equivalence class of intermediate states (differing only by an exact state) is represented by exactly one state that contains no quanta of the BRST exact fields. This is the Fock space we want for <i>asymptotic</i> states of the theory; even though we will not generally succeed in choosing the particular final field configuration to which the gauge-fixed <i>Lagrangian</i> dynamics would have evolved that initial configuration, the singularity of the inner product along BRST exact degrees of freedom ensures that we will get the right entries for the physical scattering matrix.</p>
<p>(Actually, we should probably be constructing a <a href="../../../k/r/e/Krein_space.html" title="Krein space">Krein space</a> for the BRST-closed intermediate Fock states, with the time reversal operator playing the role of the "fundamental symmetry" relating the Lorentz-invariant and positive semi-definite inner products. The asymptotic state space is presumably the Hilbert space obtained by quotienting BRST exact states out of this Krein space.)</p>
<p>In sum, no field introduced as part of a BRST gauge fixing procedure will appear in asymptotic states of the gauge-fixed theory. However, this does not imply that we can do without these "unphysical" fields in the intermediate states of a perturbative calculation! This is because perturbative calculations are done in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interaction_picture.html" title="Interaction picture">interaction picture</a>. They implicitly involve initial and final states of the non-interaction Hamiltonian <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/6/a/36a00b2dae922834f79134851ee837b8.png" alt="\mathcal{H}_0" />, gradually transformed into states of the full Hamiltonian in accordance with the <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adiabatic_theorem.html" title="Adiabatic theorem">adiabatic theorem</a> by "turning on" the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interaction_Hamiltonian_37f3.html" title="Interaction Hamiltonian">interaction Hamiltonian</a> (the gauge coupling).

<p>T. Kugo and I. Ojima are commonly credited with the discovery of the principal QCD <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_confinement.html" title="Color confinement">color confinement</a> criterion. Their role in obtaining a correct version of the BRST formalism in the Lagrangian framework seems to be less widely appreciated. It is enlightening to inspect their variant of the BRST transformation, which emphasizes the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermitian_operator.html" title="Hermitian operator">hermitian</a> properties of the newly introduced fields, before proceeding from an entirely geometrical angle. The gauge fixed Lagrangian density is below; the two terms in parentheses form the coupling between the gauge and ghost sectors, and the final term becomes a Gaussian weighting for the functional measure on the auxiliary field <span class="texhtml"><i>B</i></span>.</p>

This field must enter into the formulas for infinitesimal gauge transformations on objects (such as fermions <span class="texhtml">ψ</span>, gauge bosons <span class="texhtml"><i>A</i><sub>μ</sub></span>, and the ghost <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i></span> itself) which carry a non-trivial representation of the gauge group.

There are two kinds of quanta in the Fock space of the gauge-fixed Hamiltonian that we expect to lie entirely outside the kernel of the BRST operator: those of the Faddeev-Popov anti-ghost <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/a/4/aa4b2218d6f2ac59e29ffd0da3ce8e19.png" alt="\bar{c}" /> and the forward polarized gauge boson.

These are the four types of "unphysical" quanta which will not appear in the asymptotic states of a perturbative calculation—<i>if</i> we get our quantization rules right.</p>
<p>The anti-ghost is taken to be a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorentz_scalar.html" title="Lorentz scalar">Lorentz scalar</a> for the sake of Poincaré invariance in <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/5/4/8545ff60be0177a6852a0217dbd966ac.png" alt="-i (\partial^\mu \bar{c}) D_\mu c" />.

<p>In order to do the BRST method justice, we must switch from the "algebra-valued fields on Minkowski space" picture typical of quantum field theory texts (and of the above exposition) to the language of <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber_bundles.html" title="Fiber bundles">fiber bundles</a>, in which there are two quite different ways to look at a gauge transformation: as a change of local section (also known in <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> as a <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_transformation.html" title="Passive transformation">passive transformation</a>) or as the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pullback_%28differential_geometry%29.html" title="Pullback (differential geometry)">pullback</a> of the field configuration along a vertical diffeomorphism of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principal_bundle.html" title="Principal bundle">principal bundle</a>. It is the latter sort of gauge transformation that enters into the BRST method. Unlike a passive transformation, it is well-defined globally on a principal bundle with any structure group over an arbitrary manifold; this is important in several approaches to a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_Everything_75c9.html" title="Theory of Everything">Theory of Everything</a>. (However, for concreteness and relevance to conventional QFT, this article will stick to the case of a principal gauge bundle with compact fiber over 4-dimensional Minkowski space.)</p>
<p>A principal gauge bundle <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> over a 4-manifold <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i></span> is locally isomorphic to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/d/8/3d8915653a58b0dfca081ff9b347a274.png" alt="(U \subset \mathbb{R}^4) \times F" />, where the <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber.html" title="Fiber">fiber</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i></span> is isomorphic to a <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_group.html" title="Lie group">Lie group</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span>, the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_group.html" title="Gauge group">gauge group</a> of the field theory. (This is an isomorphism of manifold structures, not of group structures; there is no special surface in <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> corresponding to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/5/7/157c2eb0288b235d6cbbcae46ba1b362.png" alt="1 \in G" />, so it is more proper to say that the fiber <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i></span> is a <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span>-<a href="../../../t/o/r/Torsor.html" title="Torsor">torsor</a>.) Its most basic property as a <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber_bundle.html" title="Fiber bundle">fiber bundle</a> is the "projection to the base space" <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/4/7/247c9aa92acb0385713bf6bd4442b542.png" alt="\pi:\, P \rightarrow M" />, which defines the "vertical" directions on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> (those lying within the fiber <span class="texhtml">π <sup>− 1</sup>(<i>p</i>)</span> over each point <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/2/2/722e922493fc7fc32ead9ad5a25fb032.png" alt="p \in M" />). As a gauge bundle it has a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_action.html" title="Group action">left action</a> of <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span> on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> which respects the fiber structure, and as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principal_bundle.html" title="Principal bundle">principal bundle</a> it also has a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_action.html" title="Group action">right action</a> of <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span> on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> which also respects the fiber structure and commutes with the left action.</p>
<p>The left action of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure_group.html" title="Structure group">structure group</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span> on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> corresponds to a mere change of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinate_system.html" title="Coordinate system">coordinate system</a> on an individual fiber. The (global) right action <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/1/c/11ce512ca428b799f15d7a38b3dd639a.png" alt="R_g:\, P \rightarrow P" /> of a (fixed) <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/2/c/72c2de6dada513c3d289a176500f29c8.png" alt="g \in G" /> corresponds to an actual <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automorphism.html" title="Automorphism">automorphism</a> of each fiber and hence to a map of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> to itself. In order for <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> to qualify as a principal <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span>-bundle, the global right action of each <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/2/c/72c2de6dada513c3d289a176500f29c8.png" alt="g \in G" /> must be an automorphism with respect to the manifold structure of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> with a smooth dependence on <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i></span>—i. e., a diffeomorphism from <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/e/c/cecb22957a54bb8a1a1fe31fc60ce035.png" alt="P \times G" /> to <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>.</p>
<p>The existence of the global right action of the structure group picks out a special class of right invariant geometric objects on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>—those which do not change when they are pulled back along <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>g</i></sub></span> for all values of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/2/c/72c2de6dada513c3d289a176500f29c8.png" alt="g \in G" />. The most important right invariant objects on a principal bundle are the right invariant <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_fields.html" title="Vector fields">vector fields</a>, which form an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal.html" title="Ideal">ideal</a> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/1/4/8146573517967557175b7374b5f01cb5.png" alt="\mathfrak{E}" /> of the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_algebra.html" title="Lie algebra">Lie algebra</a> of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>. Those vector fields on <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> which are both right invariant and vertical form an ideal <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/9/d/39daafb6811de0f7e9f372ec055ff151.png" alt="V\mathfrak{E}" /> of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/1/4/8146573517967557175b7374b5f01cb5.png" alt="\mathfrak{E}" />, which has a relationship to the entire bundle <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> analogous to that of the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_algebra.html" title="Lie algebra">Lie algebra</a> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/a/9fa60b47d3ec5aeffcb61fe983c9e72b.png" alt="\mathfrak{g}" /> of the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauge_group.html" title="Gauge group">gauge group</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span> to the individual <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span>-torsor fiber <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i></span>.</p>
<p>We suppose that the "field theory" of interest is defined in terms of a set of "fields" (smooth maps into various vector spaces) defined on a principal gauge bundle <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>. Different fields carry different <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representations.html" title="Representations">representations</a> of the gauge group <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i></span>, and perhaps of other <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetry_groups.html" title="Symmetry groups">symmetry groups</a> of the manifold such as the <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poincar%C3%A9_group.html" title="Poincaré group">Poincaré group</a>. One may define the space <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i><i>l</i></span> of local polynomials in these fields and their derivatives. The fundamental Lagrangian density of one's theory is presumed to lie in the subspace <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i><i>l</i><sub>0</sub></span> of polynomials which are real-valued and invariant under any unbroken non-gauge symmetry groups. It is also presumed to be invariant not only under the left action (passive coordinate transformations) and the global right action of the gauge group but also under local gauge transformations—<a href="../../../p/u/l/Pullback_%28differential_geometry%29.html" title="Pullback (differential geometry)">pullback</a> along the infinitesimal diffeomorphism associated with an arbitrary choice of right invariant vertical vector field <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/a/e/2ae4f66bfdf58dbb91641e62b76ae380.png" alt="\epsilon \in V\mathfrak{E}" />.</p>
<p>Identifying local gauge transformations with a particular subspace of vector fields on the manifold <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> equips us with a better framework for dealing with infinite-dimensional infinitesimals: <a href="../../../d/i/f/Differential_geometry.html" title="Differential geometry">differential geometry</a> and the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Exterior_calculus.html" title="Exterior calculus">exterior calculus</a>. The change in a scalar field under pullback along an infinitesimal automorphism is captured in the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_derivative.html" title="Lie derivative">Lie derivative</a>, and the notion of retaining only the term linear in the scale of the vector field is implemented by separating it into the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_derivative.html" title="Inner derivative">inner derivative</a> and the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Exterior_derivative.html" title="Exterior derivative">exterior derivative</a>. (In this context, "forms" and the exterior calculus refer exclusively to degrees of freedom which are dual to vector fields <i>on the gauge bundle</i>, not to degrees of freedom expressed in (Greek) tensor indices on the base manifold or (Roman) matrix indices on the gauge algebra.)</p>
<p>The Lie derivative on a manifold is a globally well-defined operation in a way that the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_derivative.html" title="Partial derivative">partial derivative</a> is not. The proper generalization of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairaut%27s_theorem.html" title="Clairaut's theorem">Clairaut's theorem</a> to the non-trivial manifold structure of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is given by the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lie_bracket.html" title="Lie bracket">Lie bracket</a> of vector fields and the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilpotence.html" title="Nilpotence">nilpotence</a> of the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Exterior_derivative.html" title="Exterior derivative">exterior derivative</a>. And we obtain an essential tool for computation: the generalized Stokes theorem, which allows us to integrate by parts and drop the surface term as long as the integrand drops off rapidly enough in directions where there is an open boundary. (This is not a trivial assumption, but can be dealt with by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renormalization.html" title="Renormalization">renormalization</a> techniques such as <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_regularization.html" title="Dimensional regularization">dimensional regularization</a> as long as the surface term can be made gauge invariant.)</p>

<p>(This time around I will absorb factors of <span class="texhtml">− <i>i</i><i>g</i><i>t</i><sup><i>a</i></sup></span> into the definitions of the gauge field and its friends to obtain true Lie algebra elements and their duals instead of real-valued coefficients. This eliminates the need for the Grassmann parameter—really an element of the vertical ideal on the gauge bundle—to appear in "conjugated" form or to anti-commute with anything other than an operator of odd grade in the exterior algebra.)</p>

<p>Chapter 16 of Peskin &amp; Schroeder (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-50397-2</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-50934-2</a>) applies the "BRST symmetry" to reason about anomaly cancellation in the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian. This is a good start for QFT non-experts, although the connections to geometry are omitted and the treatment of asymptotic Fock space is only a sketch.</p>
