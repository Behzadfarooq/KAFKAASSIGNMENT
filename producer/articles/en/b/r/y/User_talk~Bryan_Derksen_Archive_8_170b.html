<p>I wasn't gonna. But if you wanna, go for it. &#160;;) Just wasn't sure if there was a proper way. Figured the list was sufficient, but I suppose the ideal solution is that every single article on Wiki is categorized.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 05:34, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. Hit one Washington Metro article while random-paging, and had a few spare minutes so I dove in. There doesn't seem to be much of a standard right now, so I figure one will develop out of the chaos of editing if enough people categorize stuff.&#160;:) If nothing else, putting all those articles in a category gives a convenient "handle" for recategorizing them later. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:50, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right now the overwhelming listing of Metro stop articles hides the more important Metro line articles. I think all the stop articles should be put in Category:Washington Metro stops, leaving the line articles in the base Washington Metro category—that's how I've handled it with <a href="../../../n/e/w/Category%7ENew_York_City_Subway_24dc.html" title="Category:New York City Subway">Category:New York City Subway</a> and intended to do it with this too. I don't know if this is a particular interest of yours, but another project that needs to be undertaken is renaming many of those stops with "(Washington Metro)" at the end that have the same names as independent DC places (i.e., <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judiciary_Square_5991.html" title="Judiciary Square">Judiciary Square</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Street_39a6.html" title="King Street">King Street</a>). Even if King Street, for example, doesn't rate its own article (I'm thinking about it), it should at least be made clear that "King Street" isn't simply a Metro stop and has no independent meaning. I was planning to eventually get around to that myself. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 07:48, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good to me. This isn't really an area of interest of mine, though, so I'll just do the recategorization and leave it to those who know more about Washington geography to do the moving and renaming stuff. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:53, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mozilla's tabbed browsing function. I start by middle-clicking my way down the list of stations, opening each one in a new tab. Then I cycle through the tabs, clicking "edit this page" on each one. Then I go back to the first tab again, by which time all the articles are now open in editing windows. Highlight the old category, paste, click save (actually ctrl-v, tab, ctrl-v, tab, space, enter - pastes the new category into the article and edit summary, marks the edit as "minor", then triggers the save button. This set of keypresses has become so habitual it takes maybe a second or so&#160;:), and then move on to the next tab while the edit uploads. When Wikipedia's slow there can be dozens of articles in the process of saving in the background at once.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:13, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you use your sysop powers to do this rename?</p>
<p>It's needed for consistency with all the other "List of FEATURE-TYPEs on PLANET/SATELLITE/ASTEROID" pages that I'm classifying in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Category%7ESurface_feature_nomenclature_of_solar_system_bodies_7d94.html" title="Category:Surface feature nomenclature of solar system bodies">Category:Surface feature nomenclature of solar system bodies</a>, and it's needed to make the category alphabetical sorting come out right under "M".</p>

<p>On another note, perhaps <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECratons_3e18.html" title="Category:Cratons">Category:Cratons</a> would be useful to create as a subcategory of continents if you plan to add articles on those as well? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:32, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose that my love for palæocontinents blinded me to the concerns of others. The Australians seem to think about their land more as a country than a continent. I shall only categorize when I add new continents such as I did yesterday, when I added <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurentia.html" title="Laurentia">Laurentia</a>. I shall lurk in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> and maybe contribute a bit there after a while.

<dd>No problem. It's not so much a question of "sensitivity" in my case, as it was that most of the categorizations you added didn't really seem to apply; you'd categorized North America under "Geological timescale", for example, and I can't see any way in which North America is a geological time period. It was also put in Category:Earthquakes, and North America <i>definitely</i> isn't an earthquake.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:44, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've slightly altered your article on Celestial body atmospheres and added a section "Theoretical ideas on the atmospheres of interstellar exoplanets"though I'm not quite sure it belongs with the article it's attached to or should be moved to a new one....

<dd>Looks like a neat addition! You're right, though, I'm not sure that it fits so well in this particular article. It might fit on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extrasolar_planet.html" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planet</a>, but the definition currently over there would exclude them because interstellar exoplanets don't orbit stars. Hm... perhaps you could move this to its own article, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_planet.html" title="Interstellar planet">interstellar planet</a>?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fictional deities</span></h2>
<p>Hello Bryan Derksen,</p>
<p>You recently removed categories of some D&amp;D deities to <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_deities_1132.html" title="Category:Fictional deities">Category:Fictional deities</a>, when they had other Categories in either Gods or Goddesses.</p>
<p>This is fair enough, but at the same time some deities with specific genders remain in the main Deities page. Should I deal with the obvious ones? Or... It is my opinion, that despite deities often being termed as he or she, these aren't actually accurate - deities are deities, and can masquerade as either sex. So should there even BE subcategories for gods and goddesses?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EErolos_d52a.html" title="User:Erolos">Erolos</a> 17:02, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I wouldn't have created those subcategories myself given the choice; that's why I didn't do any work to sort the other dieties, I just did the ones I'd come across while reading through all the Forgotten Realms-related articles. But I also don't strongly oppose the subcategories, so I don't plan to campaign for their destruction.&#160;:) Anyway, IMO for some gods and goddesses the gender is a pretty well defined part of their description, much like their portfolios and other such details, and those are probably okay to move into the gendered subcategories. Others don't have gender so strongly defined (often the "monsterous" deities like Cthulhu, for example) or are otherwise ambiguous, and those should stay in the root fictional deities category. Ideally, IMO each deity will only be in one of the three categories. The guidelines at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> seem to support this, suggesting that redundancy and over-generalization leads to needless clutter.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, those are my thoughts on the matter. I was just cruising through those articles on one of my random walks through Wikipedia, so if you find some edit of mine that you really want to revert I probably won't even notice let alone object.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:56, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've edited the first table in your sandbox version to use CSS styling instead of "small" tags, what do you think? I generally prefer CSS where possible, and in this case it allows the font size for the entire board to be modified again in the future quickly and easily.

<dd>Oh, I wasn't really being "active in the arts." What I do on some days when I'm bored is click "random page" until I hit an article that needs some easy-to-do work - in this case, presumably one that lacked a category. If I did a whole lot of categorization in one particular field, that probably means I hit a jackpot - a juicy "list of" article that hadn't been made into an analogous category yet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linking Syntax</span></h2>
<p>I am the fool who thought placing a category in a page only provided a link to the page of the category. I thought that Category:Geological Time Scale would be useful for <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pang%C3%A6a.html" title="Pangæa">Pangæa</a> and ended up listing <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pang%C3%A6a.html" title="Pangæa">Pangæa</a> in Geological Time Scale. I found out how categories truly worked the hard way.</p>
<p>Well now, the way categories work now is cool; the category-pages just write themselves. Still it would be nice to link to a related category without being listed in it. Maybe, the next version of the software could recognize two linking syntaxes for categories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ [ Category:X ] ]</li>
<li>{ { Category:X } }</li>
</ul>
<p>One would generate a simple link like between <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pang%C3%A6a.html" title="Pangæa">Pangæa</a> and Category:Geological Time Scale; while, the other would categorize <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pang%C3%A6a.html" title="Pangæa">Pangæa</a> into Category:Continent.</p>
<ul>

<dd>Actually, there's already a syntax for it. Put a colon at the front of the link, like so: [[:Category:Geology]] becomes <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeology_d2cd.html" title="Category:Geology">Category:Geology</a>. You can also do this with images (eg, <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.png_c43a.html" title="Image:Smiley.png">Image:Smiley.png</a>) and templates (eg, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">Template:disambig</a>), and possibly other things that I can't think of offhand. Category links like this would probably be best suited for the "see also" section, but I'm not sure whether there are any standard practices being developed about linking category pages in this way. I guess you could try doing a couple and see if anyone comments on it.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:20, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the note. I know that at one point you all had come to a silly consensus, where "deity" was used instead of the word "god"/"God" (a consensus I was happy with). But from what I could tell in the history, this consensus was overturned by Sam Spade acting on his own. Sam Spade frequently does this sort of thing on pages that bare a philosophy he doesn't like. He even started a VfD for the libertarian socialism page with the excuse that he didn't understand it, and, that, he thought we were playing an elaborate trick on him. The only reason I ever registered a user name was so that I could vote <i>keep</i> on that VfD. On the death metal page he wrote an absurd statement that I think most DM fans would find offensive, but I let it stand because I'm tired of dealing with him. There just comes a point when I feel like people need to stand up to him. If I'm wrong on this, feel free to change the capitalization back to avoid conflict; I won't get into a battle over this if you do so, but if Sam Spade does so, I think I probably will. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 03:06, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

They're administrative pages and probably don't need to be restored, but I would like to get ahold of the text that was in some of them since it may be relevant at some point in the future. Does anyone have suggestions on how I might go about finding this? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:45, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I just this very moment noticed that that category already existed. However, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_nuclear_explosive_tests_8143.html" title="Category:American nuclear explosive tests">Category:American nuclear explosive tests</a> can be further sub-categorized under American history, American military, etc. so I think it isn't such a bad idea. Other countries don't have as many articles for nuclear testing, so breaking them down by country wouldn't be necessary; they can just go right under cat:nuclear tests. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:36, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Bryan, thanks for the janitorial services, keep up the good work! However, could you teach your bot (it is a bot, is it?) to mark its changes as minor? If it's the category it fixes and nothing more actually, then I see no point in overcrowding the watchlists. Also, what is the point in removing the categories from a template into the articles themselves? The effect is the same with the exception that it's easier to add just a template message than template and the same set of categories to all project pages.

<dd>Heh. Not a bot, I've been doing categories manually. With Mozilla's tabbed windows it's easy to develop a rapid patter for doing simple cut-and-paste changes like bulk categorizing. I've actually been of two minds on whether categorization is minor or not, but since you ask I'll try to lean more on the side of marking them minor. As for the template category issue, I feel it is inappropriate to put categories in "navbar" templates because the two features serve distinct functions. Many of the articles that wind up with templates do not properly belong to the categories that are included with them. For example, although I didn't take the time to clean it up myself this time around, most of the articles with Template:Polish Secret State probably should not be located directly in Category:World War II; it's excessive and overly redundant clutter. They should be in sub-categories. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:58, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the quick answer. As to the categories - IMO if you find the categories wrong - feel free to correct them. However, I still do not understand the reasons behind removing the categories from a template into the articles themselves. The navboxes are not only a nice and clean way to let the users navigate between sub-pages of the same project, but they also serve as templates that ease the work of a wikipedian who writes the articles. That's why I decided that it would be easier for me to add the categories to the Template - it's much easier to write {{Polish Secret State}} than to write {{Polish Secret State}} [[Category:World War II]] [[Category:Polish history]] [[Category:World War II resistance movements]]. It saves both time and effort.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Catherine Palace images</span></h2>
<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>I'm still learning about images - I noticed that your positioning in individual thumbnails is now "none", but preceded by **div class="floatright"**</p>
<p>Could you please inform me more about this technique? How does this differ in effect from positioning each image "right"? I note that those editors with tiny monitors (800 px) object to the larger images - my theory is that a reasonably sized image may obviate the necessity of a click-through to what is in some cases an over-large image (see <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Gorges_Dam_1276.html" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> and click on one of the first few images - I have not yet produced an intermediate as is needed in this case, not my contributed image), so I tend to prefer a 300 pixel minimum. I have also had a carefully constructed gallery destroyed by an editor - it appears that the editor did not like the detachment of image from text, as the gallery followed the text. This destruction resulted in some of the ugliest image layout I have yet seen on WP. I restored it by putting the gallery <i>before</i> the text and then referencing the specific image within the nested sub-article with a postage stamp sized image - see <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seismic_retrofit.html#Exterior_reinforcement_of_building" title="Seismic retrofit">seismic retrofit#Exterior reinforcement of building</a>. At least that has (thankfully) been left undisturbed for a while. Where a large number of images are to be shown I have been putting these in floating galleries (see <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html#Architecture" title="Shanghai">Shanghai#Architecture</a> as an example) specifically so that they may be of reasonable size, and where the image is central to the theme of the article, to make it large and prevent text wrapping with appropriate coding. See <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundial_Bridge_c1fa.html" title="Sundial Bridge">Sundial Bridge</a> for a large article preface picture with a trailing gallery. That article would definitely loose its impact with a smaller image as the image is a representation of the visual impact of the object. I do think that 250 pix is too small for my preferences in the particular case of Catherine Palace, but that a gallery is not yet appropriate for that article, and a large image would be inappropriate as the article is about the palace - not its visual importance as with the bridge article. What we really need is a variable image width by user screen width - at least it would be nice to set this up as a user preference. I think that there methods to get the user's width - at least the window size, but the Wiki engine would have to have some extensions to process this correctly.</p>
<p>By the way, what size monitor do you use and why did you feel that the images were <i>out of control</i> (a bit)?</p>
<p>Please respond here - I will watch your page.</p>

<dd>Heh, many comments in one. I'll try to answer them all.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, the div. I use the "classic" skin rather than the "monobook" skin, and although I didn't know it at the time the "monobook" skin apparently automatically stacks floating images in a column down the side of the page. In "classic" it doesn't; try switching your preference over to "classic" skin temporarily and have a look at the version before my edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Catherine_Palace&amp;oldid=5776516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Catherine_Palace&amp;oldid=5776516" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. All the images are in a row at the top instead of a column down the side, which squeezes the text into a tiny little column on the left. By turning off the built-in layout code (using the "none" keyword) I forced the images to form a column, and by wrapping the whole group in a div I was able to tell the whole group of images to float to the right. Here's a quick demo, using a div with a visible border (and note that I'm still in "classic" skin):</dd>

<dd>I have since learned that Monobook handles image layout better than Classic does, however, so I've mostly stopped doing that (but I haven't worried about going back and removing it from articles I've done that in, since it looks the same in Monobook either way). At some point I'm going to file a bug report and see if I can get Classic fixed to work like Monobook does.</dd>

<dd>As for resizing them down from 350 to 250 pixels, that was just due to my own personal preference for what a "good sized" thumbnail was. I agree that it'd be nice to have an adaptive thumbnail setting, once upon a time I used to just use the "thumbnail" keyword without specifying a size in the hopes that that would be implemented soon. Personally, I think Wikipedia articles should be primarily focused on the <i>text</i> and use images only to accentuate the text rather than as the main centerpiece of the article. Generally speaking I would only leave images larger than around 300 pixels if it was a map or diagram that would become illegible at smaller sizes. In my opinion a thumbnail should be large enough to let the reader know what's in the image so that he can decide if he wants to click and see the full-sized version and not much larger than that. However, I don't feel strongly enough about this that I'd argue if you made those images 350 pixels again.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:20, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much for your prompt and very informative response. I agree that many find 350 pixels too wide, but I feel that the 250 pixel WP "standard" is too small - I have been recently been setting to 300 pixels in the hope that this will stick, but it still gets downsized in some articles - which I why I have taken to galleries and (only in a few and especially appropriate cases), wide images isolated from the text (not only the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundial_Bridge_c1fa.html" title="Sundial Bridge">Sundial Bridge</a> but also a bridge panorama in the <a href="../../../w/u/h/Wuhan.html#History" title="Wuhan">Wuhan#History</a> section of the article. This latter example simply would not work well in a more restricted format. I admit to pushing the envelope further down in the article with the concert group panorama, especially since it is not isolated.</dd>

<dd>I will follow your model for right hand images in my new work and will try to go through my older articles as time permits. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 02:34, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, I believe the Sundial Bridge article is a perfect illustration of what I said about how images should serve the text of the article rather than the other way around; that first 700 pixel image completely dominates the article, with the descriptive text about the bridge tucked away at the bottom where I have to scroll down to see it. Furthermore, at 700 pixels the image is too wide for people browsing on 640×480 or smaller screens (don't laugh, I bet Wikipedia's going to be a popular item for small handheld computers once a properly downloadable version is available&#160;:) and even an 800 pixel wide screen is a bit too small when you allow space for the sidebar, scrollbar, etc. And the image size is 93.5 kilobytes, which is a bit hefty for dialup users especially when combined with the four other thumbnails below. I'm going to shrink it down into a "conventional" right-floating thumbnail, I hope you won't mind too much. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:52, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
