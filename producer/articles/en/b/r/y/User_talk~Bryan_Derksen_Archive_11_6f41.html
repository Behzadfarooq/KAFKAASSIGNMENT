<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category Metabolism</span></h2>
<p>Hi Bryan_Derksen, I have noticed that you have removed <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetabolism_cede.html" title="Category:Metabolism">Category:Metabolism</a> from articles that are already in the subcategory <a href="../../../p/h/o/Category%7EPhotosynthesis_64b4.html" title="Category:Photosynthesis">Category:Photosynthesis</a>. I don't see this as a problem, see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Categories_form_a_graph.2C_not_a_tree" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#Categories_form_a_graph.2C_not_a_tree</a>. It is useful to have all <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabolism.html" title="Metabolism">Metabolism</a> related topic in one category. Category:Photosynthesis contains articles that have nothing to do with Metabolism. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 20:46, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Creating_subcategories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#Creating subcategories</a> says "In the "vertical" dimension, you should probably be more frugal. A good general rule is that articles should be placed in the most specific categories they reasonably fit in." If Category:Photosynthesis contains articles that have nothing to do with Category:Metabolism, then perhaps it shouldn't be a subcategory of it? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:11, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The contents of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Category%7EPhotosynthesis_64b4.html" title="Category:Photosynthesis">Category:Photosynthesis</a> do not have to be a subset of the parent <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetabolism_cede.html" title="Category:Metabolism">Category:Metabolism</a>. As I said, its not a strictly hierarchically tree, its more like a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_net.html" title="Semantic net">semantic net</a> that should mainly aid the users in finding articles. Photosynthesis is clearly related to Metabolism and several articles belong to both categories while others belong only to one. I still think it is a good idea to have all <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabolism.html" title="Metabolism">Metabolism</a> articles together in Category:Metabolism and at the same time to keep Category:Photosynthesis as a subcategory of Category:Metabolism. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 21:44, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears we have a difference in our interpretation of the philosophy of subcategorization, then. I've had a look through the articles currently in category:photosynthesis and didn't spot any that looked like they didn't also belong in category:metabolism (category:phototrophs didn't, but I've now reversed the direction of the relationship between those two categories), so I don't know which articles you're referring to as not fitting into the "subset" pattern. Based on the articles we're currently arguing about, though, perhaps it might help if there was a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetabolic_pathways_6ea5.html" title="Category:Metabolic pathways">Category:Metabolic pathways</a> subcategory to category:metabolism? That way things like "Calvin cycle" would go in there but things like "thylakoid" wouldn't, and it could be a subcategory of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChemical_reactions_81af.html" title="Category:Chemical reactions">Category:Chemical reactions</a> as well. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:57, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

At some point in the near future an admin will visit those VfDs and implement the consensus for each one, keep or delete. Since this is done manually by a completely volunteer labor force the exact timing will vary. In theory I could go do it myself, since I'm an admin, but this is an area of Wikipedia I'm not familiar with and I don't want to study the various guidelines and procedures in detail just for a handful of deletions like this. April 11 is currently about halfway down the list on /Old, I presume it'll be processed when it gets near the bottom. That looks to be in about six days, assuming the current list size represents an equilibrium. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:40, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While one might think that this is now a nice gallery, you have in fact reduced the images to such a tiny (literally postage stamp) size, that now to get any reasonable impression one must click on the images, upping the navigation chore. Note that the preceding gallery was a <i>floating gallery</i>, constructed with no small effort and thought, designed to display on a wide range of window widths, showing each in a reasonable size (not requiring further navigation) and for all screens designed to preserve a good layout. Please comment on your thoughts here. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 03:02, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thumbnail images are tiny, yes, but that's the point. They're still large enough that one can see what's pictured, but if you want to see them in all their glory you click on them. The current total size of the gallery thumbnails is 93054 bytes, originally they were 146895 bytes - this is a significant saving in download time for dial-up users, though the page is still very graphic-heavy and could use more trimming. Frankly, I'm not fond of having image galleries embedded in articles like this at all - I'd much rather see that real estate used by a <i>textual</i> description of Shanghai's architecture, with descriptions of historical trends, famous buildings and architects, etc., with the images serving to illustrate and elaborate rather than being the entire meat of the section. Just looking at these seven images doesn't really tell me much about Shanghai's architecture as a whole - certainly not as much as 93 kilobytes of text would. Finally, the gallery markup is easier to maintain as new images and new features are added in the future. With the images explicitly marked as a gallery like this, there are many things that browsers and other software could potentially do with it - customized layout, for example. The gallery markup is still a relatively new Wikipedia feature, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EGallery_5a0b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Gallery">Wikipedia talk:Gallery</a> has some discussion on what's being done with it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:34, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps I will move the old gallery code to a new article not intended for direct search (e.g. <i>Shanghai architecture image gallery</i> but accessible via a "view gallery" link in that part. This is not ideal of course since this would require double entry maintenance, but the gallery has only had one addition by another since I created it in mid 2004. On the other hand, rather than double maintenance it could become a much richer image source than the primary article. As far as images are concerned I think of WP as a multimedia source. The bandwidth problem in the US is ultimately a short term issue currently stemming from (rational) corporate decision making (neither cable nor telephony see an upside interest in Korean-style high speed internet as this would undercut their current business models) compounded by a lack of appropriate national policy. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 14:54, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about the bandwidth problem in Africa, though? Anyway, splitting off a separate "gallery" article might be a good idea, it'd satisfy me and there are other articles that have such things. But if what you're interested in is a multimedia source rather than an encyclopedia article, perhaps <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Commons_7b57.html" title="Wikimedia Commons">Wikimedia Commons</a> would be more suited to the task? The Commons is specifically intended for that purpose, whereas the multimedia content on Wikipedia is there only to serve its goal as an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:44, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll do that - I have several other articles that can use this treatment also - I'll implement your method and link to mine in these also. With regards to Africa: since they will likely be going to wireless mesh network architecture owing to a "clean slate" infrastructure it would not surprise me if their per-household bandwidth exceeded ours within the next decade.

<p>Why do you claim the article is using the wrong template and has the wrong title? It has existed in this format since its inception and has been edited by other admins before and none of them have made mention of what you claim. Just curious. TruthCrusader</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't claim the article was using the wrong template, I just said the name of the template I was adding was <a href="../../../w/r/o/Template%7EWrongtitle_7b78.html" title="Template:Wrongtitle">Template:wrongtitle</a> - it's what's generating that standardized notice that's currently at the top of the article. As for what's wrong about the title, it's a capitalization issue; Wikipedia's software automatically capitalizes the first letter of an article's title and there's currently no way to override that. So the article is named "Rec.sport.pro-wrestling", when in actuality the newsgroup is "rec.sport.pro-wrestling". This problem is more obvious with articles like <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, which winds up as "IPod".

<p>Hello Bryan Derksen,</p>
<p>I am not a native English speaker. I love Wikipedia, of course! I want to know how one can get feed back on language quality.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting article on "Chesapeake Bay". I saw your name on the history list.</p>
<p>The article has this sentence which I consider correct but very odd and hard to read:</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay contained one of the planet's first identified marine dead zones, where hypoxic waters were so depleted in oxygen they were unable to support life, identified when massive fish kills resulted.</p>
<p><br />
Would it be better to separate the two "stories" like this:</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay contained one of the planet's firstly identified marine dead zones, where hypoxic waters are so depleted in oxygen that they are unable to support life. The resulting massive fish kills spurred public concern.</p>
<p>(or: ... massive fish kills attracted attention.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your opinion</span></h2>
<p>Hi Bryan, an incident has occured in the article <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werewolf.html" title="Werewolf">Werewolf</a> (see <a href="../../../w/e/r/Talk%7EWerewolf_8bd3.html" title="Talk:Werewolf">Talk:Werewolf</a>, Full Moon section). Back on 23:59 Sep 19, 2002, you wrote the sentence that is now at issue, a sentence which seemed to strongly suggest that the idea of the full moon being involved in werewolf transformations does not occur in pre-modern lore (not whether it was a prevalent notion or not). This is repeated in a number of references. Yet, I found a medieval author, Gervase of Tilbury, who wrote otherwise. So I edited the sentence, and replaced it with a new one. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">User:DreamGuy</a> seems to have a problem with this edit, I was wondering if you'd care to weigh in or propose a compromise. I'm not, contrary to what the said User thinks, implying that the full moon was a prevalent notion, only that it indeed occured prior to modern times. Thanks. Also, I think it should be dealt with upfront in the opening paragraph, since it is such a prevalent notion. Decius 03:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the edit you're referring to all I did was change "<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">berserks</a>" to "<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker.html" title="Berserker">berserkers</a>". Perhaps you're thinking of the edit from August 20 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Werewolf&amp;diff=204148&amp;oldid=165534" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Werewolf&amp;diff=204148&amp;oldid=165534" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which was by an anonymous editor? I did do a lot of work on the article back in that timeframe, but it was mostly just integrating the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article on werewolves into this one. I'm afraid I don't really know much about the details of the historical legends surrounding them. I'll take a look at what's being discussed, though, just to see if an outside view will help. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:31, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That was my mistake, of depopulating. I was indirectly informed awhile back that the category discussions were not so much a vote as a discussion, as I remarked on a similiar situation. It seemed it wasn't a harmful or rash move to depopulate and and recat, until after I was done, and reconsidered my decision to do so. I was awaiting the outcome, as some of the obvious cat entries have little discussion, and just need to be depopulated.

<dd>This <i>was</i> discussed, see <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_English_cricket_season_311c.html#Subpages" title="Talk:2005 English cricket season">Talk:2005_English_cricket_season#Subpages</a> - I started that section myself. Even Jguk had no problem with removing the subpage "prefix" to those articles. The only problem that was raised was that these pages might wind up on VfD, but that's not something I have control over (as in I can't preemptively stop other people from doing it) and a page's deleteworthiness doesn't have much to do with whether the articles are subpages or not in any event. The only issue that I raised at the village pump that remains unresolved is the usage of transclusion, which is a separate issue as far as I'm aware. I haven't touched any of that stuff yet, I figured I'd tackle one issue at a time.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for removing that last line of your comment for fear it assumed bad faith, I'll answer it anyway though to allay any remaining suspicions at my motives. I first stumbled across the 2005 English cricket season group of articles while going through <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedpages_5680.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedpages">special:uncategorizedpages</a>, all of the then-subpages were listed there. As I've pointed out in that talk page section I linked to above, subpages aren't used any more in the article namespace of Wikipedia so I went to the "root" article and started that discussion there. It was only later that I realized all that transcluding was going on, which didn't sit well with me for entirely different reasons. The transclusion issue is what I raised over at the village pump, because I wasn't as familiar with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines regarding transclusion as I was with subpages and wanted to see if my gut reaction was reasonable. Discussing issues like that is what the village pump is for. Since I had become involved in cricket articles again, that reminded me to go and check up on the "cricket subcategories" issue that I still consider unresolved. One thing led me to another naturally, I don't "have it in" for WikiProject Cricket or cricket in general. I have no particular interest in the sport one way or the other. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 29 June 2005 00:39 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Magdenburg rights - please, reconsider the last edit</span></h2>
<p><s>Hello, I would like to point, that the correction you have added "especially new cities founded" recently to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdeburg_rights.html" title="Magdeburg rights">Magdeburg rights</a> is not correct historically. Cities never have been founded as they are these days in medieval Europe. Before a city has been established, it always existed as a village. After willage has grown substantially for inter-city trade or a local self goverment was necessary, it was given the mMgenburg city rights and automaticlly received a status of a city. These facts have been preserved in various chronicles, and in many cases these were the first writteen sources the locality was named. So many cities celebrate their foundry date the date they have been mentioned in chronicles. I din't wan't to disregard you, so better fix that yourself . Have a nice day&#160;:)</s> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDariusMazeika_2318.html" title="User:DariusMazeika">DariusMazeika</a> 21:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there bryan, got your message about the lich image thingy, lets put that aside and get to know each other a bit;</p>
<p>1.How did you find me you, or did sango123 tell you about me?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lich.html" title="Lich">lich</a> article watchlisted, since I did some work on it once upon a time and decided I was interested in seeing how it evolved. When you added the lich image I checked it out to see what its source was, and when I found there wasn't one I marked it and left a note on your talk page. Then I checked your user contributions to see if you'd added other unsourced images recently and that's how I found the others. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:51, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2.what's your speciality?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, this and that. I do a lot of work on science fiction and astronomy related articles, but my favourite link is "random article" and I often just cruise around doing minor bits of tidying. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:51, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've gattered up what website there from, from googlo, by seeing the bar where it says (eg:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sango123&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sango123&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sango123&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40</a>), is that what you want to know?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup, that's the most important part - with that information, other people can check out the copyrights and ensure that we aren't using stuff in Wikipedia that we aren't allowed to. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:51, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>ps: could you teach me how to tag the images, please.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Visit this policy page: <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. You'll find a whole bunch of different tags there. The trick is picking out which one should go with any given image. If the image is from a US government website, for example, there's a good chance that it's in the public domain and one of the tags in the section <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#USA_Federal_government_images" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#USA_Federal_government_images</a> will apply. To put a tag on an image, just copy and paste the bit of text with the curly brackets (for example, {{PD-USGov}}) into the image's description page (for example, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Image%7EPolythemusmoth.jpg_8d5c.html" title="Image:Polythemusmoth.jpg">Image:Polythemusmoth.jpg</a> uses this tag). Try clicking on the "edit this page" link for an image that already has a tag and you'll see the text that generated it. These curly-bracket links are known as "templates", <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a> gives an intro to some of the ones that are available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's important to tag images with information about their sources and copyrights since we're trying to create an encyclopedia that's free of legal problems that would prevent it from being distributed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:51, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>hope this helps.</p>
<p>(please note that the GNOLL image is the same as the Gnoll, i just made the mistake of outting it in all capitals, could you delete it.)</p>
