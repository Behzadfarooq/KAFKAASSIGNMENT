<dd>Whether an article is a "stub" or not is a highly subjective thing, as far as I am aware. An article is no longer a stub when you think it's too big or detailed to be called a stub any more.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:52, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed your edit back because as it stands there is at least a link to some info about <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoka.html" title="Ashoka">Ashoka</a>. Changing it to Ashoka pillar without even bothering to create a stub for it seemed to decrease the information content of the article. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">mahābāla</a> 11:01, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But there is already a link to Ashoka just a line or two before the pillar is mentioned. Creating a link to the empty article invites future addition on that subject, whereas having two links to Ashoka in the same paragraph adds nothing that having one link doesn't already provide. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 14:35, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oo, lovely! I've been working from the what-links-here of Wikipedia:Disambiguation, but it doesn't show a complete list. My long-term plan has been to switch everything over to the one uniform msg format, and then get a database query of what links to that and then add them all to the "links to disambiguating pages" in one fell swoop (minus the multiple-place-name articles).

There is some advantage for queries if we keep msg:disambig as well, but there is a slight difference in scope of them, so the usual msg may need an addition. -- User:Docu</dd>

<dd>No problem. One thing to watch out for when using the "move this page" function, BTW, is that it won't work when there's already an article with the new name - even a redirect. In such cases the article you want to replace will have to be deleted, which can only be done by a sysop. You could put it on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> to get a sysop to do it for you, or you could put your name on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a> and do it yourself.

Apologies for the intrusion, but as you have been a positive contributor to the ongoing review of the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Atlantium_31bd.html" title="Empire of Atlantium">Empire of Atlantium</a> article recently I thought you might be interested to note that this article has been listed for deletion for the second time in several months, by a user who appears to have targeted it in some sort of POV-push.

<dl>
<dd><i>Right margin is better for images, IMO, since the text is easier to follow with the eye.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know if I agree with this. Certainly left-hand images should occur at breaks in the text, and the image will be "read" before the text, so the text should be directly related to the text. But given these criteria, I think a judicious few images on the left can give the page a little more visual interest. I wouldn't go so far as to use the zillion sidebars and floating boxes you find in the average magazine, but I think that having all the images on the right, almost the same size, one per section can be a bit dry, so I tried to liven up the page a little. Do you have any suggestions fo giving the page a little more visual appeal? (Or perhaps I'm worrying too much about MTV-addled teens?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My only issue with left-side images is when they're "floating", so that the text flows around them. Since English is read from left to right, I find it easiest when there's a consistent margin for the eye to jump back to when it finishes the line. The right margin can be a lot more "ragged" without being noticeable, since the eye simply scans along the lines until it hits the end of the text. If the text doesn't flow around it, then left-side images are fine (though perhaps consider centering it instead). It makes the article a little bit less "artistic", true, but I think that can actually be a benefit in the case of an encyclopedia article; your comparison to magazine articles is apt.&#160;:) However, this is clearly verging over towards the area of personal taste, so I don't generally go far out of my way to change things; if every second image on that page had been floating left instead of just one I would have been more hesitant to radically remodel.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It would be nice if Wikipedia:image guidelines were a little less about technicalities and more about "does this article <i>really</i> need yet another picture?" As is probably obvious, I tend to err on the side of too many pictures. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 02:43, May 7, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Metric/Imperial References</span></h2>
<p>As stated Wikipedia is an International website, viewed both by Americans and non-Americans. And as such, pages often contain both [SI] and [Imperial Measurements]. The biggest reason that Americans give to resisting the adoption of metric [and being an American, I can say this], is that they're "'not used'" to metric. The only way that they are going to become "'used to'" metric, is to see and to be required to use it. The rest of the world is not us any favors by including non-SI measurements in their definitions.</p>

When I went around restoring the pages Steggall had removed imperial measures from, I always made sure to leave in the metric measures (though in a few cases he'd rounded the metric measurements to the nearest 5 for some reason, perhaps to make them seem more "natural". I undid those changes). The only major problem to keep in mind is precision; if an article says "one million miles", it's not correct to add "(1609344 kilometers)" after it.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:07, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't aware of that decision, but if I'd noticed it being discussed at the time I would have opposed it; putting categorizations in brackets like that should only IMO be done when disambiguation is necessary. Since there's nothing else in Wikipedia with an article that goes by the name "Saturn V", putting (rocket) at the end is completely redundant and should not be done. I note that <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> would seem to agree with me on this, too.

In data terms, Column 2 is never more than 8 characters, but is forced to about 43 characters wide. Column 3 is never more than 13 characters wide, but is forced to, I dunno, about 70. 2) You've wikicoded 2 out of the 22 or so tables. Could you tell me what you see the advantage of doing this is? I note the comments in [Wikipedia:How to use tables]; this doesn't appear to me a case where the tables are now more easy to edit than they were. Indeed, candidly, I'll tell you, as the person who has put ridiculous time into these pages, that for me they make the whole thing more difficult to edit.

<dd>I was on a Special:longpages binge, working my way down through the list looking for articles to shrink, and hit those two. By that point I'd become quite efficient at converting HTML tables to wikimarkup using a couple of search-and-replace techniques, so I tried it out to see how well the page's byte count would reduce. In this case not very much; those external links accounted for most of it. I'd been planning to go back and make sure the other tables in that group of articles got formatted the same over the next few days, but if you're deeply opposed to what I did go ahead and revert; since there wasn't much space saved I'm not going to complain. As for why I changed the headers, that was simply due to my personal "table philosophy"; I try not to force tables into any sort of predefined layout or formatting unless there's some pressing reason for it, instead preferring to let browsers handle them however they prefer. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:13, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If you like I could go through the other pages and convert them all to wiki table markup that produces a result exactly identical to what's currently there, and leave issues of formatting up to you? I was a reluctant convert to wiki table markup myself, BTW, but I've since taken a shine to it because it means the wiki software will automatically generate "correct" HTML code and I won't have to go hunting for where I forgot the / in a &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; or something like that. :) ~~~~</dd>

<dd>I totally agree with you, it's clear that it's this one particular user that's the problem and he's the one that should be the focus of the solution.

<dd>Sure. Chip in how, though? Next time Levzur vandalizes and I block him I'll make sure to provide a more detailed description in the block explanation so that hopefully he won't get unblocked like this again.

<dd>Thanks for your supportive comment - that was fine. Camembert (of the Arbitration Committee) has given some advice on the situation (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_ChrisO_and_Levzur_82a7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/ChrisO and Levzur">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/ChrisO and Levzur</a>) which I think we can use as a green light for an extended ban. We will need to keep an eye on the blocklist to make sure that other admins don't unblock the proxies prematurely, and let them know the situation if they do. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:05, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed you cut and pasted the article to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Morrissey_e97d.html" title="Steven Morrissey">Steven Morrissey</a>, whilst it would seem to make the most sense to have the page there, there aren't many <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Morrissey_ab18.html" title="Neil Morrissey">Neil Morrissey</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Morrissey_701b.html" title="Paul Morrissey">Paul Morrissey</a> references that would link only to the surname. But Steven Morrissey now no longer uses his forenames and most musical references to him would link only to <b>Morrissey</b>. I have created a page <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Morrissey (disambiguation)">Morrissey (disambiguation)</a></i>, so that hopefully there will be minimal confusion.<br />

<dd>I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, since I don't know much about the guy. I did that simply because it seemed to be the correct Wikipedia standard for articles about people and because it preserved more of the article history associated with the text. Wish there was some way to merge the histories, but I guess the edit summaries will tell people where to find the rest of it if necessary. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:19, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are a lot of non-natural disasters that I was planning to put into there, but got distracted from for the time being. Specifically, I was going to start with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_on_commercial_airliners.html" title="List of accidents and incidents on commercial airliners">List_of_accidents_and_incidents_on_commercial_airliners</a> as soon as I worked out a good set of sub-categories to divide them up into. I'm not sure what other category those would all be grouped under (some would fit under "Terrorism" and such, but there are a lot of non-terrorist airplane catastrophes in there too). I don't think Natural hazards fits very well as a direct subcategory under Disasters, due to contents like <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanoes_75eb.html" title="Category:Volcanoes">Category:Volcanoes</a> (which includes Olympus Mons, for example) and the other generic stuff. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:19, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Natural Satellites</span></h2>
<p>Sorry for not checking the template first! I knew there was somewhere to check.. anyway, here's my argument for using mean diameter. First, mean (as opposed to equatorial). Many of the sizes I found were mean, and listed as equatorial, which may be quite a bit off, especially for smaller moons. As for diameter.. it's just a matter of preference. But I did it for half the moons anyway, so..&#160;:P. I did forget to record the dimensions of some moons in their text before deleting them, but I know some reliable sources where I could recover them, later. As for my sources, I'm using JPL's <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov" class="external text" title="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov" rel="nofollow">Solar System Dynamics</a> page except where info isn't available there, in which case I'm using <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~sheppard/satellites" class="external text" title="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~sheppard/satellites" rel="nofollow">Scott Sheppard's page</a>. Anyway, I'll change the template, and I have some plans to put the data box on some moons that haven't been updated within a few days.. I'm a student, and I'm on break. I have plenty of free time to work on it.&#160;:P --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatteroast_e908.html" title="User:Patteroast">Patteroast</a> 15:40, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. I wasn't exactly objecting to your change (though I must admit a moment of panic when I saw you were tampering with my preciousss tables, mine, MINE!&#160;:), in fact I agree that mean diameter probably is better as a "general single number" than equatorial. I just like to keep everything standardized where possible, and figured giving you a heads up on that might make it easier to do. Amalthea was the only irregular moon whose article I spot-checked, so I didn't see that you were preserving dimensions elsewhere and was worried you might not have considered such information to be relevant. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:28, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
