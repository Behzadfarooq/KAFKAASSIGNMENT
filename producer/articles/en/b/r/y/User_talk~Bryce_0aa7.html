<p>I saw your AfD vot for Simson Garfinkel. While he is of somewhat greater noteriety than I (David Mertz) am, there seems to be a common weird bias against academics/computer writers (but a porn actor or indy band of 1/20th the influence is automatically kept). If you feel like voting, thanks. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 17:18, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Being the inclusionist I am, I voted for keeping the article. No problem. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryce_2348.html" title="User:Bryce">Bryce</a> 20:20, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I confess there is a vanity aspect to wanting the article about me to continue, but then, I would (less vehemently) work to keep articles on writers/academics who are <i>less</i> notable than me; just today, an AfD vote and a minor cleanup for Shari Evelyn Kendall. I'm not <i>completely</i> inclusionist, but I do tend to think that earning Ph.D.'s and writing academic books is more notable than a lot of things that people do without being listed on AfD. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:45, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I voted to keep professor Kendall also, thanks for pointing it out. If you'd like to point me at any other endangered academics, feel free; I'll strongly consider voting to keep them. I do wish that these articles talked more about why the person is notable, however. What amount to snippets from a CV may make someone notable if you are in the same field, but for the general audiance of Wikipedia, I think more explaination of the significance of the person's work would be highly helpful. Not only would the articles perhaps be more useful/interesting, it would help keep them of AfD. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryce_2348.html" title="User:Bryce">Bryce</a> 00:16, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't necessarily follow AfD that much. Usually I just see some particular topic that I think should be kept; then kinda get drawn into reading the AfD pages for a couple days. Then it fades. But if I do that, I'll keep you in mind to mention academics at issue. Having started a couple pages on academics myself, I both certainly agree with you on the need for giving general-reader context, but also know that it's a lot easier to start the two sentence version of an article than it is to write six paragraphs on why their work is actually important. If AfD'ers would give articles a couple weeks to magically evolve, I think the significance of academics would emerge better... but when things get AfD'd in a day or two, it's harder. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 00:21, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:1630analyzer.png</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bryce_a951.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bryce">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. Thank you. <a href="../../../n/v/8/User%7ENv8200p_b2e9.html" title="User:Nv8200p">Nv8200p</a> <a href="../../../n/v/8/User_talk%7ENv8200p_4d2d.html" title="User talk:Nv8200p">talk</a> 21:03, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You really goofed up. I created that image and put it into the Public Domain, at a time when - IIRC - it was legitimate to simply put the generic 'PD' in the description. Paranoid morons going around and deleting images because they don't know the exact circumstances are hurting Wikipedia, by filling pages with broken image links. I see more and more of these <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disappeared.html" title="Disappeared">disappeared</a> images these days. It was one thing to delete images with no claim as to their copyright status, but this is going too far. That image had been around for quite a while before you decided to do this. I happened to not log in for a few days and this happens! You could have at least waited a month or so, given how obviously non-urgent the situation was.</dd>
<dd>Really, do something constructive. People like you are vandals as heart, hiding your destructive tendencies behind a disguise of lawfulness.</dd>
<dd>Thankfully, the image was replaced, as I have lost the original that you destroyed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryce_2348.html" title="User:Bryce">Bryce</a> 20:27, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I did not goof up. If I remember correctly, there was no source information on that image, which means the PD tag had no validity. The policy of Wikipedia is an image older than 7 days without a source is to be deleted. Pretty sure I followed the policy in this case. If you are unhappy with this policy, please contact <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a>. I remove image links from articles, when I delete the image, but I'm sure I have missed a few. Others bother not to remove broken links, which, like you said, is detrimental. Though, what could really hurt Wikipedia is if they end up in court because of any one of the thousands of copyright violations on the site. The faster we can get rid of images that are not properly sourced or licensed the better for the project. Sorry if we don't see eye-to-eye on that. <a href="../../../n/v/8/User%7ENv8200p_b2e9.html" title="User:Nv8200p">Nv8200p</a> <a href="../../../n/v/8/User_talk%7ENv8200p_4d2d.html" title="User talk:Nv8200p">talk</a> 22:53, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
