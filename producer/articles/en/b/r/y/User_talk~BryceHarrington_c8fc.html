<p>Hi Bryce, Criteria: 1. Does the city have an port where international vessels can dock safetly? 2. Population should be geater than 500,000. 3. Should be within 20 km from the main coast. See if Portland and other cities you know of qualifies. I'll clarify this in the category.

<p>Ah, Portland doesn't fit since it is not within 20 km of the main coast. The other coastal cities in Oregon do not have populations greater than 100,000. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryceHarrington_3b7b.html" title="User:BryceHarrington">Bryce</a> 05:40, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, we're organizing a Wikipedia meetup in Seattle, tentatively scheduled for the afternoon of November 6th. I understand you're in the Portland area, so I thought we should let you know in case you're interested in attending. I know it's a bit of a drive, but if you want to come we would love to see you there. So far at least one person is planning on coming down from Vancouver, BC, although right now I don't know if anyone else from Portland is coming. The details are being worked out at <a href="../../../m/e/e/Wikipedia%7EMeetup_Seattle_0dbb.html" title="Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle">Wikipedia:Meetup/Seattle</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:15, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bryce--It was great to meet you today. I very much enjoyed hearing your war stories about the early days and GNUPedia.

<p>Bryce, just thought I'd leave a note in case you didn't know you weren't logged in.&#160;:-) Oh, and thanks for the note about your friend's name -- for some reason I completely blanked on the first name and I felt "Mr. Cook" would look bizarrely formal.&#160;:-) Great meeting you yesterday, Jwrosenzweig 20:39, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bryce. I was wondering if you could give me your opinion of something I've done in an attempt to deal with annoying stubs. Towns in Victoria, Australia I found that there were numerous stubs on towns, so I chose Victorian towns and made one article on these. If any are too big, then I just have a link to the main article. All the stubs are now on the one article, and can stay there until they become good articles in themselves. This doesn't seem to have a precedent. It has annoyed people who have worked on the original articles, some incorectly thought I'd not included all their information. Anyway, I was hoping to get an opinion from someone who isn't so involved with the articles. Please see the talk page as well Talk:Towns in Victoria, Australia. Thank you for your time. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChammy_Koala_0670.html" title="User:Chammy Koala">Chammy Koala</a> 11:57, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Chammy. Sorry I didn't reply earlier, I only just noticed it.</p>
<p>I've always taken a low view of the propagation of stub articles. Long, long ago I wrote an essay [<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Stub_Pages" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Stub_Pages" rel="nofollow">Kill the Stub Pages</a>] on exactly that topic.</p>
<p>I also put a good bit of time into fleshing out pages about towns and small cities in Oregon. I tried to always ensure they had enough content that they wouldn't be mere stubs, but in some cases there's not much to say! &#160;;-)</p>
<p>However, for town stub articles I don't think I'd recommend solving the problem by consolodating them, for a few reasons. First, it makes accidental linking not work as well (although perhaps you could solve that via redirects). Secondly, it may discourage people from fleshing those entries out into full articles, which might happen if they were to be stubs. Thirdly, I noticed with my own Oregon town articles that people wrote bots to go through and add demographic details, maps, etc. - you'd probably not gain the advantage of this type of work if you consolodate.</p>
<p>The solution I recommend is to do what I did for the Oregon towns: Pick one town, google for pages on the history of that town, summarize that in a paragraph. Do a few towns each week, and before long you'll have eliminated the stub problem in this section permanently. (Plus, you learn all sorts of useless trivia about the towns that you can bore people with at social gatherings!) &#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryceHarrington_3b7b.html" title="User:BryceHarrington">Bryce</a> 21:28, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi bryce, thanks for getting back to me. I'd pretty much given up the idea of consolidating town stubs as it's a lot of work, and if they become slightly large I have to remove them. Not to mention there are A LOT of towns in just one small corner of the globe. So if I get the time I'll probably take your suggestion, but there are certainly a lot of stubs that need fleshing out. One place I seem to have been successful in consolidating stubs is on the article <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_Yard_c445.html" title="Skin Yard">Skin Yard</a>. This worked because the band isn't all that notable, isn't even together anymore and only had about 5 albums. I had a revert war at first, but that is over now. Anyway, thanks for your reply, and I'll try to flesh out some stubs when I can. Oh, and I've changed my name — --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversmith_d59b.html" title="User:Silversmith">Silversmith</a> 22:20, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
