<dd>You are welcome. I could not find exact verification, but "precis" is good French, and all the websites refer to this as the <i>Precis</i>, so I felt it was fairly safe to correct this.

<dd>Well, I am not familiar with Magnol's work so I will trust you for this. A detail is that the book will have been in Latin which will mean that the word he actually used was "familia" or pl. "familiae" rather than the English "families"&#160;? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 15:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should 76 be spelled as "seventy six", "seventysix", or "seventy-six"? As I am not a native user of English, I am in doubt... Google gives 18&#160;100 for "seventysix" and 1&#160;860&#160;000 for both "seventy six" and "seventy-six" (without distinguishing between them). Wiki gives "seventy-six" in <a href="../../../7/6/_/76_%28number%29.html" title="76 (number)">76_(number)</a>, so I corrected it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexei_Kouprianov_0861.html" title="User:Alexei Kouprianov">Alexei Kouprianov</a> 09:04, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, after changing this, I started wondering about that too. I have always written it together and not gotten into trouble, but from Google I, too, get the impression "seventy-six" is quite popular. Certainly I have no strong feelings about it. I will keep this in mind to determine usage more closely. Thank you for attention to detail! <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 10:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Brya, thank you for cleaning up my messy entry on J. C. Buxbaum. I added some more info to it after that. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexei_Kouprianov_0861.html" title="User:Alexei Kouprianov">Alexei Kouprianov</a> 04:46, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. I have two points worth considering:
<ul>
<li>You write "the Russian Ambassador to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinopolis.html" title="Constantinopolis">Constantinopolis</a>. " It looks to me that the function of the ambassador was the "Russian ambassador to Turkey". At that time Constantinopolis was not an independent state. Did he reside in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinopolis.html" title="Constantinopolis">Constantinopolis</a>? Was this the seat of the Turkish court? Possible ways to express this are "he joined the Russian Ambassador to Turkey in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinopolis.html" title="Constantinopolis">Constantinopolis</a>. ", "he joined the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, at the court in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinopolis.html" title="Constantinopolis">Constantinopolis</a>.", "he visited <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinopolis.html" title="Constantinopolis">Constantinopolis</a>, to assist the Russian Ambassador to Turkey. ", etc.</li>
<li>a second point is author citation in botanical names. You should either include this in all the names you cite or in none. So if you cite <i>Carex buxbaumii</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahlenb..html" title="Wahlenb.">Wahlenb.</a> including the author you should also cite the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moss.html" title="Moss">moss</a> genus <i><a href="../../../b/u/x/Buxbaumia.html" title="Buxbaumia">Buxbaumia</a></i> <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Hedwig_55cb.html" title="Johann Hedwig">Hedw.</a> including the author. Or you could cite both without the author: <i>Carex buxbaumii</i> and the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moss.html" title="Moss">moss</a> genus <i><a href="../../../b/u/x/Buxbaumia.html" title="Buxbaumia">Buxbaumia</a></i>. In general I would prefer not to include the author, as this will only hinder easy readability. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 08:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, hat was a temporary mission. It was called <i>posolstvo</i> (посольство) which can be literally translated as <i>Embassy</i>. Which means that the Ambassador Alexander <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumyantsev.html" title="Rumyantsev">Rumyantsev</a> went to Constantinopolis and returned to St. Petersburg without settling in Turkey. I was a bit puzzled how to describe this ancient diplomatic practice in a couple of words. A "Diplomatic mission"? A "temporary diplomatic mission"? Resulting in:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a physician, he was called to accompany Alexander <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumyantsev.html" title="Rumyantsev">Rumyantsev</a> in the Russian diplomatic mission to Turkey.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think, we can skip the author citations for now. However in a longer paper about <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Magnol_08a7.html" title="Pierre Magnol">Pierre Magnol</a> the history of the plant name Magnolia is given in full detail. Probably this tiny moss with its barely visible gametophyte (I saw it at botanical excursions near St Petersburg) is less important than a magificent flowering tree populating parks all over the world, but? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexei_Kouprianov_0861.html" title="User:Alexei Kouprianov">Alexei Kouprianov</a> 10:10, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you, I tried to include this in the entry on Buxbaum. As to citations of authors in botanical names, the point I am trying to make is not that no history should be given: it may be quite relevant who gave the name. I am just aiming for consistency. There really is no right or wrong way. That is
<ol>
<li>"<i>Carex buxbaumii</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahlenb..html" title="Wahlenb.">Wahlenb.</a>" including the author and the "<a href="../../../m/o/s/Moss.html" title="Moss">moss</a> genus <i><a href="../../../b/u/x/Buxbaumia.html" title="Buxbaumia">Buxbaumia</a></i> <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Hedwig_55cb.html" title="Johann Hedwig">Hedw.</a>" including the author.</li>
<li>"<i>Carex buxbaumii</i>" not including the author and the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moss.html" title="Moss">moss</a> genus "<i><a href="../../../b/u/x/Buxbaumia.html" title="Buxbaumia">Buxbaumia</a></i>" not including the author</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>are both correct. I just want to be consistent within the entry. Different entries might adopt different policies.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The entry on Pierre Magnol tells about the authors involved in the name <i>Magnolia</i>, but does not cite this name including the author (which would be "'<i>Magnolia</i> L."). BTW, the history given in Pierre Magnol is slightly inaccurate. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 14:50, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "version at the Norton Brown Herbarium, Maryland" is based on an unverifiable secondary source: a professor's unpublished, unreferenced, undated, and apparently out-of-date lecture notes. Reveal's version differs from the one published most recently by Thorne (2000), which is the one which should be used as it presumably reflects his current taxonomic opinions. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:16, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>More or less true, which is why I emphasized the source. It is the best I can do at the moment. Of course, it is verifiable as the system has been published (in several versions). Perhaps I will at some time get round to a more firmly grounded statement. Besides that, there is the question of the different versions, and how to evaluate and present these.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, you may take my statement as an objection--and one I have raised many times, with regard to many Wikipedia articles--to the all-too-frequent, uncritical, and often unreferenced or unattributed use of copy-and-paste lists from the web, which may or may not be reliable or accurate. If any system is to be used, it should state explicitly which <i>published</i> version is being referenced. When a scientist has published modifications of his or her own ideas, I believe it is a disservice to him or her to use old information (unless it is being used specifically to compare to more recent info).</dd>

<dd>My dear Berton, As far as I can judge you are quite correct in that <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> on line is using Cronquist.

<p>I see you have felt the need to extensively delete and/or rewrite what I added to the article. Fair enough, but did you have to add the insulting comment "replacing factually incorrect and misleading" when you have essentially just re-stated what I had written (I am mystified as to what you considered "factually incorrect"), while adding your own extremely misleading comment that there is "only one kind of cultivar"? <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 12:54, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I did not restate what you had written. What I put in (again) is what is in the <i>ICNCP</i>, while what you had written is derived from what realm I dare not guess. Also, strictly speaking, clearly there is only one kind of cultivar. Or, there are as many kinds of cultivars as there are cultivars. If you are going to differentiate in kinds of cultivars you are introducing "original research", if not complete myths. The cultivar world is a strange place, but the one thing it is not is unstructured. There is no need to invent anything <i>ad hoc</i>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 13:03, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I derived it from (although for the most part paraphrasing) was the 1995 edition of the ICNCP, which as you have pointed out is superseded by the 2004 edition. Here I am at a clear disadvantage as you have that edition and I do not, so I will have to take your word for it that you are right and I am wrong. However, I did compare what I wrote with what you replaced it with, and am at a loss to find anything "factually incorrect" or even "misleading" in my text.</dd>
<dd>Regarding "kinds" of cultivars, the 1995 edition says, in Art. 2.6, "cultivars differ in their mode of origin and reproduction and may be one of those defined according to Art. 2.7-2.17", with those articles then going on to describe clones (of various kinds), graft-chimaeras, seed-derived assemblages, lines, F1 hybrids, etc. In other words, the ICNCP clearly describes several different originations, or classes, or groups, or kinds (choose your word) of cultivars. Has that changed in the 2004 edition?</dd>
<dd>Please give me a little credit, Brya, you should know by now that I am not an idiot. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do assume you are not an idiot, but this only means I cannot understand your actions here. The 1995 Art 2.6 has become the 2004 Art 2.4:
<dl>
<dd>"Cultivars differ in their mode of origin and reproduction, for example as described in Art 2.5-2.16. Whatever the means of propagation ..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This new wording makes it a little more clear what is also in the 1995 edition, viz. that it is not possible (nor desirable) to delimit the nature of cultivars. The 1995 edition says "... MAY be one of those ..." (Caps mine, also in the subsequent quotes) and in the Arts 2.7-2.17 in each case says "... MAY be given a cultivar name ...". In the current edition this has become "... MAY form a cultivar." What the <i>ICNCP</i> is bending over backwards to do here is list a number of possibilities of cultivated plants that could become cultivars, while making it clear that this is not a delimiting list.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nor do I think that the article on "cultivar" should be based on a single reading of the <i>ICNCP</i>. It is quite a complex world (not really a botanical topic at all), affecting and being affected by horticulture, agriculture and forestry (and who knows what else). In addition it is squeezed in between the <i>ICBN</i> on the one hand and the commercial names (with legal repercussions) on the other hand. The article needs to be as clear as possible, certainly in the beginning. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 14:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Brya! Thanks for taking a look at the D. anglica article. I have reverted most of your edits, as they took away important factual information. You comment about <i>D. anglica</i> v. <i>D. x anglica</i> on my talk page, while well meant, only displays your lack of knowledge in this field. <i>D. x anglica</i> is the sterile natural hybrid between <i>D. linearis</i> and <i>D. rotundifolia</i>, whereas <i>D. anglica</i> is a fertile SPECIES which <i>originated</i> from <i>D. x anglica</i>. I hope that makes sense. Comments and questions are of course welcome. --<a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahElhardt_3ca9.html" title="User:NoahElhardt">NoahElhardt</a> 17:24, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your response. I would like to point out that on the whole it is a good thing to check facts before reacting. If someone points out that you have written down something completely silly it is natural to go into the defensive and 'retaliate'. However, although this is natural this is not a good reaction. First check the facts then act.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, it does not matter what you may assume, because <i>Drosera anglica</i> and <i>Drosera ×anglica</i> are the same. This is by definition. They cannot be separate plants. Under the <i><a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBN_59d1.html" title="ICBN">ICBN</a></i> they are one and the same name (e.g. Art 50.1). There is merely a limited difference in status.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should also point out that <i>D. x anglica</i> is a way of writing that is to be deplored: the professional way to write this is <i>D.</i> ×<i>anglica</i>.</dd>

<dd>At some point in the past, a <i>Drosera</i> ×<i>anglica</i> reproduced to form a tetraploid offspring, which stabilized and formed a population of plants. Although this is still continually happening today (as I mentioned in the article), the original occurrence must have been ancient, since this population now exists in places as isolated as Hawaii and far away as Japan (remember, one of the parents, <i>D. linearis</i>, exists only in the Great Lakes area.) Since this tetraploid population is "a polyploid believed to be of ancient hybrid origin", it is therefore treated as a species. It can no longer be called <i>Drosera</i> ×<i>anglica</i>.</dd>

<dd>From what I read in the rules of nomenclature, I couldn't see any specific hindrances to giving two taxa the same name, one with the "×" and one without it. (If there are, please point them out to me). Regardless, I am not making these names up, as they are accepted and published names. (See <a href="http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/samples/Science284Dxanglica.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/samples/Science284Dxanglica.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>) What should I do? Ignore these publications, assuming that the taxonomists that wrote them made a mistake (which is possible)? For the sake of correctness (if indeed it would be incorrect to have them share the name), should I replace <i>D.</i> ×<i>anglica</i> with <i>D. linearis</i> × <i>D. rotundifolia</i>?

<dd>Clearly I never said, or even suggested that the error originated with you: the error is in the publication you cite. I cannot tell what would be the exact correct way to deal with this. What is clear is that the name <i>Drosera anglica</i> Huds. is very well accepted for the species. If they are indeed two different plants then your suggestion to "replace <i>D.</i> ×<i>anglica</i> with <i>D. linearis</i> × <i>D. rotundifolia</i>?" looks as if it may be a good solution. However, taxonomy is notoriously tricky, and in the absence of real information it is dangerous to reverse engineer an erroneous publication.

It is not very helpful to have such small categories: a category is handiest if it has between, say, 25 and 150 entries. Even if all species in <i>Gunnera</i> get their own entry these will comfortably fit in <a href="../../../g/u/n/Category%7EGunnerales_5e53.html" title="Category:Gunnerales">category:Gunnerales</a>, and this remains true if all species in <i>Gunnerales</i> get their own entry.

I do not know whether this is of any interest for you, but, as for me, the nomenclature is just another facet of any taxonomist, so why not to suppose that you are interested in the phylogenetics as well?

<dd>Okay, I don't claim to be a taxonomist of any sort, but I must have missed something major if much of classification has suddenly become original research. Isn't this kind of thing set in stone (more or less) already? Plant families aren't just swimming in a sea, with every Tom Dick and Harry allowed to place them in whatever Order they want to according to their own "original research". Last I checked, every order had a specific well known class it was placed in, and each class a phylum, and so forth. When I make a page, I don't make this info up on the spot, or do some kind of "original research" to deduce this information. Its widely available. (<i><a href="../../../d/r/o/Drosera_anglica.html" title="Drosera anglica">Drosera anglica</a></i> taxonomic tree can be found <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=DRAN" class="external text" title="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=DRAN" rel="nofollow">here</a> for example).

<dd>You describe it pretty well, except that such placements are not mandatory (an order does not have to be in a class). What is important is to use a particular tree, from one particular point of view. There are many different <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_systems_of_plant_taxonomy.html" title="List of systems of plant taxonomy">systems of plant classification</a>. Probably the two foremost systems in use are the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronquist_system.html" title="Cronquist system">Cronquist system</a>, of 1981, and the <a href="../../../a/p/g/APG_II_system_50c9.html" title="APG II system">APG II system</a>, of 2003. The tree you refer to, <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=DRAN" class="external text" title="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=DRAN" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a tree according to Cronquist, also used by ITIS. You can recognize Cronquist by its use of classes (<i>Magnoliopsida</i>) and subclasses (<i>Dilleniidae</i>). On the other hand the APG II system designates only families and orders. For the higher level systematics it uses <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clade.html" title="Clade">clades</a> (<a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudicots.html" title="Eudicots">eudicots</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosids.html" title="Rosids">rosids</a>, etc): this saves a lot of arguing about assigning ranks and choosing formal names. Also this improves clarity as the clade names are unambiguous.</dd>
<dd>Basically you could use either system and be fine. The French Wikipedia is using both, side by side, which is also fine. In the English Wikipedia most of the taxoboxes have sawed both systems in half: the bottom half, the families and orders are according to APG II while the top half, classes and divisions are according to Cronquist. It (mostly) leaves off the layer of subclasses, presumably because then it would not fit at all. In all cases the result is an original taxonomy. In some cases it is not all that bad, in others it results in a true travesty. For example the family <i><a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepenthaceae.html" title="Nepenthaceae">Nepenthaceae</a></i> exists in both systems. Cronquist assigns the family to the order <i><a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepenthales.html" title="Nepenthales">Nepenthales</a></i>, while APG II places it in order <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Caryophyllales.html" title="Caryophyllales">Caryophyllales</a></i>. Cronquist then places the order <i><a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepenthales.html" title="Nepenthales">Nepenthales</a></i> in subclass <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilleniidae.html" title="Dilleniidae">Dilleniidae</a></i> in class <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnoliopsida.html" title="Magnoliopsida">Magnoliopsida</a></i>. APG II places the order <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Caryophyllales.html" title="Caryophyllales">Caryophyllales</a></i> in the clade <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_eudicots.html" title="Core eudicots">core eudicots</a> in the <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudicots.html" title="Eudicots">eudicots</a>. A typical wikipedia taxobox will use APG II for family and order (family <i><a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepenthaceae.html" title="Nepenthaceae">Nepenthaceae</a></i> in order <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Caryophyllales.html" title="Caryophyllales">Caryophyllales</a></i>) and then places that in Cronquist's class <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnoliopsida.html" title="Magnoliopsida">Magnoliopsida</a></i>. Such a taxon as Cronquist's class <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnoliopsida.html" title="Magnoliopsida">Magnoliopsida</a></i> not only does not exist in APG II, but it cannot exist (actually it is close to blasphemy).</dd>
<dd>So mostly I am leaving taxoboxes alone, but when I am writing a page, extensively rewriting a page or feeling tired (and am editing the page anyway), I am correcting to one system, and at this moment it is APG II, which Wikipedia at least claims to be following.

<dd>Unfortunately, Class is still part of the ICBN (Article 3), and cannot be ignored.

<dd>Clearly Class is part of the <i>ICBN</i>. As I understand it there is no requirement that it MUST be used (IIRC a Note is going to be appended to Art 3.1 to that effect). See also Art 2 ("indefinite": there is no required minimum number of ranks). If a taxobox were to require a Class then it can only use a classification such as that by Cronquist, Takhtajan, Dahlgren, Thorne, etc. Designing a new taxonomic system merely to fit the Wikipedia taxoboxes is original research. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 10:41, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your view of "original research" and the sanctity of published classifications is charming. Wikipedia is rife with juxtapositions of information that may never before have been juxtaposed – that is the nature of an encyclopedia. And APG II doesn't include species or genera (beyond the ones they use to anchor, circumscribe, and typify families); should they, too, be left out of taxoboxes?--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 14:38, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, such juxtapositions should be dealt with very carefully. As to placing genera and species in families, yes, this too needs care. However, the problem is not the taxoboxes. If a genus or species is recognized (of course, this is a big IF already), then its placement will on the whole be unproblematic. The problem lies in the reverse: when describing a family what are the genera that belong to it? This indeed is not answered by APG II (the list of synonyms gives some indirect information). Personally I tend to be very careful when dealing with this question of intrafamiliar classification: it is very easy to give the wrong impression. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 09:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, the general public deals only with family, genus and species. Still, as APG II 'tops out' the formal classification at order, that might be better. Also, it looks to me that the APG orders are more stable than the families. Topping out at order would still put most of the emphasis on family. But I agree, higher classification mostly clutters up the taxobox, without adding real information. If it is clear that a plant is a <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flowering_plant.html" title="Flowering plant">flowering plant</a> aka <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angiosperm.html" title="Angiosperm">angiosperm</a> then that will be enough for most practical purposes. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 09:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and in back of the system there are even some genera not assigned as to family. Any representation of the system tends to look untidy.

<dd>Thank you. Yes, I suppose that would have been better. It was just that I am not interested in categorizing carnivorous plant articles as such. I am working my way through the order <i>Caryophyllales</i>, and this was blocked up completely because of the <i>Nepenthes</i>-items. These were categorized in <i>Nepenthaceae</i> a subcategory of both <i>Caryophyllales</i> and of <i>Carnivorous plants</i> and in both these main categories. This is against common sense and against the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">guidelines on categorization</a>. The result was a hopeless mess. I tried to gently nudge <a href="../../../m/g/i/User%7EMgiganteus1_8ce8.html" title="User:Mgiganteus1">User:Mgiganteus1</a> into cleaning up his act, but he did not get it. I did not feel like getting into a big hassle and tried to do the sensible thing.</dd>
<dd>Categorization depends on the number and nature of the things to be categorized. This means that on the whole there is no fixed "right categorization" but that it needs to be adjusted as items are added. At the moment the Category <i>Caryophyllales</i> contains lots of non-related items, and the exceptions belong to the family <i>Cactaceae</i> (in category Cacti, which looks to be allright) and a few genera only (<i>Amaranthus</i>, <i>Drosera</i>, <i>Nepenthes</i>) so at this moment it seems clearest to move these items into subcategories dedicated to each genus&#160;: this has several advantages. As items are added it will be wise to look at it again and to add new subcategories. As I see it, at this moment this looks best. However I have not finished yet; a category should not contain that much over 150 items and <i>Caryophyllales</i> will be near the upper limit even after <i>Nepenthes</i> is properly filed away. The same goes for Carnivorous plants, although as I said I have no real interest in those and would gladly leave that to you, as long as it does not interfere with <i>Caryophyllales</i>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 08:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I made categories for genus pages. With good reason. See above. It depends if (1) you want to make sensible categoies for the items that are in the category, following the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">guideline</a> that wikipedia sets for this. This is what I did. Or (2) you could look at a topic and look at the categories you are going to want (even if in only the long run) and make those categories even if there are only one or two items in each category. The latter of course may contribute to interchangeability with other wikipedias.<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 07:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the consensus over time (at least in the <a href="../../../t/o/l/TOL_6a85.html" title="TOL">TOL</a> crowd) has been to avoid genus cats... the only ones I've seen are the ones you've created. In taxonomy, it's really the heirarchical structure that's most appropriate, wouldn't you agree? <a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny">SB Johnny</a> 10:35, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it looks to me the "TOL crowd" is a rather loose gathering of people, often with a rather limited level of knowledge. As to taxonomy, it is pretty well understood in taxonomy that what matters are good taxa. In some groups you have good families, with genera ephemeral. In other groups there are good genera, with families ephemeral. Rank often is relative to the moment and to the purpose to be served.</dd>
<dd>I don't really oppose family cats in <i>Caryophyllales</i>, at least not if it means that from now on you are going to keep the category in order. When I came accross it it was an impassible swamp and it is odd to see people taking an interest only after it has been put in order. Still, I do feel that in this case cats of genera were and are more appropriate. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 06:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Brya, you are not being stalked, but you are being watched (by me), because you seem to be editing out of a sense of mischief. Please respond to this mediation before continuing to make these edits, which do seem to be violations of the accepted MOS vis a vis <a href="../../../t/o/l/WP%7ETOL_6e15.html" title="WP:TOL">WP:TOL</a>, which in turn is the project where you should bring these issues up to reach consensus. Please consider the following:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The broad consensus -- judging both by the MOS at TOL and by the vast majority of articles already written -- is that the names in ranks above family are not italicised. By changing them to italics you are:
<ol>
<li>Creating inconsistencies in style between one group of articles (i.e., "articles Brya works on"), and other groups (i.e., "the articles everyone else works on")</li>
<li>Causing unnecessary <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikistress" class="extiw" title="m:Wikistress">wikistress</a> to other editors who are, like you, trying to build a comprehensive encyclopedia.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>By dismissing both this mediation as well as the members of TOL (see topic above), you give me and others little alternative but to think you are not interested in collaborating. WP is not "your own encyclopedia", except in the sense that it is also mine, MPF's, and everyone else's.</li>
<li>By engaging in this edit war (which is exactly what it is), you are not adding anything to the project. For example, the back-forth-back again on the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botanical_name.html" title="Botanical name">Botanical name</a> article has not done anything to clarify the article... in fact, it needs a cleanup tag as it stands (I know what a botanical name is, but I am unsure how useful that article is in describing what it is or how it works).</li>
<li>By continuing to revert even after Circeus was kind enough to mediate, you are making it difficult for those interested to discuss this with you.</li>
</ol>
<p>So again, please refrain from this for a few days while the discussion continues. <a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny">SB Johnny</a> 10:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>In June 2005, the Arbitration Committee ruled that, when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic. Revert warring over optional styles is unacceptable; if the article uses <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colour.html" title="Colour">colour</a> rather than <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">color</a>, it would be wrong to switch simply to change styles, although editors should ensure that articles are internally consistent. If in doubt, defer to the style used by the first major contributor. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Jguk_d4af.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see that this is all that hard to read, or ambivalent. If a style is suggested by the wordlwide accepted rule book (i.e. in the real world) governing the matter and it is followed by 10-30% of the publications (in the real world) then it is an acceptable style. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 08:03, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Brya, in case you haven't remarked, disregarding the MoS in such a way is blatantly disregarding the principle of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">Consensus</a> that is central to wikipedia.

<dd>I am scrupulously putting content first, making sure readability comes first. I will admit to being an exception here. There are all too many people on Wikipedia who care nothing for content but only about how things look and how they conform to some pet rule they believe in. The other day I came across a page where someone had did a copy and paste from a website to make a page consisting entirely of copyrighted text. This page went through like some twenty edits, by about as many editors, of people formatting it, categorizing it, adding tags. None of these editors had even bothered to read it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, Wikipedia favors a style of headings that is very bold. This means that if you have a short text only, it will get overwhelmed by inserting these heavy headings into this. It not only looks terrible, but hinders readablity. Putting content first, it thus is necessary to judge (from page to page) where the recommended standard will be counterproductive.</dd>

<p><b>Response:</b> The guideline you used above (sentence now italicized/boldfaced) is pretty much the point when it comes to the italics-in-higher-taxa battle you're fighting here. As I said above, your insistence on doing things your way is <i>"Creating inconsistencies in style between one group of articles (i.e., "articles Brya works on"), and other groups (i.e., "the articles everyone else works on")"</i>.</p>
<p>It's quite clear that you know more about certain subjects than do most editors here (myself included). We read what you add (I personally have learned a lot from your contribs), and simply want to help out by making the articles conform to the style of other articles within the same subject or related subject. This includes (possibly minor) issues such as appropriate font styles, lists of genera within families, standard usage (regarding headers, taxoboxes, etc.,), inclusiveness of alternate uses of terminology among various fields (see my edits to <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautonym.html" title="Tautonym">tautonym</a>), proper (wiki) referencing (including the use of ISBNs), and so on.</p>
<p>You are clearly an intelligent, well-researched, and valuable editor and contributor. Other users (like me) who might know a bit less are ready and willing to dot i's and cross t's so that you can feel free to add substantive content. We're all trying to build a great encyclopedia... if you feel the styles/templates/footnoting needs to be changed, you need simply bring the topics up for debate on the appropriate fora and make your point. If you're not sure where to bring things up, consider me "at your service" and leave me a message on <a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny">my talk</a>.</p>
<p>I am confounded by this whole thing. Are you in some sort of academic turf battle in "real life"? If that's what's going on, you won't have much success making WP a battleground, because (to be frank) you're now being watched very carefully here, as are the articles you work on. You speak of consensus, yet you seem to have no interest in swaying it (instead, you simply dismiss your fellows). Your latest reply on <a href="../../../c/i/r/User_talk%7ECirceus_2b29.html" title="User talk:Circeus">User_Talk:Circeus</a> was pretty much a non-sequitor, and makes me feel that you are grasping at straws.</p>
<p>To sum this all up: I have great respect and admiration for your knowledge and scholarship. I have no respect for you whatsoever when it comes to your sense of the importance of collaboration. WP is not a good vehicle for "pushing the envelope"... it's just an encyclopedia, and reflects the current understanding of the things in our world. Some (or even all) of your views may in time be adopted by the community at large, but they aren't right now, and the best way to sway opinion is to bring it up on project pages where policy is decided. <a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny">SB Johnny</a> 17:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have all but given up on being a regular contributor to Wikipedia, largely because it has become evident I was fighting a losing battle against those who were not necessarily more knowledgeable, or better editors, but apparently have limitless time on their hands to edit thousands of articles. However, I have been following this "discussion" with some amusement and feel compelled to come out of retirement to comment.</p>
<p>Brya has (apparently unilaterally) decided to follow a typographical practice for botanical nomenclature used in printing the ICBN that does not even rise to the level of "example" (as defined within the Code): the italicization of all botanical names at all ranks. As others have discovered, this leads to stylistic inconsistency between botanical and zoological Wikipedia articles, and between those botanical articles which Brya has or has not edited. In the end this is about as inconsequential a disagreement as I have ever seen on Wikipedia, but as Brya clearly has no intention of accommodating, cooperating or compromising with, or conceding to, any other editor, and has displayed such breathtaking arrogance in all his (her?) past and present editing, I hereby award him (her?) my "Does Not Play Well With Others" award.</p>
<p>Now to the matter at hand: the ICBN (Saint Louis Code, published 2000), in its preface, states, "As in the previous edition, scientific names under the jurisdiction of the Code, irrespective of rank, are consistently printed in italic type. The Code sets no binding standard in this respect, as typography is a matter of editorial style and tradition not of nomenclature. Nevertheless, editors and authors, in the interest of international uniformity, may wish to consider adhering to the practice exemplified by the Code, which has been well received in general and is being followed in an increasing number of botanical and mycological journals."</p>
<p>I became curious as to how "well received" this practice has been and to what extent it has been followed, so I did a quick survey of the most prominent botanical, mycological, and phycological journals in my library. I was hard pressed to find any that italicize botanical names above genus. Of 30 journals I checked, only 3--exactly 10%--have followed the example set by the ICBN. (The actual percentage is probably lower, but I did not check every minor journal.) The journals I found using italicization are Edinburgh Journal of Botany, Mycotaxon, and Kew Bulletin. In my judgment, it would appear that the non-binding practice of the ICBN is little more than a quaint typographical convention that has not been widely adopted. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 17:30, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ha MrDarwin, it is good to see you take an interest again. However it is somewhat curious to see you come out in support of those against whom you were "fighting a losing battle [namely] those who were not necessarily more knowledgeable, or better editors, but apparently have limitless time on their hands to edit thousands of articles."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Pity. I suppose you are right and that Wikipedia is doomed if it continues on this path. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 06:03, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>PS. You missed quite a few journals. I am sticking to a lower estimate of 10%, although quantification is impossible, unless one draws up an elaborate set of criteria of how to measure this. The important point is that the range of journals to do this is quite wide. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 06:03, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brya, my interest is mostly that of a motorist slowing down to rubberneck at an accident scene. I have had my own share of disagreements and disputes with MPF, but have generally found him willing to accommodate me or accept my edits when I was willing to explain my reasoning. And yes, sometimes I had to compromise. You, on the other hand, seem unable to ever concede that another editor might, just might, have even a slim ghost of a point and seem unwilling to even consider compromising or reaching consensus on any issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will say this much in your defense: Wikipedia policy seems to give you, as the creator of an article, both broad leeway in the style of that article and deference in its later editing, and I assume it is on this that you are basing your revert decisions. Fair enough. Wikipedia also in many cases, with regard to style and other issues, basically says "here are the rules, but feel free not to follow them". (Not to mention, "be bold!") As long as such policies are in place, and as long as there are editors who place style above content in their editing, there will be problems. But your approach to editing Wikipedia articles does strike me as a bit odd when you are such a stickler for the rules of zoological and botanical nomenclature (to the point of refusing to concede that a zoologist just might use the term "tautonym" even though only the word "tautonymy" appears in the zoological code!).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the italicization issue itself: it's interesting that you say I "missed quite a few" when you have no idea what I sampled. I suppose I should be happy that you didn't tell me I'm wrong, for no better reason than that you say it is so. Of course there are more than 30 botanical journals in the world and if you can point me to any others that follow this policy, please do. But if I could find only 3 of the top 30 in the world following this practice after the ICBN instituted it in (I believe) 1994, I think it's fair to say that it has not been widely accepted. For that reason alone I think you are fighting a losing battle on this issue, all the more so when the other editors of biological articles have reached a virtually unanimous consensus not to follow such a policy. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:36, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Addendum (in case anybody still cares): having limited my first sample to what I judged to be the better known and/or influential botanical journals, I went back to the library and checked some of the more minor or obscure ones. To avoid any kind of bias I simply checked the current issue of the first 10 journals, as arranged alphabetically on the shelves, that I had had not previously checked. Not one of them italicized family names, so that brings the total number down to 3 out of 40, or 7.5%. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 19:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Strictly speaking that is not so. Due to the nature of Wikipedia I am limiting my contribution~s to a minimum length, and with careful thought to how words can be misinterpreted. My standard is that if you put in the five top experts in the world in a room with one of my contributions they should not be able to find fault with anything that is there (they will no doubt be unhappy with lots of things that they feel are missing, but likely won't agree among themselves on what should be added). So after giving very careful thought on phrasing I am indeed dubious about changes. Especially in such cases as type (botany) when out and out errors are introduced when I went to great lengths to do everything I could to combat those errors in the first place. On the whole I feel my contributions are close to optimum, at least for that particular length of the page. Of course it would be possible to deal in much greater length and more detail with such matter, using a lot more examples, etc. But that is another case. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 13:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But you do apparently object quite strongly to my (accurately) saying that most botanical publications do not italicize botanical names above the rank of genus, or my (accurate) description of this practice having been adopted by a small minority of botanical publications. (And I would strongly question whether fewer than 10% of publications italicizing such names counts as "many".) More on typification later, if I have time. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Numbers and amounts are tricky. I suppose I will agree that italicization in all ranks has been adopted by a minority of botanical publications (so far). It is hard to be precise on degrees of minority. It distinctly is more than a "significant minority". Probably a "substantial minority" is fairly accurate. I am not at all sure what a "small minority" is, but is sounds like an underrepresentation. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 14:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Regarding type (botany), upon looking at the article and its past versions I see that Brya did keep some of the things I added and left out many of things I considered best removed--so overall it looks like Brya did not revert or edit this article as drastically as I had thought. But I do still strenuously object to Brya's wording on, and characterization of, italicization in botanical publications. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have tried to be strictly NPoV in my "wording on, and characterization of, italicization", making only basic and true observations. A NPoV characterization tends to be controversial (remember <i>Malvaceae</i>). My statements all look quite true:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>In print botanical names are often italicized. -- One might debate "often", but it should be safe.</li>
<li>The example set by the <i>ICBN</i> is to italicize all botanical names. -- This is not in doubt</li>
<li>In practice a great number of styles are in use concerning typesetting of botanical names. -- I quickly gave up trying to count how many. There is a finite number of such styles, and it won't run to dozens, but more than I care to count.</li>
<li>Many publications do not italicize names above the rank of genus, or above the rank of subfamily. -- The word "many" is conservative, but it may well be accurate, depending on what publications one is counting.</li>
<li>In this there are national differences, with italicization above the rank of genus least popular in the US. -- A new addition; might need further tuning.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, your statements were not as accurate
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Botanical names at the rank of genus and below are printed in italics when it is possible to do so -- Very many publications don't use any kind of special typesetting for any botanical name, and quite likely these form a majority of publications. Possibly even a preponderant majority.</li>
<li>(underlined in some older references, especially those produced on a typewriter). -- This has happened, but actually is so rare I do not really see it rates a mention. Nevertheless I kept it (I remain dubious).</li>
<li>The example set by the <i>ICBN</i> is to italicize all botanical names at all ranks (e.g., family) -- The example "(e.g., family)" is a little odd, and limiting. Linguistically I am not happy with the repeat of "all" here ("all botanical names" firmly includes names at all ranks).</li>
<li>but only a small minority of botanical publications have adopted this convention, generally reserving italics for names at the rank of genus and below. -- There are many things wrong with this, such as that it disregards non-botanical publications to adopt this style. A "small minority" is not a particularly clear indication of the amount, and is rather a PoV characterization.</li>

<dd>Sorry, In the first sentence you quote he offers an apology. If someone offers an apology, I count that in his or her favour, and I dont hold it against him. He did make a remark (for which he apologized on the place you referenced) for which I reproached him too, on his talk page.. His remark was less strongly worded than yours, so I removed yours, and left his remark. You can call that selective if you wish, but its always hard to make an accurate judgement.</dd>

<dd>I got to thinking about Brya's claim of libel, so I checked <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> (which Brya has never edited, at least under that name). Assuming that the claim would be adjudicated in either a Commonwealth country or the US, in both cases it is necessary that the individual be identifiable. As far as I can tell, there is no demonstrative evidence that "Brya" is even a single individual (multiple users could be posting through that account), and certainly no evidence to connect "Brya" to an individual with legal standing to make a claim of libel (although Brya could of course disclose information that would settle both of these issues). Therefore, IMO (and <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>), "Brya" cannot be libeled.</dd>

<p>I've seen some of your pages, but those few "External link" references down at the bottom of the page are hardly enough. I meant like this: <i><a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheris.html" title="Atheris">Atheris</a></i>.<br />
Actually, I didn't really start writing for Wikipedia until late March of this year, and for the first three months I didn't really use any references either. Then, in late June, I read an article about Jimmy Wales somewhere, who was saying that he receives an average of ten emails a day from students complaining that they quoted Wikipedia, and the information turned out to be wrong! That made me feel bad, but what can we do about that?<br />
There can be only one solution: cite your references always; for every sentence if necessary. Only then can we hope to regain the trust of the skeptical reader. Then, if someone doesn't agree with a certain statement, they can follow the reference (view the web page, download the PDF, or even buy the book) and check its veracity for themselves. Without it, that's not nearly as easy, and all the reader can do is trust the honesty of the writer (who the hell is <a href="../../../j/w/i/User%7EJwinius_b7e0.html" title="User:Jwinius">User:Jwinius</a> anyway?!), or research the subject themselves (in which case you might as well not use Wikipedia).<br />
Currently, I don't really have any problems with anybody, but there's not much I'll put into an article these days without adding a reference tag. My three main reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To gain the reader's trust.</li>
<li>So I can always find out later where the information came from, in case I begin to doubt what I wrote.</li>
<li>To prevent people who think they know better from arguing with me. (If they do, and I quoted accurately, I can't loose).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you always stick to the facts, only quoting published articles and on-line works (perhaps including your own) and always cite your references, people like MrDarwin won't be able to argue with you; they're not your words anymore. They become the words of the ICBN or an opinion voiced in some author in a publication. If MrDarwin doesn't agree, he can try to check up on your reference, but if you were accurate -- too bad. All he can do then is add another reference with an opposing point of view, which is excellent! That's the way it should be. Finally, the only things left to argue about is stuff like the structure of the article and whether certain parts belong in a separate article or not. If you think you can write like I'm suggesting, I think you'll get along with MrDarwin just fine. --<a href="../../../j/w/i/User%7EJwinius_b7e0.html" title="User:Jwinius">Jwinius</a> 20:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. This may sound like good advice, but unfortunately does not take into account the situation as it exist in those parts of wikipedia that deal with plants. There are some good pages on plants that do conform to the guidelines you suggested, but they are the exception. There is a very bad atmosphere in the plant section. It is full of errors at the level of species and genus and these errors are actively defended. I have seen references that were quoted being used for the opposite point of view (that is, the original text being changed while leaving in the references that thereafter support a new opoint of view). I have seen an editor, when questioned, produce a reference for his edit, and when I went to look up that reference found it to contain the opposite of what it purportedly contained. I could go on: for the long term I am hoping that some qualified editors are attracted, but I am not getting my hopes up. Such botanists of good repute that signed up under their own name have precious few edits to their name. I suppose I don't blame them.</dd>
<dd>I am limiting myself to edits that are directly supported by web-available content, as anything else is just too vulnerable. And as you see I get into trouble even so, when people refuse to follow the link or refuse to admit their own limitations in understanding the contents there and base their edits on their pre-existing ignorance.</dd>
<dd>You will also have noted that in the articles in contention I am the only one adding real content and correcting existing errors, while MrDarwin (and others) are just trying to insert their points of view and general beliefs. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 17:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
