<p>The original Bryman Schools were founded in 1960 by Mrs. Esther Bryman as the Los Angeles Colleges of Medical and Dental Assistants. The Bryman Schools were acquired by National Education Corporation in 1975. In 1983, the school names were changed to National Education Center Bryman Campus. Corinthian Schools, Inc. acquired the schools in July 1995. The school names were changed to Bryman College in June 1996. Corinthian Schools acquired the San Bernardino campus in 1982, the San Jose Campus in 1996, and the City of Industry, Ontario and West Los Angeles campuses in 2000.</p>
<p>Although the original Bryman school was opened in 1960, several of the campuses that have been acquired have founding dates that are much older, with one campus dating its founding to 1907.</p>
