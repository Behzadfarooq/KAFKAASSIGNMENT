<dd>That in itself is also a bad idea, since I'm sure it's going to result in a lot of bad attention from other editors who react even more strongly to the idea than I do. Besides, I don't think I can really trust you at this point; you've inserted blatant disinformation into an article once already that I know of, and the same disinformation is presented on that page as an example. Besides, what's the merit of a hoax project to insert hoaxes? Remember that our goal here is to write an encyclopedia, not build an online community. Everything ultimately must serve that goal. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're probably right. I'm sure someone could come up with a really good justification for the idea, but I can't see it at the moment.

<dd>To ping Wikipedia, how about selecting a number of random articles and independantly verifying the information contained within to see if there are flaws? That's straightforward statistical sampling, and it has the added benefit that it will allow any errors so detected to be corrected. I recommend deleting the disinformation page entirely, it's only going to draw heat. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:34, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brian, I've spent the last couple of weeks going through all the geo-stubs and putting them in their correct subcategories (such as Africa-go-stub, UK-geo-stub, etc).

<dd>Oh, one or two minor things just came to mind which I think you'll find noncontroversial. I should put the (film) subcategories under <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilms_aa86.html" title="Category:Films">Category:Films</a> and the actor subcategories under <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActors_5e27.html" title="Category:Actors">Category:Actors</a> (that aren't already included via Category:Academy Award winning actors). Also, I just noticed that Category:Best Director Oscar was put on the Lord of the Rings movie article when the award actually went to Peter Jackson for his work on that film. The movie itself would fall under something like Category:Films directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners, under the renaming scheme I proposed on CfD. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:14, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, please see my rational on the CFD page.
<ul>
<li>Regarding film categories: I'm not sure where they should go. Putting films under <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilms_aa86.html" title="Category:Films">Category:Films</a> makes sense and likewise for actors</li>
<li>Regarding Best Director: I don't think that was my addition. I had created the category but didn't populate it. Someone who saw my best picture category addition must've added all the oscar categories for it.</li>

</dl>
<p>My biggest problem with your renaming is the massively lengthed categories now. I'm not entirely sure how long, but I spent hours just thinking of ways to name categories to make them succinct but understandable. For a film that won 11 awards or even a couple, those category names will fill up several lines in the category box already, but now several more because of the extended length. My optimal choice would be to put everything back and strike up a discussion on a talk page instead of involving WP:CFD on the issue.&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 22:27, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As with most of the big categorization projects I wind up involved in, I didn't intend to do this much work at first; I was just browsing through <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedcategories_dcd5.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedcategories">Special:Uncategorizedcategories</a> and when I first started trying to link these together into subcategories I found the names to be highly non-intuitive. So I started working up ways to label them more clearly, and that CfD was the result of my thoughts. I've added some discussion of why I thought those names needed changing to the CfD discussion now, with a link to the naming conventions I think apply here. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:34, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cricket subcategories category</span></h2>
<p>Bryan</p>
<p>Philip and I are the two main categorisers of cricket-related articles. As you saw, we were both in favour of retaining the cricket subcategories category as a tool to help us - and there are good reasons for keeping it rather than a list. Categorisation takes a lot of time as it is, maintaining a list of subcategories would merely add to it (after all, it takes one second to add "Category:Cricket subcategories" at the bottom of a newly created cricket subcategory, given WP's current performance, it could take up to a minute to add it to a long list.</p>
<p>I think your proposal to convert this category to a list would not only be a waste of your time, it would also hinder our work to categorise cricket and lead to a waste of Philip's and my time. When the software changes so that we can "look through" categories, we will no longer need this subcategory - until then, I ask you to appreciate that this is just one of thousands of categories, and to realise it is doing more good than harm. Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 07:42, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless I remain committed to doing just that. See <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a> - you may be one of the primary users of this category, but I have just as much right to fiddle with it as you do. You're a fan of cricket, so you do a lot of work on cricket articles; I'm a fan of good, clean category structure, so I do work on tidying up cases like this. I don't think it's worth the trade of a few seconds' convenience to have this inappropriate category remain in Wikipedia. How often do you create new cricket subcategories, anyway? There are roughly 250 of them in that category right now, so it would have taken a grand total of 4 hours to add those all to a list if you did them one at a time and it took a minute for each one. How long have you spent arguing with me to keep that category?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please, tell me what sort of work it is that you think will take years to complete on these categories, I'm not trying to be obstructionist and I really do think that a list will be more helpful for whatever it is that you're trying to do. I can even help out with doing it, I'm good at categorizing stuff and can probably contribute way more than four hours' worth of work if it needs doing. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:30, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bryan, you have offered your opinion and now been told by at least 3 members of the Cricket WikiProject that we do not like your idea of having a list of subcategories rather than a category of subcategories. It is members of the Cricket WikiProject who are most likely to be categorisers of cricket articles. I ask you to just accept the position as it is. I thank you for your idea, but ultimately, what tools are used by those who categorise cricket-related articles should be determined by those who categorise cricket-related articles, rather than your good self.</p>
<p>I would also add that your persistency is beginning to have a negative effect - certainly I for one am reluctant to continue much categorisation work as I am not sure whether you are going to hinder or destroy that work going forward. I'm sure that is not your intention, but I would like to point out that as far as I am aware this discussion is now counter-productive to the categorisation of cricket-related articles. After all, we are only talking about one category amongst thousands - if you do not like it, it is easy enough to overlook it, Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 17:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have never suggested that I would "destroy" any categorization work you've done, indeed I've offered at several points to <i>help</i> with it. I categorize a lot of heck of a lot of articles. I've had people think I run some sort of categorizing bot through this account (I don't, it's all manual). But so far none of you have actually told me what sort of work you're trying to do here, you've given me no reason to believe that this "cricket subcategories" category is of any use and you've certainly given me no reason to believe you consider it only a temporary thing. I don't think I'm the one who's being counterproductive here. Would you please at least answer my question? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:15, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm probably going to regret asking, but what do you find it useful for? This sort of redundancy is explicitly frowned upon in the categorization conventions on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>. Specifically:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An article should not be in both a category and its subcategory, e.g. Microsoft Office is in Category:Microsoft software, so should not also be in Category:Software.</li>
<li>A good general rule is that articles should be placed in the most specific categories they reasonably fit in. For example, Queen Elizabeth should not be listed directly under People, but Queens of England might be a good place for her.</li>
<li>Articles should be placed in the most specific categories possible. Categories should be more or equally as broad as the articles they contain; articles should be more or equally specific as the categories they are in.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are exceptions to these, of course; I made one myself on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Lord_246c.html" title="Thomas Lord">Thomas Lord</a>, for example, because he's not <i>just</i> a Middlesex cricketer but there wasn't an Epsom cricketers category to put him into. Eventually I presume there will be one, at which point I'd put him into Epsom cricketers and take him out of English cricketers. Did I miss other cricketers who didn't have appropriate English cricketer subcategories to add when I removed them from the main English cricketers category? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:02, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may be useful, in a spirit of co-operation to explain the categorisation of cricketers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. The year of birth and (if applicable) death are categorised;</dd>
<dd>2. The nationality and the fact that a person is a cricketer is categorised (eg "English cricketers). Sometimes a player has had a number of different nationalities - for instance, <a href="../../../k/e/p/Kepler_Wessels_bb40.html" title="Kepler Wessels">Kepler Wessels</a> is a South African who became Australian and then South African again.</dd>
<dd>3. Players are categorised by skill and by nationality (eg "English batsmen", "English bowlers", "English all-rounders", "English wicket-keepers"). A player may be in more than one of these categories - and if he is an all-rounder he will be a batsman and a bowler too. Personally I do not like these categories and am not convinced people find them too useful as I do not understand why anyone would specifically wish to search by nationality and skill, but I have to date respected the fact they are there and used them. As far as I am concerned, this is the only redundancy in the current classification system.</dd>
<dd>4. Players are categorised by major domestic teams that they have played for. This is where cricket-knowledge comes in most useful - as it can be difficult to spot what a major team is if you're unfamiliar with the history of cricket in a particular cricketing nation. For instance, I know that there should never be a category "Epsom cricketers", as Epsom is not and has never been a major team. The most difficult situations are pre-19th century cricketers (like Thomas Lord), cricketers in Pakistan (where many of the major teams are tied to different companies), and more recently South Africa and Sri Lanka, where there has been a recent consolidation of the major sides. Note that there is no redundancy with 2 - many cricketers have played domestic cricket in a number of countries - for instance, the English cricketer <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Botham_39d4.html" title="Ian Botham">Ian Botham</a> infamously played one season for the Australian side Queensland, and so is, amongst other things, categorised as a "Queensland cricketer".</dd>
<dd>5. If a player has played international cricket, then this is also noted. There are two sorts of international cricket - Test cricket (with categories such as "English test cricketers") and One-Day International cricket (with categories such as "English ODI cricketers".</dd>
<dd>6. If a player has captained a national side this is also noted (eg "English cricket captains").</dd>
<dd>7. Certain other honours - such as whether a cricketer has been knighted, or received a Wisden Cricketer of the Year award are noted.</dd>
<dd>8. Many cricketers have gone on to become commentators, broadcasters or writers - this may also be noted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The categorisation is pretty comprehensive. And, except for the categorisation by skills, I think all the categorisations have intrinsic interest, particularly for cricket aficionados. Source information can be found on www.cricinfo.com and www.cricketarchive.com.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that there are many cricketers on List of cricketers who need categorising. Your assistance would be welcome - as each category expands it becomes more and more interesting, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:38, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, you're probably going to argue with me more on this, but as far as I can see from the thorough explanation you've given (thanks for that, BTW) it looks like removing those articles from category:English cricketers was the right thing to do after all. This is because those articles were already in various more-specific subcategories of English cricketers, such as for example Category:English bowlers. Every article that's in Category:English bowlers is also considered to be in Category:English cricketers, since it's a subcategory; the nationality information is automatically included that way. You were okay with me removing them from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECricketers_4858.html" title="Category:Cricketers">Category:Cricketers</a> which I did for exactly the same reason; consider the analogy there and I hope you'll understand where I'm coming from on this. I'm not going to lunge straight for those articles to re-remove them again, before you panic, but I'll probably get around to it eventually - I'm pretty sure my understanding of category conventions is correct in this case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A suggestion for the non-major-team cricketers. How about creating Category:Minor team cricketers for them, or some other more appropriate name? That way it'll be easy to tell which cricketers are from minor teams without categories of their own and which are just not yet fully categorized.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">interference pattern</span></h2>
<p>Hi Brian,<br />
back in 2001 you wrote in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interference_pattern.html" title="Interference pattern">interference pattern</a> article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Light beams that can produce interference patterns are called "coherent," and have all of their photons' phases aligned with each other. <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">Lasers</a> are an example of a coherent light source. Light beams which cannot produce interference patterns are called "incoherent." Most ordinary incandescent light sources (including the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>) are incoherent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lasers are the only source of coherent light, and lasers have been available since the 1960's. Double slit experiments were conducted in the 19th century. The famous Michelson-Morley interferometry experiment, failing to detect motion of Earth with respect to local space, was performed around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Coherent or incoherent doesn't matter; incoherent light can produce an interference patterns just as sharp as coherent light can. The advantage of laserlight is that it is monochromatic. Possibly early experimentors used sodium lamps to get a lightsource as monochromatic as possible. Or they spread the light of an incandescent lamp into a spectrum with the help of a diffraction grating, en then used a smal spectral band of the light. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleon_Teunissen_354f.html" title="User:Cleon Teunissen">Cleon Teunissen</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/e/User_talk%7ECleon_Teunissen_4622.html" title="User talk:Cleon Teunissen">Talk</a> 09:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Court cases by year</span></h2>
<p>I've thought about creating a "Law by year" structure of categories (<a href="../../../1/9/8/Category%7E1986_in_law.html" title="Category:1986 in law">Category:1986 in law</a> and so on); I think ultimately this would be the best way to organize court cases by their year of decision and statutes by their year of enactment. What do you think? Do you have any objections to doing it that way rather than placing the law articles directly in the year categories? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 02:46, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect there might well be enough court cases to justify that; I started categorizing the articles in one of the smaller case law subcategories and only later stumbled upon <a href="../../../u/2E/s/Category%7EU.S._Supreme_Court_cases_8eac.html" title="Category:U.S. Supreme Court cases">Category:U.S. Supreme Court cases</a>. (I've only done up to the "B"s so far :) My philosophy with categorization has generally been to dump everything into root categories and then later look at what's in there to see whether the creation of subcategories are warranted, but I've no objections to doing it other ways if someone wants to set up a category scheme ahead of time. I'll lay off further categorization for the time being. Put in as many "year in law" categories as you think are warranted, bearing in mind that the density of articles per year will probably be lower farther back in time, and I'll get back to work on them then. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:56, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't think I could do much for such an article. Perhaps instead of creating an arachnoid article, the other two should be merged in to meninges instead?

<dd>There were a couple of subcategories under sailing that were solely yachting-oriented, specifically Category:Yachts, Category:Yachting races, Category:Yachting associations (incorrectly capitalized as Category:Yachting Associations at the time) and Category:Yacht clubs. Since "Yachting" seemed to be the most reasonable name for a category to encompass all of those and it already existed anyway, I picked that one to serve as their root and moved them all under it. Since Category:Yachting is under Category:Sailing those other more-specific categories are still categorized under Category:Sailing too, just one level removed now. The guidelines at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Creating_subcategories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#Creating subcategories</a> say "A good general rule is that articles should be placed in the most specific categories they reasonably fit in", and by putting yachting-related subcategories under the "Yachting" category I believe I'm following that principle. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:47, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a related note that might prove useful for your project, I've recently been considering creating an entirely new version of the isotope and periodic table charts using Wikipedia's EasyTimeline plug-in.
