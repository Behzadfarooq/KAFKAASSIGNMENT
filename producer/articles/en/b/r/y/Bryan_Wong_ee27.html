<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Wong_ee27.html" title="Edit section: Before competition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Before competition</span></h2>
<p>Bryan was an air steward before he joined <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Idol_e463.html" title="Star Idol">Star Idol</a></i>, the acting competition held at the end of 2005 and finishing in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. He had attended Temasek Info Tech School, earning a diploma in Information Technology. Bryan had wanted to become an actor at the age of eight and was often described as fun-loving, diligent and analytical.</p>
<p><a name="Star_Idol" id="Star_Idol"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Wong_ee27.html" title="Edit section: Star Idol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Star Idol</span></h2>
<p>Bryan entered the Top 8 with other contestants like <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kang_Cheng_Xi_c084.html" title="Kang Cheng Xi">Kang Cheng Xi</a>, Leo Lam, Lincoln Khoo, and Jacqueline Sue, and had to star in the competition television series <i>Who Is It?</i>, where on each episode one contestant goes missing till there is one left (the contestant with the least amount of votes goes missing and the last one is the winner and Star Idol 2005/06).</p>
<p>After the first episode where the first female, Lilian, was booted out, Bryan was next. However, a revival round brought him back to the competition, surpassing eliminated Lilian, Leann and Lincoln. Bryan joined Jacqueline, Alicia Neo, Cheng Xi and Leo as they carried on the competition.</p>
<p>As Bryan stayed on in the competition, his acting skills became better, and on the finals against Leo Lam, Bryan succeeded in being the better actor and took the crown of the first Star Idol, garnering 61% of the overall votes. (He had not had many votes during the start and it was announced halfway through the finals, probably urging Bryan's fans to vote more.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Wong_ee27.html" title="Edit section: Star Idol finals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Star Idol finals</span></h3>
<p>During the finals, Bryan was the only contestant to strip to his underwear in front of national television during a fight against a hooligan. This was on Part 1. In a more detailed way, Part 1 shows Bryan playing as a man auditioning to become an actor. He is chosen to play a role where his wife is kidnapped by the leader of the underworld. Bryan points his gun at him, and the leader (played by <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Chen_620a.html" title="Adam Chen">Adam Chen</a>), sends for his henchmen to beat him up. They strip him nearly naked until Bryan stops them by fighting them, left with his underwear. Some said that the underwear was translucent, as such, some said that they saw his cock and <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testicles.html" title="Testicles">testicles</a> underneath that thin piece of undergarment. When the leader's henchmen are all out of energy, the leader takes off his shirt and battles Bryan. (This scene is said to be the most sexual one in the whole competition, due to the fact that two 'hunky and muscular guys' are wrestling.)</p>
<p>On Part 2, Bryan played a lover alongside <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felicia_Chin_78eb.html" title="Felicia Chin">Felicia Chin</a> who talks about their romance while singer Kelvin Tan performs.</p>
<p>On Part 3, Bryan has to compete against Leo in a dance, where many agreed that Bryan was more stiff that Leo (Leo was thinner but was less muscular).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Wong_ee27.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>There have been some criticism towards Bryan on how he uses his looks and body to appeal to the audience. This was felt unfair towards his rival contestant Leo Lam, who was not as muscular as Bryan. Leo had once mentioned that if he could garner more votes, he would go to the gym and get a six pack now, in which Bryan had. Another contestant, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kang_Cheng_Xi_c084.html" title="Kang Cheng Xi">Kang Cheng Xi</a>, was also given a stripping scene where he was required to wear cartoonish red boxers. The judges mentioned that Cheng Xi was not very muscular, and somewhere later, he was eliminated.</p>

<p>Many months after the competition, Bryan appeared in his first role - it was to many not considered as a supporting role, and a rather minor role at that. Nevertheless, his appearance in <i>An Enchanted Life</i>, a drama, surprised many.</p>
