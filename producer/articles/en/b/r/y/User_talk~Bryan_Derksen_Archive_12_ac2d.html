<p>Bryan, I saw your comment on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7ETherianthropy_649d.html" title="Talk:Therianthropy">Talk:Therianthropy</a> that you intend to unlock the page tomorrow. I'd be grateful if you wouldn't do that, partly as you're involved in editing the page, but also because I'm currently trying to work out how best to approach the clash between DreamGuy and Gabrielsimon, and the page protection is part of the process of trying to cool things between them. I don't intend to keep it protected for long, particularly if others want to edit it, and I'll leave a note on the talk page to that effect. Both DG and GS seem to be problem users (for different reasons), and DG is one of the rudest editors I've encountered. Any light you can shed on how to approach the issue would be much appreciated, as it's led to serial reverting, 3RR violations, blocks, complaints, and page locks, but the origins of it are hard to trace now. Feel feel to e-mail me if you'd prefer. I heard there was an article about you by the way, which I'm about to track down, so congratulations on that.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:08, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Incidentally, considering that <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> here has repeatedly shown severe bias in her actions against me, and has for several days before the latest incidents came up, I already requested that she remove herself from taking any actions involving me. If I was rude to her it's because she is not at all even trying to treat situations fairly. If she says *you* are involved in editing the page and should step out, she clearly should have removed herself days ago. If she wants to open conversation with me on any topics she best send someone else completely or apologize for her behavior, as I already explained to her several times. In the meantime I have nothing to say to her. Other admins have been completely fair, and the more she insists upon inserting herself into it the more she demonstrates exactly why she shouldnot be involved in these matters. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:26, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DG, you can request all you like that I remove myself, but I'm not going to.

<dd>Sorry to take over your user page, Bryan (but then again she threatened to block me for posting on hers)... SV, the most constructive thing there is here is for you to let it go... Think about this here: why are you so incredibly headstrong about it being YOU who deals with me? There are many, many other admins here. My point is that you seem to be biased and overly emotional in your responses to me, and the fact that you won't let anyone else take over can only be seen as proof of this. I've explained the problem to you, I've made suggestions on how to get past the conflict, but you are unwilling to do so. Why is that? Put yourself into my shoes here, what else am I supposed to think? You need to back yourself out of these conflicts as you are clearly too emotionally involved, or calm down and apologize for your rude overreactions that escalated the problems instead of helping. You can't possibly claim to try to be even handed and ignore that your presence makes things far worse instead of better. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:45, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, ideally <i>everyone</i> involved in this dispute would just "let it go". I realize that's not likely, though, I've been in arguments like this before and I know how it's like.&#160;:) In the case of Therianthropy, IMO if the problem is just GabrielSimon and DreamGuy reverting each other then the solution should be to apply the 3RR. Protection would only be necessary if the fight was sufficiently widespread and complicated that 3RR wouldn't be useful and that doesn't seem to be the case here. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 14:46, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If other editors on the page request unprotection, then I'm happy to do that. So far as I can see, there was no 3RR violation, though it looked as though there was going to be, which is why I opted for protection, rather than later having to block people. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:47, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's better for those who are going to violate 3RR to go ahead and violate it so they can be blocked and others can get some work done on the article (not to mention to prevent them from further vandalizing other articles) than to lock a page and let the abusers have a victory in disrupting it. Instead you prevented that to avoid disciplining someone whose side you took in other conflicts. That's not a good plan. Once again, other than sockpuppets and the extremely abusive editor Gabrielsimon, everyone on that page is on complete agreement on what to do. See the additional comments there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, does reverting the evidence section of your own RfC count towards 3RR? How about reverting other people's talk pages to versions they don't want. If so, he should be blocked for that. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 22:32, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bryan, I don't think it's a good idea for admins to unprotect pages that they have been involved in editing, nor to enforce 3RR on those pages, particularly when another admin has already protected the page. You really should work this out with the first admin, or take this to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> for an outside opinion. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:34, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I jumped in and made one edit a couple of days ago before I saw what a mess the dispute was I and don't plan to make any others while it's going on. Since no proper protection request was made in the first place, and since I am of the school of thought that protecting a page is worse than banning a combative user, I figured being bold would be good here. Do you want me to re-protect it, or just lay off on the 3RR enforcement promise? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:41, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I noticed on the article Talk: page that SlimVirgin did solicit requests for it to be unprotected from the people involved in the dispute. No-one appears to have requested that it be unprotected yet. Some people might interpet your unprotection as a vote of non-confidence in SlimVirgin's admin decisions. The article is currently not in terrible shape, so I don't see a pressing need for major changes to it. I think it would be a good idea to re-protect it, and have the involved editors approach SlimVirgin, or make a request for unprotection at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a>, which is the normal procedure. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:06, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

The thing she is discussing in that context is specifically the things that were changed on therianthropy... especially since the relationship between these conditions at mental illnesses are more obvious with <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_lycanthropy.html" title="Clinical lycanthropy">clinical lycanthropy</a> being a professionally mentioned and sourced topic, whereas SlimVirgin's argument is that there is no sources of any sort to justify mentioning mental health problems on any of those articles. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:01, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see it. Looks like slightly less involvement than I had on the therianthropy article, so I might still be "in trouble", but still possibly significant. Sigh, so many subtle complications...

<p>A Talk: page comment on a different article in response to a request for comment is hardly being "involved in the article in the first place". I doubt SlimVirgin has even heard the words "Therianthropy" or "Otherkin" before; they're rather specialized areas of knowledge that few would have (or would want to have) any familiarity with. I know I don't. Please try to work with the admins involved, rather than making spurious accusations about them. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:06, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, what I am saying is, she was on the Otherkin talk page *actively arguing* for her position, telling Gabriel to remove things and that he wsa justified in doing so, and she CLEARLY heard of the terms because she was discussing those exact words and the implications of the topics and ridiculing other sides several days before she progressed to locking down the articles in question. This is not a "spurious" accusation, she was directly involved. It would help if you would read what I am writing or go check out the pages I mentioned to see exactly how involved she was before you condescendingly jump to the conclusion that there's nothing to it. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:22, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the comedy films category was overloaded, so was the film stubs category. Basically the comedy film stubs category was to merge overloaded categories for population control. Why would you want it to retain the comedy cat tag after being stubbed as a comedy film stub? I mean, comedy film stubs is tagged as a subcat of comedy films. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDude115_8134.html" title="User:SuperDude115">SuperDude</a> 22:51, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Stub categories have always been a bit of a difficult spot for me - they really shouldn't be on articles at all, in accordance with <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Wikipedia_namespace" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#Wikipedia namespace</a> they should be on the talk pages of articles. When I tried putting the stub templates on the talk pages instead, though, that caused some difficulties for stub-active editors who didn't like not being able to tell at a glance whether an article was properly stub-tagged or not. I can see their point on that issue, and so after that I just ignored stub tags - someday, hopefully, a better technical solution will come along. But I don't think I can ignore it if the stub categories start devouring the contents of regular categories wholesale.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, what I object to is breaking up the contents of a category based on details of the way the Wikipedia article itself is written, rather than based on some characteristic of the <i>subject</i> of the article. If the comedy films category is too big, then subdividing it based on more detailed genre divisions is the way to go. It's already been started with the comedy-drama subcategory, for example, and I note that <a href="../../../s/a/t/Category%7ESatirical_films_3d5f.html" title="Category:Satirical films">Category:Satirical films</a> only has four articles in it currently so can probably take in a heck of a lot of the stuff currently in comedy films. I'd be quite willing to help out with such a task, if you like - I've been looking for a nice big categorization project to get into again. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bryan. I am concerned that you are disrupting the VfD process to make a point by voting on an article without regard to its content. You seem to be upset that nominators are using the abbreviation "nn" to refer to "non-notable," and are voting <b>keep</b> on all such nominations because you disagree with this abbreviation. I suggest that a less contentious thing to do would be to read the article, vote on it as you see fit, and contact the nominator on his talk page or make a remark on the VfD in question.

<dd>True. However, I had no idea what "NN" meant, so as far as I could tell there was no actual justification given for proposing those articles for deletion. I saw the first one because I have <a href="../../../t/c/s/TCS_Victory_8ffe.html" title="TCS Victory">TCS Victory</a> watchlisted for reasons I've since forgotten, the others I saw because I checked User:ComCat's contribs. I don't "hang out" on VFD, so I don't know anything about the VFD process - if putting up a VfD with only the code "NN" as justification is acceptable practice over there then the process may well be even more messed up than I've surmised from the debates I've seen over it.

<p>This earlier discussion has been cited as an example as to why the category Category:Mountains by Elevation (km) (and sub cats) should be deleted.</p>
<p>Could you please take a look at the following CFD and vote. <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2005_September_1_1d6f.html#Category:Mountains_by_Elevation_.28km.29_and_its_subcategories" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 September 1">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 September 1#Category:Mountains by Elevation (km) and its subcategories</a></p>
<p>A complication could be that Category: British Hills by Height seems be to liked by the actual British Hills content contributors. <b>By contrast</b> the category Category:Mountains by_Elevation (km) is not liked by User:RedWolf who seems to be a major Mountain page contributor.</p>
<p>Special note: the <b>Ocean trenches by depth</b> categories were added after the all of the people had voted. But frankly these have no real contributors and would probably get deleted if another vote was taken. You should specifically mention these to ensure there is no confusion in future.</p>

<dd>Yes, but it isn't erroneous to say that clinical lycanthropy is named after lycanthropy.

At <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gabrielsimon_4cc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gabrielsimon">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gabrielsimon</a>, it specifies that "If problems evidencing immaturity emerge with the new username he may be banned for up to an additional month by any three Wikipedia administrators who, based on his edits and behavior, identify him and feel an additional month's ban may aid him him in gaining maturity".

<p>You're right in what you said to the anonymous user; adherents are inherently POV. I don't think, though, that including their statements about what their position is would automatically be POV. Especially not when the opposing claims are no better sourced than some anonymous non-otherkin users at kuro5hin.org and a wikipedia editor who sees a self-evident relation between a psychiatric condition and a belief.</p>
<p>How would you feel if the section on transformation enthusiasts in the article on shapeshifting were edited to include an unsourced suggestion that they too are related to clinical lycanthropy in some unspecified way? After all, couldn't the case be made that there is a "self-evident" relation between "people who want to be animals" and people who believe they are animals? (Yes, I realize not all people who have a thing for transformation want to be animals, but I can easily see it being taken that way and the statement on the page about having a thing for shapeshifting being distinct from therians, otherkin, and any other group that actually identifies with or wishes to become something else accused of being original research in the same manner that the distinction otherkin draw between themselves and those with clinical lycanthropy is being branded as original research.)

<dd>I wasn't arguing that the statements of adherents shouldn't be included at all, I was arguing that their statements shouldn't be taken as if they were the first and final truth on the matter. As for editing the transformation enthusiasts article, yes, as you propose above that would be not good. But that's not what was going on with Otherkin, it was simply a <i>see also</i> link. "See also" links don't require references, they're just a bunch of articles covering similar topics. I certainly wouldn't object to a clinical lycanthropy "see also" in a transformation enthusiast article. Do you mean <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformation_fetish.html" title="Transformation fetish">Transformation fetish</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_transformation_fantasy.html" title="Animal transformation fantasy">Animal transformation fantasy</a>, by any chance?

<dd>With respect, it is not the "see also" link to clinical lycanthropy that is being debated on Otherkin. It is the section of the article on Otherkin that states "When mental health professionals have encountered individuals who believe that they can transform into an animal or are otherwise non-human in some way, they have sometimes diagnosed the condition as clinical lycanthropy[18] or some other mental disorder." The citation points not to a mental health professional claiming that clinical lycanthropy is related to otherkin, but to an article on clinical lycanthropy itself (and one that you have to pay to read more than the abstract of, to boot.) The description of clinical lycanthropy, as given, is also overly broad... it has been purposely broadened to sound more like otherkin beliefs than its actual definition. Nothing in the definition of clinical lycanthropy says "or are otherwise nonhuman in some way", that wording has been taken straight from the description of otherkin beliefs. The article on clinical lycanthropy defines it as a disorder where the afflicted persons have a delusional belief that they "are or have transformed into an animal", period.

<dd>Heh. There are a few articles here and there on Wikipedia where some sort of monomaniacal collective insanity seems to have ensnared many of the editors who get involved in them, the stuff going on at Otherkin is relatively tame compared to some.

I usually manage to avoid getting involved by taking a long-term view of things; Wikipedia is still going to be here in a year, or five years, or ten years, and eventually things will settle down enough to go fix whatever problems are remaining. There's no hurry.&#160;:) In the meantime you can always wander around tinkering with some of the other related articles, or just clicking random article until something catches your interest.

<p>I'd appreciate it if you could review and reconsider a couple of your AFD votes that were cast apparently in protest of the nomination. <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_School_tram_station_0f2f.html" title="High School tram station">High School tram station</a> is a tram stop, a structure of similar purpose and build to a bus shelter. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Alexander_%28US_Army_soldier%29_d521.html" title="George Alexander (US Army soldier)">George Alexander (US Army soldier)</a> is an article about a person of questionable notability, and notability is indeed a factor in determining whether an article about a person should be kept (per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7).

<dd>My bad on that one, I've withdrawn my vote there. As for the others, there's already an RfC against ComCat and the debate about this sort of stuff going on in AfD has been going on for many months without any resolution in sight so I feel a need to be a little more proactive when nominations this bad show up. I don't think it's inappropriate to vote against deletion solely on the basis of "no adequate reason given <i>to</i> delete" - the policy is to keep when in doubt, after all. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sir, I would like to make a comment on this, if I may. While I agree with you in principle: Poorly reasoned AfD nominations are a problem. Voting keep simply because the nomination was done poorly (and not because the subject is noteworthy) is disruptive and counter-productive (and as <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">User:A Man In Black</a> pointed out above, borders on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). By all means point out the fact, but you should not allow it to affect your vote.

<dl>
<dd>So long as unreasoned AfD nominations and votes are given weight, why shouldn't I put in a vote with weight in the opposite direction to counter them? Articles can be re-nominated for deletion at a later date, so if a poorly-justified AfD results in keep because I don't think it's adequately justified, but the article itself is worthy of deletion, it can later be re-nominated with a <i>proper</i> justification. Or the nominator/voters could provide reasoning for their votes and convince me to change mine as a result. A deleted article, on the other hand, is much harder to bring back.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really don't think I'm as close to POINT as people keep saying, despite my comment on the mailing list that I was expecting accusations along these lines. If anything, I think my votes will serve to help <i>reduce</i> the disruption of Wikipedia that these inadequate and seemingly-random AfDs might produce. And in any event, if you'll take a look at the ComCat AfDs I voted keep on you'll note that I later went back and checked the article's merits to provide justification of my own. Every single one of them stayed "Keep", which doesn't give me any reason to doubt my initial approach to these things. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 15:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's a subtle distinction but perhaps helps make my outlook more palatable; sort of a "not proven" rather than a "not guilty" verdict. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:26, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
