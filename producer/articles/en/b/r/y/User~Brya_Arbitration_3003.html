<p>Although the focus now is on me it should be clear that what is happening here is actually part of what effectively an ongoing war, which had been underway for quite a time at the moment I made my first edit. It never really went away although there were occasionally lulls. At the heart of this war against basic policies and guidelines of wikipedia are some highly idiosynchratic habits of <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">user:MPF</a>. Maybe it is only a single habit with various aspects, but it manifests in what has been called "pushing PoVs" and an huge urge to standardise things across all ToL articles. As good an example of his PoV-orientation is <i><a href="../../../c/e/p/Cephalotaxaceae.html" title="Cephalotaxaceae">Cephalotaxaceae</a></i>. Based on a few publications (see <i><a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxaceae.html" title="Taxaceae">Taxaceae</a></i>) he has decided to favor a particular taxonomy, which is presented as universally accepted in both the page on <i><a href="../../../c/e/p/Cephalotaxaceae.html" title="Cephalotaxaceae">Cephalotaxaceae</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxaceae.html" title="Taxaceae">Taxaceae</a></i>). However, the world at large assumes one genus in the family (see <a href="http://www.conifers.org/ce/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.conifers.org/ce/index.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>gymnosperm database</i></a>, <a href="http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=10174" class="external text" title="http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=10174" rel="nofollow">Flora of China</a> , <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?240" class="external text" title="http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?240" rel="nofollow">GRIN</a>), but what widely accepted in the real world does not even rate a mention by MPF.</p>
<p>Well beyond PoV is <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Callitropsis.html" title="Callitropsis">Callitropsis</a></i>, which is almost (but not quite a taxon) that exists in wikipedia only. There may be case to be made in favor of adopting this name (not that I see how) but the article does not make such a case. Instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Callitropsis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45064811" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Callitropsis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45064811" rel="nofollow">it states</a> that: "The name <i>Xanthocyparis</i> has now been proposed for conservation (Mill &amp; Farjon 2006), but until that is decided on at the 2011 International Botanical Congress, it is correctly classified as <i>Callitropsis</i>. " which is well beyond a possible interpretation of the process of conservation. See the NPoV-item wiped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xanthocyparis&amp;diff=78196406&amp;oldid=71853577" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xanthocyparis&amp;diff=78196406&amp;oldid=71853577" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xanthocyparis&amp;diff=80515213&amp;oldid=79364777" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xanthocyparis&amp;diff=80515213&amp;oldid=79364777" rel="nofollow">here</a> by MPF: For the position taken by the real world see: <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?447594" class="external text" title="http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?447594" rel="nofollow">GRIN</a> and <a href="http://www.conifers.org/cu/xa/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.conifers.org/cu/xa/index.htm" rel="nofollow">gymnosperm database</a></p>
<p>This pushing may not really be because of a PoV he believes in, but rather enforcing a uniformity that he feel should exist, as in inserting British spelling for everything that does not happen on the same side of the Atlantic Ocean as the US) as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Engler&amp;diff=36357766&amp;oldid=36345898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Engler&amp;diff=36357766&amp;oldid=36345898" rel="nofollow">here and subsequent edits</a>.</p>
<p>From my very first edit on Wikipedia I found that no page on wikipedia treating a plant genus or species can be edited without an automatic edit war ensuing, with the end result being a page worse than before the edit. I have long since given up touching any such page, but a recent event showed this is still in full force. The picture in Koehler of <i>Viscum album</i> was so good that I could not help creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=54047749&amp;oldid=46490638" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=54047749&amp;oldid=46490638" rel="nofollow">page</a> for this highly interesting and fun species. MPF pounced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=54047802" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=54047802" rel="nofollow">immediately</a> to #$% the #$% out of it. As this was even more brutal than usually (with MPF featuring a picture which had no other appeal than that he personally had cleverly identified the tree in the background) and even at first glance was both PoV and original research (that is, MPF publishing his own original internal taxonomy of the species, and the elevating it to the only one possible) I tried to effect at least some improvement. The page history shows that it took two months of unpleasantness for MPF to even move to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=64265559&amp;oldid=64243713" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viscum_album&amp;diff=64265559&amp;oldid=64243713" rel="nofollow">somewhat neutral position</a>. Also note that he did not hesitate to back his edits by providing a reference which, when I went to check, proved to contain nothing of what he claimed it contained.</p>
<p>In his editing he is also handicapped by (apparently) being a British English speaker only. He does not take into account the many ways a sentence can be misread, by people from different backgrounds. In many cases his "copyedits" are to sentences that (I assume) sound good in British English, without regard to how this may be read. In all to many cases his copyedits are oblivious to what the sentence means.</p>
<p>So in practice, all the plant pages at the level of species and genus are off-limits for any edits (any such page falling prey to this fate of a quick Google and a comparison to a popular handbook, with all the errors this entails), unless somebody moves firmly into ownership. However, botany in wikipedia is something like 90% empty. And anything that improves the ratio of real information to bogus information should be worthwhile, in view of the high exposure wikipedia gets.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a long while, I have restricted my contributions to a quite minimalistic style, not venturing beyond basic facts, and almost always backed by a link to an authoritatve source, available on the web.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have certainly had my own disagreements with MPF; he will have to defend his own edits but aside from British spellings like "colour" his English is not an issue. As a native speaker of American English I find MPF's text to be quite readable and understandable, even when I disagree with what he is saying. For Brya to criticize MPF's English leaves me literally speechless. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 16:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_Arbitration_3003.html" title="Edit section: Botanical nomenclature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Botanical nomenclature</span></h2>
<p>MrDarwin commented that my contributions on the topic of botanical nomenclature are made from a narrow point of view, restricted to what is formally laid down in the <i><a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBN_59d1.html" title="ICBN">ICBN</a></i>. This comment is as true as it is irrelevant. Not only are nomenclature and taxonomy two entirely different things, but there is a big difference between the body of rules in nomenclature, as a body, and how they are applied in taxonomic practice. No doubt it would be possible to write a page "History and usage of the type concept in botany as practiced in the Eastern United Stated" or a page "History and usage of the type concept in botany as practiced in the France". As I understand it, in zoology it is something of a cult to disregard at least some of the rules in the <i><a href="../../../i/c/z/ICZN_7fe7.html" title="ICZN">ICZN</a></i>. However, it is quite difficult to document such informal usage (just because it is informal), and to place it in its proper context. I have not seen anybody volunteer to write such pages. However it will be clear that if everybody is trying to force his local informal usage into the formal description chaos will ensue. These things should be kept separate.</p>
<p>As to being overly formal, well, there are between 3 to 8 different Codes of Nomenclature, partly independent, partly complementary, partly competing. Each with a different field of application (but a few that have the same field of application, depending on how you count). All these use concepts that are somewhat comparable to rather different, with different names, the same word having different meanings in different Codes. Without being clear on context and very precise about the concepts under discussion, a hopeless mess will ensue. Writing about this means knowing what words and phrases are to be avoided as being ambiguous.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose I should qualify that a bit: Brya has a very narrow interpretion <i>when it suits her.</i> Unfortunately there was much that she introduced in the <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_%28botany%29.html" title="Type (botany)">Type (botany)</a> article that goes beyond a narrow interpretation. My primary concern with this and other botanical nomenclature articles is that they were (and thanks to Brya larely remain) more or less incomprehensible to anybody who is not already familiar with the subject. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 16:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_Arbitration_3003.html" title="Edit section: Type (botany)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Type (botany)</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/y/p/Talk%7EType_%28botany%29_6c30.html" title="Talk:Type (botany)">Talk:type (botany)</a> does look ugly. Clearly the accusation that I would not allow any addition is not true, as I let in the inclusion of clonotype and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Type_%28botany%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49999083" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Type_%28botany%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49999083" rel="nofollow">paratype</a>. In the second case this was quite a dubious addition as a paratype is listed in the <i>ICBN</i> among the types and it does have an influence on the application of a name (as pointed out by MrDarwin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paratype&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=79905168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paratype&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=79905168" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Let me further point out that 1) I did initiate the Talk page, hoping to move the alternation from the project page, but in vein. 2) I also tried to get it into a discussion of the facts, rather than anything else, but with only a partial success. 3) I hinted to MrDarwin that he start a new page for the material he felt strongly about (also in vein). Of course I was handicapped because I did not understand (and still do not understand) what he wanted. I could only see that he tried to force material which touched only peripherally on the topic in to the project page, and that this would not have had a positive effect on said project page even if he had found a way to phrase it so that it reflected reality (which he clearly failed to do). The position he took did not leave any room for an upside, no matter what I tried. I am quite willing to assume he had (and has) something worthwhile to contribute on whatever he feels so strongly about, but it belongs on a page of its own. Maybe "Curatorial practice in major herbaria of type specimens of the higher plants", "Taxonomic practice regarding type selection in the late twentieth Century" or possibly "history of the type concept in the Eastern United States". I am unsure what title to suggest as it is a fairly large field and I cannot read what he really intended. What is clear is that with a lot less effort and aggravation he could have started a new page. For all I can see he was just deliberately picking a fight. Of course there is some history: for an early attempt at communication which failed miserably see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;oldid=36150929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;oldid=36150929" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=36341058&amp;oldid=36150929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=36341058&amp;oldid=36150929" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36341058" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36341058" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36363970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Asteridae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36363970" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36386716" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36386716" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36397648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36397648" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36409831" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36409831" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hamamelididae&amp;diff=36665758&amp;oldid=36648314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hamamelididae&amp;diff=36665758&amp;oldid=36648314" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36416991" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36416991" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36650075" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36650075" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36663419" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MrDarwin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=36663419" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42976900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42976900" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42977187" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42977187" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Plants&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43018404" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Plants&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43018404" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.</p>

<dd>I suppose I could have followed Brya's example and split every concept into such tiny pieces spread across dozens of articles that every article is little more than a dictionary definition, but Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia and not a dictionary, if I'm not mistaken. I have to admit to being dumbfounded by the fact that Brya did actually allow one of my words into "her" article (note that contrary to Brya's claim, the reference to "paratype" was later removed and does not appear in the current version.) But if I may quote Brya, "not understanding is not a virtue." Unfortunately Brya chose to "try to get into a discussion of the facts" by opening her talk page comments with:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this is not a good development, MrDarwin. It used to be so that you did your thinking before editting [sic!]. Also your edits used to take the facts into consideration.</dd>
<dd>I had supposed that after being exposed to MPF and the horrific proportion of error he makes I would be inured to even the worst errors. However you are really achieving a rate of error (in so few sentences!) that is appalling.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That may or may not be a personal attack against me (or MPF), but either way, if that's what Brya calls "initating a discussion" I'd hate to see what she calls "picking a fight". Oh wait, we <i>do</i> know what she calls picking a fight: when as a newbie I honestly raised some very valid concerns about the "adoption" of APG in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Talk%7EAsteridae_b252.html" title="Talk:Asteridae">Talk:Asteridae</a>. I thought we actually had a pretty good exchange there (although I was a bit frustrated that Brya never did provide the information I was asking for; this is a common pattern with Brya, telling people they will just have to take her word for something and not backing it up, even when asked). And the rest of those links Brya provides--those are "picking a fight"??? Good grief. I could provide better examples myself of my being cantankerous. But the bottom line is that Brya has claimed ownership of this and several other articles: nobody may edit them without her explicit permission and approval. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 16:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_Arbitration_3003.html" title="Edit section: Taxonomy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>I made quite a few pages of families, orders and clades. Any such page I made will be minimalistic and mostly restricted to establishing a NPoV framework, and in making links to authoritative sites (there actually is quite a lot of information on plants and their taxonomy on the web, much more than referenced by wikipedia). There are very good reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A NPoV means that any page of a higher taxon, by its very nature should (also) be a disambiguation page. Such a taxon is a box and it may contain any of a number of things. It is not possible to describe an order or family without first establishing what belongs in it. Cases are known where a taxonomist adds or subtracts a single extra species, with as a result that the description changes completely.</li>
<li>Writing descriptions for higher taxa is not as easy as it sounds. In practice some pages are the result of a quick Google of the more popular pages on the net, with some elements being lifted from each, and being melded into a composite of different concepts. A good description should be made with a monograph in hand, complemented by recent articles. Just dashing of quick descriptions is not very helpful, not when there are authoritative sites available, giving meticulous descriptons with authors and context being listed.</li>

<p>Note that I went to considerable trouble to establish a NPoV framework of reference for plant taxonomy, so as to be able to follow different placements of taxa (I should mention here that Berton pitched in enthousiastically). Pages such as <a href="../../../a/p/g/APG_system_4dd5.html" title="APG system">APG system</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/g/APG_II_system_50c9.html" title="APG II system">APG II system</a>, as wel as classics like <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentham_%26_Hooker_system_d60a.html" title="Bentham &amp; Hooker system">Bentham &amp; Hooker system</a> (note the carefully preserved original typography).</p>

<p>The charge of vandalism apparently is based on this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Loranthaceae&amp;diff=57670958&amp;oldid=40493889" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Loranthaceae&amp;diff=57670958&amp;oldid=40493889" rel="nofollow">deletion of a copy-and-paste list of genera</a>. Apparently there are thos who feel this is a heinous crime (perhaps that is what they do?). At the time I explained this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Circeus/june2006#Now_it.27s_user:SB_Johnny_and_user:Brya" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Circeus/june2006#Now_it.27s_user:SB_Johnny_and_user:Brya" rel="nofollow">here</a> where I stated&#160;:</p>

<dd>Interesting to come upon this. The latter point is of course well worth commenting on. If Mike Dallwitz and the organization at DELTA go to great lengths to kindly provide descriptions of families (available nowhere else on the internet), then the least we can do is to respect the style of referring to this that has been expressed at the site. I think it is very undignified to force Mike Dallwitz to run round and manually correct all these references. Speaking about contempt!</dd>

<dd>As to another point mentioned above. In spite of the sentiment expressed above ("it should be easy to create a server with reliable information on the latest taxonomy out of thin air") accurate taxonomic information is hard to come by. For a large plant family it requires a considerable staff working for decades to even get near. Accurate descriptions are even harder to come by. The trick is to make do with the information that is available, and to put that in the right context.</dd>

<dd>Providing a list of redlinked names of genera (and that is not readable because of faulty layout) that may or may not belong to the family discussed is not helping anybody. All that is communicated by such a list is "this page was put together by somebody who did not know what he was doing". Anybody who is interested in the list of genera as it was according to Mike Dallwitz in 1998 can follow the link and see for himself. At least then he will be aware of the proper context.

<dd>A few points to consider. Many, most, or likely all, family treatments are incomplete and they will remain so until Wikipedia attracts a staff of competent people who devote very considerable time to this. This is not a bad thing when there are sites that can be linked to. Priority should be to avoid giving misinformation.</dd>
<dd>AFAICT, lists of genera in family treatments are the exception rather than the rule and this is a good thing. At least if giving accurate information is the purpose.</dd>
<dd>A copy-and-paste of a paragraph of text from a copyrighted site is a violation of copyright (unless a number of conditions are met, and there is not even an attempt here to do so). Also violently against basic Wikipedia guidelines. Brya 05:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>which remains true enough. A listing of genera only is useful if the context is made clear (when, by who, with what taxon concept of the family). In this case not the least attempt was made here to do so. Also I should re-emphasize that I feel that courtesy in wikipedia should not be restricted to people within wikipedia but certainly should be extended to professionals outside Wikipedia whose work is being referenced. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 13:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I can tell, the charge of vandalism resulted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Sokal_It_to_.27Em_--_Brya_Is_Hoaxing_Us" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Sokal_It_to_.27Em_--_Brya_Is_Hoaxing_Us" rel="nofollow">this</a> discussion on the ToL talk page, where KP Botany rightly complained (if rather stridently, and with an ill-considered accusation of vandalism) about some of Brya's edits with regard to "APG III" and the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleodicots.html" title="Paleodicots">Paleodicots</a> article (and where, ironically, I and at least one other editor came to Brya's defense). <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 16:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
