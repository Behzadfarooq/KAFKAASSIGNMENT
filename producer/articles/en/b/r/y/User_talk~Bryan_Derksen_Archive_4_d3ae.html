<p>Hi Bryan, I saw some of your discussion with <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocu_0014.html" title="User:Docu">User:Docu</a> which has now been moved to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia_talk%7EHow_to_use_tables_1006.html" title="Wikipedia talk:How to use tables">Wikipedia talk:How to use tables</a>. As I am the principal author (to date) of the table examples, I can understand where you're coming from about the lack of closing tags. I prefer to always use closing tags, but according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" rel="nofollow">HTML 4.01 specification</a>, they are indeed optional (and always have been). In <a href="../../../x/h/t/XHTML_2462.html" title="XHTML">XHTML</a> and <a href="../../../x/m/l/XML_3501.html" title="XML">XML</a> they are a requirement. For Wikipedia articles, it may be better to leave off the optional closing tags to make editing easier, especially for newbies. As you probably know, it is often the case that a table is being used inappropriately in the first place. Converting those to lists or another appropriate structure may benefit both readability and editability.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any input or contributions you may have to the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_use_tables_519d.html" title="Wikipedia:How to use tables">Wikipedia:How to use tables</a> article. Also, you may want to check out the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_accessibility" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipedia_accessibility">m:Wikipedia accessibility</a> meta page I've started for discussing accessibility issues - it'd be great to have your feedback!

<dd>Hmph. Guess I should stop my mad quest to fix all the tables after all, then.&#160;:) I'll pop over and see what I can add to the discussion. I'm hoping that Wikipedia will move in the direction of XHTML someday, so that MathML support can be more easily added, but I suppose that will require some sort of built-in translation for table code either way. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:24 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree! It'd be nice to see Wikipedia move to XHTML (or even XML) someday, but it'd be a bit harder to stay valid with those, since they are stricter than the loose HTML DTD used now. As someone pointed out to me, we can pretty easily fix closing-tag issues with a conversion script, if/when that day comes. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 22:47 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>You wrote in <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesla.html" title="Tesla">tesla</a> that 10<sup>17</sup> T is the maximum possible field strength for any known phenomenon. Can you give me any clues about how this value was calculated, please?

<dl>
<dd>It was a factoid that I read in an article about <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetar.html" title="Magnetar">magnetars</a>, I think it was in a recent Scientific American. As I recall, that was the maximum field strength that a neutron star was calculated to be capable of holding, and that nothing more capable than neutron stars were known - so it's a practical limit, rather than a theoretical one. I'd have to go back and find that article again to say more, I'll search tonight when I get home. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>Thanks. Excuse me if I don't respond quickly next time, but I shall be away from Wikipedia for a few days. -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here's what the article says. "An upper limit to neutron-star magentism is about 10<sup>17</sup> gauss; beyond this limit, the fluid inside the star would tend to mix and the field would dissipate. No known objects in the universe can generate and maintain fields stronger than this level." The fluid-mixing thing is in reference to the convection currents inside a neutron star that generate a dynamo effect. This is from the February 2003 issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Right off the bat, my face is red; the article uses gauss throuhout instead of Tesla, so all the neutron-star-related values I put into the Tesla article are off by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>. I'll fix that immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Scientific American article has a couple of other interesting factoids about extreme magnetism. It mentions the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_electrodynamic_threshold.html" title="Quantum electrodynamic threshold">quantum electrodynamic threshold</a> of 4×10<sup>13</sup> gauss, above which X-ray photons freely split in two or merge together. Polarized light waves change wavelength when they enter very strong magnetic fields, and the scattering of photons by electrons or other charged particles is suppressed if the magnetic field prevents the charged particle from accelerating in the direction it needs to. Fields above 10<sup>9</sup> gauss squeeze electron orbitals into cigar shapes; in a 10<sup>14</sup> gauss field a hydrogen atom becomes 200 times narrower.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't know if you want to incorporate any of these, but if you want to here they are.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. I put a short note in <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesla.html" title="Tesla">tesla</a> about the upper limit. I'll wait on the other stuff until I'm feeling more ambitious&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't really a big deal, but regarding your edit to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harp.html" title="Harp">harp</a> just now - is there really anything wrong with using an apostrophe when pluralising single letters? Every style guide I've looked at (which admittedly isn't many) says that it's acceptable, or even desireable, to use an apostrophe in this case. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If there's a style guide that covers that specific situation, then that's probably the correct way to do it. I was operating only under the general guideline that apostrophized s is only used as an abbreviation of "is" and as a possessive. I see incorrect apostrophized s everywhere these days and it grates on me, so I get a bit trigger-happy. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the AP style guide says to use an apostrophe on plurals of single letters, but not on plurals of multiple letter abbreviations, and somebody's told me that Chicago says to use apostrophes on lower case single letters, but not upper case. The idea is to avoid ambiguity between multiple letter As and the word "as", for example. It's not a big deal, as I say. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>"beam-powered propulsion" is a very general term. It covers lightcraft, solar sails, magsails, and possibly other types of ship as well.

<p>Hello! Thanks for the brave move of moving Arpad (etc) into Árpád. Are you sure that it won't cause problems for the USA guys who cannot probably write <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diacritic.html" title="Diacritic">accents</a>?

<dl>
<dd>It's not a problem, fortunately, because thanks to redirects linking <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpad.html" title="Arpad">Arpad</a> still works just fine. Since this redirect is automatically created when a page is moved using the "move this page" function, one normally doesn't have to do anything to fix other page's references. The only exception that comes to mind is when there are already redirects pointing to the original location; since redirects only go one step (to prevent loops from forming) double redirects need to be updated. I've just checked (via the "what links here" function) and there are no double redirects for Arpad, so everything looks to be in order to me. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:49, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to coordinate w/ you re IFF article: you may have noticed that i created one despite the one you worked on, and someone collapsed "yours" into "mine". I have two concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>The more substantial history got disconnected from the article.</li>
<li>The unofficial title is the article and the official is the redirect.</li>
<li>The old article title is misleadingly described</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I think i know how to repair #1, and would like the practice; if you don't follow what i'm talking abt, let's discuss.</li>
<li>As to #2:
<ul>
<li>IMO, the WP MoS recommendation <i>should</i> be no punctuation in article titles except hyphen, paren, &amp; apostrophe; but include redirects to WP-std name where an outside standard or other common usage says otherwise</li>
<li>IMO, what it should be is irrelevant if cases like this have been anticipated in a previous consensus</li>
<li>IMO, #1 &amp; #2 need to be corrected at the same time, not piecemeal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>#3 is natural to fix as part of the above. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a> 07:50, 2003 Nov 18 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It looks like my only contribution to that article was to add a link and to remove a stray HTML tag that had no real effect on the article's display. I know nothing about how IFF works or anything like that, I probably just came across the article at random one day.

<p>Bryan, I just noticed your change to my Lincos edit. I don't claim to know anything about Lincos or SETI, but is the following interview totally bogus? <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview01" class="external free" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview01" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview01</a>. I will defer to you. In case you're wondering, the reason I originally made the change is because I read about it in Stephen Webb's book, "If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?" Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of it to look up the reference. Thanks, Mignon 10:03, 31 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Over on the interview you point to, Dutil says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"However, Lincos has it own drawbacks. Since it is based on pure logic it become rapidly difficult to communicate some complex processes. For this reason many researchers find it impractical. Therefore, we preferred an hybrid method with the addition of schema and graphics to guide the reader."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From what I've seen of both Lincos and the Dutil-Dumas message, the Dutil-Dumas message has only traces of Lincos concepts in it - mainly just the introduction to numbers and basic arithmatic at the beginning (and even there it's in base 10 rather than Lincos' base 2). It's very heavily graphics-oriented; they draw graphs, arrows, chemical structures, a map of Earth's surface, DNA helixes and cell membranes, even human figures ala the <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer_plaque.html" title="Pioneer plaque">Pioneer plaque</a>. This doesn't have much in common with Lincos' approach of defining a simple coded "language" and then describing more complex concepts using it, in my opinion. I haven't read Stephen Webb's book, nor have I read any other books on SETI itself; I just play around with these SETI messages because I find them to be interesting puzzles. But I'd be very surprised if my impression is wrong on this one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, if you liked the Dutil-Dumas message, I created my own variation on it a few years back that includes a lot more information. I'll dig it up and email it to you if you'd like to take a crack at decoding it; I've never had feedback on it from other people before.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 10:42, 31 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your right, but things should be discussed, not reverted. Reverting is an accusation of vandalism, or very close to it, since your not supposed to revert unless it <b>is</b> vandalism. And whats this "I'm tired of doing all the work" stuff? What work? Your reverting things. Thats the opposite of work, its undoing work. I'd love to discuss this in depth in talk, but one of the people there, <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">User:Lord Kenneth</a> is trolling me. Anyways, I am reasonable, and if you want to discuss why my sentance shouldn't be there, but the paragraph should, I will listen.

<p>I'm not sure if the "compromise" critics section in scientific skepticism is NPOV. It seems the only critics of scientific skepticism in general are those promoting quackery and pseudoscience. If one so-called skeptic is criticized often, then it should be on that particular skeptic's page, there is no reason to group all skeptics together. As well, skeptics may disbelieve a newly-discovered phenomenon, no one denies that: it's whether the evidence is present for them or not. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 19:55, Jan 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was only intended as a start, to try pushing things away from a cycle of total deletion/total reversion. There have been instances throughout the history of science where a new idea has been subjected to skepticism that could reasonably be called "excessive". However, such judgements can <i>only</i> be made in hindsight, so it's difficult or impossible to make such accusations in regard to theories that are currently in dispute. Surprisingly, I think Reddi's most recent additions have been pretty good. I'll just do a bit more editing right now and see if I can make sure the honor of skepticism isn't being trodden on too severely, and remove the CSICOP reference as you suggest. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:33, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The page is turning more "criticisms of skeptics" instead of about skeptics themselves! It's obviously Reddi's (and now JackLynch's) wargrounds for their philosophical views. For whatever reason, Reddi hates skeptics. He's an idiot. Hell, look how he writes on the damn talk page. I'm getting pretty pissed off at his idiocy. The links he insists on adding are filled with nothing but lie after lie. Hell, why is it necessary to add what that Bruno Bauer said when few people have probably heard of him?</p>
<p>Skepticism is a part of science, or else we would be doing nothing more than accepting any idea out of the blue. I think that's what people like JackLynch and Reddi can't accept, that their theology and unfounded beliefs aren't considered "mainstream".</p>
<p>There's a reason evolution is given more credence here than creationism, and that's because one side is scientifically credible. If we start giving each side the appearence of "equal factuality" we might as well not have educations and just make things up.</p>
<p>Scientific skepticism has no critics except from the pseudoscience-peddlers. Why do we need to give them "equal time"? This is ridiculous. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 06:05, Jan 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sheesh, calm down already. You're preaching to the choir here; I'm a dedicated skeptic myself. But at the same time I think you're letting your <i>own</i> biases run away with you a bit here; the chunks of text you removed from that criticism section were steadily working their way towards a reasonably balanced explanation of how skepticism works in real-world science. I'm going to revert your deletion, and I suggest that you don't give Jack the satisfaction of getting into an edit war with me on it. Instead, why not suggest a better header than "criticism"? It's not really criticism any more, IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:41, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm getting mad because it's the page has turned basically into a debate. Reddi's edits suggest he doesn't even know what skepticism is. In fact, I'm curious as to whether he's copying and pasting, because it's obvious on talk he doesn't know how to write.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd rather have them justify their changes first.

<dd>Well, our opinions seem to differ on just how "bad" Reddi is. His comments on talk: are as you say somewhat hard to follow, but I've been tinkering with the wording of the article to move it away from pure criticism and he seems to have been pretty good about accepting modifications or caveats to "his" statements there.

<dd>Your version simply <i>omits</i> all the stuff you disagree with, instead of trying to present information such as historical context or the difficulty of gaining solid evidence or simple human nature that might explain why things work the way they work.

I never denied that "valid theories are slow to gain acceptance", in fact, that's how they SHOULD BE... we can't know if a theory if valid or not until it's been properly tested and backed up by sufficient evidence. Such irrelevencies don't belong on scientific skepticism because it's like writing a long (by comparison) section on theories that aliens built the egyptian pyramids. I can't address every criticism JDR adds to the page, so I just stripped them off and referred to them in very general terms. Also, I removed the links because it's no different than adding a "jews caused 9/11!) page to the Sept. 11 section-- full of bias and lack of factual information. I don't know why you insist on JDR's biased-filled version, it's like you turned against me for no good reason, clearly not one based on reason. If you checked my version I mention criticisms but to not mention any particular ones because, like in my earlier example, there's too much to refute and doing so could almost be considered "POV". - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 00:48, Jan 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Back to atheism again</span></h2>
<p>I think we got onto a very bad foot due to the harshness of Kenneths ad hominems occuring simultaneously to my placing a mention of Amalek into the article. You apeared to have found that threatening. Let me be clear. I love encyclopedias, and that is why I am here. My agenda is for this to be the best encyclopedia ever (and to have a good time making it so!). My personal POV is likely profoundly disimilar from what you might expect. If you would like to know more about my religious beliefs, take a look at <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">Pantheism</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_pantheism.html" title="Classical pantheism">Classical pantheism</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panentheism.html" title="Panentheism">Panentheism</a>. The bible is not the basis for my beliefs, but rather one among many other signifigant historical tomes relating to matters of spirituality. The issue about g/G is simply a matter of respect. IMO you don't want to show respect to God, by refering to him by a proper noun. I find that highly POV, and unencyclopedic. The one God who is All is not a god. He is a synonym for existance. Its a whole other subject from an angry space jew who lives on a cloud. Once the problems with the atheism article are solved (I actually don't see many left, now that so many have become involved in the editing, particularly eloquence) I plan to spend some time editing "arguments for/against God". I think you will find pantheism particularly difficult to argue against. I was once an atheist myself you know. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 23:11, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a question of respect as far as I'm concerned, since I don't believe that God exists and therefore don't have much of an opinion one way or the other on his respectability. I simply think that God really <i>is</i> a god, under all the definitions of those two terms that I consider reasonable. Not the <i>same</i> as every other god, of course; "god" is a very broad category. Pantheism may use the terms in other ways, but that seems pretty nonstandard to me and requiring no more than a special-case footnote or two in the atheism article to accomodate. If you define "God" to be equivalent to "the Universe", then since I believe the universe exists I must therefore believe that God exists - but I see that definition as being a bit odd and misleading, frankly. We already have a perfectly good word for "Universe" and the word "God" has a lot of other widely-established connotations. I do not believe that the universe has any sort of concious will, for example, which is a quality that most people seem to assume deities would have.</dd>
<dd>In any event, since I am a weak atheist, I don't concern myself much with arguments against God. It's the lack of (IMO) credible arguments <i>for</i> God that leaves me in this position.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:36, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>first of all, the mention of my own beliefs was ment socially, not in regards to this subject of g/G. Secondly, the issue of God being distict from gods is not one which is being debated by much of anyone. Monotheism is clearly different from polytheism, and the term is simply used differently, in monotheism to refer to one individual with a proper noun, and in polytheism god is used in a different way, relating to many individuals. Finially, soft/weak atheism does not exist (atheism=rejection of God), IMO you are agnostic, since you don't appear to be claiming certainty. I reccomend you inspect <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pascal%27s_Wager_d152.html" title="Pascal's Wager">Pascal's Wager</a> and consider the utility of such a decision. In conclusion, IMO, the only sensible religious decision available to those who have not experienced personal revelation is reverent agnosticism. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 00:08, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A potential path to compromise has just occurred to me. How about temporarily bypassing the entire God/god issue, and adding a section on "Atheism and pantheism" to the Atheism article that deals with just that particular subject? If the pantheistic concept of God is really significantly different from other types of gods, it might be worth treating separately. I can't guarantee that I'll agree with whatever you write about it, of course, and I certainly can't guarantee what anyone else will think of it, but it'd give you a place to put stuff that wouldn't automatically step on sensitive toes and could later be integrated elsewhere into the article if it turns out to be warranted. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:03, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, keep in mind that atheism deals with <i>gods</i> and not necessarily <i>religion</i>s. There are religions without gods, and I'm thinking that some forms of pantheism may well fall into a fuzzy area near that. But I haven't really looked at pantheism in detail, so if I'm off on that then so much for that idea.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:18, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the definition of atheism should take into account the differing types of gods (or God) being rejected, be they monotheistic or polytheistic. Thats what I'm getting at. I don't see a need for any specific mention of any specific religion. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 00:15, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Atheism is the rejection of God, or gods. it isn't innacurate to call a christian an atheist in regards to their rejecting shiva, or some other god than their own. We really need to get back to basics and knock this article out. Its not very far from being done! Personality conflicts have resulted in a mess, here and elsewhere, IMO. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 00:12, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, atheism is a <i>lack of belief</i> in any gods. It is quite inaccurate to call a Christian an atheist in regards to any other particular gods, because they still believe in at least one god themselves. Atheists believe in 0 gods. Anyway, this is the same old argument that's on <a href="../../../a/t/h/Talk%7EAtheism_4580.html" title="Talk:Atheism">talk:atheism</a>, and if it's to continue it really should be over there. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:18, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Talk, talk, talk.

<p>I blanked nothing. The page was too big! I put it in the archive. Its not MY capital G! Everey source agrees w me! Plenty of others in the talk agreed w me. I did compromise~! prom was, I realized I can't say something thats untrue, w those citations staring me in the face.... I donno man... if you really think I'm unreasonable (habe you read the talk page recently?) you need to thinkn again.

<dd>Generally speaking, when one archives old talk: one should archive <i>old</i> talk. The stuff at the end was still quite pertinant to what was going on, as evidenced by the fact that I'm having to refer back to it in the continuing argument over there. As for discussing the content of the article itself, I'm not going to do that here - take it to talk:atheism. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:37, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem has nothing to do w the article, its clearly personal( you not accepting facts when they are presented) and interpersonal (you accusing me of not understanding my own references?). If I was the admin/arbitrator/wikipolice, I'd ask the both of us (and a few others) to leave the page. This is ugly and stuipid and ignorant of all obvious facts/citations/sources. IMO its all based on anti-theistic rhetoric, but whatever. Thats my POV. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 04:55, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I can quite safely say that this time, you started it. I was quite willing to leave off editing the article further as long as you didn't either; I have other stuff to do. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:13, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about we both avoid this article (and that skeptics mess) as much as possible, and let others enjoy the pleasent musings of lord kenneth&#160;;). IMO your actually not a bad guy, you just have a very bad impression of me, and a very non-scholorly approach to dealing with that bad impression. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:38, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The scientific skepticism article seems to be pretty stable right now, so I haven't been paying attention there either. As for my scholarly approach, I guess one's impression depends heavily on whether I agree with them or not.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:42, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I'm saying is I have seen you be both scholorly (respectful of logic, polite debate, sources) and not. And the not has been centered around me, after you realized I wrote amalek. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:49, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It wasn't that you wrote Amalek, it was that you redirected "rejection of God" there and then featured that redirect prominently in the atheism article. The Amalek article itself looked quite good to me. But let's not recap our entire disagreement now that we've agreed to leave it lie. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:59, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right. I just wanted to point out that I see our disagreement based on certain subtle causes, not on a fundamental editorial failing. That is a signifigant distinction.

<p>Jack's use of "God" on atheism is like what Reddi and Mirv are doing to scientific skepticism. I don't know why you wish to side with them when they are just as biased and wrong. I've already discussed it with you but you refuse to listen. I've told you why you are wrong and you have refused to answer me. You're becoming like Jack. Once scientific skepticism is back I fully expect you to actually look at my fair and unbiased one instead of the unfair and inaccurate one. The fact that you reverted to Mirv/Reddi's inaccurate version is obviously an attempt to antagonise me. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 20:56, Jan 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You and Jack are both interpreting "disagrees with me" as "out to get me," and I'm not going to waste the effort to try refuting such paranoia. Believe whatever you want; I will continue to argue for what I consider to be NPOV and leave it up to the Wikipedia consensus to ultimately determine whether my position is acceptable. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:36, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I see, sorry. Obviously "NPOV" means "allows lies, exaggerations, etc" to go "undeleted". You seem like the type of guy that would allow discussion of creationism in school science textbooks. Since you obviously refuse to discuss the issue, it's obvious where your biases lie. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 02:59, Jan 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>
