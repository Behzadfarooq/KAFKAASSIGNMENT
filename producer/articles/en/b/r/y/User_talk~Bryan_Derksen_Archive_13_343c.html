<p>A problem. I don't know who to contact about this, but since you seem to be well-versed in matters Wikipedian, I decided to come here.</p>
<p>I <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">boldly</a> changed numerous articles using a stub called {{Horror-stub}}, but have now learned that it was (apparently) recently created by a new user. Since I made the same mistake in the past (that is, creating a stub template without approval), I don't know if this stub is officially sanctioned (and because it has a mundane title, I thought it was just a run-of-the-mill stub).</p>
<p>So what should I do? Should I manually change all the stubs back to the {{fantasy-stub}} template; or can this be done with a robot?</p>

<dd>It looks like a pretty normal sort of stub category to me, I don't expect there'll be a problem with it. If it ultimately gets listed on <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_types_for_deletion_254f.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion">Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion</a> I presume there's some sort of bot they use over there to clean up after a deletion or merge (I've never looked at that page before, but <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a> has such a bot and this seems like a very similar sort of task).</dd>
<dd>I just noticed that the stubs-for-deletion page mentions <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Discoveries_017f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries</a> as a place to list stubs like this, and that horror-stub is already listed there for consideration: [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries#{{Horror-stub}} / Category:Horror stubs]]. You might want to add a comment there if you're interested in continuing to use this stub type. I've never really cared for stub notices and categories myself and usually ignore them completely so if you read those pages you'll probably know more about how these things work around here than I do&#160;:). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:54, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, and one other thing since my previous conversation with you was also laden with references to Wikipedia guidelines and stuff. Don't get paranoid worrying about "following the rules". Almost all the "rules" on Wikipedia are just <i>guidelines</i>, subject to flexible interpretation and changes whenever a situation comes along that might warrant it. <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a> is a useful guideline. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:01, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Next you'll be telling me to ignore the black helicopters circling my house (kidding). I'll try to keep your suggestions in mind. However, don't count on me creating any more templates in the near future! ...Or using templates that I'm not familar with. Maybe I'd better play it safe and stick to simple editing. <a href="../../../r/l/y/User%7ERlyehRising_5472.html" title="User:RlyehRising">RlyehRising</a> 01:43, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I came across this picture while working my way though this <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~gmaxwell/cgi-bin/report_orphan_fair_use.py" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~gmaxwell/cgi-bin/report_orphan_fair_use.py" rel="nofollow">list</a>. It's a nice picture, unfortunately having it on your userpage is strictly speaking against Wikipedia <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use policy</a>, wich explicitly does <i>not</i> allow "fair use images" on userpages. Not that I think this one is likely to cause any trouble compared to the people who splash DVD covers and what not all over theyr userpage, but still. Have you tried contacting Wired, and asked them if they are willing to release the picture under GFDL (or a compatable creative commons licence)? That would have been the ideal solution. I've left a notice on the image page for people speedy deleting orphanded fair use images to give it a pass for a while, but I suggest not delaying for too long. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 00:14, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. I kind of figured this day would come but I've been putting it off in case Wired says "no" (and because in the grand scheme of things it's not really all that important, I guess. I can always take another picture of myself, that one just looks extra cool.&#160;:). I'll dig out the email address and give it a whirl, thanks for giving me a heads-up to kick me into action. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:34, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BTW - When I marked the various Cthulhu mythos categories with rename/delete templates, I was NOT AWARE AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE THE ORIGINAL CREATOR of these categories. It never occurred to me to check the History to see who made them (until now); I just assumed they were created by <i>someone</i> in the past (and Wikipedia users tend to come and go—whatever happened to User:Cthulhu2000?). Ergo, <i>nothing personal</i>! It's just that recent events got me to thinking about categories and how incompatible they seem to be with my <i><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" class="extiw" title="meta:Mergism">mergist philosphy</a></i>. I realize you created them in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, but unfortunately in some instances they aren't practical, primarily because there is <i>so little information</i> about the various fauna and flora of the mythos. It is virtually impossible to write a <i>comprehensive</i> article about each and every one (for example, under <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsathoggua.html#Tsathoggua.27s_family_tree" title="Tsathoggua">Tsathoggua#Tsathoggua's family tree</a>, I merged lots of stub articles that were no more than one or two sentences...and furthermore, <i>that was about as much as could be said about those beings</i>!) Although Wikipedia doesn't exactly spell out what an "article" <i>is</i>, one might infer that a few paragraphs (or at the worst, a few sentences) is not generally recognized as an <i>official</i> Wikipedia article—especially if such a small article can be merged into a larger article (hence, those enigmatic <i>stubs</i>). Granted, some (or many?) of my mergers are <i>controversial</i>, even though I <i>try</i> to merge in the most logical way; for example, <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_One_%28Cthulhu_mythos%29_5227.html" title="Deep One (Cthulhu mythos)">Deep One</a> merges several seemingly disparate pieces, successfully (?), I think, primarily because they all revolve around the eponymous character. But enough of that. Just thought I'd drop you a line, and clear the water—uh, I mean air. <a href="../../../r/l/y/User%7ERlyehRising_5472.html" title="User:RlyehRising">RlyehRising</a> 00:56, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I merge articles fairly often myself, but mergism can only go so far in cases like this. There's enough material for stand-alone articles on at least a dozen of these Cthulhu mythos species, probably more, and IMO a dozen articles is enough to warrant a category. The distinction between alien and non-alien species seemed clearer back when I created the categories, I've no major issue with merging those two categories now, but I don't think more than that needs to be done. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:31, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I only vaguely remember encountering TDC, and the only comment I can find of mine on either of those pages is a couple lines mentioning that I'd looked at some of his edit summaries and found him making personal attacks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">State ritual and ceremonial</span></h2>
<p>What the heck did you remove the state ritual and cermonial category from articles? All that happened was that some user renamed it to remove an amersand from the name, but didn't set up a redirect. Now I'm going to have to go through <i>all</i> the articles that were in the category and reinsert it again. Could you not have done a quick search first just to make sure that the name of the category hadn't been slightly renamed? Sorry if I sound a bit grouchy but I have spent most of this week doing nothing but fixing other people's screw-ups and I'm getting fed up having to do it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:43, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>, you've misunderstood why I was removing articles from it this category. It was not a screw-up or a result of lack of diligence in searching for alternative categories. The ones I took out were already sorted into subcategories under it, and the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Creating_subcategories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization#Creating subcategories</a> state:
<dl>
<dd>"A good general rule is that articles should be placed in the most specific categories they reasonably fit in. For example, Queen Elizabeth should not be listed directly under People, but Queens of England might be a good place for her."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As an example from this particular case, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-arch_%28crown%29.html" title="Half-arch (crown)">Half-arch (crown)</a> is categorized under <a href="../../../c/r/o/Category%7ECrowns_3965.html" title="Category:Crowns">Category:Crowns</a>, which is already a subcategory of Category:State ritual and ceremonial (via <a href="../../../c/r/o/Category%7ECrown_Jewels_7715.html" title="Category:Crown Jewels">Category:Crown Jewels</a>). So "State ritual and ceremonial" is redundant once Half-arch is already categorized under "Crowns", which it was. Unless there's some specific reason why half-arch should be categorized under both of these categories, I or someone else will just end up removing the overly-general parent category from it again in the future in accordance with the guidelines. The same goes for the other articles you're putting back into State ritual and ceremonial. Perhaps we should discuss this on Category talk:State ritual and ceremonial if you think there's some reason to make an exception here? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:39, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I've just gone back to check and noted that I was the one who put the category up for renaming in the first place on October 22, at the same time I did the various removals: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Speedy&amp;diff=26168386&amp;oldid=26134244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Speedy&amp;diff=26168386&amp;oldid=26134244" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<dd>The way you have merged it, the abstract sumamary leads right into the "meat" — which is fine if it is a short, simple article with no sub-sections, and no TOC. However, when there <i>are</i> sub-sections to the article, then not using the abstract/main article divide places the <b>main part</b> of the article <i>outside</i> of the table of contents, which doesn't seem right.</dd>

<dd>It was exactly because the "description" section seemed artificial that I merged it. The description seemed like good intro material to me, the sort of thing someone should read if they're just wanting a basic overview of the topic, and it was too short to warrant a separate section elsewhere in the article (if it became longer than a paragraph or two I'd definitely support splitting it out again). I guess our minds just break down the article differently, I think every intro should have some meat to it regardless of the article's size otherwise it's just wasted verbiage. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:39, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried to "split the difference" as well as the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question on interference article</span></h2>
<p>It appears that you are the person who added the following to the article on interference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a single source interferes with itself, the principle of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_of_energy.html" title="Conservation of energy">conservation of energy</a> dictates that the energy "missing" from the darkened regions of an interference pattern where destructive interference has taken place will be found in the brightened portions where constructive interference has taken place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no citations for this article, and the above sentence appears to be wrong. (See Feynman, <i>QED</i>, chapter 1.) See also, Francis Weston Sears, <i>Optics</i>. (Check the index under interference.)</p>
<p>If it were as you suggest, then people would be using this phenomenon to create more intense bursts of laser radiation. If you wanted a really bright laser light at one point, then you would create an interference pattern and use the "super bright" part. But nobody seems to be doing this kind of trick. I suppose it might be because it is easier to scale up an ordinary laser than to concentrate the beam of an ordinary one, but I should think that people would at least occasionally talk about what might be done to push the envelope of intensity of laser beams.</p>
<p>If you have a citation for the claim I quoted above, please let me know. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 08:27, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was over four years ago and I neglected to add an edit summary, so I have absolutely no idea where I got that information from.&#160;:) Physics isn't really my field so go ahead and edit mercilessly. I'm curious how the energy conservation issue works out otherwise, though. Since the interference pattern is spread out over an area larger than the original beam, shouldn't that allow "super bright" patches to be avoided if they're a problem? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the gentleman you were discussing the neutronium and neutron stars with is an advocate that neutron stars do not in fact contain matter composed of neutrons, why does he not advocate the changing of that article as well to something more relevant? I myself cannot really contribute an arguing factor against him or in agreement with him as i have only just begun Nuclear physics and the fact that i did enjoy the Neutronium Alchemist by Peter F Hamilton, but i see no reason why a neutron star cannot contain matter composed of neutrons if they obey the Pauli exclusion effect. Yes learning about that effect has led me to the conclusion that neutron matter in 'clumps' cannot exist outside of extreme conditions, but maybe the gentleman should advocate the changing of neutron stars names to Pauli Exclusion Stars after the effect they may utilise whether it be with neutrons or the entire family of fermions. Perhaps genuine science and science fiction should not be so hostile to each other, as implied by the gentleman, he just has to remember that going to the moon was science fiction at one time, and many new ideas are spawned from science fiction that could be utilised by modern physics --Cranstoun 18:57, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw trouble brewing because I've got Gimmiet's user page watchlisted due to his previous disruptions, in theory you could post a warning there and probably draw the attention of others who might have him watchlisted for similar reasons. But Gimmiet's had a history of simply deleting stuff he doesn't like from his user talk page, so that might slip through the cracks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">user IP 211.28.7.201 edits on timecube page</span></h2>
<p>Hello Bryan. I dont understand why IP 211.28.7.201 is allowed to make edits on the timecube page like the recent one he did of 09:32, 10 February 2006 which was mostly propaganda for his own site, cubicao. He re-worded most of the article to sound pro cubic, and to give it a "slogan" kind of feel. He also removed some links to refutations of the theory because he said the forum where the links came from was already linked to, however the specific threads where the refutations come from are not obvious to find, so it is most helpful to have the links as absolute addresses, rather than being included under the general home page of said forum.</p>
<p>I reverted the timecube page back to how it looked just before he made his edit. This is ridiculous... if you want wikipedia to be serious, you have to start blocking people who abuse it repeatedly, and evidence suggests this user has so in the past. He is slowly working to remove any criticism, and to pull all traffic to his own website (cubicao). He also frames his wording as though timecube is some sort of accepted theory. There is clearly enough junk on the net not for people to start giving credible voice to any crackpot who is persistent enough. Is there a policy on nuisances like this? Its certainly getting to be NOT NPoV when he is allowed to make these subtle changes all the time.</p>
<p>He (211.28.7.201) also claimed that timecube makes many sociological observations, and that the theory is a worthy TOE. This is totally preposterous, and makes it sound like wikipedia is endorsing the theory as legitimate and a worthwhile TOE. Thats nuts! Cheers, ewm</p>

<p>Thanks for taking care of it. Working with templates, etc. isn't my strong point. I'm sorry for responding so late, I got sidetracked and away from the project for a while.<a href="../../../r/t/6/User%7ERt66lt_1e4e.html" title="User:Rt66lt">Rt66lt</a> 01:56, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about misinterpreting your intent for &amp;#32; in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_episode_0190.html" title="Template:Cite episode">Template:Cite episode</a>. But now I'm confused about the purpose of having <i>any</i> space manually added there. Couldn't you just insert a space between the appropriate consecutive {{<a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">qif</a>}} tags? (I'd expect that, if the template returns nothing, you'd just get extra whitespace that would be rendered as a single blank, and if it returns something, you'd get the needed spaces around its content.) Is there something odd about the current transclusion mechanism that mishandles whitespace between consecutive templates in this situation? ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 03:55, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm actually not completely sure, the initial version of the template was just a rejiggered copy of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">Template:Cite book</a> and it used those like that. <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">Template:Cite journal</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">Template:Cite web</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">Template:Cite news</a> also use #32. My assumption is that if you use an ordinary space (as in " ") at the beginning of a template parameter it gets trimmed away as whitespace, and so the sections of the template would get all mushed together. I'll test that in a sandbox in a moment. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:32, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's a cite using a sandbox version which replaces the #32s with ordinary spaces:</dd>
