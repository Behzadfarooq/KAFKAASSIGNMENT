<p>First of all Alex Bakharev and Irpen, then others. Look how ridiculous is the situation. Shao comes from uk wiki. He has 28! articles of the week on this wiki. He writes solely on biological and geographical topics. Here he also started to create high quality, comprehensieve articles on same topics. Nothing "nationalistic", nothing controversial. Even not asingle word on political issues etc. Just he is using geographical names that ARE correct. Not for your "consensus", "WP policy" or whatewer yor call yourself. And seems like he is going to be banned, driven away, and will leave en. wiki. Then Alex will write that there are only "two active and handful semi-active editors out of thousand wikipedians". But he will write it to next person who comes and stumbles over same stone. This was with me, AndriyK, and many others I don't know. Situation repeats over and over again. Do you guys understand what you are doing? This is the way you are improving content of this corner of WP? This is the way to build up local Ukrainian or Russian community of WP editors?</p>
<p>Irpen wrote in his latest reverts: "Correct names in English are defined by Webster, Oxford dictionaries as well as major media. I suggest you look there and see for yourself". I truly believe you. But are you sure this is where you have to refer to? When were they printed? Did you look it up in 2007 edition? Did you hear that the scretary department of Congress of the United Stated issued indications (last year, 2006) to change spelling of Ukrainian geographical names from old (Soviet) to correct ones - Kyyiv, Odesa, etc. in all their documentation. Did you know that? So if this pretty serious official body, the one, who, I would say, was the most serious "spreader" of old names did it, then "WP policy" can not do it? Irpen also wrties: "your desired change can only be accoumplished through a change in naming conventions, not revert warring". So what about changing it? Is there not enough reasons? You will strat telling me over and over again that "English speeking users are more used to..." and I will tell you that "there is mechanism of redirects in WP and we can olways write Kyyiv (Kiev)...", we will use same arguments millointh time again and come to nothing. Why because SOME people here prefer to stay where they are. It does not matter for them that times and the world around are changing, that they are loosing and scaring new valuable and productive editors, that THE IS a solition for this. It takes my time, it takes your time, it is counterproductive. But unless there is a wish. I mean unless there is clear view from your side (I mean those who keep this part of WP under their control. Don't tell me this is illusion) that something must be done - there will be no progress over this question. So my question is: Do you see some other ways to solve these issues except for doing what you are doing now?--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 14:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bryndza, all your arguments are useless. This problem, according to present circumstances, can be completely solved only via editorial war. Also it can be solved partially by allowance to use hyperlinks to redirect pages. Properly speaking, it's exactly the way which I'd like to use. I don't have any idea concerning the result: may be in the end my opponents will secure a prohibition of redirect pages' usage. But it's the only way which can lead to acceptable result for both sides: allowance to use redirect pages for hyperlinking.</dd>
<dd>I am not very familiar with english wiki-policies (and have no time and willing to study them in finest details), but it seems to me that it is no any restrictions for such type of redirect pages' usage. So, my opponents should agree with local policy, I suppose. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShao_6c52.html" title="User:Shao">Shao</a> 15:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think Editor's war will lead to anything good. Do you want to wake up every morning and first thing you do - check if somebody reverted your edits on 10-20 articles? I don't. Waste of time. Plus they will block you much earlier even if you don't violate 3RR rule, start arbitration etc. Both sides will loose. I hope it is clear - you will not be able to enjoy writing your articles - they will loose productive editor. So I suggest to find any other possible compromise. redirect links are good option in my opinion, and this is one of the greatest features of WP, but I think our opponents would not agree on this solution. Therefore I suggests (again and again) to use <i><a href="../../../k/y/y/Kyyiv.html" title="Kyyiv">Kyyiv</a> (Kiev)</i> form. Finally, there are not so many names that need it. Kyyiv, Odesa, Dnipro come to my mind first. For some anglophone people that would be also good to have both names in front of their eyes. But let's see if other side wants to do something at all. And we better do, otherwise this will resurface again and again and waste our time again and again.--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 16:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. Discussing, unlike revert warring, is always the right way to resolve the differences. I will post to this page later today.

<dd>"Prevailing opinion" and a number of links in Google search are not arguments for the right or wrong. At least, some time ago millions of people were convinced that the Sun is rotating around the Earth - but that's not true. The same with Ukrainian cities' spelling: if mistake is common, it doesn't make it truth. <b>Right</b> transliteration is the one established according to correspondent ukrainian law; <b>more common</b> transliteration is the old from Soviet times. But if mistake is common, it does not matter, that any encyclopedia must strictly follow it. --Shao 17:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mistake #1. The Ukrainian laws do not regulate the English language and do not define what is "right" and what is "wrong". That is defined by the dictionaries. Ukrainian laws only regulate what spelling should be used by the Ukrainian government bodies. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Local laws regulate official transliterations of all objects at their legislative territory, for all languages. Example 1: <a href="../../../c/%C3%B4/t/C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_ed5b.html" title="Côte d'Ivoire">Côte d'Ivoire</a> is the official name of the country in spite of the wide-spread <b>wrong</b> name "Ivory Coast". Example 2: the same with <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and "Burma". Example 3: <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a> and "common" usage of "Russia" between 1922 and 1991. All three names were accepted as <b>right</b> since they had been established by <b>local governments</b> of correspondent countries. --Shao 18:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I used same arguments as Shao does long time ago when we discussed this Irpen. I still did not change my mind. I would not classify it as mistake, Irpen. Ukraine is able to tell others how to spell correctly it's own geographical names. If Ukraine decides to move capital from Kyiv to Kharkiv - it will do so and others will have to recognize it. When are those dictionaries you are referring to edited? I have most comprehencieve geographical atlas edited in 2006 in Canada or USA by National Geaographic. ALL names there are spelled they should be. Does it present any authority to you? And what US Senate have passed? Do you need me to post references here? So. Even we assume that #1 of yours and agree that Ukraine can not indicate/recommend how to spell it's own geographical names (which is not completely true), then do you agree that these "external" bodies are folowing Ukraine's recommended spelling already? Not en maso, of course, but US congress and national Geographic are far more significant things than gazette articles. Don't you find?--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 18:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>NO they are not, associated press, CNN and BBC are significant. And they use Kiev! I mean think of how rediculous would it be if Ukrainian government chose to alter its Russian language publications from Киев to Кыйив. What would be the reaction to that? Would any Russian language publications change? Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28UE%29_41c6.html" title="WP:NC(UE)">WP:NC(UE)</a> policy which means <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> over Moskva, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> over Warszawa, <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baku.html" title="Baku">Baku</a> over Baki, <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tashkent.html" title="Tashkent">Tashkent</a> over Toshkent, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> over Suomi, <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> over Ukrayina ... Kiev over Kyyiv.

<dd>See before examples of <a href="../../../c/%C3%B4/t/C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_ed5b.html" title="Côte d'Ivoire">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a>. But also - is it already prohibited to use redirect pages for hyperlinks? I just do the following: link a page <a href="../../../k/y/i/Kyiv.html" title="Kyiv">Kyiv</a> which transfers user to <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>. Could you please show me a rule which prohibits this? --Shao 18:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28UE%29_41c6.html" title="WP:NC(UE)">WP:NC(UE)</a> is you rule. Now titles of nations are not the same as titles of cities. So far wikipedia has been inconsistant. For example <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Federation_4de3.html" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a> vs. <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and at the same time we have the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> of Macedonia and such. Now wrt to Ivory Coast, then BBC actually used the English name during the 2006 world cup. So as you can see titles of countries are not uniform and there are hot discussions on the topic already. So whilst I would not use the term that those names are "temporary", but there is nothing to suggest they remain permanent. However comparing that to a city name is incorrect. City names are given by their English names. However English is not a state language of Ukraine, unlike India and thus the example of <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>/Bombay (sooner or later you would have brought it up) is not the same as Kiev/Kyiv/Kiyev. The better parallel is the main river of Ukraine <a href="../../../d/n/i/Dnieper.html" title="Dnieper">Dnieper</a>. Its Russian translit is Dnepr, Belarusian - Dnyapro, Ukrainian - Dnipro... but in all cases here we use Dnieper when referring to the river itself. Same with Kiev, its Ukrainian translit is Kyyiv, Russian Kiyev, Polish Kijow... but in English its Kiev and should always be referred to as such. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 19:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry to barge in, but I see some misconceptions here. This is English language encyclopedia, and English language has <i>its own</i> geographical <i>normatives</i> (BGN/PCGN), which may or may not be influenced by the political tides.</li>
<li>It seems, so far, these were not readily influenced by any intra-national or supra-national standard bodies' decisions w/r to the <i>technicalities</i> -- so, translit systems per se, however, were generally accepting the "nationalised" spelling. Why not consult the BGN database? <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 19:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I see it, such globalities as country/capitals names naturally tend to stick.

<dd>OK, fine. And what about the usage of redirect pages for hyperlinking? Is it already prohibited?--Shao 19:08, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Technically, it is not prohibited, but you should expect that such redirects might all eventually be flattened by bots. Plus, I don't really see the point of such redirects except in cases when the modern (after 1991) city is mentioned.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 19:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If it's not prohibited why <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive186#Persistent_revert_warring_by_Shao" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive186#Persistent_revert_warring_by_Shao" rel="nofollow">had already asked</a> to press me for the usage of this editorial trick? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShao_6c52.html" title="User:Shao">Shao</a>
<dl>
<dd>It's not prohibited, but it's not encouraged either. If one can link directly to an article, one should do so unless there is a good reason to do otherwise. From what I see, your argument with Irpen and others is about what constitutes that said "good reason", not about whether or not linking via redirects is prohibited. In my <i>personal</i> opinion, if that interests you any, unnecessary linking via redirects is a bad form and just plain impolite towards other editors who would have to weed through redundant redirects.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 19:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I also tried to warn him many times to stop edit warring and discuss naming conventions to no avail. He ignored all that and continued edit warring and even resorted to insulting me by ethnic talk. Finally, I gave him a last warning that he should stop. Right after that, he went on and reverted again. He was reported last time not by me, but I would have reported him as well. Check his talk. He ignored calls to stop edit warring and start talking multiple times. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The point that in-text usage may be different from the name of the corresponding article is valid. But such trick may not be used on the whim and must have a valid reason. Such reason would be the prevalence of the historic usage in a specific historic being different from the currently prevailing usage in the modern context. For example, in the WW2 context, all major literature on the military history uses <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumania.html" title="Rumania">Rumania</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkov.html" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> despite most commonly used modern names are <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv.html" title="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a>. One may talk about <a href="../../../k/i/j/Kijow_Voivodship_9916.html" title="Kijow Voivodship">Kijow Voivodship</a> and Peremyshl Principality (despite the modern name of the latter city is <a href="../../../p/r/z/Przemy%C5%9Bl.html" title="Przemyśl">Przemyśl</a>) because the appropriate literature about the respective period uses such name. In the modern context Kiev and Odessa are most commonly used and such spelling should be used in the articles.</p>
<p>Another proper usage is when the word is a part of the larger Proper name that is known in its own right, like <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Dynamo_Kyiv_548c.html" title="FC Dynamo Kyiv">FC Dynamo Kyiv</a>, <a href="../../../k/y/i/Kyiv_Post_f364.html" title="Kyiv Post">Kyiv Post</a> or The Kyiv Beet. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. So, I can introduce all these valid reasons here. 1: Names "Kyiv", "Odesa" etc. are used by a number of people and even in state documents in Ukraine. 2: People whose native language is Ukrainian know these (and some other) cities under Ukrainian names. Should we consider that they must not have any possibility to know what is the "common" English spelling for Kyiv? Probably not. So, these redirects give them a possibility to receive such a knowledge. 3: In <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_postal_codes.html" title="Ukrainian postal codes">Ukrainian postal codes</a> article I try to use official names adopted by UkrPoshta for addressing. It's an article dedicated to postal service, BTW. Don't you think that it's better for foreigners to know what exactly they have to write at envelops in case of sending letters to Ukraine? But you try to introduce a mistake again and again. May be you will change digital postal codes in this article as well? They are quite different from codes used in Ukraine during the Soviet times, and from modern Russian postal codes as well. And a number of people know (and even still use) old versions of postal codes. The same situation as with cities' names, isn't it? So, shoud we change Ukrainian postal codes according to Russian system?</dd>

One day, a disciple asked Confucius: 
-“If a king were to entrust you with a territory which you could govern according to your ideas, what would you do first?”
Confucius replied: 
-“My first task would certainly be to rectify the names.”
The puzzled disciple asked: 
-“Rectify the names?…Is this a joke?”
Confucius replied: 
-“If the names are not correct, if they do not match realities, language has no object. 
If language is without an object, action  becomes impossible - and therefore all human 
affairs disintegrate and their management becomes pointless and impossible.  Hence, the 
very first task of a true statesman is to rectify the names.”

<dd>Just as with "Moskva" in "Hotel Moskva", we also use "Kyiv" in <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Dynamo_Kyiv_548c.html" title="FC Dynamo Kyiv">FC Dynamo Kyiv</a>. As for the government issues, don't forget that we are writing an encyclopedia here, not a government press release. Wikipedia is for human readers, not for the borgs from the government. Here is an example from real life, which I find rather telling. I was approached by my American co-worker the other day, who asked me whether it's true that the Ukrainian government is trying to change the English spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv". I said that it was. His response? "What nonsense!" Note this is coming from individual who happens to know full well that Ukrainians consider the Russian spelling to be a remnant of their "dark colonial past" and who is overall sympathetic to Ukraine, Orange revolution, and Ukrainians in general. From what I see, his attitude regarding the city name is prevalent in the US. The U.S. government knows that Ukrainian is the official language in Ukraine and bases romanization on Ukrainian, but, as Irpen correctly indicated below, it cannot designate it the only "correct" version of the name. Which is why Wikipedia uses WP:UE, and not the version devised by a single government agency.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 22:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

The U.S. government is the authority which is elected to represent the interest of the people. Then, first of all, unless we are dealing with a dictatorship, the most telling thing is the position of the government. A guy may say <i>"What nonsense!"</i> for a variety of reasons, including just to please you knowing your interest in such topics. If he were in a position to really weigh the pros. and cons. of such decision, or if he were actually to make such decision, he is likely to behave differently.

<dd>Krys, we already discussed that your invoking hypothetical desire of the city population is misplaced. Firstly, such criterion is not included anywhere in WP:NC or in the conventions of any other encyclopedia. Besides it would be hard to implement as it would require the drammatic change of all geographic names. Poles might have prefered Warszawa and Germans might prever Munchen. Secondly, your claiming that the city residents prefer Kyiv, while this is largely irrelevant, is nothing but your own original research, as I already told you.

<dd>Umm, by "prevalent in the US" I meant the opinions of regular people (potential readers of Wikipedia), not the US government policies. The same US government which uses BGN conventions for established names, for example, wages a war in Iraq despite two thirds of the US population now being opposed to it. Doesn't look like a good representation of interests to me.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I did not really hope that my example would weigh much in the discussion; it was just a curious occurence I thought I'd share. Of course, I realize that an opinion of one random guy doesn't mean much by itself; my point was that <i>I</i>, personally, find his attitude rather in line with that of the rest of the US population whose reaction on this piece of news I had a chance to observe (not that large of a sample, I admit). <i>Why</i> they react the way they do is a topic of a different discussion, one that is hardly relevant here.

<p>Unlike Ukrainian and Russian, which have a formal regulatory body through the subject committees in their respecitve Academies of Sciences, the English language does not have such officil regulatory body. Government agencies can advice what name is to use for the government publications, true, but they do not define what usage is "correct". Therefore, there is no mention of the term "correct" vs "incorrect" name per se in our naming conventions. This is because there is no authority that defines "correct" in general. English encyclopedias and dictionaries choose the names for their article's entries based on the common usage. How exactly they gauge it is best to ask them, not me. Our naming conventions also uses the term "most commonly used". The latest editions of Britannica uses Kiev as well as the major media, which confirms that this is the prevailing usage for now. Wikipedia should reflect that as well as prescribed by NC. I specifically studied the usage of the names of all major Ukrainian cities in the major media. I found that most commonly used names of all Oblast centers except Kiev and Odessa are based on the transliteration from their Ukrainian language names. I also found out that those changed relatively recently. Some time ago, Kharkov was a predominant name and English Encyclopedias used it as their main entry. Their most recent editions (eg. Britannica 2005) use Kharkiv that just shows that encyclopedias reflect the change in usage and media search for last 5 years confirm that (unlike for last 10 years). Note that not only EB changed their entry but the WP too. Moreover, <b>I</b> initiated the renaming of that article. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Take U.S. Board on Geographic Names which IS official regulatory body that DEFINES proper use of foreign names. And forget about "major media". It is NOT authotority.

<dd>US BGN only <i>defines</i> use for those who accept BGN as an authority setting standards. They cannot <i>define</i> what regular folks and media are supposed to use. If you work for the US government, then naturally you would be using BGN conventions in the documents you generate. If you work for the paper, you'd be using that paper's manual of style, which usually has no relation to BGN or any other body's conventions. If you are a Joe Shmoe of average intelligence, one who could care less about BGN, AP, or Reuters, you'd probably look the word up in the dictionary or in an encyclopedia, which may have no relation to mass media and BGN as well. The difference between BGN/government and mass media/dictionaries/encyclopedias is that the former tends to standardize usage for consistency and efficient workflow (as they deal with the general set of geographic names), while the latter represent common usage (which deals with isolated members of the general set of geographic names). When people get used to new spelling (with the help of government documents, mass media gradually converting to new usage, or by other means), then the common usage will change, too. At which time changes will be made to newspapers' manuals of style, dictionaries, and encyclopedias (Wikipedia included). Are we back to square one yet?—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 22:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have an atlas I bought this year published in 2005. It uses Kiev. I can also give you an ISBN. What will it prove? --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>USBGN is an authority to recommend the name usage to the US government and not to the Encyclopedias and other reference sources. The latter choose the convention they use as they see would serve best to the interest of their readers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since, unlike the Ukrainian, the English language lacks a formal authority that defines what is "correct" both names can be considered "correct" and none are a "mistake". The issue at hand is not choosing the correct name (they are both "correct") but the name which satisfies the naming policy adopted by a particular source. Most dictionaries and encyclopedias (including WP) base their policy on the prevailing usage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The change of a policy is a possibility, true enough. Anyone can try to change any Wikipedia policy when one finds it deficient. Personally, I find it wise to give deference to the prevailing usage but that is a side point. That our NC say so simply means that this is what most Wikipedians also agree with but policy do evolve with time, I give you that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, the <i>usage</i> evolves too. When Kharkiv beat Kharkov in English usage, I supported the respective change in WP. This has not happened for Kiev. Whether it will happen or not, there is no way to know now. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I undestand your points better now. And how would we define prevailing usage? Google? Kyjiv+Kyiv+Kyyiv (6.101.000) over Kiev (40.500.000) gives prevalance to Kiev no doubts. But proportion 1:6,6 puts non-Kiev versions on strong grounds. May be enough to start citing both names in parallel on WP? And we hardly need to change WP policy for this--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 23:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again guys. Yes, conforming to the BGN/PCGN (which spans USA and Britain, btw) is not mandatory, in the sense that conforming to the safety regulations is mandatory. Still, it's what the solid product of the sort will relate to.</p>
<p>Now, for the well-known, traditional English uses. It's obvious that for the East European names there are quite a few of such, everything other just follows the normative. Let's precise the set of objects which conform to this. Kharkiv isn't a problem anymor, AFAIU. That leaves us with Kiev, Odessa, Moscow, Ukraine? <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 08:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And Dnipro/Dniepr I suppose.--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 22:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also Crimea and Eupatoria, but since both are not close to the Russian names, I guess no one would object.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These (+Balaclava, Alma, Sebastopol) <i>might</i> get mentioned <i>relatively</i> often in texts on Crimean War. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> (<a href="../../../y/u/r/User_talk%7EYury_Tarasievich_0b27.html" title="User talk:Yury Tarasievich">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yury_Tarasievich_0a96.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yury Tarasievich">contribs</a>) 07:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>But seriously, there may be only a couple of others if any. The idea is that <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28UE%29_41c6.html" title="WP:NC(UE)">WP:NC(UE)</a> supersedes the transliteration rules, that is of course if there <i>is</i> a most commonly used name in English which in view of the relative obscurity of Ukraine among the English speakers is usually <i>not</i> the case. Very few UA related geographic names have any significant usage in English and the list above is almost exhaustive, I suppose.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, all the articles on all the other Ukrainian locations have to be titled by their transliterated Ukrainian name and the names of all such locations in the article's text should always be a Ukrainian one, at least in the modern context. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is what we have now in WP. Isn't it? But I still don't understand why would someone object to putting alternative name spelling in () beside those few examples listed above. Like this: Kyyiv (Kiev). Very often some editors insistantly revert it to single form (Kiev).--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 17:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there are no more reasons to include both names here as when writing <i>Lviv (Lvov)</i> or <i>Kharkiv (Kharkov)</i>. Perhaps it is even more like writing Lvov (Lviv) and Kharkov (Kharkiv) as your suggestion implies to use a <i>less common</i> name first and the more common name as a secondary one (in parentheses). I could accept Lvov (Lviv) in say <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov-Sandomierz_Offensive_4297.html" title="Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive">Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive</a> or Lwow in <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenian_Voivodeship_c957.html" title="Ruthenian Voivodeship">Ruthenian Voivodeship</a> because that's what English sources devoted to this time period persistently use. I would object, however, not only to Lvov (Lviv) but also to Lviv (Lvov) if used on the whim without a valid reason. Same applies to your favored Kyyiv (Kiev) if used generically without a specific reason. The article's topic being Postal codes and Kyyiv being used by Ukrposhta may be a valid reason for a particular article. But there is no reason to change a common name for an uncommon one in various articles arbitrarily. The rule of thumb is: use a conventional name by default and justify the usage of a non-conventional name by a particular context. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
