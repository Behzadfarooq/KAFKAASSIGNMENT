<p>In the main article it currently and unequivocally states:</p>
<p>"Once, Brythonic languages encompassed most of Great Britain and Ireland – though in Ireland it was replaced with Goidelic when Gaels invaded sometime between 500 and 100 BC."</p>
<p>I've done a bit of reading on the subject and this is the first I've seen that Brythonic is considered older in the British Isles than Goidelic. Most things I've read have suggested the opposite. My reading has hardly been exhaustive, however. Has anyone else heard this before? At the very least I'll bet that it is the subject of some ambiguity, as we are talking about a period of prehistory. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 20:03, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All the linguistic evidence points to Breton and Cornish being so closely related to Welsh that they must have developed alongside it on Britain, with Breton being introduced to Brittany. But there are Breton linguists who for political reasons want to believe that Breton is a direct descendant of Gaulish, and so they need to find an alternative explanation for the fact that Breton is so very similar to Cornish and Welsh. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 05:14, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gaulish scholars do not see Breton as being a direct descendant of Gaulish, but having passed through the earlier phases of the Bythonic to Old Welsh changes first.

<dd>Lowlands Scots and Modern English both derived from post-Norman Middle English dialects. It is incorrect to say that Anglo-Saxons brought Lowlands Scots with them, and there's no reason for giving Lowlands Scots prominence in the Brythonic Languages article, as both it and Modern English derive from Anglo-Saxon.

<p>The article seems to assume that Gaulish and Common Brythonic, Old Brythonic or Proto-Brythonic have zero connection beyond proto-Celtic. While this is certainly one view, and boldly overturns the P-Celtic / Q-Celtic model, it fails to explain why the actual Iron Age British evidence that we do have, scanty though it may be, and the Old Welsh material (onve adjusted back for sound shifts) are so readilly analysed as if they were Gaulish.

<dd>If it comes to that, Jorvik isn't the same word as York. Saying that Jorvik is derived from Eboracum is no more or less speculative than saying York is derived from Jorvik.

You also seem to have missed my point, which is that above you say <i>it</i> is <i>Brythonic</i>, whereas what I am saying is that it isn't brythonic. I was commenting on your statement in the discussion page, not on the article.<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 09:53, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So now I'm hoplessly confused. I've just had a look at <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a>,and <a href="../../../y/o/r/York.html" title="York">York</a>. It seems to me that what has happened is that Saxons used a Saxon word for the city (Eoforwīc-wild-boar dairy-farm), which sounded a bit like the celtic (Eborakon-yew). The Danes did a similar thing, Jórvík (Horse Bay). If I am understanding this correctly, then York is actually from Jorvik, <b>which is a Danish word</b>. The whole folk etymology arguement actually implies that words like York are in fact <b>not</b> brythonic at all. They are non-brythonic words (with different meanings to the original brythonic words), which were used for place names because they <b>sounded a bit like</b> the brythonic names they replaced. So if words like Jorvik are scandinavian words, with distinct scandinavian meanings, which were just used because they sounded a bit like the original name, then I fail to understand how it can be called brythonic at all. It's not even derived from brythonic, it just sounds like a Northumbrian word which itself just sounded like the brythonic word that used before that. Talk about tenuous to call York a brythonic word!!!!<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 10:34, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original name of the city was something like Eborakom, derived from the Brythonic word for "yew". When the Saxons came they heard this name and changed it by folk etymology into Eoforwic, which sounded more like Saxon words they knew. When the Norse came they pronounced it Jorvik, and over the centuries Jorvik was simplified to York. But York is derived from Brythonic because neither the Norse nor the Saxons ever really re-named the city, they just adapted the name slightly to make it sound more native to them. In fact, it's <i>really</i> unlikely that if the Norse had wanted to name a town "Horse bay" they would have called it <i>Jórvík</i>. For one thing, <i>jór</i> is a rare, poetic word for horse in Old Norse; the usual words are <i>hross</i> and <i>hestr</i>. For another thing, the <i>-r</i> of <i>jór</i> is just the nominative singular ending, which gets dropped when forming compounds. It's much more likely that <i>Jorvik</i> was just the Norse way of pronouncing <i>Eoforwic</i> and the only folk etymologizing was done by the Saxons to the Brythonic name. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 11:07, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But that just means that the word York is derived from a Northumbrian word (Eoforwic), by the way you say that the Saxons <i>changed it by folk etymology into Eoforwic, which sounded more like Saxon words they knew</i> so is Eoforwic actually an Anglo-Saxon word, or does it just <b>sound</b> like an Anglo-Saxon word? It's important because if it <b>is</b> a distinct Anglo-Saxon word with a distinct Anglo-Saxon meaning, then how can it be said to have derived from a brythonic word? In that case it just <b>sounds like</b> a brythonic word, which is a different thing altogether. by the way I don't think there were Saxons as far north as York. Surely they were Northumbrians, who were <i>North Angles</i> and not Saxons? It does seem to me that the whole <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> thing is just a way of saying that a word from one language is used because it <b>sounds</b> like another word from a different language, this is not the same as being <b>derived from</b> the original language. I'm no linguist and know nothing of etymology, but the whole York being brythonic thing does seem to be <b>very</b> dubious.<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 11:34, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only reason the Germanic speakers (whether Saxons or Northumbrians is irrelevant to this discussion) called it "Boarville" was that the native Brythonic named already sounded like that. They heard the Celts and Romans calling it "Eboracum" and thought "oh, that must have something to do with boars (<i>eofor</i>)" and so they folk-etymologically adapted it. But even when altered by folk etymology, the name Eoforwic is derived from Eboracum the same way that <i>bridegroom</i> is derived from <i>brýdguma</i>. York has been altered a lot over the past fifteen centuries, but at its root it is a Brythonic name. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 12:29, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes that makes perfect sense. But the point is that my great-grandfather and I share an eighth of our genes, which is why we might look similar, there's a good reason for it. These two words are more like unrelated people who just happen to look like each other. Just because you look like someone doesn't mean that you are related to them, and in biology we don't say that a person is descended from someone who they just happen to look like. You seem to be saying that in linguistics it is the case that sometimes words that happen to sound the same are considered related, like in this case. I find this reasoning strange. I would think that one could say that York is desended from a <i>Germanic</i> word that souded like another, different <i>Brythonic</i> word.<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the Germanic word didn't just coincidentally sound like a Brythonic word. It was a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanword</a> from Brythonic to Germanic, and the Germanic speakers altered it to make it seem more Germanic.

<dd>One more question and an observation. Are you saying that <i>Eoforwic</i> is itself a loan word from Brythonic, which has been Germanised, and that's why it sounds like "Eboracum"? Of course however much cosmetic surgery your putative adopted child has to resemble you, they will never be descended from you in any biological sense. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 09:49, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, I didn't expect to kick off such a thorough debate with a simple query about York! This leads me to another thought.</p>
<p>Should the list of examples include York if the derivation is so indirect? Maybe we should provide readers with a list of obvious examples (like Kent) and then add a new paragraph explaining that in many cases there are quite indirect influences on modern place names, perhaps providing York as an example of that.</p>
<p>It's mainly a question of what will best help an inquiring reader understand the idea of Brythonic languages as a whole. In its present form, I'm afraid York may confuse rather than enlighten.

<dd>I think there's a case for keeping this paragraph. The genetic evidence supports the conclusion that the West Midlands was lightly settled by Germanic-speaking people, demonstrating that it's more likely there might be Brythonic survivals here, particularly place name elements like 'coombe'. There are various reasons for words and name elements to be retained, but one of them is the lack of sufficient numbers of settlers bringing in a replacement language. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisjj_d9e1.html" title="User:Chrisjj">Chris Jefferies</a> 13:52, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There seems to be a distasteful attempt in many articles to link "Celticity" with genes, which is inaccurate, and borderline racist. While it is certainly notable that genetic evidence points to pre-Anglo-Saxon origins for many people in England, and probably deserves something of a mention, it should also be pointed at that a) there is no "Celtic gene", any more than an Anglophone one, and b) it seems that in many cases, the genes come from the <b>pre-</b>Celtic peoples of modern day England. This points to the bulk of the population being surprisingly static, yet absorbing new cultural influences, languages and rulers several times over in some cases. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 18:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking it would be nice if a knowledgeable individual could put up a chart showing how Brythonic languages became the modern languages of Welsh, Breton, and Cornish.

It'd just be nice to know, I think, how vowel sounds shifted and why certain names are the way they are...I wonder if I'm making my point clear or not?

<p>The modern Brythonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed British, Common Brythonic, Old Brythonic or Proto-Brythonic, which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic, which was possibly introduced to Great Britain from the middle second millennium BC (Hawkes, 1973).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this right? I haven't got access to Hawkes' book but I'm pretty sure this timing is about a thousand years out. It's generally considered that the 'Celtic' culture is an Iron Age culture and the Iron Age didn't reach Britain until about 700 BC. I wasn't sure if this was a mis-quote or if Hawkes actually said it. I've certainly never heard anything that puts Celtic influences this early in Britain. Halstatt culture didn't even start on the continent until about 1200 BC.</p>
