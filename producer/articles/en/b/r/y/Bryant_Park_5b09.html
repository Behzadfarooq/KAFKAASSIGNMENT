<p>While it was still a wilderness, New York's colonial governor <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Dongan_3cb7.html" title="Thomas Dongan">Thomas Dongan</a> designated the area now known as Bryant Park as a public space in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1686.html" title="1686">1686</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>'s troops crossed the area while retreating from the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Long_Island_0662.html" title="Battle of Long Island">Battle of Long Island</a> in 1776. Bryant Park was a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter%27s_field.html" title="Potter's field">potter's field</a> (a graveyard for the poor) from 1823 to 1840, when thousands of bodies were moved to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward%27s_Island_7278.html" title="Ward's Island">Ward's Island</a>.</p>
<p>The first park at this site opened in 1847 as Reservoir Square. It was named after its neighbor, the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croton_Distributing_Reservoir_c981.html" title="Croton Distributing Reservoir">Croton Distributing Reservoir</a>. In 1853, the <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhibition_of_the_Industry_of_All_Nations_cbe4.html" title="Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations">Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations</a> with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Crystal_Palace_53be.html" title="New York Crystal Palace">New York Crystal Palace</a>, with thousands of exhibitors, took place in the park.</p>
<p>The square was used for military drills during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, and was the site of some of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Draft_Riots_9364.html" title="New York Draft Riots">New York Draft Riots</a> of July 1863, when the Colored Orphan Asylum at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street was burned down.</p>
<p>In 1884, Reservoir Square was renamed Bryant Park, to honor the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Evening_Post_e48c.html" title="New York Evening Post">New York Evening Post</a></i> editor and <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionist.html" title="Abolitionist">abolitionist</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cullen_Bryant_bc1f.html" title="William Cullen Bryant">William Cullen Bryant</a>. In 1899, the Reservoir building was removed and construction of the New York Public Library building began. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrace_%28gardening%29.html" title="Terrace (gardening)">Terraces</a> public facilities, and <a href="../../../k/i/o/Kiosk.html" title="Kiosk">kiosks</a> were added to the park.</p>
<p>However the construction of the <a href="../../../i/r/t/IRT_Sixth_Avenue_Line_2573.html" title="IRT Sixth Avenue Line">Sixth Avenue Elevated</a> railway in 1878 had cast a literal and metaphorical shadow over the park, and by the 1930s the park had suffered neglect and was considered disreputable. The park was re-designed in 1933-1934 as a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_works.html" title="Public works">public works</a> project under the leadership of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Moses_343f.html" title="Robert Moses">Robert Moses</a>. The new park featured a great lawn, and also added hedges and later an iron fence in order to separate the park from the surrounding city streets. The park was temporarily degraded in the late 1930s by the tearing down of the El and the construction of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/IND_Sixth_Avenue_Line_0cee.html" title="IND Sixth Avenue Line">IND Sixth Avenue Line</a> subway.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, Bryant Park had been taken over by <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_dealer.html" title="Drug dealer">drug dealers</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitutes</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeless_people.html" title="Homeless people">homeless</a>. It was nicknamed "Needle Park" by some due to its brisk heroin trade, and was considered a "no-go zone" by ordinary citizens and visitors. From 1979 to 1983, a coordinated program of amenities, including a bookmarket, a flower market, cafes, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council and immediately brought new life to the park -- an effort continued over the succeeding years by The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, which had been founded in 1980 by a group of prominent New Yorkers, including members of the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_family.html" title="Rockefeller family">Rockefeller family</a>, to improve conditions in the park. In 1988, a privately funded re-design and restoration was begun by the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation under the leadership of Daniel A. Biederman, with the goal of opening up the park to the streets and encouraging activity within it.</p>
<p>In 1992, the new Bryant Park re-opened and was an instant and spectacular success, immediately attracting local workers and tourists to it.</p>

<p>Bryant Park now has a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Parisian</a> feel, and has been compared to <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jardin_du_Luxembourg_5f0a.html" title="Jardin du Luxembourg">Jardin du Luxembourg</a>. When re-opened the re-designed garden was planted as an English style perennial border in tones of whites, pinks, and blues. Three thousand movable green chairs and five hundred tables are available for sitting in the park.</p>
<p>On days when the weather is nice, Bryant Park is a popular spot for area office workers to eat lunch. Several dining spots are located in the park, including Bryant Park Grill, Bryant Park Café and 'wichcraft.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2002, the Bryant Park Wireless Network was launched, allowing free <a href="../../../w/i/f/WiFi_3bf5.html" title="WiFi">WiFi</a> internet access within the park. More than 50,000 users per year use this feature.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Fashion_Week_f784.html" title="New York Fashion Week">New York Fashion Week</a> is held in tents in Bryant Park each September and February.</p>
<p>On Monday evenings during the summer, <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a>, headquartered across the street from Bryant Park, presents the Bryant Park Summer Film Festival. Movies are projected onto a large screen and people sit on the lawn to watch. On Friday mornings during the summer, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Morning_America_4ee7.html" title="Good Morning America">Good Morning America</a></i> presents the Summer Concert Series. There is no admission charge for either event. Bryant Park also is host to multiple other programs and amenities: a carousel, petanque and knitting lessons, and concerts. A calendar of Summer events is published annually as well as a guide to the park's horticulture, published each Spring, Summer and Fall.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> have also utilized the park for free events; in September 2005 and May 2006 they hosted, with sponsor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_a2f8.html" title="Continental Airlines">Continental Airlines</a>, "Pinstripes in the Park". Like with the film festival, the game was projected on a large screen for fans to watch. Approximately 8000 fans showed up in 2005 to watch the Yankees play the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> and to collect autographs from former Yankee players.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation founded Fetes de Noel - a European style holiday market hosting over 100 shops (Produced by ID&amp;A, General Producer Itai Shoffman). The shops operate within Bryant Park from the day after Thanksgiving to New Years Day. The event was upgraded in the 2005-06 winter season when BPRC and ID&amp;A developed <i>The Pond at Bryant Park</i>, a temporary ice skating rink (sponsored by <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citi.html" title="Citi">Citi</a>) which is installed over the Bryant Park lawn from October to January. Admission is free if you bring your own skates, although there are skates available there to rent.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation was renamed the Bryant Park Corporation.</p>
