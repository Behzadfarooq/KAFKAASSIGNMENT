<p>Michelle, it is a clearly documented fact that Bryan Adams was in the band Sweeney Todd before his solo career. Now, you're claiming that's not true? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 15:18, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Hero, Thanks for your great contributions to the page! I work at BA's office in Canada and we have the facts here, and BA was in many bands before his career started. Highlighting a bar band he spent a few months in when he was 15 was by no means a milestone in his career, and if we agreed we would add the 5 other bar bands he was in! There are people that are continuely try to capitalise on his name with bootleg recordings who don't pay any of the musicians, so i hope you will respect the changes I've made to your addition. all the best. Michelle1</p>
<dl>
<dd>That may be so, however, Sweeney Todd are a band of some note, not simply a bar band, they are also a band he released an album with. To me, it seems that they should not be simply omitted from this article, since they are a significant part of his background and career. Also, you have not simply selectively removed mention of Sweeney Todd, you have completely reverted the edits I have made, deleting useful information in the process. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 22:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi Hero, As i said, I work for BA's office and there were many bands before BA started working on his own music and ALL of them were bar bands when BA worked in them. The information you added has been re-edited based on fact, for example he is still working with Jim Vallance and Mutt Lange today. I've kept many of the details you added and thought they were good additions. please keep adding things, and i look forward to your input. best,</p>
<p>Michelle1</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Michelle, the Vallance and Lange titles were only really a way to try and seperate eras in his career, those headings can be renamed, but I think they should remain in. If you wouldn't mind, could you explain your reasons for removing some of the following information, just so I'm clear:
<ul>
<li>The part about how he met Vallance</li>
<li>The part about Adams' change in vocal style</li>
<li>The part about Adams' parting of ways with Jim Vallance (I know they still work together, but this was the last time Adams and Vallance collaborated regularly, and on music that Adams would release himself)</li>
<li>The part about Adams' anticipated album.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, may I say again, that I believe Sweeney Todd is worthy of mention, since he recorded an album with them, he was part of that band and that band was part of his career, that album is still available in shops today. His part in it deserves some place in this article.</dd>

Dear Hero, You are obviously a big fan and have an interest in catagorising these time frames, but the bio doesn't need those headlines, it would be better to catagorise things from decade to decade.</p>
<ul>
<li>re: when he met Vallance, it is quite clear in the article when they met, and your thoughts on his vocal style are subjective.</li>
<li>re: Jim and BA working together, they still work regularly (four songs for the new album!).</li>
<li>re: new album. if you really think it's needed you can add something, but there is no real news other than it will probably be this year.</li>
<li>re: the band/album you keep mentioning. you have to understand this is absolutely not BA's work, is not in the shops and is only available as a bootleg on the internet. Lets drop that please.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again. You can always write to us on email if you like: info@bryanadams.com Michelle1</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michelle, that's what I meant, decade to decade seems fine to me.
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that my thoughts are so subjective; it is quite clear to hear on his first album and prior material that Adams sang in a much higher voice, and later, on You Want It - You Got It, he began singing in the "raspy" style he has used since. I believe that Jim Vallance even said something similar on his site. Your thoughts on this?</li>
<li>Great to hear that Jim and BA are working on songs for his new album, his work with Vallance is some of my favourite, but, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe this is the first time that BA has released a song written himself and Vallance since 'Waking Up The Neighbours'?</li>
<li>I think some info about the new album is a good idea, even if it's very little, it's better than nothing at all.</li>
<li>About the band I keep mentioning, I'm a bit confused at the problem we seem to be having, but the album I have is <i>not</i> a bootleg, I bought it last year in <a href="../../../h/m/v/HMV_faa8.html" title="HMV">HMV</a>, it's a genuine album. It's been repackaged as Sweeney Todd featuring Bryan Adams and was re-released in 2006, that's what the copyright date on the back says.</li>

<p>Dear Hero, I can absolutely assure you, it is an illegal bootleg and not an Adams recording. The bootleg you are refering to, has been packaged and re-packaged dozens of times to rip people like yourself off. The only offical releases of BA's work are with Universal Records, everything else is either a rip-off, and illegal download, or a bootleg recording. Michelle1</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't make sense; HMV is the biggest high street music retailer in the UK, they don't sell bootlegs. If it was a bootleg, why would it be copyrighted to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary_Records_a4aa.html" title="Sanctuary Records">Sanctuary Records</a>? And if it isn't a real record, how come one of the songs on it won a Juno award in 1977, and if Bryan Adams had nothing to do with the record, how come he accepted that award in 1977? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 20:02, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear Hero, If you bought it at HMV, and it has Bryan's name on the cover, then HMV sells bootlegs. End of story, but they can easily be dupped into selling any kind of recording, as they are just retailers. The information about the said recordings is listed in the discography under 'odd recordings' as are many of the other recordings he has done prior and during his career. All the best.

<dd>Since we don't seem to be able to come to a decisive conclusion to this dispute, I've be reading up on Wikipedia's <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Dispute resolution policies</a> and I think it would be appropriate to request a third opinion on this matter, so I've put a request for a third opinion on the matter. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 00:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I'm here to provide a third opinion. I'm not familiar with the work of Bryan Adams but I am familiar with bootlegs. For instance, System of a Down's Storaged Melodies. Before I had encountered this particular title, I had no idea that bootlegs existed, however they do, and they can be packaged very well in some cases. I do agree that a little more info is better though, especially if the band BA was in is quite notable. A person's beginnings can be what makes them successful. Hope that was of some help&#160;:-)</dd>

<p><b>Fourth opinion.</b> This is in response to a request for a <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">third opinion</a>, but it appears Seraphim Whipp beat me to the punch while I was still editing. I can't see any reason that the Sweeney Todd stuff should be left out. I would say that any band that produced an album sold at major retailers is not simply a "bar band," but moreover even a "bar band" that had a major musician such as Adams as a member would be worthy of note. If you want to suppress the Sweeney Todd album, Wikipedia is not the place to do it. Take it up with the producers and retailers. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 00:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since there appears to be a consensus here for keeping the information, I have warned Michelle1 about deleting the information again. Any new reasons for disagreement should be discussed here first. The previous reasons have been unconvincing, and appear to have more to do with irrelevant commercial motivations than what makes a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 11:13, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>i would like to enclose this information with links into the main body of the latest two paragraphs. would you or anyone have any obejection if the entry was thus:<br />
As an adolescent, he pursued his rock goals with single-minded fervor. He explained to Steve Pond from Rolling Stone Magazine: "In high school, I was too far into my music to even pay attention to girls." At the age of fifteen Adams quit school and used the money his parents had saved for his higher education to buy a grand piano. He joined bands like Shock and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweeney_Todd_%28band%29_0d64.html" title="Sweeney Todd (band)">Sweeney Todd</a> <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2heyxdgb8ol0~T1" class="external autonumber" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:2heyxdgb8ol0~T1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and played in nightclubs, supplementing his income by washing dishes, selling pet food, and working in record stores. A serendipitous meeting with drummer Jim Vallance in a Vancouver music store led to a song-writing partnership that continues to this day. As O'Hara from Macleans magazine phrased it, "Vallance was looking for a singer, Adams was looking for a route to musical respectability, and the two hit it off immediately." The pair began writing songs together and recording demonstration tapes.</p>

<dd>I have started with your suggested paragraph and synthesized the relevant information about Sweeney into it. I hope you will find this a useful compromise.

<dd>as much as I'd like to, no i'm not trying to remove the album. i don't know if you realise, but it's been in the discography all along with all of the other recordings BA has done outside of his own work and is represented perfectly in the AMG link provided. regarding the other link which i think needs removing; unless you have read the book yourself, i suggest it goes as a random source at the bottom of the page, as truely the other link does the job far more accurately. cut me some slack here, I know what I'm talking about!

<dl>
<dd>Similarly, recording with "Sweeney Todd" should not just be brushed off in the discography since it was Adams' first appearance with a Juno-award winning band! Your sterilization campaign is hurting the article; someone in your (putative) position should be a veritable gold mine of facts and accuracy. (You probably don't even remember when "Roxy Roller" was on the charts.) Adams' career goes back a good long way and this article should show the roots of his rise. No-one is going to take the time to improve the article if you inexplicably roll back what appear to me to be perfectly non-controversial edits.</dd>

<p>There is nothing sterilizing about putting things in the correct category and removing errors. His participation in work outside of his own, before and during his solo career, is listed in detail in the discography. BA doesn't have his own biography other than the photographic one he did with Andrew Catlin in the 90's. Everything else is completely unauthorized.

<dd>I'm off to the library on Monday to pick up more biographies. Surely fair and balanced discussion of someone's life is available in other than the person's autobiography. The Saidman biography (which I've just skimmed a couple of pages) suggests that Bryan Adams' publicity department should have the word "Security" printed on the door. I begin to see why. --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 17:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know it's a bit more work, but has anyone considered calling the Kingston public library and see what the local newspaper(s) birth announcements are for November 1959? (I don't know if they did that kind of thing back then). If there is a birth announcement for Bryan, AND if there is no middle name in the announcement, then that can pretty much close the argument. Also... even more work would be to see if it is possible to get the actual government birth record from the Ontario gov't... due to privacy &amp; identity theft concerns, someone may actually have to walk into a gov't office to do that... unfortunately, I'm several provinces West of Ontario, so I am unable to do that. 68.146.251.64 15:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And yet print references, equally authoritative, give the middle name as "Guy". Surely not everyone born on Nov. 5 gets the middle name "Guy", even if they do have English parents. See the Saidman biography I've just added and also the Canadian Encyclopedia. So,though he no longer <i>uses</i> the middle name ( a lot of performers don't use their full or birth names), he from all appearences was given the name "Guy". --<a href="../../../w/t/s/User%7EWtshymanski_3fd9.html" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> 16:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is enquiry and there is hearsay. Adams has never used a middle name on anything he has ever recorded. There are sites on the net that speculate that he may have a middle name, but there isn't a site or a reference that can actually substantiate the claim.Michelle1 22:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There does seem to be a great deal of evidence to support the fact that Adams' middle name is guy. In fact, I once heard him say that it was Guy in an interview on television.

<dd>I have yet to see a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that states that he does not have a middle name. No, sources that omit the middle name are not evidence that there is no middle name. Some of the sources provided (such as IMDB) very seldom use the middle name unless it is part of how the person publicizes themselves. A person claiming to work for Bryan Adams is not a reliable source either, although if it were publicly put on his official web site <i>explicitly</i> that there was no middle name I would accept it. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 01:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there is a statement put on his official web site that he has no middle name, then I would consider that conclusive in the absence of more compelling evidence that he does. Please note that there is a difference between a statement on an official web site, and a statement from someone claiming to work for Bryan Adams. The former is easily verifiable by anyone and the latter is not. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 16:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No offence Michelle1, but if you do indeed work for Bryan Adams, then it is clear it's simply you posting that message. It's the exact same thing as you posting here that he doesn't have a middle name. Therefore, and this is just personally, I don't count that as valid evidence.

<dd>I agree with Grouse. Without actually looking at BA's passport or birth certificate, I think this is about as official as it's going to get, however I do think that all this is worth mentioning in the trivia section, since it would seem to be a common myth and even exaggerated at times (strangely) by BA himself. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 15:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>YES! A mention in a trivia section is an excellent suggestion. Perhaps as a similar analogy: I was called "Tommy" in the 1960s...however I have never used "Tommy" professionally or on my resume or on my passport. A few people (mainly friends who knew me in the 1960s or my sister if she wants to annoy me&#160;:-) still call me by "Tommy" and I actually answer them. If I had a Wikipedia article (hahaha), I would consider a mention of "Tommy" in a "Trivia" section to be appropriate. another example: (although insulting), if a bunch of people also had a nickname of "Bonehead" for me (maybe all the people in my Archaeology/Anthropology classes where we excavated bones), I might consider that to be appropriate Trivia also even if my real name doesn't have any relation to "Bonehead" and I never really agreed to be called "Bonehead". <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Thomas Dzubin</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/z/u/User_talk%7EDzubint_af05.html" title="User talk:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sub> 15:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think two sources counts as "many sources," and I wouldn't say that "some sources" would be notable enough for inclusion.

So after that and also looking at some of the other reverts that you've done, I don't see any point in editing the article any more and I've moved on (except for this talk page) to editing other articles. Now, you may argue that you reverted my edits because I didn't provide <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references/cites</a>, which is certainly a good argument, however on the flip side, many of your edit additions don't provide detailed <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references/cites</a> either...but which you may claim you don't need because you work for Bryan Adams management...but if you take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> guideline, again I quote: "avoid editing articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with" Please note that personally, I <i>do</i> believe you are editing <i>mostly</i> in good faith, and I've certainly learned many tidbits of information from your edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Summer_of_%2769&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77950952" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Summer_of_%2769&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77950952" rel="nofollow">like this one</a>), but you may also check the Wikipedia <b>policy</b> on consensus at <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONS_36b2.html" title="WP:CONS">WP:CONS</a>. ...Anyway, that's my thoughts this sunny (where I am) Friday morning. <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Thomas Dzubin</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/z/u/User_talk%7EDzubint_af05.html" title="User talk:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sub> 14:23, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Thomas, If you or anyone here have a problem with the two years of submissions I've made here, then take them out, I'm ok with that. My view point has always been clear on what I have added and subtracted; to give accurate information and put things in the correct places. Personally i don't like the way the information or the links that have been added lately as i feel they are repeated already in the discography, and furthermore it gives undue attention to work which has been repeatedly sold as BA's work and just isn't. If we want to get into techicalities, we could add every single studio session from his pre-17 years as a studio singer to this page, which would be accurate, but clearly work for hire isn't what BA is about.

I was not commenting on the <i>content</i> of the "two years of submissions".

When contested, and back up by other sources, some form of consensus needs to be reached to prevent perpetual-check-type edit warring that just ends up in a protected article and a slew of 3RR blocks <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" class="image" title="image:smile.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/2/26/Smile.png" alt="image:smile.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" /></a>. Discussions on talk pages are GREAT for working these kinds of things out between passionate and dedicated editors. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had a thought, I think Adams' backing band possibly deserves its own section in this article. He doesn't simply use session musicians when performing live as many solo artists do, Adams has been with his band (or at least with Curry and Scott) for about 20 years. In some ways, Bryan Adams is more like a band than a solo artist, so perhaps it deserves its own section. Thoughts on this? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 16:04, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSTARD_2edf.html#Titles_and_section_headings" title="WP:MUSTARD">WP:MUSTARD#Titles and section headings</a> specifies that "In most cases, backing bands do not need their own articles; there are exceptions, such as The Wailers and E Street Band." So the place for information about the band would be in this article as you are suggesting rather than in a new one. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 16:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although Michelle1's edits are certainly done in good faith ( <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSUME_31db.html" title="WP:ASSUME">WP:ASSUME</a>), I <b>do</b> wonder about the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Wikipedia conflict of interest</a> guideline since she seems to be directly connected to Bryan Adams (website manager? publicist? ). I realize that it is just a <i>guideline</i> and not Wikipedia policy, but the part that jumps out at me is:<br />
<b>"avoid editing articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with"</b><br />
I stay away from editing certain articles or making certain edits because I don't have a "safe distance" from the subject matter. (although I did create an article about someone notable who I did have one date with in the 1980s, I felt my distance on that one was far enough to avoid <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>) <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Thomas Dzubin</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/z/u/User_talk%7EDzubint_af05.html" title="User talk:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sub> 16:50, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(and as a side note, my life is not really enhanced or lessened knowing Bryan Adams middle name, if he has one, or if he played in Sweeney Todd or not... but what I do care about more is <a href="../../../a/b/o/WP%7EAbout_8480.html" title="WP:About">Wikipedia is a collaborative free web encyclopedia that has external references for things mentioned it that I can look up if I need to</a>) If there are multiple external reliable references about something, then it should be in Wikipedia (and I don't mean "I have seen a passport" since that is not verifiable). <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Thomas Dzubin</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/z/u/User_talk%7EDzubint_af05.html" title="User talk:Dzubint"><font color="#8C8C8C"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sub> 16:50, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>your point of maintaining impartiality is a good one. for the most part, I've tried my best to back up the entries with links to other pages on the internet and will continue to do so. the discussion over the group was unfortunate one, as I felt, and still feel strongly that odd recordings outside of his own solo work were best left in the discography.

<p>I came looking for the People from BC cat, whatever it's properly called....and OK, OK, so he was born in Kingston. Consensus is he's <i>from</i> North Vancouver; didn't want to add that pending ndrestanding the "people-from categories" bt birthplace ain't the only defining parameter.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:40, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
