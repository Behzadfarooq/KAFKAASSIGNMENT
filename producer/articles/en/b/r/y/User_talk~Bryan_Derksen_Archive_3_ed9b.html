Hey Bryan; I've started a new thread over at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Elements_3d7a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elements">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elements</a> about a concept for nav bars and locator maps.

<p>Why did you remove the text centering from the table of line-ending characters in the <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_d2cd.html" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> entry, and replace it with cellpadding/cellspacing attributes? You should note that these table-level attributes have no effect if the user has chosen a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">skin/stylesheet</a> like Cologne Blue, which specifies them via CSS properties at the td level. -- <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Just personal aesthetics, I guess; I find tables more readable in general when the text all starts at the same spot, whereas centered text makes my eyes go jagged when I scan down the column. The cellspacing/padding attributes are ones which I add to virtually all the tables I edit, also for aesthetic reasons (and if they're overridden, that's fine; that's what style sheets are for). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>Bryan: I'm working on developing sep11.wikipedia.org. Until it's ready, I would appreciate it if you didn't delete the Memoriam page. Your help is welcome. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It hasn't been deleted, copies of the page are stored in both the page's history <i>and</i> on the meta site. When sep11.wikipedia.org is ready, it will be trivial to retrieve this for it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe you know what I'm talking about when I said "delete".</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but I was glad it was finally gone from Wikipedia and the fact that its contents were still accessible if and when someone wanted to make it available elsewhere was good enough IMO.</dd>
</dl>
<p>sep11: doesn't work fine. It has broken links. It's not fully set up. The blue background needs to be changed. Etc. It's still, as they say, in beta. But now that there are clean redirects the primary detriment to user experience has been removed.

<p>Hi Brian, Maverick149 thought you would like to knwo about this bug (I also filed a bug report)</p>
<p>See screendump <a href="http://members.ams.chello.nl/epzachte/Temp/ScrPrint.gif" class="external text" title="http://members.ams.chello.nl/epzachte/Temp/ScrPrint.gif" rel="nofollow">ScrPrint.gif</a></p>
<p>Explorer renders somes pages in a weird way.</p>
<p>Mav says the Periodic Table should always fit on the screen (Table width = 100%)</p>
<p>It does not in Explorer 5.5. and 6.</p>
<p>What is even more horrid: when I scroll to the right the tabIe moves underneath the menu, showing both intermingled (see screen dump)</p>
<p>I've seen this now on three PC's: Win2000 MSIE 5.5 Win98 MSIE 5.5 (screen dump) lowres screen Win XP MSIE 6 hires screen</p>
<p>The effect occurred on other pages too. Even if it is an Explorer issue only, some 90% or more of the Wikipedians probably use Explorer, at least half of them 5.5 or higher.</p>

<p>the text doesnt shrink for me <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 06:45 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you make the table wider and the total width of the screen stays the same, the space available beside it gets narrower. That's only part of the problem, though. If the factsheet template changes, then I've got to go around and update all of the other planets and moons that have them as well; before I go to all that trouble, I insist on being convinced that it's a good idea. Please take this up over on Talk:Solar system/Factsheet template.</dd>
</dl>
<p>well id love to take it up on that talk page but as far as i can tell you and I are the one ones reading it. now if you want, you could have the table be <b>above</b> the text instead of beside it. Frankly, I never liked having the damn boxes besides the text to begin with. I think having to update the other stuff is a pretty lame excuse since thats what im trying to do...<a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 06:53 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jeronimo, Maveric, and Fonzy have all contributed significantly to the talk page and to the template, and Maveric has been active there during the past hour or so while this kerfuffle has blown up. As for what you think about the table design, why should I care if you're not willing to work to convice me in a reasonable manner? I can revert stuff just as easily as you can, regardless of whether you think my excuse is "lame", and will continue to do so until you show me why I shouldn't. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Your excuse is lame! You don't want me to update the Earth page because then Id have to update all the pages? What the hell concern is it of yours if I go through and update all the pages?</p>
<dl>
<dd>what concern is it of yours if I go through and revert all of them?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You still haven't explained what your problem is with the damn table except that you didn't make it. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 07:04 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I <i>have</i> explained what my problem is, and none of the reasons I gave were "I didn't make it" (in fact, the current template has a number of sections and details which other folks added to it, so I didn't make all of the current one either). If you are interested in a more detailed discussion, there's a certain talk: page I've been suggesting where we could do that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, saying that my excuses are lame is a lame way to have a debate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hey Bryan. I am discussing on the talk page. But where are you? You haven't given any reason whats wrong with my table except you are using a substandard and atypical resolution. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 07:18 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been trying, but I've been getting edit conflicts every time I try to save for the past five minutes or so. Slow down a bit.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>So why doesn't anybody add some chatrooms? That would save a lot of trouble and time. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 07:28 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>And I'd just like to point out that basically, I've <b>never</b>, had an issue with someone modifying or adapting my text. It's only when I add new info that nobody disputes <b>BUT GODDAMN FUCKING EVERYTHING GETS REVERTED</b> because somebody doesn't like one minor point. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 07:29 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>What was with the changes to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>? I notice Lir changed Cm to M in one place, and removed &lt;sup&gt; tags within a link, changing the link. I was about to check the additions when you reverted it. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">--KQ</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, that last one was just a straight reversion-to-previous-version, assuming that Lir had only gone and replaced the table again. I'll check the diff for anything that should have been merged instead. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just double-checked, and as I'd surmised Lir's most recent change was just a replacement of the table again. No other changes were undone in the reversion. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>Well wahts the problem with it now? I can't fix something if I don't know what you think is wrong with it <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 07:47 Nov 12, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been telling you what I think over on the template talk page. You've been ignoring it completely, as far as I can tell. Why shouldn't I ignore you right back? This is getting boring. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>ring current needs its own page. Whether to describe Earth's ring current on the van allen page or ring current is another question_I tend to see the ring current as NOT being part of the van allen belts as they are two van allen belts, inner and outer, and the outer belt is surrounded by the ring current. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 00:48 Nov 13, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Bryan,</p>
<p>The Factsheet is really a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a>, no? It would be great to move the Factsheet and its talk page to a WikiProject page. What do you think is a good title? Either <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Astronomical_Objects_cc3d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical Objects">Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical Objects</a> or Wikipedia:WikiProject Heavenly Bodies would work in a pinch but we could probably come up with a better name (and then link it on the WikiProject page and under the Astronomy heading at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_by_fields_of_interest_afb2.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians by fields of interest">Wikipedia:Wikipedians by fields of interest</a>. Ideas? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hadn't really thought about it, but I guess it is.&#160;:) If this were to be put under the heading of Heavenly Bodies I'd probably giggle every time I thought about it, so my vote's for Astronomical Objects. I'll have to look at the other WikiProject pages to get some idea of what's involved in one of these before I think of anything else to change, however. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>On a similar line, I want to do a WikiProjectette about the 88 constellations. I've already started doing it on the French wiki, and I've done <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28constellation%29.html" title="Andromeda (constellation)">Andromeda (constellation)</a> here. I would like your view on disambiguation (Mav pointed me to you on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAndromeda_78aa.html" title="Talk:Andromeda">Talk:Andromeda</a>.) I would like to make <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda.html" title="Andromeda">Andromeda</a> a disambiguation page, moving the current article to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28mythology%29.html" title="Andromeda (mythology)">Andromeda (mythology)</a>, and so do with the other constellations that are named after mythological characters, much as has been done for other objects (see <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede.html" title="Ganymede">Ganymede</a> for an example).

<p>Hi Bryan. I thought you might be interested in the editing that's currently going on in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac.html" title="Zodiac">zodiac</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horoscope.html" title="Horoscope">horoscope</a>. If you want to see something really funny but really sad, check out the editing history of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mercado_fe07.html" title="Walter Mercado">Walter Mercado</a>. I've started a discussion on the village pump about this. It's very discouraging to see how the true believers in astrology have undone your work on <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac.html" title="Zodiac">zodiac</a> and tried to turn it into a one-sided, credulous "how-to" article. Something similar has happened with <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mercado_fe07.html" title="Walter Mercado">Walter Mercado</a> -- repeated attempts to change the article to a neutral point of view, followed by reversions to the biased version later. Well, I'd appreciate any help I could get, because it takes a lot of energy to argue and argue, and edit and edit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bryan, thanks for the very nice formatting change to my two pics in the <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opal.html" title="Opal">opal</a> article. They certainly look a lot smarter embeded in the text. Is there any way to avoid the use of br's to adjust the length of each caption line? It seems that if I want to insert or remove text in the caption I have to readjust all the br's.<br />
Thanks again, <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Arpingstone</a> 08:31 Feb 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it should be possible to tell the tables to only be as wide as the images they contain, and then the text will automatically reformat itself to fit. However, this requires that you know how big the images are in pixels. I was just about to head off to bed right now, but I've got a bunch of time tomorrow so I'll fiddle around with it and see what I can do. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<dd>Well, I guess I'm really bad at leaving Wikipedia when there's work to be done.&#160;:) I just added the width="250" attribute to tell the tables to be 250 pixels wide, and removed the line break tags, and that seems to have worked out okay.

<p>Hi Bryan. I contributed an article under "Ferdowsi", and I noticed that you deleted the first two paragraphs from it and moved the rest under <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahnameh.html" title="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>.</p>
<p>While I think the Shahnameh page that you have created serves well for the book itself, I kinda feel all my efforts for the Author (Ferdowsi) were thrown into a bit bucket. What ever happened to my original article and how can I do this right? Thanks. --<a href="../../../k/1/_/User%7EK1_d397.html" title="User:K1">Keyvan</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't delete anything, I just split the article into two; one for Ferdowsi and one for Shahnameh. I felt that the bulk of the Ferdowsi article you wrote was actually focused on the book, and would be better suited standing on its own under that title.</dd>

<dd>To get at material from older revisions of an article, click on the "Older versions" link at the top of the page and then select the one with the stuff you want in it. You can then copy and paste material from there into the current revision of the article, to restore stuff that was deleted. However, in this case, it looks like a merge is required since there was already an article on this person over at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdosi.html" title="Ferdosi">Ferdosi</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>Hi Bryan, there are literally <b>hundreds</b> of articles in Wikipedia comparing a movie with the book on which it is based (there are very few exceptions such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boys_from_Brazil_0a6d.html" title="The Boys from Brazil">The Boys from Brazil</a></i>, where there are two separate entries). As far as <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Mildred_Pierce_f486.html" title="Mildred Pierce">Mildred Pierce</a></i> is concerned, the comparison of the two was one of the major points of the former article, which you split up into two parts. Each of these new articles lacks information contained in the other one. In addition, you created a disambiguation page where none was needed before. My question is short and simple: Why? --<a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 19:50 24 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bryan, I saw some of your discussion with <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocu_0014.html" title="User:Docu">User:Docu</a> which has now been moved to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia_talk%7EHow_to_use_tables_1006.html" title="Wikipedia talk:How to use tables">Wikipedia talk:How to use tables</a>. As I am the principal author (to date) of the table examples, I can understand where you're coming from about the lack of closing tags. I prefer to always use closing tags, but according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" rel="nofollow">HTML 4.01 specification</a>, they are indeed optional (and always have been). In <a href="../../../x/h/t/XHTML_2462.html" title="XHTML">XHTML</a> and <a href="../../../x/m/l/XML_3501.html" title="XML">XML</a> they are a requirement. For Wikipedia articles, it may be better to leave off the optional closing tags to make editing easier, especially for newbies. As you probably know, it is often the case that a table is being used inappropriately in the first place. Converting those to lists or another appropriate structure may benefit both readability and editability.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any input or contributions you may have to the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_use_tables_519d.html" title="Wikipedia:How to use tables">Wikipedia:How to use tables</a> article.

<dd>Hmph. Guess I should stop my mad quest to fix all the tables after all, then.&#160;:) I'll pop over and see what I can add to the discussion. I'm hoping that Wikipedia will move in the direction of XHTML someday, so that MathML support can be more easily added, but I suppose that will require some sort of built-in translation for table code either way. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:24 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree! It'd be nice to see Wikipedia move to XHTML (or even XML) someday, but it'd be a bit harder to stay valid with those, since they are stricter than the loose HTML DTD used now. As someone pointed out to me, we can pretty easily fix closing-tag issues with a conversion script, if/when that day comes. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 22:47 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a factoid that I read in an article about <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetar.html" title="Magnetar">magnetars</a>, I think it was in a recent Scientific American. As I recall, that was the maximum field strength that a neutron star was calculated to be capable of holding, and that nothing more capable than neutron stars were known - so it's a practical limit, rather than a theoretical one. I'd have to go back and find that article again to say more, I'll search tonight when I get home. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

<p>Thanks. Excuse me if I don't respond quickly next time, but I shall be away from Wikipedia for a few days. -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here's what the article says. "An upper limit to neutron-star magentism is about 10<sup>17</sup> gauss; beyond this limit, the fluid inside the star would tend to mix and the field would dissipate. No known objects in the universe can generate and maintain fields stronger than this level." The fluid-mixing thing is in reference to the convection currents inside a neutron star that generate a dynamo effect. This is from the February 2003 issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Right off the bat, my face is red; the article uses gauss throuhout instead of Tesla, so all the neutron-star-related values I put into the Tesla article are off by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>. I'll fix that immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Scientific American article has a couple of other interesting factoids about extreme magnetism. It mentions the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_electrodynamic_threshold.html" title="Quantum electrodynamic threshold">quantum electrodynamic threshold</a> of 4×10<sup>13</sup> gauss, above which X-ray photons freely split in two or merge together. Polarized light waves change wavelength when they enter very strong magnetic fields, and the scattering of photons by electrons or other charged particles is suppressed if the magnetic field prevents the charged particle from accelerating in the direction it needs to. Fields above 10<sup>9</sup> gauss squeeze electron orbitals into cigar shapes; in a 10<sup>14</sup> gauss field a hydrogen atom becomes 200 times narrower.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't know if you want to incorporate any of these, but if you want to here they are.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. I put a short note in <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesla.html" title="Tesla">tesla</a> about the upper limit. I'll wait on the other stuff until I'm feeling more ambitious&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></p>

<p>This isn't really a big deal, but regarding your edit to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harp.html" title="Harp">harp</a> just now - is there really anything wrong with using an apostrophe when pluralising single letters? Every style guide I've looked at (which admittedly isn't many) says that it's acceptable, or even desireable, to use an apostrophe in this case. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If there's a style guide that covers that specific situation, then that's probably the correct way to do it. I was operating only under the general guideline that apostrophized s is only used as an abbreviation of "is" and as a possessive. I see incorrect apostrophized s everywhere these days and it grates on me, so I get a bit trigger-happy. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the AP style guide says to use an apostrophe on plurals of single letters, but not on plurals of multiple letter abbreviations, and somebody's told me that Chicago says to use apostrophes on lower case single letters, but not upper case. The idea is to avoid ambiguity between multiple letter As and the word "as", for example. It's not a big deal, as I say. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>"beam-powered propulsion" is a very general term. It covers lightcraft, solar sails, magsails, and possibly other types of ship as well.

<p>Hello! Thanks for the brave move of moving Arpad (etc) into Árpád.

<dl>
<dd>It's not a problem, fortunately, because thanks to redirects linking <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpad.html" title="Arpad">Arpad</a> still works just fine. Since this redirect is automatically created when a page is moved using the "move this page" function, one normally doesn't have to do anything to fix other page's references. The only exception that comes to mind is when there are already redirects pointing to the original location; since redirects only go one step (to prevent loops from forming) double redirects need to be updated. I've just checked (via the "what links here" function) and there are no double redirects for Arpad, so everything looks to be in order to me. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:49, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to coordinate w/ you re IFF article: you may have noticed that i created one despite the one you worked on, and someone collapsed "yours" into "mine". I have two concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>The more substantial history got disconnected from the article.</li>
<li>The unofficial title is the article and the official is the redirect.</li>
<li>The old article title is misleadingly described</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I think i know how to repair #1, and would like the practice; if you don't follow what i'm talking abt, let's discuss.</li>
<li>As to #2:
<ul>
<li>IMO, the WP MoS recommendation <i>should</i> be no punctuation in article titles except hyphen, paren, &amp; apostrophe; but include redirects to WP-std name where an outside standard or other common usage says otherwise</li>
<li>IMO, what it should be is irrelevant if cases like this have been anticipated in a previous consensus</li>
<li>IMO, #1 &amp; #2 need to be corrected at the same time, not piecemeal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>#3 is natural to fix as part of the above. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a> 07:50, 2003 Nov 18 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It looks like my only contribution to that article was to add a link and to remove a stray HTML tag that had no real effect on the article's display. I know nothing about how IFF works or anything like that, I probably just came across the article at random one day.
