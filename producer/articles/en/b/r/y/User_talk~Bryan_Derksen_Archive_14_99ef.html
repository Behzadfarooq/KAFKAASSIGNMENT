<h2><span class="mw-headline">goa'uld ring transporter</span></h2>
<p>they werent created by the goa'uld, so, why put them there? who cares if they just took over the usage and started producing them? it is NOT goa'uld technology, and thats what the page is about, goa'uld tech... if you put it under, say, "Technology the Goa'uld have stolen", then, sure, maybe as a reference then. cause we all know the goa'uld steal most of their technology, it has been said multiple times... <a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 18:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They weren't created by the Goa'uld, but they are now the only race manufacturing them (and also perhaps the Tok'ra) and pretty much the exclusive current users. IMO that's a perefectly reasonable justification for mentioning them there. I suspect most casual viewers of the show wouldn't even know the ring transporters weren't Goa'uld-originated. If one were to rigidly exclude "copied" technology like this, then <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri_technology.html#Naquahdah_generator" title="Tau'ri technology">Tau'ri technology#Naquahdah generator</a> would also seem to be in violation - it's Orbanian technology. The X-301 should also probably go, the Tau'ri didn't even build all of the <i>components</i> for that themselves. Anyway, when I restored the ring transporters to the Goa'uld technology list I also added a note explicitly pointing out its non-Goa'uld origin. Some of the other entries could use similar notes, I notice that the Sarcophagus doesn't mention <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_healing_device.html" title="Ancient healing device">Ancient healing device</a> for example. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>because the sarcophagus was developed from the ancient healing device, whereas the ring transporter has not undergo any change at all. the ring transporter is still the same design, etc, that the ancients used. the orbanian design was different from the tau'ri one, but yes, it is in violation... maybe "Tau'ri design naquahdah generator", because it is NOT tau'ri tech, only the design... but i suppose the mach 2 would be, because they engineered it to be 600% more effective then the original... something the orbanian people couldnt do... the x-301 is experimental, the fact that they added different components means that they were trying to modify it... which they failed with the 301... its a hybrid, but it led to the 302... just like taking an idea, transforming it, and making it your own... -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 00:58, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This all seems like excessive hair-splitting to me. It's all well and good to have detailed descriptions clarifying these technologies' origins within the show, but we shouldn't go so far as to make the article's layout or contents violate expectations in a non-obvious way. People who are reading about Goa'uld technology are naturally going to expect ring transporters to be mentioned since Goa'uld use and manufacture them so extensively. In computer programming terms this is the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_least_astonishment.html" title="Principle of least astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>. If we don't mention ring transporters under Goa'uld technology I expect there will be an endless stream of people such as myself coming to "correct" the "omission". <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:46, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so that you know: by using [[Category:The Elder Scrolls regions&lt;noinclude&gt;| &lt;/noiclude&gt;]] instead of &lt;includeonly&gt;[[Category:The Elder Scrolls regions]]&lt;/includeonly&gt;, the template is sorted to the top of the corresponding category with every other article that icludes it sorted normally.

<dd>I know, I was deliberately removing that feature. It was a clever approach but those categories are intended for articles in the main article namespace and templates are not articles so shouldn't have been in there at all. Templates are an "under the hood" component of Wikipedia that are used to construct Wikipedia content but are not the sort of thing a reader needs to go to directly. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:43, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, a few days ago, I spent hours researching and writing <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_Resequencer_94d3.html" title="DNA Resequencer">DNA Resequencer</a>. I am almost the sole author of the article. However, I had had very little expirence with refs and didn't know how to cite properly. Using another article, I managed to get 80 cites done. However, many were redundant, and i didn't know how to do the a,b,c, thing. I saw that you went in and fixed the only part of the article that wasn't perfect, the refs. Thank you very much for that. However, there were 3 messages at the bottom which said that the cite wasn't done properly. After expirmenting for a long time, I fixed two of them, however, I don't know what is wrong with the 3rd. I would appericiate it if you would fix ref 30. Also, did I fix the others correctly? Thanks. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 03:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't actually read the text all that closely as I worked, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.&#160;:) The "Other fictional examples of genetic advancement" section doesn't look like it's going to work well, IMO. As it stands now the three examples it gives are rather sparse and random; there are probably thousands and thousands of examples of "genetic advancement" in fiction so picking just a few will be difficult. It might be better to create an article specifically about this sort of thing (genetic enhancement in fiction, perhaps?) so that it can be handled with as much depth as it deserves and just have a "see also" in the genetic resequencer article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:07, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm. Featured Article status is pretty demanding, I suspect it'll still have trouble making it as it is right now.

Since it's been brought up as a point of discussion, it is always nice to leave a note on the discussion pages when converting from one style to another. I don't plan on reverting the changes, as I think that cite.php has a lot going for it. Rather, I intend to work to see more variability in its implementation — it's quite hard to edit the source code on well-referenced medical articles with the length of citations that the code uses within the text! Any support that you can give me (I intend to bring it up on the appropriate page later today) in giving us choices (ie full reference at bottom of page with in-line anchor) would be appreciated!

<dd>Not sure what sort of note would be useful in this case, though - I came, I saw, I converted. There were no broken links whose repair wasn't obvious to the layman, the references on those two articles were very well maintained. In one way it does make it more complicated editing articles with the citation text embedded in it, but IMO in others it makes it far easier; there are no longer any issues with having to manually maintain the numbering of the references, moving text around or adding new references is trivially easy, and there are never any hard-to-spot broken reference links introduced by subtle typos. One suggestion I might make to make it easier to read and edit the source code with the refs embedded would be to use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">cite journal</a>}} template instead of just raw text, I've found it easier to differentiate reference text from article text when it's embeded in a template like that (and it has the added benefit of ensuring standardized reference formatting accross Wikipedia). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:32, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally agree that in every way but one cite.php is superior and I really like the way it looks and works. It solves all of the problems that I've had in the past with the referencing systems. However, the difficulty that it creates with the page source is so irritating that I really find it hard to work with. I am not a fan of the cite journal template - it's much more tedious to complete than a pubmed cut and paste. I do see your point about ease of reading, though articles with frequent citations may have mere words or sentences between citations and having large blocks of space make source code reading difficult. Anyway, I would just love to have the option within cite.php to place the reference list at the bottom and put a note on the project page. Seeing as how there haven't been responses to other such inquiries on that page, do you have any idea of other ways to address this desire?

<dd>Oh, another idea comes to mind for making heavily-referenced source code more readable; insert a single line break before and after each set of ref tags. When the article source is rendered it won't cause a paragraph break, but it could make the beginning and end of ref blocks more noticeable in the source code. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:05, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And one other idea - you say you're not a fan of the cite journal template because it's tedious to fill out, but would you like it a little better if some wikignome whose attention has been drawn to the articles in question were to take the cut and pasted references and do all the tedious templating for you?&#160;:) I just did a couple of {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}s on <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_sclerosis.html" title="Multiple sclerosis">Multiple sclerosis</a> this morning to clear up the numbering problem mentioned in the talk page there, considering the other journal references already have all their detailed information in place it would be no big extra trouble for me to go through the rest of the references and put cite journal markup in place as well.

<dd>Haha, I can think of a hundred better ways to spend your time than that! I understand it's a style/standardization issue, but the cite journal template doesn't affect the outcome of the finished product so it makes more sense for me to try the line break and just suck it up! Plus, I'm sure I could just write a word macro to convert them all automatically if it were really necessary.

<dd>I think it's fine keeping the references within the article. There aren't that many for an article of this size, especially not compared to some of the more controversial articles I've seen, and they're tucked away unintrusively at the bottom. And the new cite.php reference markup makes it quite easy to maintain compared to the old template-based mechanism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">various edits</span></h2>
<p>Your edits to references/notes in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_McKean_7b30.html" title="Thomas McKean">Thomas McKean</a> are appreciated, especially since I've learned there's something new and better in the way of doing references, and will use it in the future. However, I would ask you to give some thought to making changes to the nav boxes and succession boxes as you have.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The "standard" governor navbox you have inserted is a modification made a couple of months ago to the navbox you found. In fact the one you replaced is the orginal. Although I cannot convince the editor who redesigned it of the shortcomings of his design, there is no reason to accept it as a standard. Neither is there any reason to have major revert wars over them as they both convey the same information, one is just missing an unnecessary flag, and one is in alpha order.</li>
<li>2) The state navbox you removed is intended to be a partner to the office specific navbox. Most readers of this stuff, I believe, are looking around for related items as well, and its intent is to help them. I have worked hard to try and design a small clean looking box to accomplish that. I would ask you to take another look at it in that light and consider its usefulness to the reader seeking other information on, say, Delaware government, when reading a Delaware biography.</li>
<li>3) I am using the succession box design from the Succession Box standard project: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Succession_Box_Standardization_48b2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization">Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization</a>. In fact, it fixes some real programming problems in the "start box" template, in the wrapping of data. It is not well known, but should be, and I hope you will take a look at it.</li>
<li>4) Regarding the location of succession boxes, you seem to have accepted the credo that these boxes always have to go at the VERY end of an article. This is not written anywhere, and IMO does not make any sense. Like a picture they should go where they are most useful. In biographies, I think that's after narrative part of the article, but before other almanac like information and references. No one is going to scroll down to the end of a long article to find this information, so it might as well not be there. I think that's why you often see it duplicated in the infobox, which (properly) is always at the top of the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have given a great deal of thought to these issues over many months, and have not casually tossed them out. I would ask that you not casually reject them because they are variations on what most are doing or what you are used to. Frankly, again IMHO, the designs in nav boxes and succession boxes is way out of control; many look simply awful, often including way too much information, unsymmetrical images, or strange sizes. Discussing changes is a mind numbing task, because it is often impossible to convince anyone, myself included, in these discussions. People need to see and experience the variation before they can let down their defenses and appreciate them. I'm simply trying to present a few slight variations on the norm to make the product better. Your thoughtful consideration of all this is much appreciated. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilltim_7d55.html" title="User:Stilltim">stilltim</a> 11:23, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, opinions on how things look are in the eye of the beholder. I am a big fan of standardization (I'll definitely look at that succession box link you mention), but you're using it as a very selective argument here IMO. I'll address some specifics:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1) If the only issue here is cosmetic, as it appears, then IMO it's not a good idea to subst the template. We'd end up with all sorts of different-looking navboxes according to the varying tastes of whoever edits each bio article, which defeats part of the purpose of a standard template - it should be easy for someone to get used to seeing the navbox and click around quickly using it. Furthermore, it means that if there's a substansive informational change to the template (a new governor is elected) then we have to somehow locate and manually update <i>every</i> instance where the template was used - without the advantage of a whatlinkshere function to find them. If you really don't like the current design of the navbox, I suggest instead of not using it you go around trying to gather supporters to help argue for changing it. If you can't find enough people who agree with your view to make a difference, well, unfortunately we can't all get what we want all the time - Wikipedia is a collaborative effort.</li>
<li>2) I don't feel particularly strongly on this, but there was a whole page full of navboxes at the bottom and that seemed excessive. Do we really need {{<a href="../../../p/e/n/Template%7EPennsylvania_a1bf.html" title="Template:Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>}} at the bottom of every single article that has anything to do with Pennsylvania? I feel such general boxes are only warranted on the "main" articles on the subject.</li>
<li>3) Will take a look at that project. I've gone on major succession box adding sprees in the past, if there's a new standard with more support than the old one I'll switch over (with or without arguing about it&#160;:)</li>
<li>4) If succession box placement at the bottom is a "credo", and is implemented on the vast majority of the pages that way (which has certainly been my experience), then IMO it's a de-facto standard to do it that way even if it isn't explicitly written anywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>I'll go over to the navbox talk page later today when I've got idle time and see what the discussion was like, maybe participate in it a bit myself.

Checking the histories of the template pages themselves suggests {{<a href="../../../d/e/g/Template%7EDEGovernors_6033.html" title="Template:DEGovernors">DEGovernors</a>}} is the one there was disagreement over, you reverted Jack Cox at one point suggesting he discuss the matter on the template talk page. But I've looked at<a href="../../../p/a/g/Template_talk%7EPAGovernors_1a3d.html" title="Template talk:PAGovernors">Template talk:PAGovernors</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/g/Template_talk%7EDEGovernors_7586.html" title="Template talk:DEGovernors">Template talk:DEGovernors</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJack_Cox_6d70.html" title="User talk:Jack Cox">User talk:Jack Cox</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkles_da7d.html" title="User talk:Markles">User talk:Markles</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStilltim_2ab0.html" title="User talk:Stilltim">User talk:Stilltim</a>, and all I could see relating to the governor navboxes was a brief discussion between you and Markles about the use of &lt;small&gt; tags. Did I miss a talk page? What was the actual dispute over, just the issue of alphabetic order versus chronological order? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Most of the discussion is on the several user pages, but frankly the discussion is really my being lectured. Hence, after fully explaining once or twice, I have not wasted further time with it, going with the substitution on the advice of administrators+ at WP. Otherwise I would, of course, use the template. This specific dispute is simply alpha vs. chrono &amp; the addition of an image (flag), but there are others. By itself, this is hardly worth the time it is taking either of us, but the larger issue is that there must be a way to prevent "out of control" WP editors from effectively vandalizing work in the name of "standarization." I strongly believe in standarization as well and have faithfully applied the many good standards I have found (and even some bad ones) to the work I am doing, but never at the price of quality. However, there is something quite unprofessional going on here, as it sometimes feels to me that the two editors you identify, at various times since February, have been following me very attentively, and doing over the cosmetics (never content) of work I do, especially templates, in their particular way, and declaring it to be "standard." This has sometimes taken place within minutes of my save. I realize managing such issues is the price of working in this medium, and view this exercise as a learning experience in how best to do so. Nevertheless, it is very discouraging and unmotivating. I feel like I am back in high school. Aren't you glad you stumbled into this. BTW I have tried to work the new note methodology into all the notes I have done, and used the tool quite successfully. So I do like standards. But of course my shadow, Mr. Markles, upon seeing the refr changes I make, becomes aware of the article and has to go fuss over the templates. I'm going to go do something sane...and fun now.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilltim_7d55.html" title="User:Stilltim">stilltim</a> 12:43, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What, pages and pages of discussion over whether a small list at the bottom of some articles are alphabetical or chronologica isn't <i>fun</i>?&#160;:) Seriously, though, from your self-description at your user page and from the work you've done on these articles it looks like you're quite a good content contributor for Wikipedia so I do consider it worth my while to spend some effort trying to ensure that you're having a good experience while contributing.</dd>
<dd>One thing to keep in mind is that other editors are probably thinking some of the same things. I first stumbled across the Thomas McKeen article simply because I've been on a reference cleanup/conversion binge recently and it showed up on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7ERef_aca0.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Ref">Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Ref</a>. When I saw all that transcluded wikitext at the bottom while checking my conversion to make sure I didn't break anything my first thought was "oh dear, this is a mess." Not vandalism, but definitely something "broken" and in need of "fixing." Since I've never encountered you before that I'm aware of and didn't examine the article's history, that was an honest reaction to the content rather than anything personal. I also checked out a couple of other articles listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Governors_of_Pennsylvania_42c5.html" title="List of Governors of Pennsylvania">List of Governors of Pennsylvania</a> to see if there were similar situations among them, which could have appeared like "stalking" if you'd been doing work on those as well - again with no ill will intended on my part. I haven't found the lectures you've mentioned on any of the talk pages I linked to above so I can't say anything specific about them, but could it be that Markles and Cox are honestly attempting to help? I myself can think of strong arguments for why chronological order would be better than alphabetical, there's more information in it that way. I don't like the little flags and other decorations many of these navboxes have, but IMO it's a pretty trivial detail and certainly not worth the trouble of substing templates instead of transcluding them.</dd>
<dd>My suggestion would be to try to find some sort of central gathering area where lots of other people who might be interested in this matter go, a related Wikiproject perhaps, and raise the issue on the talk page there since these particular templates are probably not very heavily travelled. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography</a> might be good for settling the alphabetical/chronological issue, or <a href="../../../n/a/v/Wikipedia%7ENavigational_templates_8f66.html" title="Wikipedia:Navigational templates">Wikipedia:Navigational templates</a> for the flag/substing issue. If you feel you're being harrassed by specific editors, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> is a good central clearing house for ideas on what to do and where to get help with that. I'll offer my own assistance as a neutral third party, if you want, though I've already formed an opinion on the article formatting issue itself so I might not be much help there.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'm sorry you feel put-upon. Ideally there'll be some sort of compromise position that everyone's at least vaguely satisfied with, but the ideal isn't always possible.

Legality probably isn't a problem for something like this, though, so it comes down to whether it makes for a good encyclopedia article or not.

<p>okay, i was wondering... when i type Firefly, i get the insect page. wouldnt it make more sence to link it to the disambiguation page since it is more likely that people looking up firefly are looking for the TV show. and i know it was named after the bug, i know that the the show isnt as famous as stargate but still. instead of typing firefly, having to click on the link to go to the disambiguation, and then clicking on the tv series link, i thing it should be that people type in firefly, and then they can choose to go to the insect page if they want to, instead of being forced to. the casual user wouldnt know to type Firefly (TV series) to get to the show... it would be more user friendly to navigate around... i was just wondering what you think since you are one of the oldest and more experienced users around here (you've been here since 2001, right?) anyways, thanks -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 05:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason for this is that there's one particular meaning for the word "firefly" that is far, far more common than the other meanings for it. When this occurs, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Primary_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Primary topic</a> suggests using this way of arranging things. In cases where it's not so clear that one particular meaning is more significant than the others it's done as you suggest, but in the grand scheme of things I think a family of beetle with worldwide distribution and a unique luminescent ability that's been inspiring all manner of poetry, art, and scientific research for thousands of years is a bit more significant than a relatively low-budget science fiction series that ran for one season and spawned just a single spinoff movie. As much as I may have liked it myself.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:01, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Bear in mind, whatever social community you're surrounded by is probably a very biased sample. What percentage of the general population has any interest in science fiction in general, let alone recent American science fiction television series from FOX that only lasted 14 episodes? Grab a random person off the street and I bet they won't be able to clearly distinguish Star Trek from Star Wars.&#160;:) If you think you can make a case to the contrary, though, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Talk%7EFirefly_b7a0.html" title="Talk:Firefly">Talk:Firefly</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Talk%7EFirefly_%28TV_series%29_9fb6.html" title="Talk:Firefly (TV series)">Talk:Firefly (TV series)</a> are probably good places to try it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:39, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>this isnt actually about the show... its about the people who run this place (meaning you and me and every other editor). you think that by typing firefly people want the beetle. why not just link to the disambiguation page and then let the user decide for themselves, you just automatically assume they want the beetle... and i think is more then just firefly, i think things like windows and stuff should automatically link to the disambiguation page... it would make it more user friendly... but i see what your saying, i just dont like how people assume... because they cant know, there is no way for us to check to see how people go to the firefly page because they were searching for the beetle or because they were looking for the phone or the tv show... -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 08:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see what you mean. The disambiguation page is already linked, though, right at the top of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">Firefly</a> page. This means that someone searching for the TV series has to make an extra click to reach it, but conversely someone searching for the beetle has to make one <i>fewer</i> clicks than if the disambiguation page were at <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">firefly</a> directly. This tradeoff is a net benefit if most people searching for "firefly" are interested in the beetle, which I think is a reasonable assumption. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. I haven't done any rigorous checking, but it seems like a reasonable assumption to me that the beetle is far more prominent than the TV show and more likely to be what an average encyclopedia-user is going to be looking for.

<p>isnt is also about naming articles? if someone got to the disambiguation page, and their were no summaries to tell what each link was, then only by process of elimination can someone deduce that regular Firefly is about the beetle... i thought it had to be 100% clear where each link goes to and Firefly (insect) takes away any doubt where it goes to... this is of course assuming that there are no summaries to tell what the links are about, which i think should be some sort of guideline as to establishing disambiguation pages... also, youre assuming that people know what theyre looking for when they search for firefly... someone may have thought they heard Firefly is a phone for small children, but dont remember... by automatically linking to the beetle its like "hmph, i guess its not called Firefly"... because some people might not know what disambiguation means... hell, i even dont, i just know it gives all the meanings of the word, which should always be the first place someone goes too... its like refining your search, you type in a word, its gives you all the possibilities, and then you go from there... so what if the insect was the first and probably the most relevant but unless all people are looking for the beetle when they type firefly, they should be linked to the disambiguation page first... -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 18:25, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i just did some research. if you type "firefly" into either yahoo or google, the tv show and the cell phone are the top searches... they have the most relevance according to the two biggest search engines around. i think thats proof enough that the beetle is not the top choice... also, people who are looking for the beetle generally use the term "fireflies", plural. i think this is significant because you generally see fireflies together in groups. you never say "look a firefly" its usually "look, fireflies"... i think this constitutes as compelling evidence to rename the articles... -<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 21:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I disagree. First, it's blatantly obvious that the page <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">firefly</a> is only about beetles - it says it in the first line of the article and there's a photo of one right beside that. So if someone goes there looking for something called "firefly" that's not a beetle, how hard will it be to figure out the instruction "For other uses, see Firefly (disambiguation)."? This is not a difficult puzzle, we're not going to have people giving up in confusion. Second, Yahoo and Google are not the final authority on what is more prominent - they're focused solely on the Internet. A small group of fans can put up a lot of fan sites and make a lot of noise in the blogosphere even though in the grand scheme of things the show remains a small phenomenon compared to the beetle family. If we were relying on Google results the planet <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto.html" title="Pluto">Pluto</a><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=pluto+planet" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=pluto+planet" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> would be neck-and-neck with a <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto_%28Disney%29_cd77.html" title="Pluto (Disney)">cartoon dog</a><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=pluto+disney" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=pluto+disney" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> for the position of "primary meaning."</dd>

<dd>But the most important question now, IMO, is why are you spending so much time here on my talk page trying to convince <i>me</i> about this? I'm getting a little puzzled here - you popped onto my page with a question about what I thought about some article I don't recall ever making significant edits to, and so I gave you my answer and some pointers to Wikipedia guidelines on the subject. You apparently didn't like my answer, but what of it? I'm not in charge of Wikipedia's contents, I'm not involved in the article (at least not so far), I just gave an opinion when asked. The discussion on <a href="../../../f/i/r/Talk%7EFirefly_b7a0.html" title="Talk:Firefly">Talk:Firefly</a> is the important one, take it over there. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:49, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see the problem. I didn't remove them, I turned them into footnotes using the cite.php system (<a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a>). This system requires a &lt;references/&gt; tag at the bottom to "catch" and display the references in a manner that looks very similar to how the {{<a href="../../../m/n/b/Template%7EMnb_1e78.html" title="Template:Mnb">mnb</a>}} templates are displaying it, so I assumed there was already a reference tag down there and that I was just adding these to the list. Looks like the article's using two other referencing systems simultaneously but neither of them is cite.php. What a mess. The <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnote4_ff60.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnote4">Wikipedia:Footnote4</a> system in particular is an obsolete never-implemented proposal that's only used by a handful of articles now. I'll revert myself for the time being, but later on when I've got more time I'll see if I can't revamp the article's referencing to be a little tidier and easier to manage. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> goes into detail about how to use the new cite.php footnoting system.

Neither of these systems is mandatory, but I find the new footnoting system to be quite a bit easier for editing purposes than the old template-based one; the contents of the footnote are placed in the article's source text in the same place as the material being footnoted, so it's really easy to move stuff around and add new footnotes without having to go down and edit the references section at the same time. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:24, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I've just found your reply to my note about spoilers in <i>Bleak House</i>. Of course I agree with you, and indeed it is Wiki policy. But the comment was put in relation to a single bracketed note to the character list. If you want to put that back in (it's marked in the history), and add the spoiler tag, go for it. And then make the spoiler note earn its keep by putting in a synopsis of the plot, which is of course what this article needs.</p>
<p>It was just a response to an addition that would mean nothing at all to a WP reader unless they were part way through Bleak House - in which case it would have blown the entire plot. So yeah, please fix all: take out the HTML note and go the whole hog - like you say, it's good for the encyclopedia. cheers, <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackyR_e6f9.html" title="User talk:JackyR">Talk</a> 21:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
