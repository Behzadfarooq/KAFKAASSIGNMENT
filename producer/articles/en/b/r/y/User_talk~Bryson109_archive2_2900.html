<p>I have realised that your issue with the panzer division page is not misplaced. I am going to reword it as much as I can.

<p>Oh by the way, your article u 172 is only 964, not over 2000, I'm sure of that. Plus its counted as a stub.

Dear Bryson, I feel as if there is an animosity between us, I don't know if you feel the same. I don't want to have an animosity with any fellow wikipedian, so I hope that things can become more friendly between us. And I do appreciate your help on Unterseeboot 30 and the U-boat articles in general. Feel free to remove the tags on your articles if you have not already.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another U-boat buff!</span></h2>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have been looking for another U-boat buff and I think I have found one. So far I have only done one major re-write of a U-boat article (<a href="../../../u/n/t/Unterseeboot_28_%281936%29.html" title="Unterseeboot 28 (1936)">Unterseeboot 28 (1936)</a>) but more will be done soon. I just wanted to know if there is a U-boat group around here. Also I saw that some articles have infoboxes now. Would it be possible to put total tonnage sunk in there somewhere. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk_Royal_9b35.html" title="User:Ark Royal">Ark Royal</a> 20:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Yes, you have found another U-Boat Buff.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Battle of Eylau or Battle of Preussich Eylau</span></h2>
<p>Well yes this would be alright in my opinion, if english historiography use name Eylau (which is wrong). Try to see translation of the text on Deutsch Wikipedia (Schlacht bei PreuÃŸisch Eylau). It's not my personal idea I just want to help you a little bit becouse your text is translated in several languages (english is common language)and those translations don't have redirect: Battle of Preussisch Eylau (in italian for example). So... little mistake makes many huge mistakes on many wikipedias... Unfortunetly there is a second reason why your Article should be changed, try to see articles on english wiki 1. - Ilawa (Deutsch Eylau) and 2. - Bagrationowsk (Preussich Eylau). As I understand name Eylau is refering to both this towns? as well as your Battle of Eylau? If I were you (but I'm not) I would copy the article Battle of Eylau to Redirect Battle of Preussich Eylau and create redirect: Battle of Eylau. Belive me I have read a lot of books from many sources about this battles and one very big compendium 93 pages in polish called "Bitwa pod PruskÄ… IÅ‚awÄ…" (Bitwa pod Preussisch Eylau)writen by Tomasz Rogacki <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 83-11-09807-7</a>, en: Battle of Preussich Eylau.

<p>I can only mention that I have created the article Battle of Pruska IÅ‚awa in Polish and i have used from your article one information that marshal Ney said after battle "What a masacre! And for no outcome." You can use my images to make your article better, they are in public domain and I have exported them on Commons server (copy names of images on polish wiki and find them on commons). You should find more informations about this battle. It is one of very big importance. After this battle both armies were almost destroyed and soldiers faith in victory on both sides have disapired... This was the only reason why Napoleon was seeking on spring final victory to persuade Russia to peace table. After this Battle Napoleons soldiers were screaming Viva le Paix(Long live the Peace) instead of Viva l'Emperour(Long Live Imperor) as they usuall were doing. You must understand that every commander tried to find safe quaters for winter. In the time of Napoleonic Wars to lead an army in the middle of winter in -15 Degress was like Suicide that's why Benigsen has made huge strategical mistake trying to engage Napoleon in this time. If he would wait till spring when he was joined by reinforcments he would have some chances to win Battle of Friedland instead of this he has lost half of his men at Preussich Eylau.

<dd>I agree fully that the correct name is Battle of Preussich-Eylau, but there are other articles on wikipedia that use a 'common name' as the article name. But if you feel strongly about it â€“ I have no objections to the article being re-named and Battle of Eylau being the re-direct.

<p>As far as I know, English language texts have always called the battle "Eylau", and so have French texts. Similarly, the battle of Wagram has always been known by that name (in both French and English) though the name of the place is actually (if I'm not mistaken) Deutsch Wagram. There are cases in which different nations have different names for battles. Examples are Salamance (British) versus Los Arapiles (French), and Borodino (French) versus Moskva (Russian). Names of battles are conventional, and do not necessarily reflect geography (the battle of Waterloo took place some distance from the village of that name and the name was clearly chosen because it was less French than Mont Saint Jean, the place where the battle actually happened, and because Waterloo had a vaguely English sound to it, and would be easy for English people to pronounce. Salamanca is probably another case of Wellington choosing a name that would be easier for English people, just as non-Slavs probably find Borodino easier than Moskva. Encyclopaedia entry names should probably reflect conventional usage because people use an encyclopaedia to expand their knowledge of a name or word they have found elsewhere. English speaking people will find that almost all the books they read refer to the battle as "Eylau", not Preussisch Eylau. However, none of this should be a problem: an electronic encyclopaedia can cope with different names very easily because of electronic searches and redirection. If necessary, entries can point out where conventional names are misleading or incorrect, but they should also draw attention to conventional usage. That is what an encyclopaedia is for: allowing people to increase their knowledge by starting from something they already know. I feel one should never lose sight of the fact that an encyclopaedia is for its users, not its compilers, and one should always ask oneself what the users will need. If one doesn't, the users will go elsewhere.<br />
Having said that, why is the entry for the battle of Arcole entitled "The Battle of the Bridge of Arcole"? I may be losing my memory, but I don't recall the word "bridge" usually appearing in the name in either English or French. Iorwerth Glyndwr 13:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I see your doing some expansion work on U-boats. I had a go at that myself some time agao, but other commitments forced me to give up. There's a useful infobox avaliable which nicely encapsulates the information on each boat which you might want to consider using, see any <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyd101_U-boat_articles_4e9a.html" title="User:Jackyd101/U-boat articles">of my articles</a> for an example.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thank you for your message</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your message of welcome. I'm still struggling to fathom how this system of communication works, but I'll do my best. I don't really have time to make a proper contribution to the Military History Project, and in any case I have my own web-site where I would be likely to post anything I write. But having done eight years of research and written a book on Napoleon's early career, I didn't feel I could let the entries on Lodi and Arcole remain as they were, because they were perpetuating largely unsubstantiated popular legends about Napoleon instead of giving properly researched historical information. As far as I am aware, there is no contemporary account of Napoleon being pushed off the bridge at Arcole. Indeed, there does not seem to be any contemporary account of him reaching the bridge at all. I seem to recall that there are accounts of him slipping into the marsh, but I can't remember exactly where I found them (I haven't got my notes to hand). His Polish ADC, SuÅ‚kowski, describes Bonaparte trying to lead the troops forward along the dyke, but SuÅ‚kowski was knocked out and didn't see the end of the episode. Estienne also describes it (see Kryn, Le petit tambour d'Arcole). But this episode is only a tiny part of a complex and debilitating battle that lasted for three whole days, and included serious fighting on the French left flank, some two miles from the bridge of Arcole. I may try and expand the entry if I have time, but I am also in the middle of another piece of research on another subject. Best of luck, Iorwerth Glyndwr 13:53, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

By the way, one of the battles in the Revolutionary Wars box appears as Trebia instead of Trebbia. I've tried to clean up the entry on FM Wurmser, but the page name really needs changing in my opinion. Iorwerth Glyndwr 23:50, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes you are right, it should be Trebbia. I re-named the page (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trebbia_%281799%29_5a88.html" title="Battle of Trebbia (1799)">Battle of Trebbia (1799)</a>).

<p>Hi, Bryson, you gave me notice that I change Borodino casualties, right? well, if you didn't know, there is a lot of contradiction on that matter, and wikipedia page also contradicts itself, stating different casualties. It is just that lowest estimate for French is stated near highest estimate for russians, which is simple BIAS. I hope wikipedia will refrain from being biased towards one side or another in future.</p>

<dd>Yes published sources do give different figures, but figures in the info box were cited (and are the generally accepted numbers), and it is not a good idea to changed cited sources. Both French and Russian casualties are from the same source, so it is not using the highest estimate for the Russians. If I misinterpreted your edit I am sorry, and I now believe it was a good faith edit. --<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryson109_a423.html" title="User:Bryson109">Bryson</a> 04:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like inform you of an incongruency with the Six Days Campaign article. The campaign is called the Six Days Campaign, but however, if you look at the dates, they are clearly spanning over five days. i do not know if it is a misnomer with the event or an inaccuracy with the article. I can't tell because i would normally look it up on Wikipedia, but this article has a problem, so I don't know. The person who wrote this article should be alerted of this inconsistency and should be confronted. Also, indicate on the page that if there is in fact a misnomer of the event, it is a misnomer and not an inconsistency with the article itself.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<dd><a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Gutenberg_b9aa.html" title="Project Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a> is in the references section, maybe it is link spam, but I don't want to remove it, since it may have been used as a source of information. And as for "I am new to Wikipedia so perhaps this violated a policy of which I am unaware" No your not new, I looked at your talk page you know what you did. --<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryson109_a423.html" title="User:Bryson109">Bryson</a> 16:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And what exactly is it that I did? I am "new" as of late February, 2007 -- less than a month. In my first-day enthusiasm, I began by adding links to several WOWIO books a la Project Gutenberg that I believe offer unique value to readers. A few of these links were removed without explanation despite my follow-up inquiries. I have since researched Project Gutenberg policy and precedent, and again see no issue aside from a few overzealous editors. So, in accordance with the Wikipedia:External links section of the Manual of Style and in the spirit of keeping the discussion constructive, I again respectfully request an explanation as to why the link was removed. Thanks, Max</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wars France lost</span></h2>
<p>There is nothing remotely "divisive and inflammatory" about the "Wars France lost" category. It's completely factual.

<ul>
<li>Then create a category for wars other countries have lost! Don't try to have other categories deleted just because you don't like information they give out. You need to check your bias at the door. Whether you like it or not, the "Wars France lost" category is factually correct. -- <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReid1867_4b26.html" title="User:Reid1867">Reid1867</a> 02:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>We could easily create those other categories, but they would be vastly oversimplistic and completely devoid of any historical significance and context. Plus the creation of the category is not the only troubling thing; I sincerely doubt your knowledge of French military history (and military history period) given some of the articles you added the category to. We are trying to avoid problems like this in the future, hence our thinking that this category is a bad idea.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 17:09, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The general consensus AFAIK is that while it's okay to strongly discourage users from removing warnings from their talk page, you shouldn't revert them if they do. Removing a warning is taken as a sign that a user has read the warning. In this specific case, I added the indef blocked template which is enough. The indef blocked template should remain.
