<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reformatting of articles</span></h2>
<p>Your addition of Episode headings is contrary to what's been established in the <a href="../../../w/h/o/WP%7EWHO_6935.html" title="WP:WHO">WP:WHO</a> style guide. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Doctor_Who_Archive_2_b911.html#Serial_summaries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who/Archive 2">We had a discussion about this a long time ago</a>; the adding of episode headers this way adds additional sub-headers in the contents box and also will make the pages inconsistent since not all summaries neatly divide into episodes. The agreement at the time, and as was incorporated into the style guide, was to put in &lt;hr&gt; breaks instead or end it with ellipses. Unobtrusive, and gets the point across. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 22:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eww. Horizontal rules used to be used long ago to separate articles where multiple different small articles were combined into one page (nowadays we just disambiguate into stubs), so using horizontal rules between episodes like that looks way out of place to me. Can't say I agree with that decision at all. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Little update: I found that the bottom entry in the table at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#Examples" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Examples</a> agreed with my memory on how horizontal rules are used in general on Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Help%7ESection_322f.html#Horizontal_dividing_line" title="Help:Section">Help:Section#Horizontal dividing line</a> indicates they're not to be used for dividing articles up into sections like this. Perhaps we should start up a new discussion about it at the Wikiproject? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I didn't even insert breaks at all when I started doing those summaries, but they are there if anyone wants to use them. My problem is with inserting subheaders because they will lead to an inconsistent look across articles, create a larger TOC box and just look awkward. If you don't want a horizontal rule, then ellipses is another option. Sure, bring it up again if you want, but that's my take, FWIW. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 02:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alrighty. I probably won't take it up right now since those few Doctor Who episodes were just a little drive-by I did, I wasn't planning to do any bulk editing just yet. I just discovered that the Stargate Wikiproject has been having the same Notes/Trivia header issue that I brought up with the Doctor Who Wikiproject a while back and it reminded me that I should have been spending more effort on Doctor Who articles too. I'll see whether I wind up embroiled in a big discussion in the Stargate Wikiproject first.&#160;:) In the meantime, want me to go back through the ones I did and re-add the horizontal rules for now? Assuming it hasn't already been done that is. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, since I know it might seem a little rude for me to keep swooping in on Wikiprojects and objecting to long-established aspects of their operation like this, I just wanted to say that I really don't mean to seem arrogant or intrusive. I'm just concerned with the consistency of Wikipedia as a whole. I don't want to create work for people if I don't feel I have to, since all this minor format fiddling takes time away from the more important work of adding and expanding the informational content instead. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think its safe to use the primary source (show itself) as a referance as tech manuals are not necesarily reliable. The contravercy over rank insignia can be covered in the aproporate rank article. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 05:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with C.C. in this case. What is shown on the live action productions (films, TV show) would nautrally outweigh anything in a tech manual.

<dd>And as I mentioned over on the ranks and insignia talk page, I've got no problem with that. The problem is <i>citations</i>.

<dd>The citations are offered in the rank specific articles that are linked to the page. They were removed to the specific pages when the article was broke up into several smaller articles. The main article page with a chart lmost serves as little more than an all encompassing redirect page now with pictures. I also mentioned the live action sources for the insignia on the talk page of the article and it is heavily referenced in the rank specific articles as well as well as in the references section at the bottom of the article. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 16:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As soon as the article's unprotected I'll put the specific cites you mentioned in place, but it's really rather inconsiderate of you to have the cites available and not do it yourself in this situation.

<p>For the love of the God, the article is not uncited. It was discussed long ago that the artcle should be split into separate rank specific articles. When it was, the general agreement was that citiatons for specific ranks should go on specific rank articles. I addition, nearly <b>ALL</b> of the footnotes, in every single rank specific article, was researched and posted by me. So, you state I am inconsiderate and not post my citiations when exactly the opposite is true. Here's a list for you to check out: <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_%28Star_Trek%29_5a11.html" title="Lieutenant (Star Trek)">Lieutenant (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Commander_%28Star_Trek%29_ad0e.html" title="Lieutenant Commander (Star Trek)">Lieutenant Commander (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28Star_Trek%29_da0a.html" title="Captain (Star Trek)">Captain (Star Trek)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_%28Star_Trek%29_14fb.html" title="Commodore (Star Trek)">Commodore (Star Trek)</a> not to mention the text in each of those articles which states where the information comes from and from what on-screen production. A final note to all this, and a lesson well learned here, is that if you make radical edits to well established articles, you will often meet heavy resistance. I have done that before, myself. Use the talk page when resistence is met and, if disputed edits are reverted, post them to the talk page and say "how about this?" instead of putting them on the page over and over again. In any event, I'm off to real world stuff now. See ya. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 16:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

No objections were raised until just now, though some questions were asked and answered and I made a correction to a filename when informed of the system by which they were named. As a recent "arrival" to the article, I wasn't aware of any previous discussions about the split-up. Perhaps you can also draw a lesson here, that articles shouldn't require a knowledge of their editing history for their current state to be accepted. Anyway, I also am off to real world stuff. When the article gets unprotected, I intend to start bringing in citations where I can find them and I invite you to help out. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's okay, I recall being a bit hard-headed about forcing the change through myself. I really need to be reminded sometimes that if a hot new bit of syntax really is superior to prior methods then there's no need to rush in implementing it everywhere, it'll just become the de facto standard naturally over time.

<p>Re: The Jar -- I'm afraid all the information I added was from personal recollection and what I could find with Archive.org. I know memories are not the most reliable, but I did keep up with the Jar when it was still in production... Should the article get put on the AFD list again, then I suggest putting a section for the Jar in with Kittyhawk's new comic, or in an article on Kittyhawk, as has been suggested. -- <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreku_8417.html" title="User:Areku">Areku</a></p>

<dd>Well, if it comes to that then we should do these things <i>before</i> the article goes on AfD. It's always easier to work on an article without the deletion process hanging over it.&#160;:) I'm about ready for bed tonight and I may be busy with other things tomorrow, but on tuesday I'll start going through what's left on archive.org and prune the article down to just the stuff that I'm able to find references for. Then we'll see whether it's enough to stand on its own, merge into a Kittyhawk article, or merge into SGVY. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The URL that was included with that reference - <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/War06.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/War06.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystar.com.lb/War06.asp</a> - gave me a 404 error when I tried visiting it. Fortunately, though, the cite template had other details - title, date, and publisher - which means that even if that URL is forever dead and Internet Archive doesn't have a copy, we could concievably dig up the news story again by other means.

Despite the amount of effort I spend on Wikipedia in general I <i>am</i> just a volunteer here, you know.&#160;:) I would probably have got to it eventually, or at least have put some sort of message on talk: to make sure other editors familiar with the subject eventually would.

<p>Hey, thanks for your work on {{<a href="../../../m/o/r/Template%7EMortal_Kombat_series_cb03.html" title="Template:Mortal Kombat series">Mortal Kombat series</a>}} (and {{Mortal Kombat media}}). While I completely agree with the assessment of the template (and what you split out), it would have been nice if you'd asked/told the <i>MK</i> WikiProject; not only would we (probably me) been happy to do the split and subsequent article editing, but it also would have ensured that we didn't use a generic nav box (which I've reformatted to match). Not angry (this post <i>could</i> be interpreted as mildly antagonistic), just dropping you a line. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 14:56, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. When I saw that there was a wikiproject for that game I figured someone would come along and do some additional editing, and while I'd been secretly hoping that the other template would get switched over to a layout like the new media one I didn't really expect it. I tend to prefer standardization but this being Wikipedia I know that any attempt to force it is a losing game.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:26, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heh, so the split wasn't particularly <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mortal_Kombat_209c.html#About_the_template_split" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mortal Kombat">well received</a> by other members of the <i>MK</i> project. We've revised the series template to have all the information, but a bit smaller. No hard feelings, but I'm putting the media template up for deletion now, as it isn't needed anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, and as for switching the layout over (horizontal vs. vertical), I'll play around with the new current one; now that we've trimmed it down some, it might work better that way.</p>

<p>No, I really have a problem with including the variations at all, since they basically just result from "artistic licence".

<dd>In that case please avoid leaving misleading edit summaries. I have no particular basis for holding an opinion on this matter myself, but my general feeling is that even rare variants are worth mentioning - especially in this case where there's an entire <i>section</i> dedicated to Ceres' symbol. If we take out the variants the section consists of just a single sentence, which seems kind of pointless to me.

<dd>I propose putting them nowhere. Like I said, they're basically artistic licence variations—no different, really, than if you draw the symbol for Jupiter differently (say, with only a little or quite a lot of curve on the blade).

<p>Hey Brian, a question on your revert on <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire_lifestyle.html" title="Vampire lifestyle">Vampire lifestyle</a>. If I understand what you are saying from you edit summary it is somehow against policy to remove or otherwise change citations even if I find their inclusion in the article to be inncorrect? <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 03:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I was against turning citations into plain external links. As you can see with what I've done with the article subsequently, putting references into ref tags allows full bibliographic details to be included.

<dd>Depends on the specifics of each reference. I'm just looking through a few of them now and I don't see any that appear to be inappropriate to me, so I suspect that yes, I would oppose removing them. They may not be the best possible sources but they do support the statements they're associated with, and given the choices of having statements with poor references and statements with <i>no</i> references I think it's best to have poor references. How about bringing up the ones you've got issues with on talk?

<dd>It's quite possible. My usual approach to statements I find dubious or poorly supported is to put {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} stickers on them and then come back in a few months to see if anyone's done anything to fix them up. I rarely delete stuff outright unless it's gone for a very long time, and even then I often move stuff to talk for future restoration. There isn't a deadline, after all. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:50, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Episode article naming</span></h2>
<p>Hiya, there is currently some discussion about the proper naming of <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</i> episodes, and as I see that you have been involved with that the discussion in the past, I'd like to ensure that we have your input. It's being discussed both at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%281987%29_episodes_78a5.html" title="Talk:List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) episodes">Talk:List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) episodes</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_2a37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)</a>, and your thoughts would be greatly appreciated at both locations, to indicate whether or not you prefer a consistent method of titling TMNT episodes, or a method of "disaambiguate only when needed."

<p>You recently replaced my .jpg version of the Stargate title art with your own SVG art. However your version is incorrect: the Stargate title isn't just Times New Roman with a funny A. Please look at my JPG - the letters are specifically crafted (and compare to the show). I don't know how to make an SVG, but if you could do a direct convert from my version that would be better. Otherwise I might be able to send you the Stargate font i used to make my version.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amateur astronomy / Skygazing merge</span></h2>
<p>Did you have a specific goal in merging these two articles? They should probably be merged (or at least Skygazing should be redirected) but copying <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> into <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_astronomy.html" title="Amateur astronomy">Amateur astronomy</a> has made some massive problems because Skygazing is so very un-encyclopedic, full of redundant sections that should be in other articles, and suffers from general translation problems. I am planning to revert this merger unless you are in the middle of some kind of refinement of the resulting article I am not aware of. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 23:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I'm</i> not in the middle of refinement, since I'm not familiar with the topic and have other stuff on my plate I hadn't planned to go into detail on it. The purpose of the merger is to allow <i>others</i> to continue refining the article. It's a simple case of collaborative editing, which is what Wikipedia is all about. I don't see how reverting the merge makes any sense since it's progressing in the opposite direction of how the article should ultimately develop, a direction that you yourself agree with. If you have specific problems with the material, why not work on improving it? Delete the redundant sections or move them to the other articles they should be in, for example. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can see your point of moving things along by being bold on the merger. The problem is <b>Skygazing</b> really has nothing useful that could be added to the <b>Amateur astronomy</b> article. <b>Skygazing</b> is a translated French “how to” article. It resembles the state <i>English</i> <b>Amateur astronomy</b> was in a few months back. <b>Amateur astronomy</b> has been heavily edited by User:<a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> to correct all the problems you currently see in <b>Skygazing</b> (<b>Amateur astronomy</b> is now an article describing the field of Amateur astronomy whereas <b>Skygazing</b> is a manual "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wp:not">instructing</a>" someone how to observe the night sky). Izogi had <b>Skygazing</b> available when he did his edit but (correctly in my mind) chose not to use any of it because of its encyclopedic problems. At this point in time almost none of <b>Skygazing</b> belongs in <b>Amateur astronomy</b> because the only usable parts are redundant. The rest of the article could be used in there respective topics (sky phenomenon, telescope description, ect) but that does not mean it should be dropped into <b>Amateur astronomy</b>. I think no one has taken an axe to <b>Skygazing</b> because they can see a lot of useful stuff in it that could be used in other articles, or they just couldn't figure out where its place was in the wikipedia world. <b>Skygazing</b> should probably be a redirect as a slang term for <b>Amateur astronomy</b> with no merger and its "contents" moved off to someone’s project page. I may do that. At this point in time I am going to revert the merger and try to find time to integrate some of <b>Skygazing’s</b> content or simply move it off to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wikihow.com" rel="nofollow">WikiHOW</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 23:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Heh. If the article goes to AfD I'd be tempted to vote delete as well. A list of this scope is probably not appropriate for Wikipedia, and I'm not sure if splitting it would solve the problem unless the dividing lines were very specific and strict. I could see "Villains from the Hebrew Bible" or "...Christian New Testament" sections making good lists in their own right, for example; their scope is quite solidly bounded. But "Villains from films" would be a vast and formless mass and I don't see any obvious way to salvage it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. You kindly supplied some comments on the above article in November. I wrote most of the article and obviously I am concerned if the article seems to be completely unintelligible to most readers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SVG on Commons</span></h2>
<p>The only problem? The software I use doesn't utilize or recognize SVG. And I have no idea how to translate or any software (freeware) that is available. So if someone would point me in the right direction and give me a few pointers about how to do SVG... well, maybe then. The idea of "cleanup", however, is insulting - as it suggests something "wrong" with the image. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The program I use for general SVG editing is <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a>, which is free and open-source. There may be other programs that are specifically designed for maps, though - I use <a href="http://bkchem.zirael.org/" class="external text" title="http://bkchem.zirael.org/" rel="nofollow">BKchem</a> for work with chemical structures instead, for example, because it has a lot of tools meant for working with those. I did some quick Googling and found this page of links to various map-related SVG software, does anything here look like it might be useful? <a href="http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/links/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/links/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. It's got a list of commercial SVG mapping software but some of those may have free demo versions. <a href="http://www.svg.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.svg.org/" rel="nofollow">svg.org</a> might also have something. I'm not familiar with the common file formats used by cartographic data so I can't tell what specific programs look most useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "cleanup" tag isn't meant to be insulting, it's meant to suggest that a specific improvement is possible in this case. The most wonderfully drawn high-resolution PNG map could still be improved by switching to SVG because there are things that can be done with SVG images that just can't be done with other formats. For example, the labels on place names could be translated to different languages without even needing an image editor; one could just open the SVG file in a text editor and replace the names with translated versions (SVG is an XML-based format stored in an ordinary text file). But in the meantime there's nothing wrong with having a high-resolution PNG instead so don't stop uploading maps if you don't find any SVG tools you like. Eventually someone else will come along who can convert the PNG files to SVG, it's the wiki way. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 20:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hardly seems fair considering I've been on Wikipedia since mid 2001, but I'll be magnanimous and change my sig rather than asking User:Bryan to give way to seniority.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 05:39, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arecibo</span></h2>
<p>Re. Arecibo and Pluto: the radar does not work out that far. We don't work beyond Saturn. I'm also not sure what 'at the time' means: Pluto isn't classified as a planet now, and not many scientists have considered it as such for about fifteen years. Pluto cannot ever be observed with Arecibo, so I'm not sure what the relevance is. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 03:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My point was that one shouldn't remove actual information (the fact that Pluto dropped below Arecibo's field of view in 1989) simply due to a semantic quibble over what the object is classified as. My impression from your edit summary was that this was the main reason you removed it. If there are other valid reasons for doing so then that's fine, though perhaps in this case it would still be better to point out that Arecibo couldn't do radar observations of Pluto even when it <i>was</i> within its field of view. More information is almost always better than less, IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 03:36, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ref in Freemasonry</span></h2>
<p>I'm sorry to have to remove the reference you put in Freemasonry again, but as written (&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;) it did point to the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition_8e5e.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition">Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</a>, and as I'm sure you are aware cannot be used as a reference. May I suggest that you find an online copy of the 1911 EC and link to their article on Freemasonry if you feel this reference is important? <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWegianWarrior_abbf.html" title="User:WegianWarrior">WegianWarrior</a> 04:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oy. I've run into this misunderstanding before. The reason why there's a Wikipedia link is because there <i>aren't</i> any good copies online; the only ones are laden with OCR errors and other glitches. The choices are between a wikipedia link explaining what the reference is and a plain bit of text with no link at all. I'll expand the bibliographic reference a bit more, will that satisfy? Take a look at the first usage example at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">Template:Cite book</a>, it has a wikilinked title just like I've done in this case. It's perfectly valid. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 05:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's better, allthought not perfect (I'll accept the fact that there are no good copies online thought). However, my, and I'm sure BlueBoar's, problem was the fact that the reference, <i>as written</i>, simply pointed to the Wikipedia article on the 1911 EC. <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWegianWarrior_abbf.html" title="User:WegianWarrior">WegianWarrior</a> 05:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My position is simply that <i>improving</i> a badly written or incomplete reference is far preferable to <i>deleting</i> it. If the wikilink is truly intolerable, then simply delinking the text would have been preferable (though I don't see the problem with wikilinking titles myself). I haven't even really looked at the fact that's being cited in this case, I just saw that a reference was being removed from it and reflex kicked in. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 07:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The wikilink is not the problem. The problem is that a vague citation to an entire edition of an encyclopedia is completely useless to back up a specific statement, especially when the wikilink points to an article that has nothing to do with the topic. My response said as much; and you apparently misiniterpreted it. Without some way to link a reference directly to the article in question (so the reader can find it if he or shw wishes), citing it does nothing. If you cannot find the EB Freemasonry article, don't add the citation in again. Furthermore, what good is an incomplete citation? For example: "Smith, J. pg. 12" - does this at all aid you in finding whatever it is I'm talking about? Probably not. If you can't get away with it in high school, why should you get away with it on WP? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When an article is imported from the old Encyclopedia Britannica, it has been long-standing practice on Wikipedia to put the template {{<a href="../../../1/9/1/Template%7E1911.html" title="Template:1911">1911</a>}} at the bottom as the source. It's no more specific than the reference in this case, and even wikilinks to the same article I linked to. What is worse about attaching this reference to a specific line instead of an article as a whole? And what is better about having no reference at all instead of one with poor specificity? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 05:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we didn't import the EB article into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> at all, and a poor citation is worse than none, because it looks like fabrication of sources (which is exactly what it is). We've got the actual article as an external link for anyone who wants to read it. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the source is fabricated, by which I take it you mean the information isn't actually supported by the source being cited rather than the source not actually existing, that's a whole other kettle of fish. In that case replace the cite with a {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}}, or simply remove both cite and cited information. But if the information is indeed in the source then I simply can't agree that a poor citation is worse than no citation. A poor citation is at least a step up from "we have no idea if this was just dreamed up out of thin air." Frankly, I'm still convinced that the article's quality has been damaged by this and I can't really understand the position the rest of you guys are taking on the talk page - it seems to have shifted several times and none of them make sense. But I'm tired of this one little detail, so whatever. I've got lots of other things to work on instead. Just please bear in mind next time you encounter a citation that has a wikilink in it that it might actually be citing the named source itself rather than the Wikipedia article <i>about</i> that source. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 00:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that you were a major contributor to <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D">WP:D</a>. I have a question regarding naming convention guidelines in <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html" title="WP:D">WP:D</a> regarding the situation when one entry is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:D#Primary_topic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:D#Primary_topic" rel="nofollow">primary meaning</a>. What is your opinion on how you determine whether one meaning is the primary meaning relative to other meanings? For example, if there is a topic XYZ and multiple meanings for XYZ, but one stands out as the primary meaning to me, what necessary and sufficient evidence would you require to be convinced of that, if it's not obvious? Thanks in advance for you consideration of this issue. --<a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 21:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
