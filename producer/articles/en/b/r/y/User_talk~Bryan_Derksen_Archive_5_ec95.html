<p>This is an odd question, but isn't it true that .333... equals 1/3rd? I got into a rather silly debate on a forum and they disagreed that .3repeating equals 1/3rd. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a> 03:30, Feb 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. If you're curious as to how the debate got started, I started by saying to (someone who claimed to be a Mechanical Engineer) that they were wrong about 1&#160;!= .999...</p>
<p>My proof was something someone else once showed me. 1/3 = .333... 2/3 = .666.... So why then does 3/3 = 1 and not .999... unless they were the same thing?</p>
<p>Alas the moderator had locked the topic before I could cleanse them of their ignorance. I shall do so via PM. - <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Kenneth_baa7.html" title="User:Lord Kenneth">Lord Kenneth</a></p>

<dd>They are indeed the same thing. You can probably prove this using limits; <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/4/0/14067fe27b59783e64090d268ea71627.png" alt="\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x}{3} = 1" />.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:46, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the guy doesn't understand high school algebra he is unlikely to understand, much less be convinced by, arguments based on limits. You might try the following. Let x = 0.3333... Then 10x is 3.333... Subtract 3 from this and you get 0.333... = x back again. So x is a solution to the equation 10x - 3 = x. But this is a linear equation which only has one solution, namely x = 3. This is standard technique for converting repeating decimals to rational (p/q) form that we all were supposed to have learned in 9th grade algebra. Grizzly 03:50, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Sorry that I had to revert your conversion to thumbnail image on the map of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Romania_d2a0.html" title="Counties of Romania">Counties of Romania</a> article, because the resulting image was not very efficient (it has 160k, while before your conversion it had 33k), since thumbnail feature was created for small images, not large images like maps. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 21:33, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure either that thumbnailing the image at <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voynich_manuscript.html" title="Voynich manuscript">Voynich manuscript</a> produces a good result; when I made that image, I reduced it to true black and white, so it is not a large file; reduced in size, it is just a bunch of specks.

<dd>Yeah, it's a little ugly via autothumbnail. However, the image was pretty large, so having the text flow around it in a tiny column down the side was a little ugly too. Perhaps it would work better as a non-floating image?

<p>Yes, of course you're right, it's not the way to handle edit wars, but isn't it rather desirable to get the attention of the warriors? And if they don't ever look at articles' talk pages--? (or respond to direct messages, or even have a personal Talk page?) Anyway, while you were reverting the text (no complaint from me), I was filing the proper complaint on the disputed-articles page. Maybe just getting somebody to protect the page <i>is</i> the only way to get these donkeys' attention.

<p>Hi, Bryan. I noticed that you used the new image markup at <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama_Hills_b3d7.html" title="Alabama Hills">Alabama Hills</a>. I should tell you that I converted a bunch of Sierra photos over to the new image markup (automatically generating thumbnails from the largest resolution). But, a lot of these photos were taken by <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a>, who pointed out that he not only downsampled to get the 300px, he also cropped. So, if we use the new image markup, we lose information. I reverted all of my changes (including in Alabama Hills, you can see in the history) and decided to wait for the image markup to allow a non-automatic thumbnail.</p>
<p>Now, in the particular case of Alabama Hills, it looks OK: I don't believe that mav cropped here. I re-added my caption to the article. But, I wanted to give you a heads-up on the issue. -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a> 02:47, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thumbnail deletion</span></h2>
<p>Hi Brian! Here is an extract from <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_for_deletion_61a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Images for deletion">Wikipedia:Images for deletion</a>:</p>
<p>START OF EXTRACT</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:Abell.lensing.arp.300pix.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Gravitational lens-thumb.jpg
<ul>
<li>Thumbnails made obsolete by the autothumbnail feature too <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:14, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>KEEP. I strongly object. I put Abell and Gravitational Lens pics onto WP. It's perfectly possible that if the new code proves unsuitable I might go back to the old code (for example, in the new code we can't have caption italics, caption text centring nor caption links). If thumbnails are deleted I'll have to reupload them which would be unacceptable.

<ul>
<li>Yes you can - just use the same old html markup but fmt the link as [[image:name|250px|blablahblah]] and your image will be limited to 250px. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>END OF EXTRACT</p>
<p>I don’t understand why thumbnails are being deleted at all since it would take 50000 of them to even make 1 Gigabyte (assuming each is 20K) and the entire WP database is 19 GB (if I remember correctly).<br />
Even though I’ve worked every day since January 2003 on illustrations I’ve still “only” put on 800 thumbnails. Thumbnails are not going to materially affect the size of WP and so are not really worth the trouble of transferring their names to IFD.<br />
However the stronger argument is that the new code is not fully satisfactory yet. We need to keep the ability to revert to the old code (and therefore use the old thumbs) if it was ever necessary. I would very much appreciate it if you do not list on IFD any thumbs with file names containing arp or ***pix.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how Jiang’s code solves my problems with the new code. The old caption standard was italics, text centred and links were possible. None of that works now. I already know the code for setting thumbnail size. Do you know the code for the three caption adjustments I can’t do?</p>
<p>I hope you can understand my concerns and leave my thumbnails off IFD.<br />
Best Wishes,<br />

<dd>The reason I've been putting them up for deletion is not space concerns, but simply because they're orphans and I don't see them becoming non-orphans again at any point in the future now that there's code for thumbnailing. Even if you have a problem with the current formatting of image captions, you can still use the autothumbnail feature to get exactly the same result as before; try [[Image:something.jpg|250px|] and you should get a thumbnail image without any of the extra bells and whistles that the "thumb" keyword currently provides. But I think it's best to use thumbs and captions, since that way the Wikipedia software will actually <i>understand</i> what text is caption and what text isn't; one could potentially have different skins that display captions in different ways, modify thumbnail sizes to fit on different resolution monitors or for the visually impaired, etc. There's discussion of all these issues over on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExtended_image_syntax_88b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Extended image syntax">Wikipedia:Extended image syntax</a> and the respective Wikipedia talk: page.<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:18, 17 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I read that you noted "there's an inconsistancy about All Saints Day that I don't know how to resolve." and was under the impression that you'd delete this text:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>"This ancient custom was Christianized in the feast of <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Saints_Day_7750.html" title="All Saints Day">All Saints Day</a>, established in Rome first on May 13, in order to de-paganize the Roman <i>Lemuria.</i> In the 8th century, as the popular observance of the <i>Lemuria</i> had safely faded over time, the feast of All Saints was shifted to November 1, coinciding with the similar Celtic propitiation of the spirits at <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samhain.html" title="Samhain">Samhain</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_III_9923.html" title="Pope Gregory III">Pope Gregory III</a> (731-741) consecrated a chapel in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilica_of_St._Peter_14cd.html" title="Basilica of St. Peter">Basilica of St. Peter</a> to all the saints and fixed the anniversary, not by chance, for 1 November.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The idea that this festival was the origin of that of <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Saints_d405.html" title="All Saints">All Saints</a>, which was moved later to November 1, has now been abandoned by Roman Catholics."</dd>

<p>I hope we may discuss precisely what needs to be improved at the site (because I care about the history of it).

<p>Just so you know, when I left that note on Rfm that I was willing to mediate, I kind of assumed that you'd see it there. In any event, I repeat here my offer to mediate, subject to the stipulations on the Rfm page. Sam/Jack seems willing to accept me. If you do as well, we can move forward. Otherwise (and I understand if you don't want to accept my mediation) you should propose an alternative mediator and see if Sam/Jack is willing to agree. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 16:24, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw it and I accepted, and Angela updated the Rfm "progress bulletins" section accordingly. After that I was just waiting for some indication of what to actually <i>do</i> now that everything seems in order. Since I'm not the initiator of this complaint, I figured Jack would contact you with his grievances (I'm still not entirely sure what they are myself) and then we'd get in touch to talk about them or something like that.

<dd>I still consider myself to be pretty much a blank slate on this article, since I've never read up on the subject from other sources before. So I'll keep an eye on things, and if it looks like a war is building up I think I can trust myself to temporarily protect the article with minimal bias while things cool down a bit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Image code questions</span></h2>
<p>Can you explain more, please, on how to have my caption text centred, italicised and with active links and use the <i>new</i> code.<br />
In <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_for_deletion_61a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Images for deletion">Wikipedia:Images for deletion</a> you said:<br />
<i>***Yes you can - just use the same old html markup but fmt the link as [[image:name|250px|blablahblah]] and your image will be limited to 250px.</i><br />
Unfortunately I don’t know what you meant. Is it something like this?</p>
<p>&lt;div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; width:250px; text-align:center"&gt; [[image:caf.f5.750pix.jpg|thumb|center|250px|]]&lt;small&gt;''Canadian Air Force CF-5 Freedom Fighters.'' &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>That does give a thumbnail, a clickable magnifying glass and a caption I can customise. The only snag is a slightly ugly blank grey bar to the left of the magnifying glass where the title would normally be. Is this the penalty for having the caption customisable?<br />
If my code is all wrong can you let me know the correct code?<br />
One further request. Would it be possible for you to set your thumbs to 250px instead of the default 180px? I find 180 a little too small on my 1024 by 768 screen. If you approve would you mind putting in 250px from now on? Thanks for any help,<br /></p>

<dl>
<dd>If you leave out the "thumb" option, you get the same result without the grey box and the magnifying glass;
<div class="center">
<div class="floatnone"><span><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Caf.f5.750pix.jpg">Image:Caf.f5.750pix.jpg</a></span></div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I personally would almost never leave out the thumb option because it automatically lets the user know there's a bigger version available by clicking. As for the default size, I've been hoping that at some point soon Wikipedia will add the ability to set your own personal default thumbnail size, so I've been avoiding setting a specific size unless it's actually important to the image. Small thumbnails aren't as pretty but they load fast. However, I'm not fixated on that, so I haven't been going around reducing existing thumbnails. I'll try to remember to set the "arp" images to 250 in the future. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:33, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
