Thanks.</p>
<p>Indeed, you made a mess of the article by not reading it before you edited it, and by blanking sections that you had been warned by several other editors not to blank. Please don't do this. You do not <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the Free Republic article by virtue of being a member of that august body, nor are you the first person who objected to the material that you are trying to censor. This article had been a bone of contention here before you ever heard of Wikipedia, and will be probably long after you have given up on it, and is the way it is because of consensus. And I think you can see that all you are doing is motivating the addition of more material of the sort you object to. Now, please try to calmly discuss changes and convince the rest of us why you think they are a good idea. You will find us not unreasonable if you are not trying to be a confrontation bully who refuses to accept the good faith efforts of others, which is all we have seen of you to date. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the acrimony came after BenBurch posted a particularly nasty personal attack for Bryan to see. Then BenBurch deleted it. That happened about a week ago and all this resentment you've seen in the past few days is residual from that. The history of the talk page for BenBurch will tell you all you need to know about that. Bryan is not a problem child. BenBurch is a problem child. He has provoked Bryan, but Bryan has never been nearly that nasty in response. <a href="../../../1/2/p/User%7E12ptHelvetica_6de6.html" title="User:12ptHelvetica">12ptHelvetica</a> 18:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pay special attention to the coaching they've received on "how to use Wikipolicy as a sword" to further their agenda, and steamroller anybody who dares to oppose their agenda and protect NPOV. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fairness_And_Accuracy_For_All/Archive2#You_might_get_indefinetly_banned" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fairness_And_Accuracy_For_All/Archive2#You_might_get_indefinetly_banned" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> As a result, administrators' attempts to rehabilitate them have only encouraged them to become more clever, cunning and subtle.

<dd>"... making his particpation here a CLEAR COI." So the many years that you participated vigorously at DU make you a fair and balanced kind of guy? I've been virtually inactive on the FR boards in the past two years and it's given me a different perspective: something you're clearly lacking. I've also remained a member in good standing: something you and Ben are also clearly lacking over at DU. You were banned for life quite recently, right? For hectoring people who didn't hate Bush enough to suit you, right? -- <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 15:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm banned from DU??? More lies! I post there at least once or twice a week. Like many who weren't very happy with Kerry being the 04 nominee (<i>"I vote Ham Sandwich"</i>), I was given a little 'vacation', but like almost everybody else who got 'purged', welcomed back with open arms. You're confused or lying again. It's you who's banned .... from Wikipedia! - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For John Titor</a></dd>

<dd>Since you have reviewed those posts, you can confirm that there was a period of two years in which I was virtually inactive; and that my most recent posts do not demonstrate any pro-FR partisanship. In particular, I've tried to provide some calming context and background for the "nuke them all and let God sort them out" crowd, and I think you can confirm that as well. My involvement in fundraising occurred over five years ago. As I said, I've gained a different perspective. Your lack of objectivity, on the other hand, is obvious. Also since you brought it up, I did bump the Wikipedia thread at FR, but that was clearly not a "call for action" as you've portrayed it. I was not one of the original participants on the thread. I bumped it after it had been inactive for about a year, simply to put it into my own cache for later reading. This is a common practice at FR. -- <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 15:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After several e-mails from my brother, I've sent you an e-mail outlining why I do not want to reactivate this account. If you want to contact me, it would be better to e-mail me because I'm never looking at this page again, and I will have to think long and hard before I even look at Wikipedia again. I trusted one of your administrators, he betrayed my trust and, as a result, the ghosts of the past have been reawakened. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 15:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moe, if you're reading this, I want my first name and last name to be put on whatever watch list you have. This is an unacceptable release of personal information by an administrator and by Wikipedia members. They should be blocked to protect other Wikipedians from similar releases of personal information. I want nothing to do with Wikipedia. Understand? I want nothing to do with Wikipedia, and I don't want Wikipedia or any of its stalkers to have anything to do with me or my family. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanFromPalatine_0d90.html" title="User:BryanFromPalatine">BryanFromPalatine</a> 20:06, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
