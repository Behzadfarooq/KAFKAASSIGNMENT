<p>so why, michelle, are you removing it? it's not about "doctoring" details to make someone look better - wikipedia is about the facts. So to remove it without comment, noting nothing more than "removing spam", is a bit rubbish. If "Guy" is not BA's middle name at birth, fine - change it to the correct name - but if it is, why dont you leave it alone?</p>
<p><br />
Hi! Thanks for your note. We have been dealing with this for years. His middle name was never Guy, i have his passport details here at the office. Plus, not on any single album of BA's has he ever used the name Guy and we assume this weird fact comes from his being born on Guy Fawkes day. Thanks for the links we will address them asap. Best Michelle1 23:31, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I heard Bryan Talk about his middle name in an interview. He said it is Guy and that his parents had a sense of humour........ Duncan</p>

<p>According to <a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.70.183.38.html" title="User talk:213.70.183.38">User_Talk:213.70.183.38</a>, these repeated removals are claimed by User:213.70.183.38 as coming from [bryanadams.com bryanadams.com] -- which does appear to be an official Web site. However, 213.70.183.38 (and these edits are coming from all kinds of different IP address) does not give any evidence that he/she was in fact authorized by Adams, or that these removed alleged facts were inaccurate. Above, obviously, the user's claiming to be "michelle booth" (and implicitly claiming to be authorized by Adams). (I think for these to be properly removable, <i>both</i> would need to be shown.) Anyone who has the time and the connections want to try to verify whether these edits were in fact coming from Adams' office?</p>
<p>And, "michelle booth" -- please note that I am not saying that your edits are factually inaccurate. However, as a matter of courtesy, I think it's up for you to show that these <i>are</i> factually accurate, rather than to march in and tell the Wikipedia community that it has to contact you if it wants to dispute these edits. That's not how Wikipedia works. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 10:49, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear who-ever you are,</p>
<p>We are currently on tour in Germany (hence the many IP addresses) and revising the page out here. your facts are NOT correct and that is why they have been removed. If you want to start a page on work done previous to Mr. Adams solo career, by all means, but please stop posting this on this page. Plus he did not live in France for several years, he did not go play music in the hall of schools in Canada etc etc. Furthermore, your insistance in changing the page back to what you wrote has deleted many of the additions we posted this morning. As i said in an earlier note, if you would like to discuss this with me i'm happy to. Cheers and thanks for being so interested in Bryan. Where are you based? Michelle</p>
<p>These are not <i>my facts</i>; these were written by somebody else. Again, I am not saying that they are true; however, the nature of Wikipedia is that effectively, people making edits should justify them. (Note that it's not just me who's reverting; other people were reverting your edits as well because you were not justifying them; now that you've given an explanation, as far as I'm concerned, this is sufficient. I don't know if other people agree, however.) And note that these reversions came as a result of your repeated failure to justify the edits despite calls for you to justify them. I have no interest in representing whether those things happened or not; that's outside my scope of knowledge. But please try to understand Wikipedia a bit better before you claim that these were <i>my facts</i>, in particular. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 11:05, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear whoever you are,</p>
<p>Do you work for wikipedia? Who are you? I never noticed the part of the site where you or / someone had asked for an explanation or justification until today. i'm not that technical, but i'm learning...fast. Moreover, you were the only one as far as i can see that was insisting on my justification, and if these were not "your facts" and you had no interest in representing whether they happened or not, then what do you care if the changes were made? If you are so concerned with the facts being correct then you should have researched them before you continually re-posted them. Anyway, all is understood. Regards Michelle</p>
<p>I don't work for Wikipedia. In fact, I don't think anyone works for Wikipedia. I'm just an interested user. For the history of the page (at which, if you have time to dig through the history of the page to see who added the allegations that you removed), click on "history" on top of the page.</p>
<p>But why I care if changes are made is that it is considered <i>rude</i> to remove facts withtout a good reason to -- and, with you repeatedly doing it <i>from anonymous IPs</i>, it made the changes themselves highly suspicious as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. Take a look at what sometimes happens that vandals do -- for example, the history of the page <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, a frequent target for vandals -- and you'll see that your behavior appeared suspicious.</p>
<p>Don't act as a bull in a china shop. If you're going to utilize Wikipedia as a new user, welcome, but don't act as if you exist outside the protocol that exists on Wikipedia.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am consitantly removeing references to work done previous to BA's musical history because it is factually incorrect. ie: BA did not play music in any schools in Canada, and did not live in France for several years.</p>
<p>Whoever keeps putting these notes up, please respect my letter and changes, as I work with BA everyday.</p>

<p>Setting hysterical adolescents aside: Michelle, if you open an editing account (free, easy, no strings) your edits can be tracked, and people can reply to you on your personal Talk page rather than here.

<p>I hope that my explanation was clear concerning our policies on original research and the citing of sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Create a separate listing where?</span></h2>
<p>Honestly, I don't think that we need to create a disambig page for "Bryan Adams" as the singer is by far the most notable Bryan Adams, but if someone types "Bryan Adams" into wikipedia looking for the hockey player, they need to be directed to the right place. In your revert, you said that I should create a sparate listing. Where do you suggest I create that separate listing? Many other pages have the "others" mentioned at the top of the page. Look at <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>. It has three "others" mentioned at the top. Why should Bryan Adams be any different than many other pages? I am putting <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Adams_%28hockey_player%29_88a6.html" title="Bryan Adams (hockey player)">Bryan Adams (hockey player)</a> back at the top of this page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">North Vancouver Residence</span></h2>
<p>To add a bit more about Bryan's life in British Columbia specifically. It is interesting that he received the Order of British Columbia but no mention of the period of his life that he spent there. Can anyone fill in the specific dates? I'd be interested.

<p><b>Michelle1</b> I noted that this was removed as 'repeated information'. Can you direct me to the location on the page which this statement repeats? When I first edited it, I did not see any reference to Bryan's life in the Vancouver area. (and I still don't). I beleived that Bryan was still living in North Vancouver at the time he was starting to enjoy his early success. I found it interesting that none of this was mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWIKIPEDIAVI_b2e9.html" title="User:WIKIPEDIAVI">WIKIPEDIAVI</a> 16:58, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early Years</span></h2>
<p>Maybe this is trivial, but shouldn't it be mentioned that in Bryan's early career he was in Sweeney Todd? He replaced Nick Gilder. Just thought that might be worth mentioning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it should. This page contains a very poor description of Adams' life and career. 88.108.177.37 00:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I've just added a single sentence to the article about his 1977 membership in Sweeney Todd <a href="../../../d/z/u/User%7EDzubint_0a90.html" title="User:Dzubint">Dzubint</a> 19:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added the sentence: "Bryan was briefly a member of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweeney_Todd_%28band%29_0d64.html" title="Sweeney Todd (band)">Sweeney Todd</a> in 1977, replacing vocalist Clark Perry for their <i>If Wishes Were Horses</i> album.", but then User:Michelle1 decided that was <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">Spam</a> and took it out. I've put it back in again, but I expect she'll take it out again and I don't care enough argue about it. So maybe someone else can revisit it in the future.

Anyone know where Bryan Adams spent his childhood? The biography says he traveled with his diplomatic parents in Europe and the Middle East. What countries did he live in exactly and when?? Maybe I've come across him and I don't know it!</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure about this but isn't "summer of 69" perhaps his biggest hit. It's not mentioned anywhere in the article <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 20:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

But i agree that <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_of_%2769.html" title="Summer of '69">Summer of '69</a> is also worth mentioning in the article.

<dd>Thank you. As a minor fan, it was just something that had caught my attention when reading through the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Princess Di</span></h2>
<p>In the article on Princess Diana, Bryan Adams is listed (and linked) in a list of puted paramours of the Princess. I haven't a clue whether that's true of false, and I don't care, so I have made no edits. However, the left hand should deal with what the right hand writes in an encyclopedia, so either this article, that article, or both need revision. Michelle can help by providing the 'official line' from Mr. Adams's side. Lamabillybob 02:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There were rumours that they had a relationship. Anyway, whether it's true or false, the 'official line' is bound to be "no". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 23:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
