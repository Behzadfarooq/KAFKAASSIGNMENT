<h2><span class="mw-headline">Catherine Palace images</span></h2>
<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>I'm still learning about images - I noticed that your positioning in individual thumbnails is now "none", but preceded by **div class="floatright"**</p>
<p>Could you please inform me more about this technique? How does this differ in effect from positioning each image "right"? I note that those editors with tiny monitors (800 px) object to the larger images - my theory is that a reasonably sized image may obviate the necessity of a click-through to what is in some cases an over-large image (see <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Gorges_Dam_1276.html" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a> and click on one of the first few images - I have not yet produced an intermediate as is needed in this case, not my contributed image), so I tend to prefer a 300 pixel minimum. I have also had a carefully constructed gallery destroyed by an editor - it appears that the editor did not like the detachment of image from text, as the gallery followed the text. This destruction resulted in some of the ugliest image layout I have yet seen on WP. I restored it by putting the gallery <i>before</i> the text and then referencing the specific image within the nested sub-article with a postage stamp sized image - see <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seismic_retrofit.html#Exterior_reinforcement_of_building" title="Seismic retrofit">seismic retrofit#Exterior reinforcement of building</a>. At least that has (thankfully) been left undisturbed for a while. Where a large number of images are to be shown I have been putting these in floating galleries (see <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html#Architecture" title="Shanghai">Shanghai#Architecture</a> as an example) specifically so that they may be of reasonable size, and where the image is central to the theme of the article, to make it large and prevent text wrapping with appropriate coding. See <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundial_Bridge_c1fa.html" title="Sundial Bridge">Sundial Bridge</a> for a large article preface picture with a trailing gallery. That article would definitely loose its impact with a smaller image as the image is a representation of the visual impact of the object. I do think that 250 pix is too small for my preferences in the particular case of Catherine Palace, but that a gallery is not yet appropriate for that article, and a large image would be inappropriate as the article is about the palace - not its visual importance as with the bridge article. What we really need is a variable image width by user screen width - at least it would be nice to set this up as a user preference. I think that there methods to get the user's width - at least the window size, but the Wiki engine would have to have some extensions to process this correctly.</p>
<p>By the way, what size monitor do you use and why did you feel that the images were <i>out of control</i> (a bit)?</p>
<p>Please respond here - I will watch your page.</p>

<dd>Heh, many comments in one. I'll try to answer them all.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, the div. I use the "classic" skin rather than the "monobook" skin, and although I didn't know it at the time the "monobook" skin apparently automatically stacks floating images in a column down the side of the page. In "classic" it doesn't; try switching your preference over to "classic" skin temporarily and have a look at the version before my edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Catherine_Palace&amp;oldid=5776516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Catherine_Palace&amp;oldid=5776516" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. All the images are in a row at the top instead of a column down the side, which squeezes the text into a tiny little column on the left. By turning off the built-in layout code (using the "none" keyword) I forced the images to form a column, and by wrapping the whole group in a div I was able to tell the whole group of images to float to the right. Here's a quick demo, using a div with a visible border (and note that I'm still in "classic" skin):</dd>

<dd>I have since learned that Monobook handles image layout better than Classic does, however, so I've mostly stopped doing that (but I haven't worried about going back and removing it from articles I've done that in, since it looks the same in Monobook either way). At some point I'm going to file a bug report and see if I can get Classic fixed to work like Monobook does.</dd>

<dd>As for resizing them down from 350 to 250 pixels, that was just due to my own personal preference for what a "good sized" thumbnail was. I agree that it'd be nice to have an adaptive thumbnail setting, once upon a time I used to just use the "thumbnail" keyword without specifying a size in the hopes that that would be implemented soon. Personally, I think Wikipedia articles should be primarily focused on the <i>text</i> and use images only to accentuate the text rather than as the main centerpiece of the article. Generally speaking I would only leave images larger than around 300 pixels if it was a map or diagram that would become illegible at smaller sizes. In my opinion a thumbnail should be large enough to let the reader know what's in the image so that he can decide if he wants to click and see the full-sized version and not much larger than that. However, I don't feel strongly enough about this that I'd argue if you made those images 350 pixels again.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:20, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much for your prompt and very informative response. I agree that many find 350 pixels too wide, but I feel that the 250 pixel WP "standard" is too small - I have been recently been setting to 300 pixels in the hope that this will stick, but it still gets downsized in some articles - which I why I have taken to galleries and (only in a few and especially appropriate cases), wide images isolated from the text (not only the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundial_Bridge_c1fa.html" title="Sundial Bridge">Sundial Bridge</a> but also a bridge panorama in the <a href="../../../w/u/h/Wuhan.html#History" title="Wuhan">Wuhan#History</a> section of the article. This latter example simply would not work well in a more restricted format. I admit to pushing the envelope further down in the article with the concert group panorama, especially since it is not isolated.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, I believe the Sundial Bridge article is a perfect illustration of what I said about how images should serve the text of the article rather than the other way around; that first 700 pixel image completely dominates the article, with the descriptive text about the bridge tucked away at the bottom where I have to scroll down to see it. Furthermore, at 700 pixels the image is too wide for people browsing on 640×480 or smaller screens (don't laugh, I bet Wikipedia's going to be a popular item for small handheld computers once a properly downloadable version is available&#160;:) and even an 800 pixel wide screen is a bit too small when you allow space for the sidebar, scrollbar, etc. And the image size is 93.5 kilobytes, which is a bit hefty for dialup users especially when combined with the four other thumbnails below. I'm going to shrink it down into a "conventional" right-floating thumbnail, I hope you won't mind too much. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:52, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I moved the main pix to the gallery - since it follows all text, this should answer your download objections. Note that some nontrivial computations are involved to get the images to flow without hangups (see my <a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonard_G._3c5e.html#Floating_galleries" title="User talk:Leonard G.">User Talk:Leonard G.#Floating galleries</a>. As the max size is now 505 wide [Sat AM - reduced to 404, other from 200 to 160, still looks good], this should be fine for small (800 pix) screens — <i>I do not believe the WP should be crippled by considerations for handhelds and cellphones - this should be a max image width option set as a user preference. This is a multimedia environment, after all.</i> Now if 505 [now 404] is too wide for 800 pix screens, all images in the gallery must be reduced in width <i>proportionally</i> to maintain image layout flow under various widths - but I do not expect that these should fit on a 256 wide (or whatever cellphones are) screen, It is bad enough that people are driving, walking and eating while <i>talking</i> on these infernal distractors, I don't want them <i>watching</i> too!

I set up two separate image flows to accommodate this problem. So this should work with various skins? - Leonard.</dd>

<dd>I did check the classic skin. Fortunately, monoblock works the same as classic when left aligned, the images stack in a wrapping row (otherwise my several floating galleries would not work). It appears that the problem is actually non-stacking to the right in monoblock, not a defect in classic. It would be nice to have more image control. Could you tell me how to get a centered image? That would be nice for certain isolated bridge images, e.g. first bridge at Wuhan and others that are by nature wide and short and cannot have text at the sides anyway ("center" does not work). -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 16:04, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There <i>used</i> to be a "center" tag that you could use in place of "left" or "right" in the wiki image markup, but unfortunately that got disabled at some point for reasons I'm not aware of. A lot of people do centering by setting the image's float tag to "none" and using a &lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt; tag pair, and although I don't like using deprecated HTML like that I don't know of a better way offhand. I never use it myself because I never center images, I always float them right.</dd>

<dd>Very nice! - (I pushed this to 550 pixels. What do you think is "too wide" in the context of a centered, text free image? I intend to use use this on a few important bridge images, including some not yet uploaded. These have 5 to 1 or better horizontal to vertical aspect ratio and would look very nice as centered, isolated images. If too narrow for a wide screen they might look strange, so I want to go for the max (excluding PDAs), which I think would be somewhere around 600 pixels. I will still force text isolation "br style=clear:both] as done above, even though a test (without colons) of the example above showed it to not put text into the margins - that may be skin specific.</dd>

<dd>The current Sundial Bridge images are 404/160/160/160/160. If you think this is still to wide the next appropriate size would be 303/120/120/120/120 - feel free to experiment. Note that the main bridge image at this size in isolation I would consider too small, but in the context of the numerous trailing narrow images it may look fine, as the context of the gallery allows the dramatic sweep of the initial image to be seen clearly. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 21:30, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>URGENT! Which browser do you use? I was at my son's house today and he uses IE on the Mac, was showing him some pages - YECHH!. This does not work - all pictures are on left, no text until after bottom most image. I am removing the div stuff and returning to old form. Center is OK because at worst on IE the pix is left, rather than centered (I always kill boardering text for these anyway). <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 03:53, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So exotic layout things should be tested in IE, right? Since "center" ... "/center" works, I tried it with "right", but this was worse as the coding was displayed on the page. Since the only problem is with one seldom used WP skin (the default setup is other than that), and there are millions (or as Carl Sagon would say ....) of IE users, we should not use the method suggested above.

<p>From <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_fictional_future_events.html" title="Timeline of fictional future events">Timeline of fictional future events</a>, you changed it to a distant future event with the claim that:</p>
<p><i>"actually, it's not 3991 or 1993 but some extremely far distant period in the future when the universe has begun collapsing towards a Big Crunch.)"</i></p>
<p>changing the content to:</p>
<p><i>"The Red Dwarf crew travels into the far distant future to a point after the Universe has begun collapsing towards a Big Crunch, causing time to run backwards until it is the equivalent of 1993 on Earth again (or 3991, as the locals write it). They spend three weeks there."</i></p>
<p>On what do you base this explanation? Yes, I understand reversing entropy and whatnot, but your explanation is the result of bringing in outside knowledge, and not necessarily the actual explanation. Unless the writers actually state that your explanation is the correct one, you can't claim it to be the correct one.</p>
<p>In any case, moving in reverse isn't going to make us write "3991" instead of "1993" (the numbers were all facing in the right direction). Time would move in reverse, but our actions wouldn't be mirrored like that. The use of "3991" is what is called "funny". Since that Earth was obviously meant to be some weird version of 1993 where time goes in reverse, we should ignore the "3991" as just being a joke, and put under 1993 that they traveled to a parallel universe or something where time was going backwards to their own. As for the "3991", you could add a comment in, something like "even the date was humorously written backwards as <i>3991</i>."</p>

HOLLY: (vo)  It's perfectly consistent with current theory.
Everything starts with a Big Bang, right? And the universe
starts expanding.  Eventually, when it's expanded as far as it
can, there's a big crunch, right? And everything starts
contracting. Perfectly possible that time starts running in the
opposite direction, as well.

<p>Thanks for showing some interest in the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weaubleau-Osceola_structure_99bc.html" title="Weaubleau-Osceola structure">Weaubleau-Osceola structure</a> article I wrote. Unfortunately, the formatting change you made to the images doesn't work well under Firefox or Mozilla browsers. And although it works with I.E., it that's not the effect I was after. Since the caption relates both of the images to each other I put it between them without it being attached in a box as a caption to either. Of course, when submitting the article to Wikipedia I agreed to allow "merciless" editing by others, so it's not "my" article any more. Before putting it back the way it was, I'm interested in knowing why you weren't satisfied with the way I had originally put the pictures and caption into a table. --<a href="../../../k/b/h/User%7EKbh3rd_5810.html" title="User:Kbh3rd">Kbh3rd</a> 15:57, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm. My main concern is that using tables for attaching captions to images isn't "meaningful", in that the software can't automatically understand that the caption text refers to the image and deal with it accordingly. Things like accessibility (alt tags), automatic removal or resizing of images, that kind of thing. So, when I see an image that has a caption attached to it via table, it's kind of reflex to just merge the two together in proper wiki formatting. A caption that refers to two different images is a bit awkward in that regard, though. How about I try splitting it between the two images, and see if that works better? Also, I'm curious in what way what I did "doesn't work" on IE and Mozilla. It looks fine to me in Firefox, and I was doing the same sort of thing routinely back when I was using Mozilla without trouble. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:12, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was working from strictly a visual perspective and hadn't thought of the uses of the caption as a form of meta-data attached to the image. It would be possible to not use "thumb" but still have a caption on the image that would show up on mouse-overs and be available for other computer-mediated uses, while maintaining the original visual layout. But what you've done works pretty well, too, and passes the "keep it simple" test. Maybe I'll play with it some more, or maybe I'll leave it be. Thanks for your contribution.</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. I use the "Classic" skin which doesn't have underlines under the headers, so I wouldn't see that problem on my browser one way or the other. One sec, I'll switch to monobook and check the old version... yup, there it goes; I get the same thing when I view in Monobook. Could it be that the PNG has a transparent background? Checking... yup, so it does. I suspect that if the background of the PNG was white this little bug would never have been noticed.&#160;:) Now that the thumbnail keyword is being used there's a box around the image that seems to be preventing the header underline from spilling over into it any more, but if you like I could switch the image over to a non-transparent white background as well. That would also prevent problems if for some bizzare reason someone decided to read Wikipedia with a black page background.&#160;:) I'm going to see if I can find a place to post a bug report about this, it seems likely nobody's ever noticed this happen before since it's a pretty unusual circumstance. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:39, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did remove a lot in terms of word count. But did you actually read both versions or just eyeball it? If the latter, please look again. The original was very poorly written, long-winded, and include a lot extraneous detail, such as practically the full text of the "challenge", which I shortened to a sentence. The details of the challenge were not especially interesting, unless you were planning to copy it for your own challenge. If you read it and still think there is something important lost, as I said on the discussion page, I will work it back in. I spent quite a lot of time working on those edits, with the aim of improving the article, and I would be saddened to simply have it lost, just because I made the article shorter. Surely these matters are not decided only by word count. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:03, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did read it, and while I agree that the current version is a bit wordy I still think that your version cuts out far too much.

<dd>As I said, I'm willing to work back in information that others think relevant, if I removed something that others think is relevant. Tell me what it is the relevant informat that I dropped.. This blanket reversion stuff is pretty discouraging. How do any of these articles ever advance except around the edges if every change of more than a sentence or two is immediately suspect and reverted all the time? It is very frustrating. For example, rather than revert me, why not simply edit back in the paragraphs where you think I overdid it? I am sure you didn't intend to be rude, but someone could easily take it that way. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:28, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I had <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_relativism.html" title="Moral relativism">moral relativism</a> watchlisted, saw you remove a link that seemed relevant without explanation, and clicked "user contributions" to see whether you were a vandal. I don't think you are, but that happened to be the one other example I found in my cursory search of an edit I disagreed with. As for why I didn't just edit back the bits I thought were over-trimmed, well, that would have ended up pretty much exactly like a revert anyway. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:01, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you might want to check out Universism which is probably going to be deleted. That link was added by someone promoting his article on the religion he invented last year called Universism. I left a lot of the links he created because the VfD process isn't finished yet, but I did remove links where I thought the links were gratuitous. It's true that Universism argues as the editor stated, but it is not distinctive in that regard. I left the sentence describing the argument, but made it a passive mode sentence.</dd>

<dd>I restored the link before I looked at the Universism page, since the section had "Universism" right in the title I figured it was pretty important to actually link there so people could find out what it meant. If Universism is ultimately deleted as an irrelevant fringe organization, then I'd have no problem with removing reference to it from moral relativism altogether. The current vote tally shows an even split on whether to keep or delete, though, which suggests to me that deletion is unlikely - <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Decision_Policy" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Decision Policy</a> suggests that consensus to delete is usually considered to be around a 2/3 majority.

<p>Bryan, that last removal was a glitch which I didn't intend. Not quite sure what happened. I was editing a section, and the article ended up consisting of just that section.

<p>Aloha. I noticed that you added/modified the image tag on the Doctor Who page, so I figured you might be the right person to ask a particular question, as I've been unable to find the answer to this question in the guideline or policy pages. What are the rules regarding screenshots of tv and film? I would like to be able to add them to a dozen or so pages but I haven't been able to confirm the acceptability of such edits.

<dd>It's my understanding that the use of screenshots to illustrate things being discussed in articles about them, when there's no other way to illustrate those things, is a classic example of exactly the reason why the "fair use" exemption to copyright is there in the first place. As long as the screenshots are labelled with an appropriate fair use template (like the Fatal Death one) there should be no problem. I don't know what the official Wikipedia policy is offhand but I'd be surprised if it said otherwise. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:30, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I'd recommend making the image out of full-sized screen captures, rather than uploading a smaller version. Someday Wikipedia may get printed and at that time we'll want every image to be as high a resolution as possible, until then the thumbnail feature will resize the image the same whether the source upload is big or small.

<p>Deleted - you can also use <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_for_deletion_61a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Images for deletion">Wikipedia:Images for deletion</a> to call for image deletions, if you don't want to have to hunt up admins to ask directly. If you think you're having cache problems, the way to solve it on most browsers that I'm aware of is to hold down the shift key while clicking on the reload button - for Mozilla-derived browsers and IE, at least, that causes the browser to ignore all cached files and go right back to the source. I had to do that myself when I first viewed the updated image at the old location, the size of the image had been updated in the HTML image display code but the old file was still being used, resulting in a hugely pixellated image. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:26, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My <i>watchlist</i> shows you managed to categorize four articles in under a minute! That's amazing. I work with categories a lot, and never get anywhere near that fast.

<dl>
<dd>Heh. Once upon a time I had someone make suggestions for the categorization bot they thought I was running, I'm glad I've still got it.&#160;:) The most important tool I've got in bulk categorization is the tabbed pane feature of my web browser, Firefox. Any tabbed browser should suffice, though. First, I open all of the pages that I'm going to be categorizing in separate tabs; I've configured Firefox to open links in new tabs in the background when I middle-click on them, so I just go down through the list of links middle-clicking each one (in my most recent spree I was working off of the stuff already in <a href="../../../h/i/g/Category%7EHigh_schools_0fb4.html" title="Category:High schools">Category:High schools</a>). If Wikipedia is being particularly sluggish, I'll then go through all the open tabs and click the "edit page" link on each of them before getting started on any actual editing; I'll sometimes have several dozen pages all loading in parallel in the background. Then, once everything's open and ready, I'll put the category tag I expect I'll be using most frequently into my clipboard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Scroll to bottom of article, control-V paste, hit tab to jump focus to the edit summary, control-V paste, hit tab to jump focus to the minor edit checkbox and hit space (optional, but categorization generally is a minor edit IMO), hit enter, then move on to the next tab while the edit saves in the background. In really simple situations I can do the whole sequence of actions in about three seconds. In this case I was going slower, since I needed to actually think about what sort of category tags to put in (I was also categorizing schools into the education-by-state categories, for example).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, once I've finished working on the batch of pages I'd opened, I wait until they all finish saving their changes and then close them all. And I'm ready to open up the next twenty or thirty pages to work on.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:37, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
