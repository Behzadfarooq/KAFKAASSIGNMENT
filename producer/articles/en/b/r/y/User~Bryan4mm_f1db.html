<p>[edit] Biography B-Harvey was born in Sacremento, California and is of Indian ancestery. When B-Harvey was six years old, he and his family moved from Sacremento, California to Caldwell, Idaho. There, B-Harvey attended a Christian school in Nampa, Idaho until the eighth grade. After eighth grade Bryan moved to public school and eventually graduated from Vallivue High school in Caldwell, Idaho. During high school Bryan formed a band named 4 Man Massacre (4MM) with fellow band mates Jeff, and Mckenzey, and Chaka. [edit] Music Career For more information please see; 4 Man Massacre. During high school, his friends Jeff Utter and Mckenzey Beshears wanted to start a band (which would later become 4MM). Unfortunately, they had several problems; chief amongst them was their lack of a drummer. Bryan suggested that his friend Josh Menchaca fill the position of drummer in the band. However, they didn't know how to play any instruments, but they knew that Mckenzey had a good voice and that Josh (Chaka) had a drum set. Bryan learned to play guitar and Jeff learned to play bass. Shortly after high school, the band broke up and Bryanmoved away to another place to live. He began constantly writing lyrics to songs that would eventually appear on the albums "Terror On The Rise". In a memorable reunion, the band played at the Imparts building in Boise, Idaho for several hundred fans during the farewell tour of The Partisans. Following the good reception from the fans, they decided to record an album. In 2006, "Terror On The Rise" was released on Creepsville Entertainment. On June 6th, 2006, 4MM fans rejoiced at the release of their album, "Terror On The Rise" on Creepsville Entertainment. [edit] Poetry and Novels Bryan is currently in the process of writing a novel with his band mates Jeff, and Mckenzey. He is also working on getting three out of five of his poetry books published. The title of the novel has not been released yet.</p>
