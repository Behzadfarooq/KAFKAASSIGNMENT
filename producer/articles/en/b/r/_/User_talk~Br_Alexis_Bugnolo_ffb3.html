Hello Br. Bugnolo; I've responded to your note on <a href="../../../a/n/s/Talk%7EAnselm_of_Canterbury_6935.html" title="Talk:Anselm of Canterbury">Talk:Anselm of Canterbury</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 01:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rather than starting an edit war, I recommend you seek whatever form of arbitration Wikipedia administrators can offer. I can't direct you to the correct page, because I don't know much about that myself. I do know that there is no <i>requirement</i> that a consensus be reached prior to an edit; it is only recommended as a means to prevent edit wars, etc. We have given that approach a good shot, but unfortunately it didn't work. So please take your complaint to the people in authority. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 23:29, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I have been also emailing him. I would be more productive if Karl Bunker had continued to participate in the discussion on the Talk Page, but as you can see from the entire discussion (in archives and what is visible) he was only concerned with his proposal and never attempted to comprimise, or allow any other proposal. The many RV I did, were only to put back what he erased. That is not vandalism, nor a 3RR violation. I even tried chaning it several times, to suit his fancy. But it seems that nobody is willing to look into the matter, only cite both sides. If you know a college educated equitable administrator at WP, please do invite him to take a closer look. Hipocrite was proposing a new version of what I had previously attempted to put on the Anselm page, but even though I guessed and wrote a new version before I saw Hipocrite's suggestion, they were nearly the same. It seems that accordign to Bunker, you cannot use the word "refute" "rebutt"; nor can you question his use of the words "passionate" "debate" etc.. He has a good deal of POV and uncited material in his Dilecto Dilectori, and I have said as much on the discussion page, without erasing his section, after he insisted it remained. I have show A LOT OF GOOD WILL in the last week, have freely identified myself as who I really am, publically, choosen my own name as a user name at WP, cited by education and website, and why I believe I know something about the matter, why I was invited to poste comments; I began a debate before editing anything, and I continued that even after Karl left the debate and started to edit his own POV onto the page. Seeing that no admit stopped him or faulted him, even though I contacted David (see talk page), it seemed that there would be no problem adding another more appropriate section, marking this as under dispute and that Karl Bunker would leave it be; but NO, he thinks that he is allowed to edit the page, and no one else, and is guarding it as his own property, because EVERY single time I edited it, he RV edited it. And no one faulted him for it, until I reported it. And then what do I get for my good will, a 24 hr block? If this sort of thing is multiplied accross WP, you will soon have no one of good will participating.--<a href="../../../b/r/_/User%7EBr_Alexis_Bugnolo_778d.html" title="User:Br Alexis Bugnolo">Br Alexis Bugnolo</a> 17:52, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I got your emails. The 3RR rule is not about who is right, it merely gives a time out in an edit war, trying to force the 3RR violators to discuss their dispute on the talk page instead of fighting an edit war. I do not prefer one version over the other, hence I have blocked you both. This is also not against you personally. About "Sockpuppetry": That would have to be checked, please do so after your block expires or is lifted. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 14:47, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is not a violation of the 3RR rule to revert a vandalized section, a section which already has a NNPOV marker dispute, which asked readers/editor to see the discussion page, before touching it; how can it be equitable to cite me for violating the 3RR rule, when I infact only restored a vandalized section. Your decision has left Karl Bunker's vandalism as the current version of the article. If you were equitable, you would have reverted it, before his last edit, or before he added the section "Dilecto Dilectori" earlier this week, since it is he, not I, who is insisting that one person's view (his own) be represented on the page.</dd>

<dd><b>Thank you for this consideration.</b> I guess that if you are a sloppy speller, or editor, and go back and fix your mistake, or put in a POV and then saw that it was a POV and then RV to remove it, that you can without forethought or malice materially violate the 3RR rule. I will try to use the preview box from now own, and give my edits more thought first. The facility with which one can use the interface to edit, without there being any warnings to the contrary, gives a new user like me the impression that he is doing something expected and normal. Or otherwise, why not put in the interface a counter, limiting to 3 edits every 24 hours, and saying so as much, right up front. However, I do not believe that many of my RV edits were truly RV's, because most of my edits were corrections to my own edits.--<a href="../../../b/r/_/User%7EBr_Alexis_Bugnolo_778d.html" title="User:Br Alexis Bugnolo">Br Alexis Bugnolo</a> 17:54, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Changing your own edits is OK, as are multiple consecutive edits. Also, I would be surprised if an admin would block anybody if there is no dispute. Two or more editors working together are not a problem, and this frequently happens on current news pages (i.e. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>, or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>).

<p>Hello Alexis. I'd noticed you were new, and I'd assumed you weren't clear on the details of the 3RR, given the nature of the report (which is partly why I didn't want to deal with it myself, not being sure how long I'd be around to deal with the aftermath). As Chris says, a revert is an edit, or a series of edits, that returns an article to some recent previous state, in whole or in significant part. Only <i>clear</i> vandalism is excepted from the 3RR. There's certainly no limit to three <i>edits</i> per 24 hours: you can make as many non-revert edits as you wish, and if your "revert" takes five edits rather than one, it's still just one revert. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:28, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
