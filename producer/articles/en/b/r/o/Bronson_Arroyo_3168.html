<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronson_Arroyo_3168.html" title="Edit section: Professional career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional career</span></h2>
<p>As of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, Arroyo has compiled a 47-44 record with 551 <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeout.html" title="Strikeout">strikeouts</a> and a 4.21 <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_Run_Average_b497.html" title="Earned Run Average">Earned Run Average</a> in 829 <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings_pitched.html" title="Innings pitched">innings pitched</a> in seven seasons. He has one career save. Arroyo's <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fastball.html" title="Fastball">fastball</a> is in the 87-92 miles-per-hour range. While it's considered average among major league pitchers, it has excellent movement and Arroyo is adept at "spotting" it. He also throws a hard <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slider.html" title="Slider">slider</a> that moves away from right-handed batters, and a straight <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changeup.html" title="Changeup">changeup</a> as well. Arroyo's best pitch is his curveball. He throws the pitch from multiple arm angles and is known to throw it in any count. The angle of the curveball itself can vary from a straight 12-6 to a sweeping 1-7. Arroyo's delivery is somewhat unique; he incorporates a leg kick in his pitching motion, extending his front leg completely straight and lifting it up to a level above his waist before delivering the ball. His kick often appears to reach head level and deceives hitters with its exaggerated motion. From the set position, his leg-kick is much less pronounced and his delivery to home plate is very quick by major league standards. As a result, Arroyo is one of the better pitchers at holding runners on base.</p>
<p>Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 1995 draft, Arroyo made his major league debut with Pittsburgh in 2000. He came to the Boston Red Sox after being selected off waivers before the 2003 season. Arroyo improved in 2004, while jumping from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_relief_pitcher.html" title="Middle relief pitcher">middle relief</a> to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starting_pitcher.html" title="Starting pitcher">starting</a>, to strengthen his role as the Red Sox No. 5 starter. He compiled a 10-9 mark with a 4.03 ERA in 178.2 innings, while posting a very respectable 3.02 <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeout-to-walk_ratio.html" title="Strikeout-to-walk ratio">strikeout-to-walk ratio</a> (142-to-47). His most productive season came in 2005, when he posted career-highs in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Win_%28baseball%29.html" title="Win (baseball)">wins</a> (14), starts (32), innings (205.1) and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_pitched.html" title="Games pitched">pitching appearances</a> (35). He also excelled at holding runners, as he only gave up five <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a>.</p>
<p>Before the 2006 season, Arroyo signed a three year $11.2 million contract with the Red Sox. Arroyo said the deal was a "hometown discount" and agreed to the terms against the advice of his agent. Arroyo was later traded during spring training of the 2006 season for <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outfielder.html" title="Outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wily_Mo_Pe%C3%B1a_0b03.html" title="Wily Mo Peña">Wily Mo Peña</a>. <a href="http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060320&amp;content_id=1356543&amp;vkey=pr_cin&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cin" class="external autonumber" title="http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060320&amp;content_id=1356543&amp;vkey=pr_cin&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cin" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The year 2006 has certainly been his best year yet. Highlights of the season included a major-league leading 3,852 pitches, league-leading 240 2/3 innings pitched, his first selection to an All-Star game, as well as his first career shutout in the major leagues.</p>
<p>In February 2007, Arroyo signed a contract extension with the Cincinnati Reds which will keep him with the organization through the 2010 season, with an option for the year 2011.</p>
