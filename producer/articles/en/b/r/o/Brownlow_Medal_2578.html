<p>The <b>Charles Brownlow Trophy</b>, better known as the <b>Brownlow Medal</b> and colloquially as <b>Charlie</b>, is the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal.html" title="Medal">medal</a> awarded to the "<a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_and_fairest.html" title="Best and fairest">best and fairest</a>" player in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> during the regular season (ie not including finals matches) as decided upon by umpires. It is regarded as the most prestigious award for individual players in the league. Though often referred to as the "best and fairest", the official terminology is "fairest and best", reflecting an emphasis on sportsmanship and fair play. It was named after a Geelong player and long-serving administrator who was active in the early days of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Football_League_a3a4.html" title="Victorian Football League">Victorian Football League</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Brownlow_d546.html" title="Charles Brownlow">Charles Brownlow</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Edit section: Voting Procedure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Voting Procedure</span></h2>
<p>Under the current procedures, the three field <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28Australian_rules_football%29_c5ec.html" title="Umpire (Australian rules football)">umpires</a> (those umpires who control the flow of the game, as opposed to goal or boundary umpires) confer after each match and award 3 votes, 2 votes and 1 vote to the players they regard as the best, second best and third best in the match respectively. There have been different voting procedures for short periods in the past - votes were the responsibility of the media until the 1930s, and; in 1976 and 1977, the first two years after a second field umpire was added, each umpire individually gave his 3-2-1 - but the prevailing system has been used for the vast majority of Brownlow Medal counts.</p>
<p>On the awards night, the votes over the home and away (regular) season are tallied and the eligible player or players with the highest number of votes is awarded the medal. In the past, only one winner was allowed, and ties were decided on a countback system, which took into account such statistics as matches played. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Fothergill_0179.html" title="Des Fothergill">Des Fothergill</a> and Herb Matthews tied for the medal and could not be separated on countback, so neither player received the real medal. Nowadays it is possible for multiple medals to be awarded in the event of a tie, and in 1989, players who had tied on votes but lost on countback were given retrospective medals.</p>
<p>The integrity of the award is upheld by the tight security and secrecy surrounding the votes. Once the umpires make their decision, the votes are locked away and transported by armoured security vehicles. No one except the three umpires know exactly who has been voted for, and as different umpires vote on different games, no one can be sure of who will win. Unlike most award ceremonies, the votes are not tallied or even opened until they are actually announced on the night, so the drama is maintained until late on the actual night, when the result sometimes comes down to the very last round of votes.</p>
<p>The method of selecting the Brownlow has occasionally come under scrutiny. The Brownlow winners contain a preponderance of midfield players and relatively few "key-position" players, with some of the game's greatest players (for instance, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Carey_4570.html" title="Wayne Carey">Wayne Carey</a>) never coming close to winning a medal despite having high reputations amongst their peers and coaches. The problem is that players who are most valuable to their teams are not necessarily viewed favourably by umpires, and their positions and playing style sometimes means they don't attract enough attention. Several prominent coaches, including <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Sheedy_d102.html" title="Kevin Sheedy">Kevin Sheedy</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Matthews_1d35.html" title="Leigh Matthews">Leigh Matthews</a> (who on 202 votes has the second most Brownlow votes in history and yet never won it), have publicly criticised the selection process, proposing that coaches or players votes be used instead. The exclusion of suspended players is also debated, but the AFL's desire to promote a good image for the game makes it unlikely that this aspect of the award will change in the near future.</p>
<p>Some bookmakers offer betting on the winner of the Brownlow. A number of well-publicised "plunges" on unlikely winners has led to increasingly elaborate security measures to ensure the Brownlow votes are kept secret until the vote count.</p>
<p><a name="Ineligibility" id="Ineligibility"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Edit section: Ineligibility">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ineligibility</span></h2>
<p>Historically, players who are suspended at some time during the season by the AFL's disclipinary tribunal for serious on-field offences (for instance, punching another player) were ineligible for the award. Suspended players have tallied the highest number of votes for the award on several occasions. This first occurred in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, when <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corey_McKernan_091a.html" title="Corey McKernan">Corey McKernan</a> received the same number of votes as winners <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hird_bbf9.html" title="James Hird">James Hird</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Voss_4868.html" title="Michael Voss">Michael Voss</a>, but was ineligible due to suspension. (Interestingly, McKernan would be named the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Matthews_Trophy_fc2b.html" title="Leigh Matthews Trophy">AFL Players Association MVP</a> in the same year.) In the following year, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Grant_bafa.html" title="Chris Grant">Chris Grant</a> of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a> had the most votes, but a one-week suspension ruled him out of the Brownlow Medal, which went instead to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Kilda_Football_Club_349f.html" title="St. Kilda Football Club">St. Kilda</a>'s <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Harvey_%28footballer%29_e381.html" title="Robert Harvey (footballer)">Robert Harvey</a>.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the criterion for ineligibility is to have 100 base points levied by the Tribunal for an infraction in the season. This means that it is now possible for a player to be suspended, but still win the Brownlow. As an example, a player carries 93.75 points from a reprimand from the previous season, and commits an infraction worth 75 base points - this brings his tally to 168.75, which is enough for a one-week suspension, even with an early plea. Despite the suspension, this player would still be eligible for the prize. Similarly, a player can be ineligible, despite not having been suspended. This most commonly happens when a player is levied 125 base points, but it is reduced to 93.75 with an early plea - sufficiently low to avoid a suspension. This new system is slightly more confusing, slightly controversial, but also slightly fairer.</p>

<p>The awards ceremony has become increasingly elaborate, with footballers and their partners gradually becoming more fashion-conscious and this aspect of the night becoming widely reported by <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gossip_column.html" title="Gossip column">gossip columns</a>. The ceremony is held at <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Casino_72ea.html" title="Crown Casino">Crown Casino</a>, Melbourne on the Monday 5 days prior to the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Grand_Final_9ad3.html" title="AFL Grand Final">AFL Grand Final</a>. In years past, prospective Grand Final players have attended the ceremony in person. However non-Victorian Grand Finalists are refusing to attend the ceremony in Melbourne due to the inconvenience of travel in such an important week. A live video link to Brownlow functions in their home city is done instead.</p>
<p>From 1959 until 1974 radio stations including <a href="../../../3/u/z/3UZ_cd90.html" title="3UZ">3UZ</a>, <a href="../../../3/k/z/3KZ_fd10.html" title="3KZ">3KZ</a> and <a href="../../../3/a/w/3AW_abaf.html" title="3AW">3AW</a> broadcast the vote counts. <a href="../../../s/e/n/SEN_1116_b525.html" title="SEN 1116">SEN 1116</a> covered the 2004 count. Direct television telecasts began in 1970 at the Dallas Brooks Hall and have occurred every year since.</p>
