<p>Anything else I'll have to research, but the K was the local service after 1968. Both "J" skip-stops ran express (one-way) on Broadway. When the K was killed, the local stations east of Myrtle Avenue became skip-stop. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 05:36, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, you were justifying your move of it from the short run column. I was debating that with myself, and decided on a strict interpretation of 'short runs'. Though I also agree with putting it in local, since it was THE local service even if it stopped short. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 07:29, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It clearly shows the Broadway Bklyn Local running pm rush hours to/from Crescent and Rockaway, but no 111th or Atlantic runs. This may have changed before then. The afternoon rush full local (Jamaica Local) is grouped in with the rest of the locals, though I guess I could see it being 14.

<dd>You can't rely on NYCTA maps (especially of that era) for permutations of service. For example, both Banker's Specials stil ran in 1966, but you'll won't see them on any public map. You won't find through Brighton-Franklin service on <b>any</b> BofT or NYCTA map I know of, yet it ran by various configurations into the '60s. Nor the Franklin-Nassau, including on BMT maps.</dd>

<dd>Yes, at least as late as 1962 I have records of all the variants of eastern 14 destinations. After that, I know there were short lines to Atlantic and Crescent (I rode them right up to Chrystie) but can't say about 111. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 06:30, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmmm. This is getting rather annoying, not being able to trust any source to be complete. There's also the whole citing sources thing - while I trust your personal recollections, others may not, and it's likely that a future researcher doing a comprehensive study, and looking back on this page, would have some doubts. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 06:46, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't get at it right now, but my 1962 source is the NY Division ERA Bulletin, which had a service rundown, including operating times. As a significant aside, I would <b>never</b> accept Wikipedia as primary research where it really counts. Even where there are sources cited (such as the historical material at nycsubway.org) they are almost invariably from secondary or tertiery sources.</dd>

<dd>I was thinking more of someone going and using the references to check facts (as I've been doing for all the dates, whenever possible). I definitely try to use primary sources - newspaper articles, official maps and service notices are what I have, and for the latter two only what other people have been kind enough to put online, and for the former only the New York Times, and that only until the summer. Unfortunately I've found even glaring errors in <a href="http://thejoekorner.quuxuum.org/Indhistory.htm" class="external text" title="http://thejoekorner.quuxuum.org/Indhistory.htm" rel="nofollow">a table from the ERA Bulletins</a> (though admittedly it may have been introduced in the translation) - West 4th to East Broadway opened on 1-1-1936, not 10-7-1933. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 07:22, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for the lecture about historical research, but I've been doing it for a long time, and even (sometimes especially) newspapers can be notoriously incorrect. The most important issue is knowing the source, and your trust in it. I commend you for the extent that you have gone to in looking for confirmations in the New York Times, but there is too much "History by Google" going on now, and Wikipedia is a prime repository for such.</dd>

<dd>As to not being able to trust sources as complete, this is unavoidable. For more accuracy, you need access to employee timetables, and even if you have those, you can't be sure that a particular train operated as stated on a particular day--for that you need bulletins and records from the towers and/or personnel and operations departments. Even photos aren't reliable unless you are certain of what the photo was. Example: was a particular train with interesting signage regular service, an emergency reroute or a fan trip? Example: the photo showing "KK Nassau Street" to 57th Street. We do the best we can, combining documentary evidence with personal knowledge and Sherlock Holmes-ing. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 07:02, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a hypothetical question, how accessible are these primary records? Is it the kind of thing that would be in a big records room that might be unorganized but accessible to the public, a records room that's closed to the public, or only among private railfans that have inherited various pieces? --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 07:22, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It varies. The Municipal Archives contains (they claim) copies of parking tickets given to horses-and-carriages 200 years ago. Yet, some of the most important material in the City's history came close to destruction not that long ago when adjacent offices suffered a fire. At least they are now conscious of the value of these items, but the budget for protecting these historical tidbits probably rivals one of Mayor Mike's lunch tabs. The budget for restoring and making these items accessible is even less. But to answer your question directly: the Transit Museum has taken charge of a lot of what the TA has; it is supposed to be accessible to researchers by appointment--I haven't done this so I don't know how much they have and how helpful they are. Time was (pre-JV Lindsay) when a lot of agencies let you rummage to your heart's content if you wore a suit and looked honest--now even the Historical Societies give you dirty looks.</dd>

<dd>What would I <i>expect</i> to find in the Transit Archives? Photos for sure. Maps probably. Very possibly employee TT. But I wouldn't hold out to much hope for tower records and personnel sheets. People asking railroads in general: "My Uncle Fester worked for your railroad in 1898, do you have any information on him?" the answer is almost invariably no. Some railfans have picked up some of these things, but you need to know who has what. I don't anyone (living) who has what we would want. I myself picked up an IRT Timekeeping Book 40 years ago which is pretty boring mostly but has a few interesting little notes of the type we would like. Where did I get it? I picked it out of the TA trash. I'll leave it to your imagination how much made it into the trash but never made it out again. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 07:48, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, and you think this is bad, try finding old routes of numbered highways, especially in states where numbered highways don't have to be state-maintained!
