<p>Ever since meeting Ridge, their relationship has been troubled. Ridge has always loved other women more than her, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_Spencer_Forrester_696c.html" title="Caroline Spencer Forrester">Caroline Spencer</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Johnson_b3fd.html" title="Joanna Johnson">Joanna Johnson</a>) and Taylor. Brooke used to feel that Ridge was her "destiny", and has done many things over the years in order to make sure she'd stay as his default girl. Finally in 2004 (after eight marriages, four of them to Ridge but only one of those valid) Brooke gave birth to Ridge's son RJ (Ridge Junior).</p>

<p>When Ridge left Brooke for Caroline, Eric consoled Brooke and they fell in love. She became pregnant with Eric Jr (Rick). Eric divorced Stephanie and married his love Brooke. Brooke got pregnant again, with Bridget, but didn't know the paternity of the baby: was it Eric or Ridge? After one misleading test (tampered with by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_Carter_0168.html" title="Sheila Carter">Sheila</a>), it was proven Eric was the father. Eric and Brooke divorced after 2 years of marriage. The pair remarried in 2005 as part of a scheme to keep Bridget and Nick together - which was to convince Bridget that Brooke was not going to steal Nick from her. The marriage was dissolved only months later. Eric has now returned to Stephanie.</p>

<p>Thorne pursued Brooke. Thorne's fiancee <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy_Alexander_8707.html" title="Macy Alexander">Macy Alexander</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbie_Eakes_51fc.html" title="Bobbie Eakes">Bobbie Eakes</a>) was left out in the cold by family. The whole family was against Brooke and Thorne's relationship, but was forced to accept it in the end, and the couple married. Six months later, Brooke realized she was still in love with Thorne's brother Ridge. They annulled their marriage.</p>

<p>After unsuccessfully trying to seduce Ridge away from his wife Taylor, Brooke sought comfort with her daughter's husband Deacon Sharpe, who she thought was no longer in a relationship with her daughter. Brooke became pregnant with Hope, and almost lost her daughter Bridget (then played by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Finnigan_2709.html" title="Jennifer Finnigan">Jennifer Finnigan</a>) in the process because of the affair with Bridget's husband. She broke up with Deacon, and later fought for custody of Hope with him. Deacon had to back off. His whereabouts is still unknown and he may pop up anytime.</p>

<p>After being disappointed by Ridge, Brooke started seeing the new man in town, Dominick "Nick" Payne. Little did she know he was Ridge's half-brother. They had a beautiful love story. Brooke went back to Ridge, but her feelings for Nick weren't completely gone. Thinking that Ridge had been murdered by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_Carter_0168.html" title="Sheila Carter">Sheila Carter</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberlin_Brown_2746.html" title="Kimberlin Brown">Kimberlin Brown</a>), Brooke slept with Nick and got pregnant, and again wasn't sure of the paternity of the child. Ridge (who turned out to be alive after all) was proven to be the father of a boy they named Ridge Junior, aka RJ. Nick went on to marry Brooke's daughter Bridget when he learned that she was pregnant with his child, but the feelings between Nick and Brooke never went away. Eventually Bridget lost the baby and decided to give Nick his freedom so that he could be with his true love Brooke. Brooke married Nick, but Ridge´s constant unwantend interference caused Nick to embark on a drunken one-night stand with a sympathetic Bridget who pushed herself on Nick, resulting in another pregnancy. Nick soon revealed to Brooke that Bridget was pregnant with his child. A furious Brooke stormed dumped him and rebounded back to Ridge, not realising that Bridget's baby was actually fathered by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante_Damiano_1167.html" title="Dante Damiano">Dante Damiano</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Sabato%2C_Jr._c5d9.html" title="Antonio Sabato, Jr.">Antonio Sabato, Jr.</a>). Bridget lost the baby, but yet Nick had vengeance on his mind after his mother fell over a balcony during an argument with Stephanie. To get even with Stephanie, he bullied her husband, Eric, to sell Forrester Creations to him, or else Stephanie would be going to jail for assault on his mother. He got the company, making enemies of the entire Forrester family in the process; and even Brooke stunned him by selling her shares to him and leaving him.</p>

<p>Brooke was the daughter of Stephanie Douglas Forrester's old college rival Beth Logan. Brooke and Stephanie have never liked each other and over the years have had many major arguments. Stephanie can never accept Brooke's relations with any of the men in her family or the fact that Brooke at one point took over control of the family company. Stephanie was able to regain control of the company, but was still driven to sever the family's ties with Brooke once and for all. However, in a surprising about-face, Stephanie has now embraced Brooke and given her 50% percent ownership of Forrester Creations, after her son Ridge nearly died from a heart attack brought on by anger over Stephanie's continuing disdain for Brooke, but things changed after Brooke married Nick (Stephanie wanted Brooke and Ridge together). Stephanie asked for Brooke to return the stock because she was not part of the family any longer. Brooke refused to give back the stock and now Stephanie plots to regain control of Forrester Creations. However, since Brooke left Nick and is now back with Ridge, Stephanie and Brooke's relationship has improved significantly as they have now have made an alliance against Nick and Jackie who bought Forrester Creations.</p>
