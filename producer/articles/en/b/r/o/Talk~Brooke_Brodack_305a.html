<p>Other people, myself included, have tried to make wikis about popular youtubers. They have been deleted within seconds of them being put onto the site. One of the administrators said, I quote: What the hell is h doing maing wikis about people like that "there are 85.3 billion other people who put videos on youtube" (she/ he does not realize only 60 billion live in this world). This user should be no exception. She uses youtube to get to fame than gets a wiki made by her? Last I checked she isn't famous. 3/4 of the UK do not know who she is, even people in Africa know who Madonna is. Sorry but she's had her 15 MEGABYTES of fame... doesn't the Wiki server cost around $700,000? I have no "beef" with her, there are even more famous youtubers, brookers ranks fourth, yet they do not have their own Wiki.--<a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmnion_1990_8839.html" title="User:Omnion 1990">{{subst:js|User:Lupin/recent2.js}}</a> 23:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest you do a google search of her name, you will find that she is the top result with quite a few news stories. I have included references for one of those - soon to be expanded. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">Wikipedia:Notability (memes)</a> states that a person who is <b>only</b> associated with their meme should be included on the meme page. This is not the case for Brooke however, she has been given a job by Carson Daly (as stated in the article) which has earned her more than a few news stories. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She has only been signed on for 'Talent expantion and training'. One article stated she was going to be doing web-based clips for MTV if certain conditions were met.

<p>Oh my... what has Wikipedia become... has much as I like her, there is 0 reason to give her an article here!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>She's an internet phenomena, has a huge fanbase and has just been signed for a television development deal so she might actually become a tv persona before to soon. So yeah, I think she merits a inclusion. It's not like anyone plastered on Youtube is featured here, but she is something of a break out talent and has made history in a way in which she is the first person ever to starting up her professional career exclusively through this media.

<p>A quick google hit search does not return many hits (less than 1000), and she has been featured in only 2-3 small articles. A 'calandar article' of the LA Times newspaper is boarderline, as pets have been featured in there. Does that make them notable?

<p>No, it really is Brodack. She did use the name "Broderick" in one video, back in December, when she was still a semi-anonymous YouTuber; at that time, it made sense for her not to reveal her real last name (just like she did not reveal it on her MySpace page, either). It was revealed publicly revealed only in June, when an article announcing her Carson Daly deal appeared in _Variety_. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Grodzins (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grodzins_01bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grodzins">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>We have millions of American parents worried about what their progeny are doing on MySpace and here is a possibly genius 20-year-old who not only can show the way, open doors and minds, but who will most likely survive her 15 minutes, and someone wants to delete her from WP as "not relevant" ...&#160;?

<dd>Wiki is NOT for listing every person that has 15 minutes of fame. Outside of YouTube, most Americans have no idea who she is.

If you drop her name on Fark.com, Slashdot, or any of the other widely popular forms or sites, she is just not notable enough for people to know who she is. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 14:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you have anything to back that up? Considering the news coverage she got, you can assume that more than a few people have heard of her. Also remember that YouTube has a traffic rank of 17 (alexa) fark has one of 736 and slashdot has a rank of 165. So someone who has risen to stardom amongst the YouTube community is more than likely to have been noticed by people who frequent other high traffic forums. I think considering the high profile of YouTube and the "first" nature of her contract that it is highly unlikely that Fark and slashdot users are unaware of her existence. (which is actually beside the point, she has had significant news coverage and fark and slashdot are not a measure of someones popularity - they create more short bursts of activity than anything else I know of) <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not going by the "conract" with Carson Daily, because it's not a final thing. Contracts can be broken.

<dd>Its not up to an admin to decide the notability. The article doesnt fit into any of the requirements for a speedy deletion, so Bschott has taken it to AfD.

<dd>I wasn't asking for deletion by an admin. Just an opinion. There isn't a whole lot of need-to-know information, about her, so I don't think this article is a worthy cause. At the moment, she is like the other famous youtube users. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHuman_historian_7a19.html" title="User:Human historian">Human historian</a> 06:54, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At the moment, yes, the article is not merited. She might become something noteworthy in herself in time, but she's not there yet. (I'd put money on it happening, but it's still the future.) However, in the context of a historical view of the colossal change of media, Brookers, with her cross-media jump and, more importantly, her validation of online video as a proving grounds for media talent, represents a pivotal figure. I really mean no offense when I say this: I find it a bit ironic that a "Human Historian" would argue against the noteworthiness of such a figure. Really. Anyway, she, as the aforementioned media phenomenon, deserves a note in at least the YouTube article. There's my opinion. 63.249.64.32 03:05, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well you can try putting any mention of her on the YouTube article itself, but the community concensus is 'Famous Users' shouldn't be there. Look at the talk page and history. Anytime she is added, she is immediately removed and the general concensus is she isn't noteworthy to be on the page. Why she is noteworthy enough to get her own page is beyond me, however there is a merger proposal happening right now that may combine Brookers and Em's pages together into a 'Famous YouTube Users' article and then add in other well known users. So far the concenus on that is 'go with the merger' so the ADF here is pointless as this page may not exist much longer anyway...since it's looking like it will be merged.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 03:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not so much that I'm against mention of her. I just don't think she has enough need-to-know info to have her own page. I don't see what that's ironic.

<p>Brooke Brodack is the FIRST YouTuber to get a contract from Hollywood. This is a milestone--a piece of showbiz history in and of itself--and so makes her worthy of at least a short entry. Also, the publicity given her is quite extensive, and so curiosity about her is quite high, and the Wikipedia should respond to that. If you look on Google News, you'll see that the articles on her in _Variety_, the LA _Times_, and the _Globe_ have been extensively reprinted, including in the foreign press; her story has also been reported NPR, _USA Today_, and in the _Wall Street Journal_ (where she's described as THE "crossover star").</p>

<p>There has been discussion of Merging all the Notable YouTube users into one article.

<p>A contract can be broken by both parties. I think it's too soon to give her a stand-alone article. Then saying that she is the first person to get a Hollywood contract thru YouTube is a bold statement, everything dosen't end up in the newspapers or on TV see! I bet there is other people getting a foot into the business as I write this, and even before Brooke, but maybe they are laying low (I'm talking about: musicians, designers, actors, comedians, cameramen, writers etc etc etc). And until she is aired for the first time on public TV or cable, she dosen't need her own article. And there is not enought need-to-know info about her yet. And as the article look right now it seems it's written by "fans", if you know what i mean. I dont have anything against her personally, but this article just seems to be unecessary right now......And remeber we are 6,5 billion people on this planet (that's a hell alot of people!) and if you put that in the perspective of getting like 2 million hits (also remeber that people click on the clips over and over again so that means that it's not 2 million hits watched by tha same amount of people, but maybe only 1 - 1,5 million that have seen the clip, see what I'm saying!) on YouTube it is hardly even detecteble......It's too soon friends....She's not there....YET!</p>

<p>I have reverted the redirect to the notable youtube users article because I believe 1. this wasn't done with enough discussion - especially considering the AfD and the discussion above and 2. I believe she warrants her own article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>She derives her notability solely from YouTube, not from anywhere else. The article in question is an attempt to merge them together to show people who have had significant media coverage in their own countries, of which she appears to be one. There's no point in having her own article - rather it should be part of the YouTube page.

<dd>Her notability is now coming from her involvement with the new website as well as her youtube appearances. She has recieved a significant amount of press coverage and so (look at the afd) it was decided that she warranted her own article, unlike many of the others. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:07, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone removed the external links to Brodack's YouTube and Myspace profiles, citing Wikipedia's policy on external links. I have placed both links back, as I do not believe they violate the policy. While the external links policy states that links to sites which fail to provide licensing information should be avoided, it also states that, "Except where noted, this list does not override the list of what should be linked. For example, if the subject of an article has an official website, then it should be linked even if it contains factually inaccurate material." The restored link to Brodack's YouTube profile does not link to any particular video clip for which licensing information is not provided. Brodack became famous on YouTube, and YouTube is the primary reason this article exists. Unless Wikipedia institutes a blanket policy of prohibiting any links to YouTube (which would include removing the link to the YouTube homepage from the external links section of the article on YouTube itself), the link to Brodack's YouTube profile should remain here. Likewise, Myspace in general may have a problem with people using copyrighted material without permission, and the Wikipedia external links policy may discourage links to personal blogs, but Brodack is in Wikipedia because she is an Internal Phenomena, and failing to provide a relevant link to her personal blog on the internet doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Again, the link to her Myspace is not a link to any particular content on Myspace with a copyright in dispute, and unless there is a blanket policy not to link to Myspace under any circumstance, the link in this case is relevant and appropriate.</p>
