	    <p>I recently did a massive cleanup of this article and removed a lot of irrelevant and poorly formatted stuff that looks like it was copied from some other source. There might still be other parts from the copied work in the page but I can't tell so if anyone finds the original work can they edit the parts that shouldn't belong. My edit was done on June 22nd 2005 - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a></p>
<p>Yeah, I am the original contributor for most of the article. It was extracted from a paper I wrote on South Africa (which is why there were a number of quotes). I had intended to clean it up on my own at some point but thanks for taking care of it. I have just added a section on Afrikanerbond policies since the end of apartheid. --<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> 04:32, 10 July 2005 (UTC</p>
<p>This article appears to confuse two different organisations, the Broederbond which is what this article mainly seems to be referring to, and the Afrikaner Bond, advocated by the Rev S.J.du Toit in 1879 and led by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyer "Onze Jan" for many years. It was on open parliamentary party in the Cape Colony and cooperated with Cecil Rhodes and later John X Merriman to form governing coalitions.. It should not be confused with the secretive Broederbond and the title of this entry should be changed to represnt this. Denis Nathan 16:05, 6th November 2005</p>
<p>i have never heard of the Afrikaner Bond, however, i was under the impression that the Broederbond was renamed after apartheid ended to Afrikanerbond. that being said, we could add a disambiguation or 'for other usages' link at the top of the page to what i assume is currently a non-existant article on the Afrikaner Bond of the late 1800s. --<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> 02:40, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Afrikaner Bond (two words) was originally called the Afrikander Bond.The latter spelling with a "d" is Dutch, the accepted language at the time that it was formed. The latter spelling without the "d" is the current Afrikaans spelling. I have written a stub on the Afrikander Bond. Afrikaans replaced Dutch as an official language of South Africa in the 1920's. The Afrikander bond ceased to function independently after Union in 1910. The Broederbond was formed in May 1918 and was not a political party openly or overtly contesting contesting parliamentary seats. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Nathan_3de6.html" title="User:Denis Nathan">user:Denis Nathan</a>7:02 yth Nov. 2005</p>

<dd>"Indeed, nearly every prominent Afrikaner in any field was a member of the Broederbond."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Did the Broederbond really have that much power, that all "important" afrikaners and politicians where members of it? What did one have to do to become a member of the bond? ��<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Poison_71c3.html" title="User:Dr.Poison">Dr.Poison</a> 18:49, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article seems to contain many generalisations for which no citation is given. Were most government ministers really members of the Broederbond? Were Dr Danie Craven and Dr Christiaan Barnard really the only influential Afrikaners who were not members of the Broederbond? I suggest that these and other similar claims should be verified and citations provided, or else they should not be stated as fact. <a href="../../../h/n/j/User%7EHnjvr_c5ac.html" title="User:Hnjvr">Hnjvr</a> 07:03, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't had time to check out the facts. But I'm a South African, so just out of some general knowledge, and a general idea of how history developed, there is certainly some mistakes. The HNP wasn't formed until the 60's of 70's. And the HNP and the Broederbond never had a good relationship. The Broederbond actually expelled all the members that broke away from the NP to form the HNP. And yes, there certainly were prominent members of the South African society that were not Broederbond members. But you will have to define prominent. But the fact is that the whole NP cabinet was always Broederbond members, as far as I know, except for one stage when there were two members of the cabinet that weren't Broederbond members, but they were replaced quite fast.</p>
