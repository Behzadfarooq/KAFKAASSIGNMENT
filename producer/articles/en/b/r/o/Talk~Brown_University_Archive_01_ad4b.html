<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is the New Curriculum overrated?</span></h2>
<p>I think it's a bit too much that half of the history section, for a university that is 240+ years old, is devoted to this subject. With apologies to older Brunonians (I'm B'97) I just don't think it is as important as it may have seemed in the 60's. Though Brown has fewer formalized requirements than other schools, I think for most students the effect is not much different (though one's GPA is a little clunkier w/o the +/-'s) as they are well aware of what will be expected of them in graduate school or the professional world. Pres. Simmons' priorities seem to be to improve brown's finances and develop top notch research centers, not to promote some idea of "self determination". Although the University still pays lip service to it I think the New Curriculum is fading in importance. Perhaps someone can modify the history section? Kurtosis 23:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What should I ask in my Brown Interview? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> EKN (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EKN_374c.html" title="Special:Contributions/EKN">contribs</a>) 02:46, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><a name="Acceptance_Rate" id="Acceptance_Rate"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Acceptance Rate</span></h2>
<p>For 2004-2005, the Class of 2009 registered a 14.6% acceptance rate. That's pretty good. But several authors keep changing this section in the text to say, "6th" lowest in the country among doctoral research universities. This is factually incorrect. In the same admissions cycle, Harvard-Yale-Princeton-Columbia had lower rates. Meanwhile, MIT's rate was 14%; Stanford hovered around 12%. So at the very least, this ranks Brown 7th, so long as we use Carnegie's index which excludes regional liberal arts college, the military academies and the music institutes. Those who ignore this fact distort Brown's relative statistical standing vis-a-vis other elite colleges.</p>
<p>For proof: <a href="http://www.hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/resources/early2005statistics.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/resources/early2005statistics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/resources/early2005statistics.html</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind in terms of the acceptance/yield ratios Brown is also not in the top five. The "bolt" rate--i.e., the percentage of students who bolt from a Brown admissions offer to another school's admissions offer given acceptance into both--for every dyad (e.g., Brown-Harvard, Brown-Yale, Brown-Princeton, etc.) is skewed towards the non-Brown institution, EXCEPT for the three Ivies not mentioned thus far: Brown-Cornell; Brown-UPenn; Brown-Dartmouth, in which the bolt rate favors Brown significantly. This is nothing to be ashamed of, but please, Brown fans, don't inflate the eliteness of the school by inventing statistics. One place may not be much to argue over: but it is a statistical lie, and Wikipedia has no place for such blatant fabrications. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 70.58.254.147 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.58.254.147_cdb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.58.254.147">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<hr />
<p>The above argument is baseless because it is based on unofficial numbers. An example: Harvard's acceptance rate is listed at 10.3% overall, while the Harvard webpage begs to differ, claiming the official rate to be 9.2% (<a href="http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/prospective/applying/stats/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/prospective/applying/stats/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/prospective/applying/stats/index.html</a>). Admissions percentages can be interpreteed many different ways. I agree that they should not appear on ANY college articles for this reason. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 138.16.12.112 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__138.16.12.112_bd5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 138.16.12.112">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>The "Josiah Carberry" reference is a little spurious--he deserves a page in the Wikipedia, sure, but should he be one of only two people mentioned in connection to Brown here? <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.43.104_3382.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.43.104">24.61.43.104</a> 05:02, 18 Oct 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed... but he really does deserve a wikipedia page, so why take him off? Can you think of people who should be added to the Brown page? We certainly could do so. Should we add the last few presidents (EGG, etc.)? They hardly seem that relevant. Actually, more than people, we should really add the New Curriculum. In fact, maybe I'll add something on that now. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Tom</a> 14:35, 19 Oct 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hrmph, now User:Someone Else has taken Mr. Carberry off without explanation (or rather, by calling it "misinformation"). "Misinformation" isn't quite the work -- perhaps a misplaced joke. On the other hand, this joke is an important part of Brown lore, documented, etc. (the library actually had an exhibit about Mr. Carberry not long ago). Perhaps if I come back to this page and organize/expand it, I can put it in under Brown traditions/myths.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV in Atmosphere at Brown University</span></h2>
<p>Memento, I don't mind if you revert changes, <i>so long as you can justify the reversion</i>. As for instance, by your citing Women's Wear Daily. However, I think you also added back in some things that are merely opinion. Do you think you could either find cites for them or remove them, please?</p>
<p>In particular: <i>Some consider Brown to be the "happiest Ivy."</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- who? And isn't this just a an opinion, and an opinion students at other Ivies might vociferously contest?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The curriculum [...] promotes an atmosphere where students are sincerely interested in their work</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- how do we <i>objectively</i> distinguish the sincere interest of Brown's students from the (presumably) insincere or less sincere interest of students at other universities? Are all or even most students at Brown sincerely interested? Is this a fact or is this Brown boosterism?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>on the basis that students on campus seem to have the strongest sense of personal style</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- did <i>Women's Wear Daily</i> actually say strongest sense of personal style? What, precisely, determines a "strong sense" of style, and what distinguishes a "personal style" from a <i>public</i> or an <i>impersonal</i> style? Is this fact, or opinion?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>they strip off their clothes and, once nude, run out from the elevators all through the library where students are dutifully writing papers or preparing for tests</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- are all students writing or preparing, or are some or most lounging about or present to see the amateur strip show? The students are "dutifully" writing papers? How do we know they're doing it dutifully, or is this just purple prose? Could they be "desultorily" writing papers? or "dispiritedly" writing papers? Or "doggedly" writing papers?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>the streakers gleefully hand out the highly-caloric treats to all bystanders.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- "Gleefully", perhaps. but "the highly caloric treats" is something straight out of a freshman creative writing class; why not just say "donuts", or "snacks"?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The naked donut runners, it should be noted, are not known for their physical fitness- and are proud of this fact.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- "it should be noted"? Why should it be noted? thus is pure filler to make the sentence <i>sound</i> better, and again, belong sin a creative writing class and not an encyclopedia. While it does seem likely the students are not known for their physical fitness, why not simply say they are "out of shape"? And how do we know they're proud of that? If they chant "we're proud to be wimps", then <i>say</i> that -- that's a firm, objective statement of fact. But "are proud" is the writer's inference. When in doubt, Wikipedia should sound more like a newspaper article, and less like a Chamber of Commerce press release.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Though Brown, like most Ivies, leans <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- I know this is a truism, but is it true? If so, how do we know?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>students on campus have a wide range of political beliefs, and seem engaged with most political topics.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- They "seem engaged"? How can you tell. Eschew broad generalization; prefer facts: "70% of Brown's students volunteer in political campaigns" or the like.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>the naked donut runners dash across campus to the Sciences Library ("SciLi")</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- do general readers who aren't Brown students care about the slang abbreviation for campus building -- enough to include it in an encyclopedia?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>where they repeat the process for Brown's more technically minded- and equally wide-eyed- students.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- is "technically minded" a mushy substitute for "science and engineering majors"? And are they really <i>equally wide-eyed- [sic]", or is this more creative writing?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Donut runs vary in number of students participating and in number of donuts purchased. In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> donut run, for example, nearly twenty students participated with numerous full boxes of donuts; in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> donut run, however, only a handful of students participated, with small bags of donuts. Student turnout</i> for <i>the runs will vary as well, depending on how secretive the runners are. In the 2000 run, the students were caught more or less unaware, while in the 2004 run, there was a huge turnout crowding the room at least half an hour before the runners arrived.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>-- this is a lot of information for an event that "only a handful" of students participate in. Does it really deserve this much attention? So much attention as to give the number of participants in specific years?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope I'm not being discouraging to a new wikipedian; please understand this as constructive criticism, and please do continue to make your valuable contributions to Wikipedia. But please consider making those contributions less "purple" in the prose and more concrete in the facts.</p>

<dd>As a past naked donut runner, I can say I don't think the shape of the naked donuters deserves mention at all -- it doesn't really matter if your insult is direct or backhanded. I also think the naked donut section should be shortioned and incorporated into a sub-section on traditions which would include the much older tradition of Josiah Carberry, which was previously deleted from this site. Other bits of lore might include the myth of the Carrie Bell Tower....<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Tom</a> 00:30, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No offense meant -- and none, I think, given by <i>me</i>. To clarify, I did not originate the Naked Donut Runners business, or their (lack of?) shape. The original entry was "The naked donut runners, it should be noted, are not known for their physical fitness- and are proud of this fact.", which I changed to "The naked donut runners profess to be proud of their poor physical fitness." My aim was merely to remove the POV you complain of, and what I think is somewhat overwritten prose. I <i>do</i> agree with you that the Naked Donut Ramble is disproportionately detailed and should be shorted (or deleted) and perhaps moved. But I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt and take its importance -- and claims about physical fitness -- at face value. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 00:43, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If they chant "we're proud to be wimps", then <i>say</i> that -- that's a firm, objective statement of fact. But "are proud" is the writer's inference.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is the Nazi Party "Political"?</span></h2>
<p>POV quibble: The list of notable Brown alumni is broken into categories. "Louis Redding - first African American to practice law in Delaware" is categorized in "Government / Law / Public Policy " But "George Lincoln Rockwell (1942) - founder, American Nazi Party" is relegated to "Other". Surely founding a political party, even an abhorrent one, is a form of politics or public policy. Or is the category written narrowly (including lawyers and political figures, but under the name "Public Policy" rather than the ore obvious "Politics", in order expressly to exclude Rockwell while including more palatable politicians? It's perhaps a minor point, but we must be <i>especially</i> careful to avoid POV that reinforces our majority societal views.<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 21:35, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citation</span></h2>
<p>User:Memento Viveri replaced my citations list with external links -- why? Is this preferred on the wikipedia? It seems to be less informative and makes it more of a PITA for outsiders to find where the sources were. Also, the source I listed for my additions gave me information/back-up on most of the current traditions (naked donuts, sex in the scili, etc.), so it's not quite accurate to just list it after the first paragraph of traditions. I have noticed that the "sources" section format is rarely used, but I assumed it was preferred to the links. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Tom</a> 23:58, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's contextual, and there are some circumstances (e.g., when you just want to provide confirmation for a single fact and the fastest, best way is by linking to it inline) where you'd definitely want to go with linking it out, and others (e.g., where you refer to a single source multiple times, and/or where it's useful to the user to be shown bibliographical information) where you'd definitely want to go with a "Sources" section, and some hazy gray areas. If you feel there's been an actual loss of useful information, you should change it back. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 00:03, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia practice seems to be to use the "External Sources"; where cites to sites are used, they are in the form [[htpp://example.com footnote number]]: "Google is a great place to search [<a href="http://Google.com" class="external text" title="http://Google.com" rel="nofollow">1</a>]"</dd>

I should also point out that one factor in deciding whether to use a link or a bibliography-style source-list is whether you want the casual user to actually follow the link, or just to be aware that a source is there. I know that you supplied that material originally to provide authentication for claims made within the article, so I understand why you'd list sources at the bottom; however, it might be the case that these are links people will want to click through to.&#160;::shrug:: <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 00:27, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the parties started with BACH, but more to the point, BACH is a real part of Brown. I wasn't there when they started, but I think they were created in response to a real housing shortage, and they may have been a class or independant study for class credit at their inception. I think that the organization was entirely student run, at least for a time, which is significant - they outright owned or mort-<br />
gaged two of the four houses they used in the mid to late nineties, they ran a food co-op, and I think that many of the members learned a lot about business and management from the experience. They also had a real culture, as much as, if not more than many of the fraternities.</dd>
<dd>I speak of all of this in the past tense, but only because I am unaware of the present state of things. I should also add that I was never a member, so other people may be albe to speak better to the actual intricacies of BACH itself, but I think they deserve at least as much mention as an fraternity or sorority.</dd>

Just because something may be amusing, such as naked donut runners, this does not by itself qualify it as a tradition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mysterious Housing Plan</span></h2>
<p>What is the secret of the tunnel?</p>
<p>Campus housing is the source of many of Brown’s most popular rumors. There is a highly mysterious tunnel system that connects a good deal of Wriston Quad around where Greek and Program houses are located. There are endless theories about the original intent of these tunnels, but rumor has it that they use to extend over a larger portion of the school. Brown is also said to have a few secret societies in addition to the well publicized organizations; these societies are said to be located near campus in mysterious Mansions. The most famous myth concerns the ominous Grad Center dorm. It is rumored to have been designed in 1968 by prison architects as a fortress in case of riots. Regardless of the building’s design intent, it is a fact that the imposing concrete spiral staircase was actually built in the incorrect orientation because the builders read the blueprints wrong.</p>
<p>from College Prowler's guidebook; <i>Brown University - Off the Record</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I seem to remember hearing that the Grad Towers were designed to be riot-<i>proof</i>, rather than a fortress against riotiers. The argument was that the lack of areas of assembly in the main towers, such as lounges, etc, left no place for rioting.</dd>
<dd>I also know that some of the tunnels are either the basement areas of buildings (as under Keeney; these are accessed by a trap door in the floor of a dead end in one of the lower level hallways, or through one or two of the maintenance rooms, in the rare event that Plant Ops left the door unlocked). Other tunnels, such as those accessed via the trapdoor in the floor of the first floor men's room of the building on the south side of lower Lincoln Field (whose name I forget - anyone?), are steam tunnels, in which steam pipes (and other types of pipes, I suppose) run between buildings. These tunnels can also be acessed via some of the manholes on Lincoln field. A manhole near Carrie Tower leads to a tunnel system that quickly splits, part of it running as a crawl space in the direction of the tower, and the rest running toward and into the Hay library. This tunnel has motion detectors and alarm systems as you approach the library, and I seem to recall that it also had steam pipes.</dd>
<dd>My recollection is that the campus has a steam plant in one corner of the Aldritch-Dexter fields, providing steam to many parts of the campus, so I expect that there are many other tunnels out there for the purposes of carrying and allowing acces to the pipes that deliver that steam. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 20:01, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The tunnel running from the manhole near the Carrie Tower leads three places: towards University Hall; towards the tower; and towards the John Hay library. The motion sensors are connected to the Hay library, as far as I can tell, because tripping them summons Brown Police to the Library. The crawlspace mentioned is actually a good ways past the tower, and likely runs under Benefit Street, based on estimates from pacing it out; thus there is no access from the tunnel to the tower. -- Anonymous, Feb. 12, 2006

<p>I've been told that Frank's recent $100 million donatation to Brown is not only the largest gift Brown has ever received, but also the largest single donation ever given by an individual to a university.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The founding of Brown</span></h2>
<p>I have a suggestion for inserting three sentences (Re: charter principle in reference to professional schools) into the first paragraph of "The founding of Brown" section that would appear just before the last sentence in the existing paragraph. Here is the modified paragraph:</p>
<p>In 1763, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Manning_c1db.html" title="James Manning">James Manning</a>, a Baptist minister, was sent to <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> by the Philadelphia Association of <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist Churches</a> in order to found a college. At the same time, local <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregationalist.html" title="Congregationalist">Congregationalists</a>, led by James Stiles, were working toward a similar end. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/6/1764.html" title="1764">1764</a>, a charter was filed to create Rhode Island College in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren%2C_Rhode_Island_dd3b.html" title="Warren, Rhode Island">Warren, Rhode Island</a>, reflecting the work of both Stiles and Manning. The charter had more than 60 signatories, including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brown_%28Rhode_Island%29_7b5e.html" title="John Brown (Rhode Island)">John</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Brown_%28Brown_University%29_9f6e.html" title="Nicholas Brown (Brown University)">Nicholas Brown</a> of the Brown family, who would give the College its present day name. The college's mission, the charter stated, was to prepare students "for discharging the Offices of Life" by providing instruction "in the Vernacular Learned Languages, and in the liberal Arts and Sciences." The charter's language has long been interpreted by the university as discouraging the founding of a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_school.html" title="Business school">business school</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law school</a>.

<dd>Brown was the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia. At the time, it was the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions (following the example of Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island in 1636 on the same principle).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Unlike other American Colonial colleges, the new school would not focus on education for the clergy.</dd>

<dd>Penn was founded on unique grounds in the history of education. In Philadelphia Benjamin Franklin sought not only to create a local institution of higher learning, but also to provide an education that did not fit the models already established in New England and Virginia. In Europe and the colonies up to that time, such schools had emphasized the training of new clergymen. The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These don't actually contradict each other, but I'm beginning to think I'd like to see some better sources for the early admissions policies of these two schools. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:37, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. Although it may sound silly, Brown students are not necessarily the only people that are interested in Brown course offerings; nor would I say that this population small enough to be of little to no importance. In fact if you think about the people that are most likely to view the Brown wikipedia page that do <i>not</i> go to Brown, its relevance and usefulness seems to increase dramatically. Be it BOCA or Mocha, I think it would be a good idea to link to Brown's course offerings. Of course Mocha would be preferable, since BOCA is a human rights violation. -<a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESeliopou_9420.html" title="User:Seliopou">seliopou</a> 00:39, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Actually the rest of the "traditions" section is in almost equally bad shape. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:00, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Students have sex on the 13th floor of the Sciences Library.

<p>There used to be a page for SexPowerGod, but it got <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SexPowerGod_c63a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SexPowerGod">deleted</a>. Now the info from that page has been added here in the Brown page itself, but I think it's an old version of what had been there (I remember discussing changes to be made that appear here in their original form). Any way to dig up the last version of it and its talk prior to deletion? I have a feeling there used to be a Starf*ck page too, but don't know a good way to search the deleted-pages namespace. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 05:20, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, found the Talk:SexPowerGod page, and made some changes in line with the feel there. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 21:08, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
