<p>Browser games is the first article I really got involved with and felt I could contribute something to. I made a few minor adjustments over time and generally try to keep the spammers away. Recently however there has been a discussion as to what should be excluded under the "External Links" section. I at first thought it would be ok (especially since I used mpogd.com) to keep "directory" listing sites under the external links. However, with some research I have found that most commonly only ONE directory listing is allowed. I removed the links and added an article I researched and found to be in direct relation with browser based programming. User:Jason however believed this article to be "mine" somehow (I have NO association with it whatsoever) and deleted it on the basis that I must be spamming. I submit to you that this article <a href="http://www.webgamebuilder.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webgamebuilder.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a valid resource of information on browser based games including tutorials, programming hints, game design methods and forums which all contain information directly relating to web based games. I am not trying insert spam links and in fact my actions have been to keeps spam to a minimum. -<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoocats_a59f.html" title="User:Moocats">Moocats</a> 20:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've seperated it into sections, plugin vs. server-side games. Removed all references to deleted article "Thin games" (this is the only place I've ever heard of it). Also cleaned up article content in general, tried to remove many repeating sentences saying the same idea over and over. Inserted comments about PHP due to the verifiable fact that a large majority are indeed written in PHP (a simple check of <a href="http://www.mpogd.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mpogd.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or any other gamesite will verify this). I would like to see a history of some type, possibly with a screenshot of one of the open source games (Legend of the green dragon? Alien assault traders? Blacknova?). Also, the connection of gambling games should probably be in here as well, along with the small (possibly growing?) number of sites that offer actual prizes simply for playing the game. There might also be a place for those games that had people generate links for turns for their site simply to create traffic and they were spammed all over the web, remember that? They should get a place as well, annoying as they were. -<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoocats_a59f.html" title="User:Moocats">Moocats</a> 15:21, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is the nature of mediation that both parties must respond, discuss their views, and be willing make compromises. As User:JasonBlake69 has decided not to respond to the request for mediation, it is impossible for it to continue. I would note, however, that the disputed behavior mediation was intended to address has since ceased.</p>
<p>As only one party has responded to the MEDCAB request, mediation is terminated without prejudice. If both parties wish to engage in the process sometime in the future, I would be happy to officiate.

<p>This site is one of the few sites I've found that deals directly with BBGs and their kind without trawling on about any specific game. It has multiple articles centered around building web based browser games. Despite not being updated in quite some time, it still harbors sufficient information for one to begin getting started on the "browser game" building path.</p>
<p>You (jason) note the article as spam however. I am unable to determine how you denote this as such as I believe it contributes directly to the articles content. If you would explain your reasons for the edit I would be happy to hear them. Also, edits do not always include a full summary of what was specifically edited because the comments are meant only to be a very brief summary as to what area was edited. I was not trying to "sneak" in another link, I just thought it would be helpful.&#160;:) -<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoocats_a59f.html" title="User:Moocats">Moocats</a> 16:03, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Moocats, my apologies for the delay in response. Although the site you mentioned is useful for <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_developers.html" title="Game developers">game developers</a>, however it does not relate to this article directly. Perhaps, you and or I should create an article relating to Browser Game Development? For now <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_development.html" title="Game development">Game development</a> best suits the site you are trying to implement into this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I assumed the link in question was a spam attempt was due to your suspicious behaviour; You persistently removed other valid/genuine links I added into this and other articles and blindly resorted to accusations against me (eg; You said I was the owner of MoFunZone.com).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You must realize, you don't have the authority to define what a browser game is or is not. To really think about it, there is no such thing (except those HTML games where you click on bunch of links). 99% of what is considered "browser games" use plug-ins to play and these plug-ins include but are not limited to: -Java -Flash -Shockwave(DCR) -ActiveX -Wiltangent -Toolbars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, my question: Why did you remove my links which I strongly believe related to this article and replaced it with the above mentioned URL? Cheers --JasonBlake69 21:30 02 February 2006 EST</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question first, wikipedia has a policy regarding external links which I was made aware of when people were editing back and forth over linkspam. The problem with external links is that although allowed without reservation there is one exception. List pages are not encouraged to be listed because there are so many of them and they are mostly proprietary (only one person has control over them). According to the list rules, only ONE page may be listed, giving preference to open directory (anyone can edit) type pages of lists. DMOZ is the only page I found to be an open directory, therefore according to the wiki policy it's the only LIST site that should be listed (tounge tied&#160;:) ).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the external link, while you are right that it could very well go under game development, wikipedia also states that it needs to be kept as specific to the article as possible. Generalization is not encouraged as this would lead to people summing up all things about say...Babe Ruth under the article Baseball Stars (I know this is an exageration, just trying to point out what I'm saying). If there were an article for Browser Based Programming I would indeed list it under there, however in accordance with their editing policy it does belong here as this is currently the most specific category to which it currently relates to (browser-based game programming is more closely related than just game programming). This is also the same reason that I will no longer remove Crimson Warfare from the list of browser games, because currently it is the most specific area to which it relates to and has no article of its own.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When an article for Crimson Warfare is made (I only assume it's a matter of time) it should be removed from that page and tagged with a "Flash Game" category tag which will automatically list it in the Flash game area. I will do the same when a "Browser based game programming site" becomes available (move my link to that page), however don't you agree it should stay here for the time being? -<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoocats_a59f.html" title="User:Moocats">Moocats</a> 12:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Moocats, although you make a good point about the generalization, however having browser game development website link in an article titled "Browser game" would also be generalizing as well. In fact, I believe listing web sites with browser games in an article titled "Browser game" makes more sense. --JasonBlake69 21:34 04 February 2006 EST</dd>

<p>The article as it stands seems to be more stub than anything, wondering if anyone had considered, or is considering a more fleshed out extension to the article? Maybe a collaborative effort. I see Moocat has been active hereabouts&#160;;).</p>
<p>For starters there seems to be a a split between server/client, but what about the other splits? Text vs Graphical 3d or 2d, range of plugins could use updating, bit of a favourable focus on PHP with no mention of reasonable alternatives (Ruby, ASP.NET, etc. - PHP is not the only large scale easy-to-use language), there are a few grammatical and spelling errors in need of correction. Where is text based mentioned???</p>
<p>"Browser games typically require a form of web browser plugin to function." - quote. Language is too strong, there are quite a lot of multiplayer server side technologies that actually refuse to impose plugin requirements. I don't like this paragraph since it seems to be stating a technology as insecure for no apparent reason. Whether that's true or not is questionable - it should be removed if only to keep the article on topic. You might as well state javascript, java, flash, X3D are all inherently insecure - not true.</p>
<p>I'm not out to simply "bash" the article - just interested in a larger extended version with a bit more in-depth descriptions. Anyone maintaining the article willing to colloborate? I'm a browser game developer myself (mainly PHP text based games) so its an interesting topic to see put up on Wikipedia. Dues to Moocats et al. who've added it.</p>

<p>There are some claims, theories and conclusions drawn in the article that aren't supported by an external reference, in fact there aren't any references in the article.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Due to this fact, it allows users to more easily hack the code on their end, denying fair multiplayer gameplay, therefore a large majority of plug-in based games today are still single player.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Is there a source for drawing this conclusion? Has there been a an article or study done on this to explain this away as the reason browser games are primariliy single player, or is there perhaps another reason for that?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>A growing number of games are being created using server-side scripting.</i>
<dl>
<dd>What is this based on? Are there any statistics available to support this claim.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>One of the most common languages used to build server-side games is PHP due to its widespread community support and low learning curve.</i>
<dl>
<dd>The theory that this is "One of the most common" has no source. Again, any statistics to support this claim?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>Some include JavaScript or AJAX to allow the user to see immediate responses to their online actions and <b>make the games more visually appealing</b>.</i>
<dl>
<dd>I've never personally found javascript to do that, nor does the description of AJAX indicate its usage is for visual reasons. It lists interactivity, speed and usability as its main uses.</dd>
