<p>Brother Martin was created by combining the two schools, St. Aloysius High School and Cor Jesu. In 1869 New Orleans Archbishop Jean Marie Odin invited the Brothers of the Sacred Heart to open a school in New Orleans, St. Aloysius opened on September 26, 1869 with six students. In 1892 the school was moved to a larger campus on the corner of Esplanade and Rampart avenues, in 1969 for the second time in the school's history it moved again under the newly changed name of Brother Martin High School. The combination came about after the Brothers of the Sacred Heart decided that expansion and cost saving would be better achieved with one school on the larger Cor Jesu campus. In 1969, after celebrating the school's 100th anniversary, the school was renamed after Brother Martin Hernandez, a brother of the Sacred Heart who was principal of St. Aloysius from 1934 to 1949, and was treasurer of the Brothers from 1969 to 1991. Brother Martin Hernandez was also a noted athlete, having been named to the New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>

<p>The history of the school mascot and colors began in 1921 when the school fielded its first football team. The school's mascot was a panther and the colors purple and gold, this combination of the mascot and colors were changed under the insistence of Bro. Martin Hernandez, the school's principal, to to crimson and white and the mascot as a crusader. When the school was consolidated the school kept the crusader as the mascot and crimson but changed the white for gold.</p>
