	    <p>The <b>Broadcasting Act <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a></b> is a law of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British parliament</a>, often regarded by both its supporters and its critics as a quintessential example of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a>.</p>
<p>The aim of the Act was to reform the entire structure of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>; <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_television.html" title="British television">British television</a>, in particular, had earlier been described by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> as "the last bastion of restrictive practices". It led directly to the abolition of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Broadcasting_Authority_eea6.html" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a> and its replacement with the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Television_Commission_7ba9.html" title="Independent Television Commission">Independent Television Commission</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Authority_f235.html" title="Radio Authority">Radio Authority</a> (both themselves now replaced by <a href="../../../o/f/c/Ofcom.html" title="Ofcom">Ofcom</a>), which were given the remit of regulating with a "lighter touch" and did not have such strong powers as the IBA; some referred to this as "deregulation". The ITC also began regulating non-terrestrial channels, whereas the IBA had only regulated <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> and the ill-fated <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Satellite_Broadcasting_6de2.html" title="British Satellite Broadcasting">British Satellite Broadcasting</a>; the ITC thus took over the responsibilities of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_Authority_04af.html" title="Cable Authority">Cable Authority</a> which had regulated the early non-terrestrial channels, which were only available to a very small audience in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>An effect of this Act was that, in the letter of the law, the television or radio companies rather than the regulator became the broadcasters, as had been the case in the early (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>) era of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Television_Authority_fb77.html" title="Independent Television Authority">Independent Television Authority</a> when it had fewer regulatory powers than it would later assume.</p>
<p>In television, the Act allowed for the creation of a fifth analogue <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrestrial_television.html" title="Terrestrial television">terrestrial television</a> channel in the UK, which turned out to be Channel 5, now renamed <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_%28TV%29_f708.html" title="Five (TV)">Five</a>, and the growth of multichannel <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_television.html" title="Satellite television">satellite television</a>. It also stipulated that the BBC, which had traditionally produced the vast majority of its television programming <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-house.html" title="In-house">in-house</a>, was now obliged to source at least 25% of its output from independent production companies.</p>
<p>The act has sometimes been described, both as praise and as criticism, as a key enabling force for <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s ambitions in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. It reformed the system of awarding ITV franchises, which would prove controversial when <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Television_9dfa.html" title="Thames Television">Thames Television</a> was replaced by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Television_b5c4.html" title="Carlton Television">Carlton Television</a>, for what some felt were political reasons (see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_on_the_Rock_5f34.html" title="Death on the Rock">Death on the Rock</a>), and when <a href="../../../t/v/-/TV-am_113e.html" title="TV-am">TV-am</a>, admired by Mrs Thatcher for its management's defiance of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a>, lost its franchise to <a href="../../../g/m/t/GMTV_128a.html" title="GMTV">GMTV</a> (the by then former Prime Minister personally apologised to the senior TV-am executive <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Gyngell_e260.html" title="Bruce Gyngell">Bruce Gyngell</a>). It also allowed for companies holding ITV franchises to take over other such companies from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, beginning the process which has led to the creation of <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_plc_fae7.html" title="ITV plc">ITV plc</a>.</p>
<p>In radio, it allowed for the launch of three <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_National_Radio_e310.html" title="Independent National Radio">Independent National Radio</a> stations, two of them on <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediumwave.html" title="Mediumwave">mediumwave</a> using frequencies formerly used by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, and the other on <a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_radio_b5d2.html" title="FM radio">FM</a> using frequencies formerly used by the emergency services. It set out plans for many more local and regional <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Local_Radio_0243.html" title="Independent Local Radio">commercial radio</a> stations, generally using parts of the FM band not previously used for broadcasting, which have since come to fruition. Its plans for expanding <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_radio.html" title="Community radio">community radio</a> would only really be developed in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>.</p>
<p>The Act passed through Parliament despite opposition from much of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> and from some members of the ruling <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>, who saw it as representative of a decline in standards, and on occasions saw it as enabling what was, for them, an unwelcome <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americanisation.html" title="Americanisation">Americanisation</a>. Notably, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Hurd_b744.html" title="Douglas Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a> has since criticised the Act's aftereffects, describing it as "one of the less successful reforms of those years". These Tories would have described their position as <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternalism.html" title="Paternalism">paternalistic</a> as a term of praise, while supporters of the Act would use it against them as a term of abuse. Since <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> became leader, the Labour Party's broadcasting policy has generally shifted much more towards that expounded in the Act.</p>
<p>The then <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Waddington_3f04.html" title="David Waddington">David Waddington</a>, described the Act as heralding "a massive expansion in choice", and supporters of the multichannel age in British broadcasting have praised the Act, and later regulation influenced by it, for such reasons. Supporters of the previous, more regulated system have strongly criticised the Act, and some have blamed it for what they see as a "<a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbing_down.html" title="Dumbing down">dumbing down</a>" of British television and radio. Like many other reforms of the Thatcher years, it has a tendency to polarise opinion very strongly.</p>

<p>A sketch in the second series of <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bit_of_Fry_and_Laurie_81c9.html" title="A Bit of Fry and Laurie">A Bit of Fry and Laurie</a></i>, in which a Conservative government minister is strangled while <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Fry_d29b.html" title="Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a> screams at him "What are you doing to the television system? What are you doing to the country?", is an attack on the Act and the perceived motivations of those who supported it. They would later attack what they saw as the Act's malign aftereffects in the sketch "It's A Soaraway Life", a parody of <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i> evoking a world in which Rupert Murdoch had not existed.</p>
