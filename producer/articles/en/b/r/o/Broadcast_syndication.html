	    <p>In <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>, <b>syndication</b> is the sale of the right to broadcast <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_show.html" title="Radio show">radio shows</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_show.html" title="Television show">television shows</a> to multiple <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_station.html" title="Broadcast station">stations</a>, without going through a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_network.html" title="Broadcast network">broadcast network</a>. It is common in countries where television is organized around networks with local <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate.html" title="Affiliate">affiliates</a>, notably the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.

<p>Types of syndication:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>first-run syndication</b> refers to programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show, or at least first so offered in a given country (programs originally created and broadcast outside of the United States, first presented on a network in their country of origin, have often been syndicated in the U.S. and in some other countries);</li>
<li><b>off-network syndication</b> involves the sale of a program that was originally run on <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_television.html" title="Network television">network television</a>: a <a href="../../../r/e/r/Rerun.html" title="Rerun">rerun</a>;</li>
<li><b>public-broadcasting syndication</b> has arisen in the U.S. as a parallel service to stations in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_Service_0dd7.html" title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a> service and the handful of independent public stations.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: How and why">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How and why</span></h2>
<p>When syndicating a show, the production company, or a distribution company or "syndicator," usually attempts to sell the show to one station in each <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_market.html" title="Media market">media market</a> or area, in the country and around the world. If successful, this can be lucrative; but the syndicator may only be able to sell the show in a fraction of the markets.</p>
<p>Syndication differs from selling the show to a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">television network</a>; once a network picks up a show, it is usually guaranteed to run on all the network's affiliates, on the same day of the week and at the same time (in a given timezone, in countries where this is a concern). Many production companies create their shows and sell them to networks at a loss, at least at first, hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off-network syndication will turn a profit for the show.</p>
<p>A syndicated program is sold to stations for "cash" (rights are purchased by the stations to <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_insertion.html" title="Local insertion">insert</a> some or all of the ads at their level); given to stations for access to airtime (wherein the syndicators get the ad revenue); or the combination of both. The trade of program for airtime is called "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barter.html" title="Barter">barter</a>".</p>
<p>While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable, the producers often enjoy more content-freedom in the absence of network standards and practice officials; frequently, some innovative ideas are explored by first-run syndicated programming, which the networks are leery of giving airtime to; the early-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> music program <i>Sunday Night</i>, later <i>Night Music</i>, for example, which offered intentionally-odd mixes of critically-favored musicians, such as (in one episode), soul singer <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Green_%28musician%29_dab4.html" title="Al Green (musician)">Al Green</a>, alternative rock band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pixies_b98f.html" title="The Pixies">The Pixies</a>, and avant garde jazz musician <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Ra_2947.html" title="Sun Ra">Sun Ra</a>. Meanwhile, top-rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach of 98%.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that very often series that are aired in syndication are cut. For example a standard American sitcom runs 22 minutes, but in syndication it may be cut back to 20 minutes to make room for more commercials.</p>
<p>Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication. The game shows, some "tabloid" and entertainment news shows, and stripped talk shows are broadcast daily or weekdaily, while most other first-run syndicated shows are broadcast weekly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: First-run syndication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First-run syndication</span></h2>
<p>As with radio in the U.S., television networks in their early years particularly didn't offer full-days-worth of programming for their affiliates, even in the evening or "prime time" hours. Also, from the beginning, other stations were not affiliated with any network. Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming and whatever network feeds there were with content that could be flexibly scheduled. The development of <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotape</a> and, much later, enhanced <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> downlink access furthered these options. While most past first-run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication, some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first-run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: The 1950s and 1960s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1950s and 1960s</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../z/i/v/Ziv_Television_Programs%2C_Inc._836c.html" title="Ziv Television Programs, Inc.">Ziv Television Programs, Inc.</a>, after establishing itself as a major radio syndicator, was the first major first-run television syndicator, creating several long-lived series in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and selling them directly to regional sponsors, who in turn sold the shows to local stations. Among the most famous and widely watched Ziv offerings were <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Hunt_1d45.html" title="Sea Hunt">Sea Hunt</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_Patrol_%28TV_series%29_6da6.html" title="Highway Patrol (TV series)">Highway Patrol</a></i>. Some first-run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and early <a href="../../../27/6/0/%2760s.html" title="'60s">'60s</a>, notably <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Ed_c9b7.html" title="Mr. Ed">Mr. Ed</a></i>. The networks started syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s, and first-run syndication shrank sharply, for a decade (<a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s first syndication arm, <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacom.html" title="Viacom">Viacom</a>, would eventually be split off from the company and eventually come back to purchase CBS, having already purchased <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and its interests, and created <a href="../../../u/p/n/UPN_2d96.html" title="UPN">UPN</a>). Some stalwart series continued, notably <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Valley_Days_7ec7.html" title="Death Valley Days">Death Valley Days</a></i>; other ambitious projects were also to flourish, however briefly, such as <i>The Play of the Week</i> (1959–1961), produced by David Susskind (of the syndicated talk show <i>Open End</i> and also producer of such network fare as <i>NYPD</i>).</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> rulings in the late 1960s curtailed the U.S. networks' ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the "early fringe," notably the 7-8pm (ET/PT) hour of "prime time," with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities (off-network syndie repeats were also banned); some projects of this sort came to fruition, though usually relatively commercial and slick ones such as the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_W_583c.html" title="Group W">Group W</a> <i><a href="../../../p/m/_/PM_Magazine_7955.html" title="PM Magazine">Evening Magazine/<i>PM Magazine</i></a></i> franchise, and such pre-existing national projects as the brief commercial-television run of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_F._Buckley%2C_Jr._7f66.html" title="William F. Buckley, Jr.">William F. Buckley, Jr.</a>'s interview/debate series <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firing_Line_982f.html" title="Firing Line">Firing Line</a></i>. The more obvious result was a rash of Canadian-produced syndicated dramatic series, such as the <i>Gilligan's Island</i> knock-off <i>Dusty's Trail</i> and the Colgate-sponsored <i>Dr. Simon Locke</i>; game shows, often evening editions of network afternoon series, flourished, and a few odd items such as <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Kingdom_a752.html" title="Wild Kingdom">Wild Kingdom</a></i>, cancelled by <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> in 1971, had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor-made for the early fringe.</p>
<p><a name="The_1970s" id="The_1970s"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: The 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1970s</span></h3>
<p>Into the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, first-run syndication continued to be an odd mix: cheaply produced, but not always poor-quality, "filler" programming. These included the dance-music show <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Train_1dfe.html" title="Soul Train">Soul Train</a></i>, several sports history series, and <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>'s <i>That's Hollywood</i>, a television variation on the popular <i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_Entertainment%21_10ee.html" title="That's Entertainment!">That's Entertainment!</a></i> theatrically released collections of film clips from the <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> library.</p>
<p>There were also many imported programs distributed this way. These include the impressive documentary series <i>Wild, Wild World of Animals</i> (repackaged by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Warner_b84a.html" title="Time Warner">Time Life</a> with narration by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Conrad_65e5.html" title="William Conrad">William Conrad</a>) and <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Television_9dfa.html" title="Thames Television">Thames Television</a>'s sober and necessarily grim <i>The World at War</i>. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Starlost_f5ed.html" title="The Starlost">The Starlost</a></i> (1973) was a Canadian series, apparently modified from the vision of science fiction writers <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlan_Ellison_e540.html" title="Harlan Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Bova_78f1.html" title="Ben Bova">Ben Bova</a>. <i><a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_%28TV_series%29_4473.html" title="UFO (TV series)">UFO</a></i> (1970) and <i><a href="../../../1/9/9/Space%7E_1999.html" title="Space: 1999">Space: 1999</a></i> (1975) came from British producer <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Anderson_2505.html" title="Gerry Anderson">Gerry Anderson</a> and his partner <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Grade_e7fa.html" title="Lew Grade">Lew Grade</a>, previously best-known for their <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarionation.html" title="Supermarionation">Supermarionation</a> (puppet/animation) series, like <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderbirds_%28TV_series%29_305e.html" title="Thunderbirds (TV series)">Thunderbirds</a></i>. The most successful syndicated show in the US in the 1970s was probably the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Muppet_Show_81a4.html" title="The Muppet Show">The Muppet Show</a></i>, also from Lew Grade.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_shows.html" title="Game shows">Game shows</a> thrived in syndication in the decade. Five-day-a-week versions of <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_My_Line__4de7.html" title="What's My Line?">What's My Line?</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Tell_the_Truth_0c2a.html" title="To Tell the Truth">To Tell the Truth</a></i> premiered in the late '60s and found loyal audiences until 1975 and 1978, respectively. Several daytime network games began producing once-a-week nighttime versions for the early-evening hours, usually with bigger prizes and often featuring different hosts (emcees were limited to appearing on one network and one syndicated game simultaneously) and modified titles (<i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a> PM</i>, <i>The $100,000 <a href="../../../n/a/m/Name_That_Tune_ae3f.html" title="Name That Tune">Name That Tune</a></i> or <i>The $25,000 <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_%28game_show%29.html" title="Pyramid (game show)">Pyramid</a></i>, for example). Of these shows, <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal_f202.html" title="Let's Make a Deal">Let's Make a Deal</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollywood_Squares_0f37.html" title="The Hollywood Squares">The Hollywood Squares</a></i> were the first to jump to twice-a-week syndicated versions around 1973. The nighttime version of <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Feud_36a7.html" title="Family Feud">Family Feud</a></i> (1977) quickly jumped from once-weekly to twice, and finally to five-days-a-week, and its massive popularity, along with that of new five-a-day entries like Jack Barry's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joker%27s_Wild_fd0e.html" title="The Joker's Wild">The Joker's Wild</a></i> (1977) and <i><a href="../../../t/i/c/Tic_Tac_Dough_df61.html" title="Tic Tac Dough">Tic Tac Dough</a></i> (1978) and Chuck Barris's increasingly-raunchy remakes of his '60s hits <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dating_Game_d8ae.html" title="The Dating Game">The Dating Game</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Newlywed_Game_2ae3.html" title="The Newlywed Game">The Newlywed Game</a></i>, brought an end (with rare exceptions) to the era of once-a-week games. Also popular in first-run syndication and daytime was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gong_Show_7459.html" title="The Gong Show">The Gong Show</a></i>, hosted by Barris throughout most of its run.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../w/a/i/Wait_Till_Your_Father_Gets_Home_6e14.html" title="Wait Till Your Father Gets Home">Wait Till Your Father Gets Home</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>) was a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna-Barbera_355d.html" title="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoon series attempting to ape the <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>-style sitcoms; <i>Skippy the Bush Kangaroo</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>) was an Australian children's series in the manner of <i>Flipper</i> or <i>Gentle Ben</i> (a decade later, the decidedly not-for-children Australian <i>Prisoner: Cell Block H</i> would have a brief US syndicated run); and a Canadian sketch-comedy series began appearing on U.S. television stations in 1977—<i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_City_Television_9024.html" title="Second City Television">Second City Television</a></i> would eventually find a home, for two seasons, on NBC, as <i>SCTV Network 90</i> (and on cable station <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinemax.html" title="Cinemax">Cinemax</a> later).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Studios_23de.html" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a> / <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount</a>-produced package of original programming, <i><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Prime_Time_ed62.html" title="Operation Prime Time">Operation Prime Time</a></i>, began appearing on <i>ad hoc</i> quasi-networks of (almost by necessity) non-network stations in the U.S. in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, with a mini-series adaptation of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jakes_521c.html" title="John Jakes">John Jakes</a>'s <i>The Bastard</i>.</p>
<p>From the latter '60s into the late '70s, Westinghouse also found considerable success with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mike_Douglas_Show_2058.html" title="The Mike Douglas Show">The Mike Douglas Show</a></i>, a variety/talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style, which played in afternoons in most markets; similar programs soon followed featuring <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merv_Griffin_a2b8.html" title="Merv Griffin">Merv Griffin</a>, who had been the host of <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s most sustained late-night answer to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson_d713.html" title="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a></i> previously, and another network veteran, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Shore_a089.html" title="Dinah Shore">Dinah Shore</a>. Also notable was the growing success of audience-participation talk shows, particularly that of the innovator of the format, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Donahue_4ba6.html" title="Phil Donahue">Phil Donahue</a>.</p>
<p>First-run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows no longer wanted by network television to remain on the air. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> cancelled <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Welk_4ff9.html" title="Lawrence Welk">The Lawrence Welk Show</a></i>, which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years. Also in 1971, <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> dropped <i><a href="../../../l/a/s/Lassie_%281954_TV_series%29_8208.html" title="Lassie (1954 TV series)">Lassie</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/e/e/Hee_Haw_128d.html" title="Hee Haw">Hee Haw</a></i>, the latter show's run ending as part of the network's cancellation of all of its <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a>-oriented shows (see <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beverly_Hillbillies_8b9b.html" title="The Beverly Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Acres_cd06.html" title="Green Acres">Green Acres</a></i>). <i>Lassie</i> entered first-run syndication for two years, while <i>Hee Haw</i> continued to produce new episodes until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout the mid to late 1980s, sitcoms continued to enter first-run syndication after being cancelled by the networks, the most successful of which were <i><a href="../../../m/a/m/Mama%27s_Family_ef25.html" title="Mama's Family">Mama's Family</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_In_Charge_421e.html" title="Charles In Charge">Charles In Charge</a></i>. Other sitcoms during this time to enter first-run syndication after network cancellation included <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punky_Brewster_f754.html" title="Punky Brewster">Punky Brewster</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster_%28TV_series%29_103b.html" title="Webster (TV series)">Webster</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Living_%281980_TV_series%29_2c95.html" title="It's a Living (1980 TV series)">It's a Living</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Spoons_0701.html" title="Silver Spoons">Silver Spoons</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/o/o/Too_Close_for_Comfort_%28TV_series%29_0c95.html" title="Too Close for Comfort (TV series)">Too Close for Comfort</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_Happening%21%21_9cbf.html" title="What's Happening!!">What's Happening!!</a></i> (retitled as <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_Happening_Now%21%21_9976.html" title="What's Happening Now!!">What's Happening Now!!</a></i>). Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in rerun syndication.</p>
<p>During the latter 1980s and early 1990s and throughout the remainder of the decade there was a resurgence of dramatic first-run syndicated programs, many of them in the science fiction and fantasy fields, or adventure dramas with fantastic elements. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> debuted in 1987 and became one of the most-watched syndicated shows throughout its seven-year run.

Among the slightly less fantastic series were <i><a href="../../../r/e/l/Relic_Hunter_b503.html" title="Relic Hunter">Relic Hunter</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../v/2E/i/V.I.P._%28TV_series%29_061c.html" title="V.I.P.

In 1997, <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Earth%7E_Final_Conflict_5c9c.html" title="Earth: Final Conflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></i>, based on ideas from the late <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Roddenberry_868c.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, premiered in syndication. Three years later, a second Gene Roddenberry series, <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28TV_series%29_2ef3.html" title="Andromeda (TV series)">Andromeda</a></i> also premiered in syndication. Shows featuring competition in one form or another, such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Search_e05b.html" title="Star Search">Star Search</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Gladiators_f4dc.html" title="American Gladiators">American Gladiators</a>, also enjoyed popularity in syndication around this time.</p>
<p>Also in the 1980s, news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations. <i>Independent Network News</i>, which was produced at <a href="../../../w/p/i/WPIX-TV_ed7a.html" title="WPIX-TV">WPIX</a> studios in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, was a half-hour weekdaily program that ran for several years on independent stations; <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> would offer a package of its <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headline_News_f2d1.html" title="Headline News">Headline News</a> to broadcast stations later. <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Entertainment_Tonight_d155.html" title="Entertainment Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a></i> began its long and continuing run as a "soft" news daily strip, with a number of imitations following; and "tabloid" television, in the wake of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../2/0/2F/20_20_9c54.html" title="20/20">20/20</a></i> and, more immediately, <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Current_Affair_%28US%29_da22.html" title="A Current Affair (US)">A Current Affair</a></i>, would become a syndication staple with such series as <i><a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra.html" title="Extra">Extra</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_TV_abfb.html" title="Real TV">Real TV</a></i>. Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was in late-night talk shows; <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Arsenio_Hall_Show_12f2.html" title="The Arsenio Hall Show">The Arsenio Hall Show</a></i> was the first and only very successful one, but <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Thicke_4042.html" title="Alan Thicke">Alan Thicke</a>'s earlier shortlived <i>Thicke of the Night</i>, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauren_Hutton_8436.html" title="Lauren Hutton">Lauren Hutton</a>'s innovatively-shot <i>Lauren Hutton and...</i>, and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Miller_e18e.html" title="Dennis Miller">Dennis Miller</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whoopi_Goldberg_25bb.html" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Brenner_9613.html" title="David Brenner">David Brenner</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenan_Ivory_Wayans_2d89.html" title="Keenan Ivory Wayans">Keenan Ivory Wayans</a> attempted similar programs; the only syndicated latenight contender to fail as infamously in ratings and critical reception as CBS's <i>The <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Sajak_5a3e.html" title="Pat Sajak">Pat Sajak</a> Show</i> and Fox's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chevy_Chase_Show_acf3.html" title="The Chevy Chase Show">The Chevy Chase Show</a></i> was <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Johnson_b171.html" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Hour_8677.html" title="The Magic Hour">The Magic Hour</a></i>.</p>
<p>As UPN and the <a href="../../../w/b/_/WB_Television_Network_db4b.html" title="WB Television Network">WB</a> began offering their affiliates ever-more nights of primetime programming, less call has been felt for first-run drama, at least, in the U.S.; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the '50s and various producers in the early '70s. The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators (particularly when they might be sold, with somewhat less risk, to cable channels); "reality" series such as <i>Cheaters</i> and <i>Maximum Exposure</i> and several series about dating stunts began to be more common in the early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>. Some of the more low-key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children, such as <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beakman%27s_World_6681.html" title="Beakman's World">Beakman's World</a></i>, <i>Animal Rescue</i> and <i>Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures</i>. They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> enforcement of rules on children's programming.</p>
<p>Several <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game shows</a> are currently syndicated; the most popular by far are <i><a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_of_Fortune_%28US_game_show%29_77e3.html" title="Wheel of Fortune (US game show)">Wheel of Fortune</a></i> and the latest incarnation of <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a>,</i> premiering in 1983 and 1984 respectively. The shows have been 1-2 or 1-3 in the syndication ratings consistently since at least the late-'80s. In fact, according to the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_9c82.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>, <i>Wheel</i> is the most popular syndicated television program not only in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, but worldwide as well. <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Feud_36a7.html" title="Family Feud">Family Feud</a></i> ended its first syndication run in 1985; a revival was a moderate hit from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> and still another revival has been airing since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. By far the most successful entry into the market in the 2000s has been the daily version of <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_%28US_game_show%29_de5d.html" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a></i>, premiering in 2002. New game show concepts (that is, not based on an existing or pre-existing format) are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication; <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Smarts_0c2a.html" title="Street Smarts">Street Smarts</a></i> was somewhat of an exception. A <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Squares_6908.html" title="Hollywood Squares">Hollywood Squares</a> revival also thrived during the late-90s and early-2000s, running six seasons until its 2004 cancellation.</p>
<p>The dominant form of first-run syndication in the US for the last three decades has been the "stripped" talk show, such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phil_Donahue_Show_a308.html" title="The Phil Donahue Show">Donahue</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tyra_Banks_Show_0486.html" title="The Tyra Banks Show">The Tyra Banks Show</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jerry_Springer_Show_e62c.html" title="The Jerry Springer Show">The Jerry Springer Show</a></i>. In many markets, a stripped show will be seen twice daily, usually with different episodes. Sometimes, station groups with more than one station in a market, or a "<a href="../../../d/u/o/Duopoly.html" title="Duopoly">duopoly</a>," will run one episode of a strip on one of their stations in the morning, and the other available episode on another of their stations that night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popularity of some of the audience-participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants, some of whom, such as <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morton_Downey%2C_Jr._1331.html" title="Morton Downey, Jr.">Morton Downey, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosie_O%27Donnell_27e1.html" title="Rosie O'Donnell">Rosie O'Donnell</a>, have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence; others, such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich, have a sustained run. A notable scheduling decision was made by <a href="../../../k/r/o/KRON_6f8f.html" title="KRON">KRON</a>-TV in San Francisco; a dispute with NBC led to their disaffiliation from the network, and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco, KRON decided to become the largest-market independent commercial station on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_high_frequency.html" title="Very high frequency">VHF</a> band in the US, with the exception of Los Angeles's <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacom.html" title="Viacom">Viacom</a>-owned KCAL (coincidentally once owned by KRON's current owners, Young Broadcasting), and soon tried running <i><a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Phil_%28TV_series%29_1e16.html" title="Dr. Phil (TV series)">Dr. Phil</a></i>, a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey-associate Phil McGraw, in primetime, with impressive ratings results.</p>
<p>While in earlier times, independent TV stations thrived on syndicated programming (including some venerable and quite profitable stations such as <a href="../../../k/m/s/KMSP-TV_a31f.html" title="KMSP-TV">KMSP</a> in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis-St._Paul_92cd.html" title="Minneapolis-St. Paul">Minneapolis-St. Paul</a> market), with the loosening of FCC regulations and the creation of new additional TV networks (<a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_CW_Television_Network_7388.html" title="The CW Television Network">The CW</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/n/MyNetworkTV_8eae.html" title="MyNetworkTV">MyNetworkTV</a> and <a href="../../../i/_/%28/I_%28TV_network%29_35f7.html" title="I (TV network)">i</a>), most of these independents have joined one or another of these or smaller (religious or low-budget) networks.</p>
<p><a name="Off-network_syndication" id="Off-network_syndication"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: Off-network syndication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Off-network syndication</span></h2>
<p>It is commonly said in the U.S. industry that "syndication is where the real money is" when producing a TV show. In other words, while the initial run of any particular television series may theoretically lose money for its producing studio, the ensuing syndication will generate enough profit to balance out any losses.</p>
<p>Off-network syndication occurs when a network television show is syndicated in packages containing some or all episodes, and sold to as many television stations/markets as possible. <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">Sitcoms</a> (short for "situation comedies") often do better in syndication than some dramatic shows due to the fact that most <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcoms</a> have few ongoing storylines; a viewer can tune into many half-hour sitcoms without worrying about having missed the last episode. With some dramatic series, missing an episode can throw off the viewer, even if the episode itself is a self-contained story. Moreover, syndicators and stations often will run episodes of some series out-of-order to satisfy other requirements at the expense of viewer satisfaction; this is less costly for sitcoms than other shows with more pronounced serial elements.</p>
<p>As an example of off-network syndication, the comedy show <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> ran on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Broadcasting_Company_8a11.html" title="National Broadcasting Company">NBC</a> television network from 1989 to 1998. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> syndicated the show to local TV stations in 99% of the markets in the country in 1994, the year that the show entered the top 10 list of network shows, and it became the most successfully syndicated rerun ever. In 1998, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Broadcasting_System_8ede.html" title="Turner Broadcasting System">TBS</a> bought cable rights to all 180 episodes of the show for 4 years, paying somewhere between <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>120 million and US$180 million.</p>
<p>Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its original network run. The most notable example of this is <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek</a></i>, which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969, but became a worldwide cult phenomenon after it entered off-network syndication, the success of which ultimately led to the <i>Star Trek</i> film series and the made-for-syndication revival <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> and three other series. Other off-network shows have run for decades in syndication, such as the 1950s sitcoms <i><a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Lucy_f6db.html" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honeymooners_1699.html" title="The Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a></i>, and the 1960s animated series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flintstones_047c.html" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i>.</p>
<p>Cable stations have been known to vie among themselves for off-net syndication; in 2006, episodes of the series <i><a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_House_0b64.html" title="Full House">Full House</a></i> were appearing on two cable channels (<a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Family_f6c6.html" title="ABC Family">ABC Family</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_at_Nite_831d.html" title="Nick at Nite">Nick at Nite</a>); <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Roseanne_%28TV_series%29_e63f.html" title="Roseanne (TV series)">Roseanne</a></i> likewise was visible on multiple cable channels. Other series seen on multiple cable channels simultaneously were often being shared by channels which had the same corporate owners.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more fee plugs have appeared during off-network syndication non-game shows such as <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/CSI%7E_Crime_Scene_Investigation_2fb2.html" title="CSI: Crime Scene Investigation">CSI</a></i>. Some of these fees charged pay for the distribution and editing of these shows for syndication, while others pay for closed captioning and promotional consideration.</p>
<p>In any event, the amount of stations airing syndicated shows depends on which station in a particular market airs a particular show.</p>
<p>Sometimes, how a program is acquired for syndication varies. In the case of shows syndicated by King World, stations loyal to the company generally have first choice on any program King World offers. For example, <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a>'s <a href="../../../k/x/t/KXTV_e1b5.html" title="KXTV">KXTV</a> is a charter affiliate of King World, and is offered first choice in the Sacramento/Stockton/Modesto market on King World's programming, and thus has first right of refusal (this is despite King World parent <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> owning both <a href="../../../k/o/v/KOVR_7037.html" title="KOVR">KOVR</a> and <a href="../../../k/m/a/KMAX_c254.html" title="KMAX">KMAX</a> in the same market)--for example, KXTV passed on the local syndicated rights to <i>CSI</i>, so King World offered it to other stations in the market in order of importance (this is generally the rule of thumb for all available television markets). For other shows syndicated by other companies, the syndication rights may be auctioned off to the highest bidder in a particular market.</p>
<p>The rise in popularity of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infomercial.html" title="Infomercial">infomercials</a> in the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a marked decresae in the number of older off-network syndicated series being aired by American and Canadian broadcasters, many of which now air paid programming such as infomercials during the overnight hours formerly occupied by old series reruns.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: Strip/daily syndication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strip/daily syndication</span></h3>
<p>Off-network syndication can take several forms. The most common form is known as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stripping_%28television%29.html" title="Stripping (television)">strip syndication</a> or daily syndication, when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week. Typically, this means that enough episodes must exist to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months, without episodes being shown again. If a small number of episodes exist, the entire run of the series can be shown in a matter of weeks. As explained by David Crane (creator and executive producer of <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a></i>), "A show will go in syndication for sure when it has reached its 5th year or 100th episode. If a Network Show only runs for 2 years or so there is usually no demand for syndication." But as you can read below, there are exceptions.</p>
<p>For example, the sitcom <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honeymooners_1699.html" title="The Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a></i> ran in syndication for decades despite having produced only 39 episodes during its original one-season run (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>). When shown in strip syndication, the entire series run could have been broadcast in seven weeks and four days. (Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Gleason_eefb.html" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> released additional episodes consisting of <i>Honeymooners</i> sketches which had originally aired as part of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jackie_Gleason_Show_d769.html" title="The Jackie Gleason Show">The Jackie Gleason Show</a></i> and eventually became part of the <i>Honeymooners</i> syndication package.) <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> had 180 episodes and thus could be aired in strip syndication for 36 weeks without repeating an episode, if one episode was shown daily. Another option common in Children's programming is the 65-episode block, which allows for a 13-week cycle of daily showings, so there will only be 4 repeats in a year.</p>
<p>In some cases, more than one episode is shown daily. Half-hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes, taking up one or two hours of broadcast time.</p>

<p>If a series is not strip syndicated, it may be aired once a week, instead of five times a week. This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication, but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching. More often, hourlong dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly; <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcoms.html" title="Sitcoms">sitcoms</a> are more likely to get stripped. In recent years there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a> (generally following the local news). This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many episodes; both <i><a href="../../../e/r/_/ER_%28TV_series%29_ba94.html" title="ER (TV series)">ER</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_%28TV_series%29_5872.html" title="The West Wing (TV series)">The West Wing</a></i> are currently being shown in this manner, as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_X-Files_4e17.html" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a></i> was during and immediately after its network run.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSI_2923.html" title="CSI">CSI</a> franchise, specifically the original and its Miami spinoff, both air in weekend timeslots, and the original is advertised on commercials as "CSI: Weekends". In fall-2006, other popular nighttime dramas, such as <a href="../../../w/i/t/Without_a_Trace_1975.html" title="Without a Trace">Without a Trace</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shield_c357.html" title="The Shield">The Shield</a> appeared in weekend reruns, with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Case_cf31.html" title="Cold Case">Cold Case</a> scheduled for fall-2007.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: Canadian dramas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canadian dramas</span></h3>
<p>In fall-2005, the Canadian series <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Vinci%27s_Inquest_5267.html" title="Da Vinci's Inquest">Da Vinci's Inquest</a> made its rounds in weekend syndication, and appears daily on <a href="../../../w/g/n/WGN-TV_d097.html" title="WGN-TV">WGN-TV</a>. The following year, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Squad_69cb.html" title="Cold Squad">Cold Squad</a>, another Canadian drama, appeared in weekend syndication.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_syndication.html" title="Edit section: Public-broadcasting syndication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Public-broadcasting syndication</span></h2>
<p>As with commercial stations, not all the air time nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U.S. public-broadcasting stations by PBS; additionally, there are some independent public stations in the U.S. which take no programming from that (somewhat) decentralized network. As a result, there are several syndicators of programming for the non-profit stations, several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some, not all, of their functions into the creation of PBS in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Public_Television_df0b.html" title="American Public Television">American Public Television</a> (APT) is the largest of these, nearly matched by <a href="../../../n/e/t/NETA_3602.html" title="NETA">NETA</a>, the National Educational Telecommunications Association; similarly, the recently defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator-descendants (of the Northeastern, Southeastern, and Rocky Mountain educational networks, respectively) of the pre-PBS era. Among the other notable organizations in the U.S. are Westlink Satellite Operations (based at Albuquerque's KNME), BBC Worldwide Americas (which often works with other distributors and individual stations, since it has no satellite access of its own in the U.S.), <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Welle_99b3.html" title="Deutsche Welle">Deutsche Welle</a>, Executive Program Services, the Program Resource Group and its member-station <a href="../../../w/l/i/WLIW_742c.html" title="WLIW">WLIW</a>, Long Island, NY's PBS station, which is (with the arguable exception of KNME) the most prolific contributor of any individual station of syndicated programming, most obviously the <i><a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_News_6e9a.html" title="BBC World News">BBC World News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus_5f2b.html" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i> in the U.S.</p>

<p>Radio syndication generally works the same way as in television, except that <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio stations</a> usually are not organized into strict affiliate-only networks. <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_network.html" title="Radio network">Radio networks</a> generally are only distributors of programming, and individual stations (though often owned by large <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conglomerate.html" title="Conglomerate">conglomerates</a>) decide which shows to carry. Some examples of widely-syndicated commercial music programs include weekly <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown.html" title="Countdown">countdowns</a> like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Dees_ff97.html" title="Rick Dees">Rick Dees</a>' <i>Weekly Top 40</i>, the <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Top_40_1771.html" title="American Top 40">American Top 40</a></i>, the <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Hit_30_Countdown_39cf.html" title="Canadian Hit 30 Countdown">Canadian Hit 30 Countdown</a></i>, and the nightly program, <i><a href="../../../d/e/l/Delilah_Rene_4833.html" title="Delilah Rene">Delilah</a></i>, heard on many U.S. stations.</p>

Two independently-produced, non-commercial syndicated programs, heard on hundreds of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_radio.html" title="Community radio">community radio</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_radio.html" title="Indie radio">indie radio</a> stations, are <i><a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Radio_4c87.html" title="Alternative Radio">Alternative Radio</a></i> and <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifica_Radio_b1e1.html" title="Pacifica Radio">Pacifica's</a> <i><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_Now%21_2a47.html" title="Democracy Now!">Democracy Now!</a></i>.</p>
