<ul>
<li>Kittybrewster gave a direct quote and cited <i>The Scottish Nation</i> (1867).</li>
<li>This differs from the quote online at electricscotland.com which cites <i>The Scottish Nation</i> (1863).</li>
<li>However, electricscotland.com gives "Published: 1863 (various editions)". This means it was first published in 1863 and there were later editions. This is different to straight reprints of the original. An edition can be (substantially on occasion) revised. This would explain the difference in text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing any other evidence, I accept the text quoted is as printed in the 1867 edition. Print sources are perfectly acceptable. If someone want to check to disprove this, then they need to either a) prove there was no 1867 edition or b) find the 1867 edition and show it was not the text quoted. Kitty may wish to provide a scan of his copy, but that is not required at this stage.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a> refers to editorial writing. It is not applicable to quotes. This is quite clear from <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Where we might want to state an opinion, we convert that opinion into a fact by attributing the opinion to someone. So, rather than asserting, "The Beatles were the greatest band," we can say, "Most Americans believe that the Beatles were the greatest band," which is a fact verifiable by survey results, or "The Beatles had many songs that made the Billboard Hot 100," which is also fact. In the first instance we assert an opinion; in the second and third instances we "convert" that opinion into fact by attributing it to someone. It is important to note this formulation is substantially different from the "some people believe..." formulation popular in political debates. The reference requires an identifiable and objectively quantifiable population or, better still, a name (with the clear implication that the named individual should be a recognised authority).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Quite obviously this quote is attributed to "a name" and also for that matter "a recognised authority". However, he is obviously not a contemporary authority, but a historical figure, so it is important to make this clear, as authors 140 years ago wrote in a very different style to contemporary authors. This enables the reader to make their own judgement and compensate accordingly. In fact the effect of Victorian overstatement can end up having the opposite effect on the modern reader to that which the author intended.</p>
<p>Even if this quote is not used, the opinion of the author can still be cited, as long as it is attributed to him. It therefore seems to me to be more economical, as well as adding some flavour to the article, to simply keep it as it now is. That's an editorial judgement which of course others are free to differ from.</p>
<p>However, regardless of that, I think this page is testimony to a very rigorous enquiry that is a credit to wikipedia.</p>

<dd>I am amazed that there could have been such a major exercise over this extremely modest article which contained nothing contentious or manufactured. There was a good set of source material given for such a minor article, in fact more than I have seen on countless other articles where often there are none at all. Looking back to when I created the article observers will see that I only attributed actual quotes to two writers. I cited Anderson as my source for much of the article but I did not actually quote him (although I lifted much from him). My edition is the revised 1867 (9 volume) set. But there are many editions of this work. I have seen editions as late as the 1890s and condensed into two big volumes. A glance at ABE Books will give some idea of the number of editions available. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 15:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, but what happened to the pear? Where is it now? Where can I get one?
