<p>CalJW, while I can understand you want to keep the page, there was a strong consensus in AfD for redirecting to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>. Unless you put forth a compelling argument for going against the consensus, I'm reverting to the redirect tomorrow. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanf_7f2e.html" title="User:Stefanf">Stefanf</a> 17:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've restored the redirect per the AFD result (which actually <i>I'd</i> probably disagree with), but I think some merging is called for. The David Beckham article hardly mentions his children. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:19, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, I've added it to the to-do list on DB's talk page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanf_7f2e.html" title="User:Stefanf">Stefanf</a> 19:44, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see that somebody has restored it again. I'm not going to take the matter any further because the AFD result was redirect (not delete and redirect) and because I personally think this article is fine as it now stands. That doesn't preclude others acting of course, perhaps by relisting at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> to get a clear consensus or taking it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:32, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The debate was on a one liner, not on this article. Also the <i>very</i> early closure was a blatant abuse of process; I am shocked that you have the nerve to defend it. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 16:30, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Very surprised to have seen this come out of redirect. Taking this to AfD again seems a bit odd especially given that the editor here has implied (in a somewhat uncivil manner) the importance of following due process. I would be recommending redirect for this version of the article as well so for me all that has changed is that an editor has unilaterally reversed an AfD consensus. I only came across this page because I used the AfD of Brooklyn as an example for <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>'s children and was surprised when this change was pointed out to me. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:32, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I have said the premature closure was a <i><b>blatant abuse of due process</b></i>. Which part of that do you not understand? It is patent nonsense to suggest that a "consensus" was properly established and I would ask you to withdraw that false assertion. You claim that I have misbehaved is clearly untrue and therefore I regard it as a personal attack. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 05:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have to assume that comment was directed at me even though it doesn't reference anything that I said which makes it a little hard to comment on. My comment re-spellt out is that there is a process for deletion. One editor felt that this process was not followed properly. There is a process for undeletion. This process was not attempted, instead the first process was simply ignored. No editors are currently involved in taking this further and the last comment here was a month ago so perhaps this is no longer the place for continuing the discussion. There are no personal attacks here, just greater incivility than I've previously ever come across on wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 06:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came here with the intention of recommending a merge into <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a>. I don't think the article should be deleted. I'd like to cut and paste the contents to a section within the Posh Spice article, and leave a nice redirect from here to there.</p>
<p>But I'll wait a while and see if anyone likes the idea. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a ridiculous article, its a child, he's done nothing himself to warrant notability, he's notable simply for who his parents are, this should be merged with either parent and then his name redirected. He's no more notable than any other celebrity child, if in the future he becomes a famous footballer, or actor, or anything to fit <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> then he can hae his own article. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 18:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Brooklyn Beckham is famous in the UK to a degree which is unprecented for a non-royal British child. His parents are the leading British celebrity couple of the 2000s and the media, especially the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloids.html" title="Tabloids">tabloids</a>, has chosen to treat him as a celebrity in his own right in a way which has not occurred in the UK before. This can be seen as a significant development in British <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_culture.html" title="Celebrity culture">celebrity culture</a>. Trivial aspects of Beckham's childhood, such as the cost of his birthday party, overheard comments he has made, and his father's difficulties helping him with his maths homework, have been given a degree of publicity which never occurred in earlier periods."</p>
