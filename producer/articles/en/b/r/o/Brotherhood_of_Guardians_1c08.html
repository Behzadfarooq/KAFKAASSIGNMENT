<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Edmund">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Edmund</span></h3>
<p>The first Echidna to take on the title of Guardian, Edmund was also the first to bear the white crescent birth mark on the chest that has passed down through the family line. Edmund was originally a scientist, and worked with his brother <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitri_Enerjak_bc75.html" title="Dimitri/Enerjak">Dimitri</a> on the Chaos Siphon. When Dimitri became Enerjak, Edmund was appointed Guardian and sent to defeat him. With the aid of several fire ants, he brought down Necropolis, Enerjak's stronghold. Edmund later perished when the Dark Legion, led by his nephew Menniker, attacked Echidnapolis. Knuckles later met Edmund during an attempt to change history, in which he worked together with his ancestor to safely lower Angel Island-an effort that failed. A second such past, in which Knuckles saved Edmund from being killed, resulted in Knuckles' <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roboticization.html" title="Roboticization">Roboticization</a>. Fortunately, neither attempt at alternation had any affect on the timeline.</p>
<p>Edmund, while alive, was an intellectual. Skilled in the field of politics, he felt that subterfuge was the best course of action to accomplish his goals. While he was deeply dedicated to his duties as a Guardian, family was infinitely important to him.</p>
<p><a name="Steppenwolf" id="Steppenwolf"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Steppenwolf">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Steppenwolf</span></h3>
<p>Edmund's son and the second in the line of Guardians, Steppenwolf's counterpart on the side of evil was his cousin Menniker, head of the Dark Legion. After his father's death, Steppenwolf was taken to Haven by the fire ant Christopheles, who then trained Steppenwolf in several ways. Steppenwolf then confronted the Dark Legion, and repulsed their first attack, banishing them to the Twilight Zone. Later on, he also repulsed an Overlander scouting party, led by <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_Robotnik_incarnations_794f.html" title="Alternate Robotnik incarnations">Dr. Robotnik</a>'s ancestor, Brutus Kintobor. Steppenwolf is dead in the current time period, either from old age or from falling in battle. However, his spirit appeared to the ailing Hawking, who then accompanied him into the afterlife.</p>
<p>Steppenwolf was the first warrior Guardian, having been trained in various methods of combat. Despite the fact that this was the primary focus of his instruction, he was also a powerful speaker, capable of convincing others that his ideas were right. Moreover, his dedication to his cause was incredibly strong, enough that he didn't flinch even when one of the people he had sworn to defend threatened to kill him.</p>
<p><a name="Hawking" id="Hawking"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Hawking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hawking</span></h3>
<p>Hawking was the Guardian of Angel Island when the Echidnas were attacked by their life-long enemies, the Dingoes. He protected Echidnaopolis from a nuclear attack with a dome shield, but then used a teleporter device to send all life off the island into another zone. He then spent much time cleaning it up, until it was again fit for habitation. He returned all the inhabitants except for the Dingoes and the Echidnas, both of whom returned after Robotnik fired the Ultimate Annihilator. Hawking, still powerful, but now confined to a wheelchair, fought against the impending threat, but the overextension of his abilities sent him into a coma and from which he did not wake.</p>
<p>In his youth, Hawking was a kind and friendly individual, eager to fight for the cause of good. Like many Guardians, he was strongly dedicated to his family, and particularly of his son Tobor. As an older Echidna bound to a wheelchair, he was somewhat cranky, and insisted that he could take care of himself.</p>
<p><a name="Tobor" id="Tobor"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Tobor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tobor</span></h3>
<p>Hawking's son and the first Guardian charged with protecting Echidnaopolis after the Dingoes' nuclear attack. Tobor battled the then Dark Legion Grand Master Moritori Rex, who attacked the Echidnas with advanced weapons while the citizens were left with farming tools. Tobor and Moritori were teleported to the Floating Island, where they were severely injured by falling ruins. Hawking, looking for his son, mistook Moritori for him and took him back to Echidnaopolis, where he infiltrated the Brotherhood. The true Tobor wandered the planet in shame, and had his eyes replaced with cybernetic implants. He later returned to the Floating Island, and was trapped in another zone with Kragok for a short time. The two later escaped in front of a Dark Legion attack ship, and Tobor sacrificed himself to take out the weapon and Kragok. Because of Moritori Rex taking his place, the rest of the Brotherhood assumed that Tobor was dead, and thus were confused when Spectre reported the death of a third Guardian besides Mathias and Hawking-Locke temporarily feared that the third sensed death was his son's.</p>
<p>Tobor's efforts may have been only half done, as an Echidna who is the spitting image of Kragok has taken control of the Frost Legion in the Dark Legion civil war.</p>
<p>As a youth, Tobor was determined to protect his family and people. He idolized his father Hawking, which made the switch with Moritori Rex all the more painful for him. Years spent wandering the surface made Tobor bitter, and for a time revenge was all that he wanted. However, upon returning to Angel Island and meeting Knuckles, he realized that what he wished for was to have his family back. Tobor remained firmly dedicated to his cause, perfectly willing to give his own life.</p>
<p><a name="Spectre" id="Spectre"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Spectre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spectre</span></h3>
<p>The oldest living guardian, the enigmatic Spectre is the most unpredictable of the group, the most ruthless in battle and one of the most powerful. He is unusual among the Guardians for several things: his black coat of fur, a cloud of smoke that trails him everywhere, blood-red eyes, and a silver open-faced helmet and flowing black robes resembling those common among the Dark Legion. Spectre is the son of Tobor, the father of Thunderhawk, and following the deaths of Mathias, Hawking, and Tobor, became the oldest living Guardian. Like most of the Brotherhood, he disappeared sometime during Sonic's <a href="../../../x/o/r/Xorda.html" title="Xorda">Xorda</a> induced exile in outer space.</p>
<p>In the <i>Mobius: 25 Years Later</i> story, Spectre immediately assumes that Lien-Da is causing trouble when Knuckles wants to use Haven 2's surveillance to spy on her family. Spectre was seen as an infant in a flashback, and it is unclear if more will be revealed about him, according to the editors.</p>
<p>Although Spectre can seem unfriendly and anti-social at times, he can be polite when he wants to, as demonstrated when <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Sally_Acorn_91a4.html" title="Princess Sally Acorn">Princess Sally Acorn</a> and he seemed uncharacteristically courteous towards each other. Spectre is also known for incredible hatred of the Dark Legion. Spectre is the most violent in his approach to Guardianship, as demonstrated when he brutally blinded <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Legion_a26e.html#Moritori_Rex" title="Dark Legion">Moritori Rex</a> or attacked Dark Legion soldiers purely out of spite. However, despite this apparent lack of moral inhibitions (or perhaps because of them), Spectre also possesses abilities that seem far beyond what the other Guardians (save Knuckles) have displayed, such as extra-sensory perception and telekinesis. Spectre always uses Chaos energy when fighting, feeling that going hand-to-hand with them would be vulgar.</p>

<p>Sabre is the son of Athair and the nominal 'leader' of the Brotherhood. He is the brains of the group, and is a top problem solver. He refuses to speak to his father, since Athair did not return the Island when Sabre's grandmother was about to die. Despite being born into the Lost Tribe, Sabre chose to return to Angel Island to assume Athair's place as Guardian. Sabre was also the first Guardian to be trained by <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie%29_4565.html#Archimedes" title="Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie)">Archimedes</a>, the Fire Ant who went on to instruct both Locke and Knuckles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Abilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abilities</span></h2>
<p>Since Steppenwolf was instructed in the manipulation of Chaos energy by the fire ant Christopheles, all of the Guardians have had the ability to control such energy. Each member of the Brotherhood uses it to varying power, and it seems to be augmented by their emotions. Use of these energies gives the Guardians powers such as teleportation, telekinesis, and the ability to fire Chaos energy blasts from various parts of their bodies, most often their hands.</p>
<p>Having been exposed to Chaos radiation while in his egg state, Knuckles is the most powerful member of the Brotherhood, being effectively a living Chaos Emerald. As such, he has demonstrated powers that no other member of the Brotherhood has ever exhibited, such as warping reality as he so chooses or healing any injuries that are inflicted upon him. Knuckles also temporarily used his power to become <b>Chaos Knuckles</b>, a green colored version of himself who is the most powerful Chaos entity on <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobius_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_2e4b.html" title="Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Mobius</a>. Knuckles is also uniquely possessed of super strength, and is the first member of the Brotherhood to have actual fist spurs. All older Guardians who appear to possess them are really wearing barbed mittens, a tradition originating in the Knuckles Clan, whose members include <a href="../../../t/i/k/Tikal_the_Echidna_edbe.html" title="Tikal the Echidna">Tikal the Echidna</a> and her father <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_6908.html#Pachacamac" title="Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog">Pachacamac</a>. Knuckles is the only Guardian whose knuckle spikes are actually part of his hand. His future/possible daughter, Lara-Su, allegedly has a similar feature, but is capable of retracting them into her hands.</p>
<p><a name="Haven" id="Haven"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Haven">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Haven</span></h2>
<p>The headquarters of the Brotherhood, Haven is located in the Forbidden Zone, a dimension split off from the rest of Mobius. Haven is the most advanced facility on Mobius, and all Guardians not on active duty reside here. Haven also serves as a monitor for nearly all activities on Angel Island, and many on the rest of Mobius. Haven was originally used as a training center by Steppenwolf, who was brought to the location by the fire ant Christopheles. During the Dark Legion Quantum Beam attack, Haven was demolished.</p>
<p>In the <i>Mobius: 25 Years Later</i> story, the Brotherhood lives in an identical facility known as Haven 2.</p>
<p><a name="Actions" id="Actions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Actions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Actions</span></h2>
<p>Despite their usual missions of observing Mobius, the Brotherhood members have gotten involved in matters personally. Such occurrences include when the disguised Guardians threw <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_villains_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_4316.html#Monk" title="Minor villains in Sonic the Hedgehog">Monk</a>, Knuckles' childhood tormentor, off the edge of Angel Island. They later attoned for this in a way by holding <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_villains_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_4316.html#Hunter" title="Minor villains in Sonic the Hedgehog">Hunter</a>, the human responsible for Monk's death, in prison. Later, members of the Brotherhood led by Guardian Mathias attacked the Dark Legion stronghold at the Grand Conservatory, resulting in Mathias' death.</p>
<p>While Sonic was in space due to the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Species_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_ba2f.html#Xorda" title="Alien Species in Sonic the Hedgehog">Xorda</a> attack on Mobius, every living member of the Brotherhood except for Locke fought against Dr. Eggman's forces when they came for the Master Emerald. While Spectre, Thunderhawk, Sojourner, and Sabre prevented the jewel's theft, they mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>Though minor characters within the comic, The Brotherhood do have an active fan base on the Internet. Many fan-fictions and fan-arts have been devised of the current Guardians (Spectre, Thunderhawk, Sojourner, Athair, Sabre and Locke). There is also a rumor of a radio drama being released on the internet based on the Brotherhood.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Guardians_1c08.html" title="Edit section: Major Continuity Errors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Major Continuity Errors</span></h3>
<p>Back in the letters page of Knuckles the Echidna #21 a fan asks a question about listing Knuckles' relatives in order up to Hawking. It states, "The father of Knuckles is Locke. Locke's father is Sabre. Sabre's father is Athair. <b>Followed by Athair is his mother Janelle-Li, the first and only female guardian, and daughter of Thunderhawk. Thunderhawk's father was Sojourner, who was child of Spectre.</b> Tobor the father of Spectre, and the son of Hawking."</p>
<p>It even goes as far as the official story in Knuckles the Echidna #29 when Spectre gives a roll call introduction to Princess Sally stating that his son is Sojourner and Thunderhawk is his grandson.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the Sonic Data Banks that this was changed around to Sojourner being the son of Thunderhawk.</p>
<p>As to reasons why this change was made nobody is quite sure. All that is known of this situation was that it was handled under poor editing. Hardcore fans got upset with this, but many have adapted to the changes.</p>
