<p>Hi. I've noticed the discussion initiated recently by the anon at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_Olsen_ef3c.html" title="Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen">Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</a> talk page. I'm not writing about the changes you made in the article (since you confirmed the stuff on the ImDb). But 2 things caught my attention there: First, when the anon, in his very first sentence, wrote that he "expect to see changes immediately". He's been vandalising the article for weeks, or months, and now that he can't do it anymore, he's giving ultimatums in the talk page. That goes to show what that guy is all about. And here is proof that this <b>is</b> the vandal (or one of them, anyways): in his last edit in the talk page (today) he again altered someone else's comment on the talk page — I've reverted it (that's the second thing that caught my attention). He cannot claim that he didn't know that this was not allowed, since the talk page has been vandalised many a time (most likely by that very person) and in every revert, at least three different users (myself included) have warned that comments on talk pages are not to be touched. Blocking him might prove somewhat difficult though, since he uses some sort of "ever changing" IP address (the last set of numbers constantly varying), but something needs to be done about this anon.

<dd>Hello again. Thanks for answering. Your actions in the article were well-thought. I have not heard of an active vandal such as this one ever being talked out of being a vandal though. I have a suggestion to deal with this: we block the talk page as well (maybe for a shorter time than the article is going to be blocked), but we create some sort of copy of the article and the talk page in the Sandbox, or maybe as a temp page, and insert a last message in the talk page asking him to discuss and make the changes he thinks should be made there. This way, we wouldn't be alienating him, and if there's any chance of "converting" him, we might just accomplish it. If not, he may ignore the copied page, but even if he doesn't, if he starts vandalizing the clone article, it won't make much of a difference, and we won't have to waste our time reverting him. I know you have reserves about blocking talk pages, but in this case, as long as this person has something, anything that he can vandalize in that article, he won't let go. This time he almost got away with it, since he did it when he had just made his own comments there. Also, I believe that if we take the Olsen twins away from this person he just might let go and maybe even mend his ways. This appears to be some sort of hardcore fan, which may also indicate that this may be a child, or an early teen. If we don't do that, he will keep attacking the talk page, even if he sometimes makes comments, just as he had done for quite some time with the article itself. How about this?

<p>Hi. I'm sorry to bring this to your door again. For some reason that I simply cannot grasp, some other Admin unblocked the article. And there it is again: the anon deleted the filmography, changed without justification a series of details. It's all over again. What I really can't understand is this other Admin (not you, of course). He simply came and unblocked the page, without any comment in the talk page or justification. Did he not read about the constant vandalism?? I believe the Admins have some sort of forum where they discuss specific Admin stuff, right? Well, something's gotta be said about this. If you won't do it, please direct me to the proper forum so I can complain about this guy. This was just down right preposterous. And, of course, could you block the page again? Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 21:04, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for answering. The problem with the anon's edits is that he is trying to enforce what we can only assume is his take on the data. The information I've inputted in the article, which isn't all that much, really, I've collected researching websites, and most importantly, cross referencing no less than three sites, to make sure that it wasn't just one person's idea of the facts. This was a while back though. When you change information, however, it's simple procedure to say why, maybe name sources, at the very least in the edit summary. The anon never did that, in fact he ignored repeated requests to do so if his edits were not to be reverted. He couldn't care less. He only started talking when we blocked the page, and even so just to say "this and that is wrong and I expect to see it changed immediately". He constantly deletes material from the article (the filmography being the most recurrent, but not the only front of his attacks at all), again without a word. This person is not willing to work together or compromise with anyone. As I have said, it's probably a kid who is a diehard fan of the twins, or someone with serious issues. I had said that blocking the page for days, or a week, would not suffice to get the anon to move on — which is what he has to do if he is not willing to work with the community, which is how Wikipedia functions. I did say that at least a month would be necessary to get any results there. If Michael Snow had taken the time to actually understand what was going on in the article, he would not have unblocked it, not if he knows what he's doing. What is that: "one week is up, unblock the page"? That might work in the case of a revert war between registered users, to give them time to talk it out in the talk page, but certainly not when a obssessed anon is involved. In fact, I checked Snow's talk page, and there it was, someone complaining about his blindly unblocking protected pages. In this particular instance, there it was: in less than 24 hours, there was the anon at it again, just like before. And it's not just me who thinks so: besides Yamla, already several other users have reverted his edits. But he'll just continue ignoring us and just vandalising again and again, even if in his mind he's not vandalising. There's no other way here: we must protect the page and keep it protected, until the anon starts talking seriously, or moves on.

<p>Hi, I got hold of that image about ten years ago when I started up the TCAS. Either someone sent it to me at a time when I was circulating TC pics, OR I scanned it in off the back of a library book (can't remember which one - I used to do this a lot in response to people's requests for pics). Sorry to be so vague! It's only ever been used on the TCAS site as far as I'm concerned, although I don't know what others may have done with it.

<p>Hi - Traipsing through the history I'm fairly certain the image was created by user:Robert Saunders in collaboration with user:JDB1983, neither of whom look to be active anymore. Do you have any suggestions for how to handle this? My interpretation of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> is that if this image was created for submission to wikipedia it is GFDL. I'm not the original author and I'm not sure if the user's contribution history (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robert_Saunders_18cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robert Saunders">Contributions/Robert Saunders</a>) is sufficient evidence that he was the originator of this image.

<dd>Actually, I think that does follow (X is GFDL and Y is derived from X, implies Y is GFDL regardless of what Y's originator might claim). Brilliant! Thanks. -- 03:25, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Except, Image:Monty-hall.png is public domain, not GFDL. Drat! I'll write something up based on the submitting user's edit summaries, which clearly imply (to me) that it was created for submission to wikipedia and is therefore GFDL.

<p>If you don't even know anything about the movie, why are you inserting yourself into this? John Connor is not even a character in the original Terminator - he is an important character in Terminator 2 and Terminator 3 (although his existence is important in the first one). He would certainly warrant an actual article. But having a redirect (and one to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Terminator_9e8e.html" title="The Terminator">The Terminator</a>, a movie in which, so far as I can recall, he is not even a character!) is ridiculous. The name John Connor is a common one (I know a guy named that, for instance), and most of the links to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Connor_efd2.html" title="John Connor">John Connor</a> are referring to men other than the fictional character. It is not standard practice to create redirects for any movie character who does not have an article of his own. I have deleted it again. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 28 June 2005 05:02 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes - I thought I was deleting John Connor again, but due to redirects, I accidentally deleted <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminator_%28movie%29.html" title="Terminator (movie)">Terminator (movie)</a>. At any rate, I've created a short article at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Connor_efd2.html" title="John Connor">John Connor</a>, so we don't have to worry about it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 28 June 2005 15:36 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you never answered my Taylor Caldwell entry above, so I'm assuming that image is OK to use?? I would now like to put an image on the Jess Stearn page, however the one I've seen is already on a web page - how could I go about using that - or can't I at all?

<dd>Thanks for your reply on my talk page.

<p>I couldn't quite find what I was suppposed to put on an image that had been stolen off of a website. I saw you were a participant in the "Image Tagging Club", as I like to call it, and thought you could help me.

<p>This is in reference to the Stardestroyer.net article that you listed as protected deleted. You commented that it was recreated enough times. It was only recreated once by a single person and no one else bothered take part in that obvious trollish behiavor. I believe at some future point a case could be made to allow the article back on Wikipedia. That means going through the proper channels. But listing the article as protected deleted makes that far more difficult, and I find it ultimately unnecessary. If the article gets constantly recreated without going through the proper channels is a problem, then consider further action, but don't automaticaly go the strict route just 24 hours after the article got deleted in a very hot VFD. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 20:10, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In reguards to your questions about the originality of my Gemsbok article, I did in fact write the article that is posted on the ADW, and am indeed Sheri Sanders (as listed on the ADW). I was wondering what kind of proof of autheticity you would like... after much thought, little of what I came up with seems like the easiest means of going about this. Also, I am not entirely familiar with the GFDL, so what specifically do you wish to have me include in the article? I am going to get around to wikifying it as well, but I simply wanted to get the information up for use. Sorry for all the trouble my newness to this whole program!

<p>Hi Broken,</p>
<p>Will you be around this weekend? I'm taking a mini Wiki-break for the next couple of days and it would be useful to have a spare pair of eyes to keep a watch over POTD and the Today's Second Feature on <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_second_feature_Saturday_d4ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's second feature/Saturday">Saturday</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_second_feature_Sunday_dafb.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's second feature/Sunday">Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>I've set up all the POTDs for the next week or so and all the elements of the Second Features are in place and are (should be) protected, so the only thing to do is follow up on any complaints about captions etc. on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>, or tweak the image width - which is difficult to judge until you see the template in context. Also if someone makes good changes to the associated POTD caption I usually like to copy them over to the Today's second feature since its protected and most people can't edit it. If someone does manage to vandalise anything on the MainPage, <a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">User:PFHLai</a> can be helpful in getting things put back to normal. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again- Your comments were <i>most</i> helpful. As a stumbling newbie, I really appreciate your help. David Justin 17:19, 18 September 2005 (UTC) P.S. Given that Wikipedia articles are unsigned, I'm clueless as to why anyone would want to plagiarize in creating them. There doesn't seem to be any benefit in doing so.</p>

I don't vandalize, nor do I delete anything that is factual. I'm out to get the stuff not worthy of being on this server, now there is no reason why you should oppose that.</p>

<p>You're the resident crypto expert so I thought I'd ask you this. Do you think it makes sense to merge and redirect <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_chiffre_ind%C3%A9chiffrable.html" title="Le chiffre indéchiffrable">Le chiffre indéchiffrable</a> to <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher.html" title="Vigenère cipher">Vigenère cipher</a>(which I have been trying to improve)? Neither one discusses Vigenère's autokey cipher in any detail, so they both discuss the same thing. (Perhaps I just should have done it, but I seem to remember reading somewhere that there was a difference between them) <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 23:08, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! Nice work on <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher.html" title="Vigenère cipher">Vigenère cipher</a>, and I agree entirely about merging <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_chiffre_ind%C3%A9chiffrable.html" title="Le chiffre indéchiffrable">Le chiffre indéchiffrable</a>.

<p>Sorry for taking so long to get back tou you (my life has a been a bit hectic). Where did I put an explanation of my revert? In the revert comment I wrote "I'd rather discuss changes like these". I was hoping your response would have been to leave a comment on the talk page about why you feel it should be changed (and I would have responded to it). Please excuse if it had been discusssed before but somehow I missed.

<p>I have had that pointed out to me before but some I very much respect use transcluded signatures - the problem only comes if I ever change it - which I don't intend to do. However, since I last revisited the issue at least one person I looked to on this issue has kowtowed to the pressure and stopped using it. I am going to ask him to protect my sig page so it won't be subject to vandalism and consider dropping it all together - I will miss the colors. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 00:57, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>First let me refer you to WP:NPA.</li>
<li>Second: What could have been a possible resolution to that discussion? Changing the archives seems to be the only possible solution (aside from doing nothing). The conversation, however, devolved into name calling (ex. "fucking shithouse", "mental asylum inmate", "menace to the collective IQ" etc), arguing over defintions and there was no discussion over whether things were actualy archived improperly. I'd say that's the definition of a debate that's going nowhere. I don't plan to respond to any comments left on Talk:Main Page under that section so if you want to continue this discussion use my talk page.</li>

<dd>If you are just going to respond with something to make yourself feel better, don't bother. If you are going to take my complaints seriously, then do so. But frankly, as soon as you got involved, I did a little research and discovered just what sort of person you are. I don't really want this conversation. I just want to help at Wikipedia, but there is far too much politics here. I will try not to get involved on future discussion pages, but a lot of people here have bad attitudes. Yes, I used some strong language, but your sweeping actions are just as offensive to a delicate flower like me. Now I must leave and reach for my 'medication.' --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOw_3a14.html" title="User:JohnOw"><font color="red">J</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOw_3a14.html" title="User:JohnOw"><font color="orange">o</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOw_3a14.html" title="User:JohnOw"><font color="darkyellow">h</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOw_3a14.html" title="User:JohnOw"><font color="green">n</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake"><font color="cyan">O</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Code (cryptography)"><font color="white">You found the secret writing!</font></a> 18:26, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Alright...</li>
<li>First: My references were in reverse order because I was reading from the bottom to the top looking for insults, not because I was trying to emphasize something. Try to assume good faith. Also, on what basis do you call me a moron? I have been nothing but patient and I think my comments are accurate. Do you know me in RL? I thought not.</li>
<li>Second: Calling someone a "menace to the collective IQ" is name calling (or at the very least insulting someone). Anyone disputing that fact is quibbling over definitions.</li>
<li>Third: If you aren't taking this seriously, then why do you care if I remove a whole bunch of you and some anons arguing? I didn't remove your complaint (you did). I just removed all of the non-serious stuff.</li>
<li>Fourth: I'd be interested to know what "research" you did and "what sort of person" I am.</li>
<li>Fifth: You called the person who archived "God". Anyone (even non-admins, or as you might say non-Gods) can archive talk pages. If you want avoid situations like this, why don't you start archiving pages?</li>

<dd>Oh. That's what you want. The reason I was leaving messages on your talk page was because that's a wikipedia style/custom. You leave messages on my talk page and I'll respond on yours (that's just how it's done, see my other conversations on this talk page).

<p>No problem, it's not your fault. From what i've seen, my opinion of Pigs is that he's basically the scum of Wikipedia -- he's even driven a user to get another username in fear of harrassment. It's ok as long as he stops, but I don't think he will since he's basically thumbing his nose at everybody up to the arbcom itself, but if you can stop his crap, that's awesome. Once he starts up again, i'll block him again.

<p>Voltman was voted MVP of a forum which gets millions of hits per year. He is a special character and deserves his own page. Can you give some advice on how to make clear it isn't an attack but rather fact-based article so that his article doesn't get deleted in the future? ~Josecuervo</p>

<p>I did read about templates, and I admit was pretty confused. I was just looking for a way to insert often repeated text into various articles I have and will submit. I thought they were local, i.e. somehow just in my user space. But, I see that are very global. I did not know how to create text in my user space for inclusion, and I thank you for the suggestion. Give me a day or so, and then I'll delete the templates myself. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJHenderson_96ee.html" title="User:JohnJHenderson">JJ</a> 21:53, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Related to the above, what I want to do is to create a series of bibliographic entries in one place (like my user space?) and then pull each reference from this space into references in various article I write. If I can then pull a specific reference from my user space, it will be reflected in every article that uses that reference. BTW, that's why 'subst' does not work, since any changes need to be reflected in what may be many places. But, here's my question. Can I create a single page in my user space and label each entry so that I can pull out a specific entry when referenced in another article? For example,</p>
<p>My Page</p>
<ul>
<li>This is entry 1.</li>
<li>This is entry 2.</li>
<li>This is entry 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>My Article Page</p>
<p>Pull out just entry 2 from My Page</p>
<p>If this is unclear, I'll try to reword my question.</p>
<p>Thanks. You are of much help to me. And, I'm glad I am no longer poluting the Template space! BTW, what's an administrator? I don't understand how you find all my mistakes so quickly. And, it's OK, since I want to learn as much as possible about this great project in true democracy.</p>
<p>And, one more question. Where is the best place to ask questions and get prompt, accurate answers? Are you happy to answer my questions, or is there a better forum?</p>

<p>Thanks for you speedy response. The reason I am using indirection, is that I'm creating the bibliogaphic entries "on the fly," and I sometimes make mistakes, e.g. not italicizing a title. If I have placed this reference in a number of pages, it's a pain to 1) find them all and 2) replace the text. Does this make sense?</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to search for text within a page? If I could search all pages for "Campbell, Catherine," I would consider using cut and paste. Thanks again. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJHenderson_96ee.html" title="User:JohnJHenderson">JJ</a> 13:09, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my article on White Mountain Art, there are many references to North Conway, NH. Is it good style to ensure that every mention is a link the the wikipedia article on North Conway? Or, should just the first reference by a link? Thanks.</p>

You have been very helpful to me, and I, again, thank you. Would you be kind enough to give this draft a very critical review?

<p>I have look at your minor edits. Thanks. Is it proper not to capitalize the headings? If so, shouldn't The Willey Tradegy be The Willey tradegy?</p>
<p>I have not yet reviewed your other comments, but thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have read your detailed comments, and it may take me a day of so to make suggested changes. I should mention, however, that I am a collector of White Mountain art, and it is always referred as "Mountain" not "Mountains." So, I'm inclined to leave it as White Mountain art. Again, I would capitalize all headings, but apparently that's not the convention. Is this true even with article titles? Please advise. Again, you have been a big help.</p>
<p>Regarding the photograph, you have raised a good question. I was the project lead on a project to compare White Mountain paintings to various scenes today. I will contact the photographer (who worked with me) to ensure that he gives his permission. At the moment, let's let it go with the ball in my court.</p>

<p>I am overwhelmed by this. Thank you. But, why?</p>
<p>The concept of wikipedia blows me away. I was in high tech for many years, and this fulfills its greatest promise. The whole is much, much better than the sum of its parts. This concept will, truly, revolutionize knowledge as we know it. Anyone with a PC and a desire can learn and contribute. And, the end-result will be truthful and accurate and better than a university of academics (not that I'm anti schooling - I've paid my dues!).</p>
<p>You took me under your wing. I made mistakes. I didn't read enough of the introductory material. But, I'm willing to learn, and I'm very open to constructive criticism and producing the best material that I can. I cannot thank you enough for your help and encouragement.

<p>I have added a section on Characteristics of the artists. There are many artists listed in a short paragraph. The thrust of this section is to describe characteristics that are more telling than signatures. So, here's my question. Should I add a gallery of many images to this section, or should I add hyperlinks to my Website that show images of the characteristic to which I refer. For example,</p>
<div class="thumb tleft">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="../../../b/c/0/Image%7EBc008t.jpg_b0fb.html" class="internal" title="A typical, early (1867) painting by Champney"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/0/08/Bc008t.jpg/180px-Bc008t.jpg" alt="A typical, early (1867) painting by Champney" width="180" height="111" longdesc="../../../b/c/0/Image%7EBc008t.jpg_b0fb.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a href="../../../b/c/0/Image%7EBc008t.jpg_b0fb.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="../../../skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>
A typical, early (1867) painting by Champney</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="http://whitemountainart.com/ArtistGalleries/gal_bc.htm" class="external text" title="http://whitemountainart.com/ArtistGalleries/gal_bc.htm" rel="nofollow">Benjamin Champney</a> was a master at painting water and is known for often favoring warm autumn colors. I could add an image that represents his style (see image on left), but there would be too many for the section. Or, I could add a hyperlink to the text to show an example from my Website:</p>
<p><a href="http://whitemountainart.com/ArtistGalleries/gal_bc.htm" class="external text" title="http://whitemountainart.com/ArtistGalleries/gal_bc.htm" rel="nofollow">Benjamin Champney</a> was a master at painting water and is known for often <a href="http://whitemountainart.com/OnePageImages/landscape_bc008.htm" class="external text" title="http://whitemountainart.com/OnePageImages/landscape_bc008.htm" rel="nofollow">favoring warm autumn colors</a>.</p>
<p>I'm leaning seriously toward the latter, but I welcome your advice.</p>

Nobody else shows up on the history so it looks a little odd. Has that happened to you before? I note that you tried to restore the missing text, but you took an earlier edit - I have restored the page to the most recent edit so all is well now. Cheers! <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 09:49, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
