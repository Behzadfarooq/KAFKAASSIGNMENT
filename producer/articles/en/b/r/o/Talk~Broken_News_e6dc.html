<dd>Yeah, I agree with you on the separate pages thing - and the poor quality of the TV show. On the topic of which existing stations the fictional ones parody, I saw a strong element of Yorkshire's <a href="../../../l/o/o/Look_North_a867.html" title="Look North">Look North</a> in Look Out East, but I'm not sure whether to add anything because of the fairly generic nature of local news. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasHarte_c731.html" title="User:ThomasHarte">ThomasHarte</a> 14:15, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I always got more of a feel for the old style (Richard Whiteley-era) ITV Calendar News. The locations are clearly East Anglia based, though (I definitely remember <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swaffham.html" title="Swaffham">Swaffham</a> in one episode). It could of course be a meta-joke based on the fact that it's virtually impossible to get Anglia Television in Norfolk; I lived in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunstanton.html" title="Hunstanton">Hunstanton</a> for 18 years and we could only ever pick up Yorkshire TV... <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 11:16, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not that I would dream of saying it in the article, of course, but I think this was one of the best new programmes on TV this year.

<p>The reason it resembles the day today is simple - The Day Today parodied multiple news channels, so does Broken News, as someone who actually watches the news these things (to a lesser degree) actually happen! I watched the first episode and then turned over and watched the news on BBC1, a very surreal experience since I could see Aronovitz Business News with real presenters, and any Film review show will never be the same. The Day Today, to me, lost the air of pseudo realism by going too far and being too extreme, whereas Broken News did more of "Real" presenters doing very odd news stories in the style of real News Programmes/Stations</p>
<p>By caompairing them you assume that if The Day Today was remade today it would be Broken News (or apparently a much better Day Today) ... This is not bourne out by what the makers of The Day Today have actually been doing? <sup><a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasterMereel_172d.html" title="User:JasterMereel">Jaster</a></sup> 13:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah right, and Shakin Stevens is nothing like Elvis (but he's better than him). The Day Today is one of the greatest comedy shows of all time, Broken News is a missing the point of everything facsimile of it that has been mercifully forgotten by almost everyone. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBingo99_1c2d.html" title="User:Bingo99">bingo99</a>, 5 September 2006</p>
<p>"The Greatest Comedy Show of all time"&#160;? So why did very few watch it? Why has it not been repeated? Why di they not make more shows? Why is it never mentioned on the endless compilation shows? Perhaps because it was a show of it's time, (and wasn't very funny even then)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It has been repeated a number of times. And to quote Screenonline "The Day Today (BBC, 1994) was the most radical satire seen on British screens since the 1960s, and marked the arrival of a new generation of comic talent. Despite lasting just six episodes, The Day Today's influence extended well beyond its short run. The programme's core team would go on to some of the most innovative television comedy of the next few years" <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/946730/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/946730/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/946730/index.html</a></p>
<p>And this quote from the Off The Telly website: "Here's a good question: what is the most subversive TV programme ever broadcast in Britain? I would say there are only two possible answers to this question: Brass Eye and The Day Today. The 'Eye probably shades it, being so perfect, so extreme, that no-one, not even Chris Morris himself, could take it any further. But TDT was the most devastatingly accurate demolition of its target (specifically, pompous, pseudo-authoritative TV news, and more generally the trend towards lowest-common-denominator tabloid TV). Most British satire simply isn't worthy of the name - either it's pseudo-"anarchic" outrage-by-numbers (we're talking The 11 O'clock Show, the equivalent of those losers who were still punks in 1985) or bumblingly ineffectual Daily Telegraph gentility (Rory Bremner - Who Else?). By contrast, TDT jumped in, bit the hand that fed it up with a rare ferocity, and ensured we could never take television news seriously again." <a href="http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/daytoday.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/daytoday.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/daytoday.htm</a></p>
<p>As for compilations. I've seen it in a number of thes tatty compilations shows.</p>
<p>"Channel 4 - Britain's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches 18. The Day Today - Swimming Pool 19. The Day Today - Bureau de Change <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/vote.html" class="external free" title="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/vote.html</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBingo99_1c2d.html" title="User:Bingo99">bingo99</a>, 6 September 2006</p>
<p>Apparently Austrailians are saysing it's a rip off of "CNNNN: Chaser Non-Stop News Network" which no-one in europe has even heard of ... but apparently is very funny</p>
<p>The Day Today predates CNNNN by about eight years. And its initial radio version "On The Hour" by about 12 - <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBingo99_1c2d.html" title="User:Bingo99">bingo99</a>, 6 September 2006</p>
<p>So important it doesn't get a mention on <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_satire.html" title="News satire">News satire</a>?? Isn't an updated copy of <a href="../../../t/h/a/That_Was_The_Week_That_Was_1d99.html" title="That Was The Week That Was">That Was The Week That Was</a> which got a rather larger audience?</p>
<p>Can we stop this now ... Ok so It wasn't that good (but some people liked it) but that is opinion so it won't go on the page It's a bit like The Day To Day and there are some fanatical fans of that show out there who compare every other news satire show to it but why is there a section of the page with uncited comparasons on it ...? the only quote/reference in the section says it's not like The Day Today .. So if no-one puts some references on this section I'll remove all but the most obvious ones i.e. the slab/spear of urine and CNN/CBN:CBS/IBS bits <sup><a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasterMereel_172d.html" title="User:JasterMereel">Jaster</a></sup> 12:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quick go to Making The News and put loads of comparasons to The Day Today on that to ....</p>
<p>The criticisms arent that they are both satirical news shows. The criticisms are much more specific and less broad than that, especially as neither is a topical satire show. Both attack news presentation in an extremely similar style - <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBingo99_1c2d.html" title="User:Bingo99">bingo99</a></p>
<p>The problem is that they are both programs that satirise news programs themselves (not the content) and there are very few others (I can only find CNNNN that does) so the Day Today advocates start comparing the two, unfortunately they cannot see that they are different programs and the similarities are because they are satirising the same thing, and News programs have not improved ... Regional news programs were this bad and still are! Most American news networks do speak earnestly on "major" news then trivialise other important news, and reporters are still sent on pointless Live interviews etc..etc... <sup><a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasterMereel_172d.html" title="User:JasterMereel">Jaster</a></sup> 07:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And identical jokes being used, and TDT's unique style slavishly copied and specific characters being almost identical. It's sets, visuals, characters, entire tone ripped off. TDT has been lauded as one of the most iconoclastic show ever, if your show is similar, it's not accident. If it's that similar, it's Xerox TV - <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBingo99_1c2d.html" title="User:Bingo99">bingo99</a> - 3 October 2006</p>
