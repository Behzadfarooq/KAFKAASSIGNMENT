<p>I corrected the reason for the 2003 orchestra strike. The previous version stated that the strike was to protest producers' plans to replace them with a virtual orchestra. Actually, the reason for the strike because producers wanted to reduce the minimum number of musicians required during contract negotiations. The musicians threatened to strike if the contract expired. That's when the producers threatened to use virtual orchestras.</p>
<p>"Musicians who work in the orchestra pits... might walk off the job after their union contract expires on Sunday. Negotiations between the musicians' union and producers have hit a snag over a clause in the contract that requires a minimum number of orchestra members to be hired for each Broadway theater... Broadway musicals this week are rehearsing with prerecorded music to prepare for a potential strike." - <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/02/25/leisure.broadway.reut/" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/02/25/leisure.broadway.reut/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/02/25/leisure.broadway.reut/</a></p>

<p>Actually, the correct spelling is "Broadway theatre." Please check <a href="http://www.americantheatrewing.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.americantheatrewing.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.americantheatrewing.org/</a>, <a href="http://www.broadway.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.broadway.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadway.org/</a>, <a href="http://www.broadwayarchive.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.broadwayarchive.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadwayarchive.com/</a>, and <a href="http://webcdi.com/theater/theatre.php" class="external free" title="http://webcdi.com/theater/theatre.php" rel="nofollow">http://webcdi.com/theater/theatre.php</a>. While most Americans spell "theater" with an "er" (as per American spelling conventions), in the field of theatre as a profession, the majority of theatres use the spelling "theatre." This can be seen from the magazine "American Theatre" published by the Theatre Communications Group and the American Theatre Wing which sponsors the Tony Awards. "Broadway theater" should be included as a cross-reference, but the correct spelling of the entry is "Broadway theatre."</p>

<p>Good question. In some cases, I left the spelling "Theater" because that is how it is spelled in the theatre's name (Winter Garden Theater, Lincon Center Theater.)</p>
<p>The main Wiki page for theatre is spelled "theater," so linking to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theater</a>, I left it how that page is spelled. In other cases, I left the word spelled theater when it refered more to a building, and opted for theatre in other cases. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p>I disagree with the claim that "theatre" is the "correct" spelling. There are two widespread spellings in use, <i>theatre</i> and <i>theater</i>. It may be the case that the trade organizations prefer <i>theatre</i>, but that merely dictates official usage, not actual usage. The general public uses both. I have no objection to the current location, as usage is mixed, but merely to claiming it is the only "correct" location. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 06:36, Oct 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">User:Delirium</a> -- regardless of how Britain spells "theater" and whether that's "correct," Broadway is located in America, where "theatre" is spelled with "-er" and therefore should go by American spelling standards.</p>
<p>The naming convention is actually a little trickier than that. In America, the word "theatre" refers to the art form and the idea, while the term "theater" refers to an actual building. Because this article is <i>not</i> about an actual building, but rather, about the art form as it relates to broadway, the name <i>theatre</i> is correct. --<a href="../../../o/m/t/User%7EOmtay38_1bad.html" title="User:Omtay38">omtay38</a> 01:53, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guess again! The spelling variation is the U.S. is <i>even more</i> complicated than that! The trend over the last few years has been for the <i>theatre</i> spelling to be shifted towards proper names (to match the American use of <i>centre</i>, which is now almost entirely found as "Centre"). The trend has by no means yet pushed the spelling all the way towards the "Centre" usage, but it's getting there. Since this article is not about a particular theater known as "The Broadway Theatre", the spelling really should be "Broadway theater". --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom"><font face="bookman old style"><i><font color="#FF0000">Cultu</font><font color="#FF5555">ral</font> <font color="#9999FF">Fre</font><font color="#5555FF">edom</font></i></font></a> 2006-07-21 14:36 (UTC)</dd>

In the text of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway_theatre</a>, I saw:</p>
<p>"The longest running show in Broadway history was Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, which closed in 2000 after running for 7,485 performances at the Winter Garden Theater."</p>
<p>But in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cats_%28musical%29.html" title="Cats (musical)">Cats_(musical)</a>, I saw:</p>
<p>"It was on the stage in the New London Theatre for exactly 21 years and 8,949 performances, from 11 May 1981 to 11 May 2002, the longest running musical in British musical history."</p>
<p>The two statements disagree about number of performances and closing date. Since I know nothing about theatre, I have no idea which statement is correct or whether I'm just misunderstanding something (in which case the pages need clarifaction). Can anyone resolve the confusion?</p>

<p>Can someone confirm this? I've personally heard 499—but this statistic should be reputable. Can anyone find the actual requirement from the true source? <b><a href="../../../m/x/d/User%7EMxdxcxnx_d1cd.html" title="User:Mxdxcxnx"><font color="#302226">mxdxcxnx</font></a> <sub><a href="../../../m/x/d/User_talk%7EMxdxcxnx_9a17.html" title="User talk:Mxdxcxnx"><font color="#B048B5">T</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mxdxcxnx_e7e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mxdxcxnx"><font color="#B048B5">C</font></a></sub></b> 00:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A New York theatre is a "Broadway theatre" if it's owners are members of The League of American Theatres and Producers, and the League has determined that theatre to be a Broadway Theatre. The 499 seats is a reference to one of the factors that determine which contract actors will work under. For instance, 99 seats is the usual maximum for an Equity waiver show. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwango_6be7.html" title="User:Swango">Swango</a> 06:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe that is totally correct. The League is basically a trade organization that has two primary functions: to promote Broadway theatre, and to negotiate contracts with the theatrical unions (Actors' Equity, the various IATSE locals, and the musicians). Contract language with these unions defines what is and isn't a Broadway theatre. I don't have the Equity Production (i.e. "Broadway") Contract in front of me, but my recollection is that it defines a Broadway theatre as one which is in a certain area of Manhattan (i.e. the Theatre District) and which has over 499 seats. Over the years, that definition of what a Broadway theatre is (however it first came about) has been integrated into all kinds of agreements and contracts, and it's pretty solid at this point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is another factor as well: the definition of what theatres are eligible for Tony Awards, which is set by the American Theatre Wing and the League, which co-administer the awards. By this definition, the theatres of the three non-profit companies (MTC, Roundabout and Lincoln Center) are Tony-eligible, and therefore considered by most people to be Broadway houses, even though the actors work under a negotiated rider to the LORT contract, which is generally used in regional theatres, and not the Production Contract. (Disney, too, has a seperately negotiated contract, as did LiveEnt before it went belly up.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fortunately, the Venn diagram of these various definitions pretty much overlaps perfectly, and there isn't all that much confusion about which houses are Broadway houses and which are not. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 20:36, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article contends that "legitimate" refers to theater in opposition to film or TV. This doesn't make much sense when you consider the term "legitmate THEATER" which seems to suggest an opposition to other forms of theater, not another medium entirely. Specifically, I have heard this term to be used to describe plays in opposition to musicals or revues, or else refer to narrative performance in opposition to performance art, burlesque, or stripping. The citation associated with this comment, at Variety's Slanguage" defines the term thusly:</p>
<p>"legit -- legitimate (live) theater. The term seeks to differentiate serious theater (think Shakespeare, think O'Neill) from vaudeville or burlesque"</p>
<p>Clearly, this contradicts what is written in the article. I suggest removing the reference entirely or else changing it to reflect its actual meaning.</p>

<dd>The derivation was incorrect, and I've changed it. "Legtimate" was meant in opposition to vaudeville and burlesque. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 18:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a lot more variation on playing schedules than there used to be, but generally speaking a Broadway schedule is Tuesday through Saturday at 8, Wednesday and Saturday matinee at 2, and Sunday matinee at 3. An alternative that many shows also use is to have a Monday night performance instead of a Sunday matinee. Some shows have started doing an earlier performance on Tuesday (7:00), and shows much more frequently than they used to will juggle their schedule according to the season. Thursday matinees (at 2) are now used more than they used to be 20 or so years ago, and sometimes a show will add that matinee and lose a mid-week evening performance. Producers are a lot more aware now of who their target audience is, when they are more likely to come to a show, and what days are the dead ones, and they adjust their show schedules accordingly. Several factors limit their flexibility: they have to pay everyone more for doing more than 8 performances in a week, and Equity limits actors to doing 5 performances over the course of three days, unless a penalty is paid. (The other unions may have contract language that places limitations on the schedule as well.) Also, shows generally try to come down after 3 hours, since the stagehands get additional if it goes over that. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 20:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
