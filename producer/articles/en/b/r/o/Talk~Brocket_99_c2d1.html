<p>Can anyone verify the claim that Brocket 99 has a cult-like following across North America? In the last 30+ years, I've lived in three different provinces and three different states. I never heard of the tape until after I moved to Lethbridge. Even then, it wasn't until I was here for five years before I first heard about it. -- <a href="../../../k/m/s/User%7EKmsiever_02b6.html" title="User:Kmsiever">Kmsiever</a> 03:35, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a British (not Canadian) citizen currently living in Edmonton, Alberta. I heard about the tape years ago. While I am not convinced it has a cult-like following (it is highly offensive, after all, and 'cult-like' implies love), it is certainly much more widespread than simply Lethbridge. Heck, I've never even been to Lethbridge except to attend a wedding. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:28, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently a few people have heard of it outside of Lethbridge, but that being said, I know several people across Canada who had never heard of it. There needs to be some mechanism other than anecdotal evidence that we can use to determine the tape's notoriety. I am not sure an obscure documentary counts either. I had not heard of this documentary until someone had mentioned it here. -- <a href="../../../k/m/s/User%7EKmsiever_02b6.html" title="User:Kmsiever">Kmsiever</a> 15:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the original author of the "cult-like" phrase, I should mention that the characterization of the tape as "cult-like" was not entirely my doing, rather it was taken from an article in the Globe and Mail from the week I wrote the original version. Outside of what I learned from that article I know very little about the tape, so please take my version with a grain of salt. --<a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullUpYourSocks_a019.html" title="User:PullUpYourSocks">PullUpYourSocks</a> 23:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I learned about the tape (and actually listened to part of it) when I lived in Medicine Hat many years ago. I didn't know it originated in Lethbridge and while Medicine Hat isn't too far away my point is that I had heard about it.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmilner_9b90.html" title="User:Jeffmilner">Jeff</a> 21:02, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's get something straight. All you answers to your questions can be found on Brocket99.net The recording is universal and widespread. It started off as a joke amongst friends(hear interview of Ernie Scar) that was dubbed and dubbed again until it gained a cult like following around English speaking countries in the world. There is even a line of fashion apparrel named after Brocket 99 that people actually buy and wear.

<dd>As Peter Yellowhorn once said to Iris Larrett, "Boo #uckin' Hoo" How can something be referenced if the referecne is then used as copyright infringement. This is a circular nonsensical notion. We have cited sources and references, but you call them copyrigth infringement. Maybe you should listen to the Ernie Scar Interview, The Cowboy SmithX Interview, the Lenny Red-Nuts Interview, and the Charles Kang interview available on Brocket99.net. Also read the various articles that have answered a lot of the questions people have about Brocket 99. The answers are there, you just have to look.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are approaching this as a research academic paprp, wheras we need to not the interview name, date, at what point in the recording the quote was made and so on. Most of us don't have time to do this, and it is not neccessary at all. Creating a link to the interview, recording, letter, or article should be enough. And no it should not be called copyright infringement.</dd>

<p>We are asked to cite spources. When we gives cite sources, we are accused of copyright infringement. If we don't cite sources, then we are accused of making things up. Brocket 99.net is a plethora is real information on Brocket 99, and thus must be cited as it contains interviews, articles, and so on which are all part of the Brocket 99 universe.</p>
<p>Brocket 99 is simply not a radio parody from 20 years ago, but is in fact a living entity which has inspired various spinoffs, interviews, articles and so on. Kmsiever wants Brocket 99 to be the original tape and Nilesh Patel's film. Fortunately, the world of Brocket 99 is much larger now and must include the various spinoffs, interviews, websites, characters(both real and fictional) as part of what Brocket 99 is. We have mentioned and cited various sources but now are accused of copyrigtht infringement. How are we supposed to cite information without mentioning site, books, interviews, spinoffs or anything. All of these contributions are relivant to Brocket 99. Mentioning Nilesh Patel's film is copyright infringement so why is that OK but referencing a site or an interview on CD considered a NO NO.</p>
<p>And about citing sources: How can you prove anything? Prove to me Brocket 99 was recorded where you say it was. I don't see and citations for previous Brocket 99 information.</p>
<p>Let's live in 2007 with the information that we have, not the ignorant year of 1992 where people thought Brocket 99 was made by a bunch of bored University students out of Lethbridge or Edmonton. Let's get real and build upon the information of Brocket 99, instead of burying our heads in the sand listening to 40th generation copies of Brocket while giving kudos to Nilesh Patel sipping Branvin in the Bridge Inn.

<dd>I have no opinion about battles among the fans of Brocket 99, and I doubt that Kmsiever does either. When we ask for citations, it's fine to <i>mention</i> websites, films, books, CDs and so forth: just don't <i>copy</i> information verbatim from them. The article probably needed citations even before the recent additions — the call for citations is coming now because the article has been drawn to the attention of experienced Wikipedians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, it is important that the citations added are from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Perhaps brocket99.net is a well-known and reliable source within the world of Brocket 99 fans. We have no way of knowing that, unless you can provide sources independent of brocket99.net which indicate that it's considered reliable. (Has the site been mentioned in newspaper articles about Brocket 99, for example?)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To cite the documentary, you might want to create a <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">footnote</a> section and use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_video_5ed7.html" title="Template:Cite video">cite video</a>}} template.

<p>Okay, let's try to define cult-like status. If I've never heard of the band Phish before, but am told they have a cult-like following, first thing I'd do is google "Phish." Well, if you google Brocket 99, on page 1 alone I find two fan-based websites, one of which sells official "gear." I see a film website. I see that the film has been featured at an International Film Festival. I see a film review by a national literary and arts magazine. I see a Wikipedia entry, for heaven's sake. Seems to me there's a culture surrounding the phonomenon. Just because I've never heard of it while in Montreal does that make it any less popular to its devotees &amp; detractors? Just because I've never heard of Phish, do they not exist?Mydinque 14:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
