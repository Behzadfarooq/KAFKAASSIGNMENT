<p><i>With its good schools (both public and private), good transportation (several branches of the MBTA Green Line traverse the Town), and good government, Brookline is a choice spot in which to reside or establish a business.</i></p>
<p>It sounds like the Brookline Chamber of Commerce wrote this entry. The transportation I can understand, but what makes Brookline's government and schools "good"?</p>
<p>This isn't meant as an insult, rather as a query.</p>

<p>According to the "Challenge Index", Brookline High School is in the top 4% in the country, and ranked 704th overall. <a href="http://www.csh.k12.ny.us/highschool/data/TheTopHighSchools.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.csh.k12.ny.us/highschool/data/TheTopHighSchools.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.csh.k12.ny.us/highschool/data/TheTopHighSchools.htm</a></p>
<p>I'm planning on rewriting this article. I can't at the moment - I have a deadline soon, but I will as soon as I can. <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> 05:23, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I can say that my entire pre-college education was at Brookline public schools and they WERE good. A pretty excellent preparation for all that followed. That Brookline has "good schools" is a truism which is at least repeated by every real estate agent and reflected in home prices. So while it might not be "objectively" true (though I would definitely argue that it is), it is a feature of the community which is generally held to be true, and certainly affects the economic and social milieu of the city. Joshua Penman, 23 June 2005</p>
<p>As a resident of Brookline, I would second the "good schools" part -- for a lot of people I know, that's one of the main reasons they chose to live in Brookline. Now, as to whether that's why it's a good spot to establish a business, I don't know. And the whole "good government" thing seems to be a bit much. There's certainly nothing particularly wrong with Brookline's government, except perhaps structurally, but it's not so fantastic that it draws people here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff.green_338d.html" title="User:Geoff.green">Geoff.green</a> 15:33, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would further add that my parents, when migrating to the US from Israel in the early 1990s, inquired among their friends and colleagues, and Brookline was consistently mentioned was one of the towns with the top public education infrastructure in the US. As someone who has gone through those schools (8th grade and high school), I certainly agree. <a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoavShapira_f928.html" title="User:YoavShapira">YoavShapira</a> 19:58, 24 July 2005 (EDT)</p>
<p>This whole article isn't <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">POV</a>. Brookline is a jewel of a suburb? COME ON!!! I'm not doubting that Brookline is nice, in fact, I know Brookline is nice. I've been there. But the whole Culture section needs to be rewrittten. It's filled with adjectives such as "marvelous" and "magnificent". It reads like it was copied from an article in a travel section of a magazine. As for the part about the schools, how about instead of calling them good, we put in those statistics that <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> found. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBIG_BROTHER_785b.html" title="User:BIG BROTHER">BIG BROTHER</a></p>

<p>As another notable statistic, Brookline is 27% foreign born. It is also worth mentioning that Brookline has a number of large public housing developments. Despite its overall wealthy reputation it does have a fair amount of lower income residents. On the other side however, housing prices, like in most of the Boston area, are currently skyrocketing. It is rapidly becoming an unafordable place to live for many middle income families. There is also a convent in Brookline.</p>

<p>This article (before my edit) claimed that <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Wallace_%28journalist%29_9172.html" title="Mike Wallace (journalist)">Mike Wallace</a> was <i>not</i> born in Brookline, while the article about him claimed that he was indeed born in Brookline. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908794/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908794/" rel="nofollow">This site (IMDb)</a> also says that he was born in Brookline. So, where was he born? If we cant resolve this, should we note it in the article or maybe we should remove that detail about him.</p>

<dd>If I'm not mistaken, Mike Wallace was born in an elevator at Newton-Wellsley Hospital in Newton, MA. However, Brookline was his hometown since birth. If you consider place of birth, I would assure you that people like Conan O'brian and Theo Epstein wouldn't qualify as being Brookline natives.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.163.241.20 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.163.241.20_050e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.163.241.20">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Then his place of birth should be Brookline. Then again, if someone was born in England (for example), and when she was a week old her parents flew her to Brookline and she lived their until the day she died, I would not say that Brookline is her place of birth. So where do you draw the line.

<p><i>On the June 8, 2006 episode of The Daily Show, John Hodgman declared Brookline to be the SMILF (Soccer Mom I'd Like to <b>Fuck</b>) capital of the world.</i></p>
<p>I love swearing. I do recognize, though, that there are parents and teachers who do not share my affinity. Much as I would change their minds for the better, I also know that they are not particularly movable on this point. And of course, these people certainly wouldn't allow their young children/students to read this load of <i>smut</i>!</p>
<p><b>So</b>, acknowledging this, why don't we strike a compromise with the single, otherwise unimportant F-word in this article? We could use a trio of friendly asterisks instead of the last three letters, thereby encouraging the popularity of Wikipedia among such parents and teachers, and thus enabling the use of Wikipedia by middle-schoolers who find themselves disposed of only those source materials which have been permitted them by their educators.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the policies: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfanity_526b.html" title="Wikipedia:Profanity">profanities in quotes must never be obscured with asterisks</a>. But I ask: are these policies, as applied here, harming Wikipedia just a little bit? <a href="../../../o/m/p/User%7EOmphaloscope_e6a5.html" title="User:Omphaloscope">Omphaloscope</a> » <a href="../../../o/m/p/User_talk%7EOmphaloscope_4d06.html" title="User talk:Omphaloscope">talk</a> 05:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
