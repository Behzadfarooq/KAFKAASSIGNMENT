<dd>I would support the more compressed format. I would also like to suggest cutting many of the award listings altogether. <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> has a lot of awards and nominations, and I don't see the benefit of listing every small regional film award it managed to pick up. Especially not since this article is rather overlong already. Wikipedia readers may want to know that Ang Lee won the Oscar for Best Director for <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, but I doubt many would care that he won the same title from the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association and Florida Film Critics Circle. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 05:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone tell me what this paragraph means?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Journalist and political pundit Andrew Sullivan speculates that the Catholic Church now sees the power of the film as a threat in that it might lead Catholics to see the "affliction" of "deep-seated homosexual tendencies" from Church teachings as "deep-seated homosexual love" or "deep-seated human love" instead.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It makes it sound like the "Church teachings" of the Catholic Church have deep seated homosexual tendencies. I didn't know church teachings could have orientations themselves. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 06:23, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're misinterpreting the (admittedly cumbersome) sentence. The way I read it, the "deap-seated homosexual tendencies" are seated in the homosexual person, not in the church teachings. Sullivans point is that if people view homosexual feelings in terms of love rather than lust, they may be more accepting of the lifestyle. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 07:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's what I figured. But I wasn't sure. It is a very confusingly worded sentence. I think it may need a rewrite. I'll work on the rewrite, if there are no objections. I won't tinker with the words in quotations marks, but that words the connect them. It's a good point that this paragraph makes, but the point isn't articulated very well. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 20:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here's my rephrasing of the paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Journalist and political pundit Andrew Sullivan speculates that the Catholic Church now sees the power of the film as a threat that may change the perspective of Catholics. Sullivan speculates that Catholic officials fear that the film might lead Catholics to rethink whether homosexuality is truly an "affliction". Further, Sullivan speculates that perhaps Catholic officials fear that the film may encourage Catholics to view homosexual love as emanating from "deep-seated human love" rather than being a love based purely on sexual acts.</i></dd>

<dd>For whats it's worth I think the Catholic quote belongs in a different article, it doesn't directly contribute anything meaningful to the Brokeback article. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 05:38, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That the statemnt is interesting is not being contested. However, it primarily deals with the Catholic church's view of homosexuality, not the film itself. For these reasons I feel it would be more appropriate in an article relating to homosexuality or the Catholic church. Also, upon further consideration, if Mr. Sullivan is "speculating" this quote really has no place in an encyclopedia article at all. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 08:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was the one who introduced the word "speculate." I did so merely as a means of giving variation to the words being used in that paragraph. I doubt that Sullivan, or anyone, can do any truly "scientific" work to determine whether Brokeback Mountain is encouraging Catholics to view homosexuality as being more founded on love than on sex. In the context of political commentary about such matters, all anyone does is "speculate." If this reference is removed, then we'd better go to Rush Limbaugh's page and remove a great deal of what he is quoted as saying, as well as Michael Moore's page, et al., because there is a great deal of speculation in their statements as well. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 12:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To Eternal Equinox: Having a year linked to a "year in film" article seems to be the norm in film articles. Having the year it is released linked to "year in film" does not seem out of line with the guidelines. Certainly, if it bothers you, you could have changed it to "<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">released in 2005</a>" which would not have been an easter egg. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 21:14, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried earlier to take a crack at putting all the trivia into relevant sections, but my changes I thought were not ideal, so I didn't make them. I would suggest changing the section "Filming locations" to just "Filming" and incorporating the anecdotes about the filming into that section. Also, add a section called "Cast and crew" with the anecdotes about people who were and would have been involved in the making of the movie. The Bush and O'Reilly comments can go somewhere in the "Critical reception" section, and the bit about release in China could go into a new section called "Release", which might be expanded to include more information about the release(s) or lack thereof. The trivium about the soundtrack can be removed as far as I'm concerned. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 23:13, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Friends, thank you for understanding that this movie is really an update of Romeo and Juliet, it's a wonderful movie, but the only difference is the lovers are male and the families are the wider society.<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHank_chapot_26c1.html" title="User:Hank chapot">Hank chapot</a> 05:25, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But that is a MAJOR, MAJOR difference. This film is actually very specific to the subject of closeted gay people, and the "star crossed lovers" angle is one played up by the filmmakers so as to attract the widest possible audience. I feel for the people trying to come up with ways to promote this story to middle America, but I don't think Wiki should play along with that. "A star-crossed lovers story," besides being a weak way of describing anything, unfairly simplifies this movie.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What is so great about the film is its truthfulness and subtlety; when I saw it, from all the hype and Ang Lee's own comments I was expecting something so much more obvious, like a gay Titanic ("a classic romance," bollocks). It's hardly even a love story, because they, or Ennis at least, can't allow themselves to love. There is always a self-hatred in there. Because of the film's high quality, I doubt it will work so well as a preaching tool to open people's minds. A homophobic person might well see it and come away even more convinced of their intolerant worldview; after all, Jack and Ennis' actions lead to nothing but misery for everyone. They value their love above all else. This makes them like Romeo &amp; Juliet. But the essential difference is that they are adults with families. And because it's a gay love, society allows NO accepted outlet for it. Society has deluded them into wanting what they can't have-- the normal family-- and into trying to create it. But they can't fight their natures, so they destroy both themselves and the "traditional" family. Although it's obvious Twist is closeted from the beginning, it's up in the air whether Ennis is "gay" in the inborn sense. But it's clear he is in love with Jack. A clinical right wing appraisal of their actions would show them selfishly sacrificing everything to their lust. This is in fact a more accurate reading than the film's supporters will admit to. It's weird, the disapproving fundamentalist takes on this film (of which Stephen Hunter provided by far the best) seem to nail it better than the attempted liberal ones that miss the point. It's not a nice love story. It is all about sex, lust, and the destruction of families. Because living that kind of lie is all that society, and society's strictures as ingrained inside these men, particularly Ennis, will allow them. Brokeback Mountain is too realistic to provide an argument either way for "gay is good," it will just solidify existing views. But it's could be an argument that gay marriage is good for society. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 172.151.122.18 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.151.122.18_6d72.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.151.122.18">contribs</a>) 03:20, 4 February 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Matthew Shepard style gay bashing episode"</span></h2>
<p>I think this should be taken out of the plot summary, because it's very ambiguous how Jack actually died. Ennis imagines the worst, but that's not necessarily what happened. Whoever wrote it is presenting their personal interpretation as fact, which is maybe Original Research.</p>
<p>Also, the short story predated Shepard's murder, so if the implication was that the story was influenced by that other Wyoming gay tragedy, that's completely wrong.</p>

<p>Both wrong. Please go back and watch the movie. During the flashack scene, the one of the men brandishing the tire iron is the man Jack met out with his wife (with a beard) who invited Jack to his cabin on the woods. It is highly doubtful Ennis knew what this person looked like or could image his appearance to this degree of accuracy. The face of the victim is also Jack. What can be inferred from this scene is that Jack went and met this person only to walk into a trap to entice amd murder him because he was gay. We are being shown a flashback of what really happened, not Ennis' imagination. The entire movie reverberates with the Matthew Shepard incident. The movies opens with Ennis recounting a story of his father bruttally murdering two gay men, he lives in fear of it, and it happens to Jack. It's a notable theme in the movie, and one clearly put their intentionally by the writers and director. Waya sahoni 03:00, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And if you actually read into the scene, it is never explicitally said, "This is how Jack died". It is not known whether this is his imagination, or flashes of the actual event. That's the beauty of it, it's up to the viewer on how they read it. But more broadly, yes, it's possible (if not probable) that Jack was assaulted which led to his death, but it's not the place of a Wikipedian article to say so.</p>

<dd>Then please provide a reputable NPOV source that says so. That is a completely POV statement because how do you know what the director intended unless he said so in a interview? And have you read the short story? I have and the possibility of Jack being bashed is alluded to with the reference to Ennis thinking that someone got to Jack with a tire iron.

<p>The original short story does make it clear that Jack died as a result of an attack because he was gay. While it is not clear in the film, it is clear in the book, so I think it did happen, and can be included in the article. It may be that the person who attacked him in the film was the guy he met with his wife. I didn't pick up on that detail when I saw it, but if that was the case then I think it further supports inclusion. Having said that, I don't think that a comparison with Matthew Shepard is appropriate. This is partly because we're talking about fiction, not real life events, and because there is no evidence to suggest that the events influenced the fiction. It's also POV because it conjures connotations of all the emotion that went with the Matthew Sheppard case, and there is no actual relationship between the incident in the story and the real life incident, other than the fact that it was an attack on somebody who was gay, resulting in his death. - They're just my thoughts. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 04:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. Although I didn't get the impression from reading that book that it was explicit that he died that way (since it described Ennis's thoughts, rather than the events itself) however, the fact that he was almost certainly assaulted is worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">čĥàñľōŕď</a> 04:07, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added a section which I hope meets folks approval. I relate strongly to this film. I am a married man with children and grandchildren, but in my youth in Texas, I met a cowboy from burnet Texas in my mid-twenties who was married (he was a year younger and a lot better looking that Jack Twist), and although I am not gay, something happened and we had an intense and powerful secret relationship that lasted for almost a year with secret rendevous into the Texas hill country with "hunting trips" (although we made our cover and always made sure to bring back a deer for his wife). His wife found out about us when she intercepted a love letter he wrote to me. I have never had such a relationship since and have never admitted it, but over the years, he has sent me letters telling me about his kids and I have felt that same longing. Not for the sex, which was secondary, but the intense emotional high we shared together which I am unable to explain. We were incredible friends, but I recognized we needed to stay away from each other, and we have since. He does call me and asked about a year after we broke up if he were to leave his wife, if I would move in with him. I declined, and I have had a rich and happy life, but I always wonder what would have happened had I continued the relationship. I guess I'll never know, but something inside of me told me my fate was not to live him, but to marry, father children, and settle down as a married man. I think about him over the years and I do miss him, and I know he feels the same, but I won't allow my life to end up like "brokeback mountain". Waya sahoni 05:05, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>It doesn't matter what was in the short story or even in the script. What was presented to us was an ambiguous scene that was never clarified. It could be that the director / editor intentionally changed the scene from the original story to be ambiguous, knowing that it would have greater impact; or it could be someone had something particular in mind that answered the question. It doesn't matter what the intent was, because it is not objectively solved in the film. Any interpretation of the scene in my mind violates NPOV because we simply cannot say what actually happens in the context of the story, because the final scenes that made it into the film do not have a clear answer on this. Interpreting the scene is up to the viewer, even if the director or other crew had thoughts of their own. TAsunder 23:20, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, it reads more like "Here's a long list of problems these people had with the film, because THESE PEOPLE SUCK!" It does have a bit of a hostile tone to it, and it does focus almost entirely on the groups that have obvious problems with the subject matter of the movie, and thus a tad of a "shame on them" feel to the notations. It also overlooks some critics who have cited that they have no problem with the homosexuality, it's the cheating that they can't stand. Personally, as a bisexual, I'm a little disgruntled that the alternative sexuality community thinks this is the best they can do as a banner to fly over themselves as a great movie.

<dd>Doesn't matter. It's still lying to the women involved, and putting them at risk to a certain extent. I'd say Rose wasn't cheating as her involvement with the man in question was not sexual or even confirmed, and was forced on her by others rather than chosen by her. The characters in Brokeback Mountain did make the choices (to be involved with those women), and they did lie.

<dd>My point to start with, though, was more along the lines that all the controversies focused on groups that disliked it purely for the homosexual content, and there's little to no mention of anyone disliking it for other reasons.

<p>I agree that the Controversy section is way too long already (I'm going to try cutting it down in a minute) without adding "representation" for every possible reason someone might dislike the film. As far as I know there was no large-scale, organized protest about adultery in <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, abd there's no reason to mention that some individuals didn't approve of that part of the story. We might as well say that some people thought the movie was too long, or that some people just don't care for love dramas. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 04:02, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that neither Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger are not gay is not "Trivia". One doesn't need to be gay to play a gay character. The fact that not a lot of people involved in the production were <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> is covered elsewhere in the article. And the legal standing of Sodomy and Adultry in fictional setting is not trivia. It's a movie, not real life. Sodomy and Adultry were illegal in a lot of states during that period.

<dd>Sodomy and Adultery being illegal could explain why many people felt the need to hide their homosexuality in 1963 Wyoming...however your <i>"it's a movie, not real life"</i> statement is duly noted. I would ask, are Bush's comments in a speech about this movie to be considered trivia? It seems irrelevant...but then again...I'm not a <i>Bush-hater</i> so what do I know....I'm merely posting and discussing in order to "test" the WikiBias that seems to exist.

<dd>The fact that Sodomy and Adultry were illegal isn't mentioned in the storyline, but it conforms with social attitudes to homosexuality at that time. So while, yes, Sodomy and Adultry were illegal at the time in which the film was set, since the film doesn't deal with the legal issues of homosexuality it hardly seems relevant. I do agree that Bush's comments seems not even that noteworthy considering he doesn't say for or against the film. Just sounds like another off-the-cuff Bush comment. So, yes I agree it should be removed. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">čĥàñľōŕď</a> 09:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>if Sodomy and Adultery were considered legal at the time, would that be considered trivia-worthy?....just wondering.

<dd>Homosexual aren't a cause. They're people. And unless you actually interview and ask everyone single actor on the movie you can't say categorically that no actors were gay.

<dl>
<dd>No offence, but I don't agree with that comparison. Race and Sexuality are hardly the same. You don't need to look the part of a gay man (well, not that Jack and Ennis are explicitly gay) you just need to act it. Straight actors play gay actors and vice versa all the time. I would however find it somewhat interesting if no-one on that set was homosexual at all, but I a) highly doubt it b)would find it difficult to prove. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">čĥàñľōŕď</a> 12:37, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is nothing wrong with having a brief description of the movie in the opening paragraphs.

<dd>Casablanca is a 1942 film set during World War II in the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz, and stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.

<p>Saying that Brokeback Mountain is about a same-sex relationship is as much of a spoiler as saying that <i><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanic_%281997_film%29.html" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> was about a love affair on a big ship that hits an iceburg, which begins...</p>

<li>The relationship between the two characters isn't just part of the plot, it's central to the movie. (Full disclosure: haven't seen it yet.) This claim seems tantamount to claiming that revealing that Dorothy visits the Land of Oz in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> is a spoiler. After the amount of press that's surrounded this movie, is it likely that anyone will be going into this movie not knowing that the two characters have a relationship?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wyoming, United States</span></h2>
<p>Do we really need to specify that the movie is set in Wyoming, United States? It's not like there's another Wyoming, and I can't imagine that anyone who's heard of this movie doesn't knows it's set in the US. But whenever "United States" is edited out, it gets put back in again. Can anyone present a good reason why the country needs to be included? "Wyoming, United States' fictional Brokeback Mountain" seems like a clumsy phrase to me.

<dd>I guess I don't think people are as stupid as you do. One need not have ever heard of Wyoming to be able to figure out that an American-made film based on a story by an American author and starring two guys in cowboy hats is probably set in the US. If someone actually was confused as to where Wyoming might be, they could simply click on the <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> link and learn all about it. Other articles for Westerns don't insult the intelligence of their readers by explaining that US states are actually in the US. (See <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dances_with_Wolves_d03d.html" title="Dances with Wolves">Dances with Wolves</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Missing_3804.html" title="The Missing">The Missing</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales_4d3d.html" title="The Outlaw Josey Wales">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a>, etc.) Even the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a> article mentions Texas without specifying "Texas, United States." If you're just looking to make some political point about the US not being "the most important nation in the world" then this is the wrong place to do it. It's also an ineffective technique, as sticking "United States" into articles where it isn't necessary looks more like an overpatriotic attempt to promote the US than anything else. That said, whoever changed the line in question from "Wyoming, United States' fictional Brokeback Mountain" to "the fictional Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming, United States" did manage to reduce the clumsiness of the phrase. I still think it's stupid and awkward to specify the country, but at least it doesn't read quite as badly now. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 18:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. The article for an American made movie (Memoirs of a Geisha, for example) would surely include "Japan" (Kyoto, Japan).

"The two young men meet in 1963 on a sheep herding job on Wyoming, United States' fictional Brokeback Mountain" (which was the original sentence I objected to) is hideously clumsy.

The questionable benefit of telling people what country Wyoming is in does not outweigh the fact that the original sentence I objected to was awkward and overlong. "The film was shot primarily in Alberta, Canada" is both clear and brief, so I don't care if the country name is included or not. I have no special agenda with regard to country names. My chief concern is good writing. One of Wikipedia's biggest flaws is that the quality of writing is often quite low, and I think we all need to try to do a better job in that regard. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 00:01, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont understand. I interpret "The film depicts a sexual and emotional relationship between two men living in the American West in the 1960s and 1970s." to mean that the film takes place in the western part of the US, so when Wyoming is mentioned later, you infer that Wyoming is in the US.

<p>The text says that "the willingness of production companies in Canada to assist with the project" was part of what motivated Ang Lee to film in Canada. This is too obvious to require stating--if they had been unwilling to assist with the project, he couldn't have shot there--unless the implication is that American companies were unwilling to assist.

<dd>I'm sorry to revert your changes so quickly, but I think you went too far in detailing the events of the film. Actually, now that I look through the history it seems that Diego Moya was the one who went too far. I can understand that you wanted to better explain the information he added about the movie's ending, but between the two of you I think far too much has been given away. Even though there's a spoiler warning I don't see any reason for revealing several major plot twists. It's boring for people who've already seen the movie and ruins things for people who haven't. I think the earlier version that explained the premise and early events of the film contained enough information, so I've removed everything that describes the ending. We can discuss the matter here. If the consensus is that it's appropriate and necessary that the article describe how <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> ends then I'll go along, but I didn't want to leave major spoilers up until it's been discussed. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 03:53, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I know that, but that doesn't mean we should have spoilers just for the sake of having them. It would be difficult to discuss a movie like <i>The Crying Game</i> in much depth without giving away a major plot twist, but I don't see how the <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> article benefits from having every detail of the movie's ending laid out.

<dd>Sorry to be so wordy, but I've just looked around more at other movie articles and the Wiki suggestions for movie articles. They do suggest giving some description of the ending, so we just need to decide how much should be revealed. Personally, I'd support including something about Jack's death and saying that it's not clear whether it was an accident or murder. I'd be hesitant to go into great detail for anything after that. Maybe just something like "A visit to Jack's parents helps Ennis to gain emotional closure." (It could probably be said better than that, but that's my general idea.) <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 16:21, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel very silly for posting so much today, but after thinking about this some more I've changed my mind. I've restored the information about the ending that I removed before. I also moved the first paragraph from the plot section (describing the basic premise of the film) above the spoiler warning. This way readers who don't want spoilers can still get a general idea as to what the movie's about, and readers who do want spoilers can have them. Does this seem like a good compromise? We may still want to discuss exactly what needs to be in the plot description, but I feel better about detailing the ending in the spoiler section now that there's a short non-spoiler section. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 17:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel even more ridiculous for having to post here again when no one else has said anything, but apparently my post above did not strike people as a good enough justification for moving the spoiler tag. Here's what the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Films_e48b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Films">Wikipedia:WikiProject Films</a> page says about "Plot" sections: "<i>It is best to describe the basic premise of the film in a couple of sentences at the beginning of this section, and then start a new paragraph going into more detail about the plot of the film, including the ending. Separate these two descriptions of the storyline with the template {{spoiler}}, which will warn readers of the article not to proceed if they do not want the film spoiled for them.</i>" So it's not just me, Wiki standards also suggest that a general description of the film's premise precede the spoiler tag and detailed plot description. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 07:08, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is perfectly correct English. It is not the most formal style of written English, and were Jack and Ennis real people then I would agree that they should be referred to by their surnames.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Censorship of Plot/Characters/Direction/Cinematography/Music/etc.</span></h2>
<p><b>Censorship</b> (06-May-2006): Since <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was <i>the</i> most honored film of 2005, I expected much more information on detailed aspects of the film to explain technical reasons for winning the awards, including direction, cinematography &amp; music. The fact that the plot is presented with limited dialog shows the need for direction of talented actors/actresses to use facial expressions &amp; physical jestures to elaborate unspoken feelings &amp; events, plus the effort needed to develop the script as an expansion of the short story is a key issue.</p>
<p>If someone has unresolved questions about the unfolding &amp; end of the plot, then turning to Wikipedia for more information would be a good use of Wikipedia in providing added value to the community. As for spoiling the ending, don't worry; I would consider the film to be a "thinking man's movie" in the way it ends: many blog entries in early 2006 revealed widespread confusion &amp; debate about the end of the movie, which is considered by the author Annie Proulx to have a definite ending. One viewer even asked if, perhaps, Ennis had a flashback of murdering Jack himself, due to jealousy about the ranch-neighbor.</p>
<p>In fact, more information is needed about the emotional impact of the plot, and how it is presented, which caused some viewers to be confused, puzzled, and thinking more about the film, on the second day after seeing it. The lasting emotional impact is a cinematic accomplishment in itself.</p>
<p>There is much more information that could be said about the plot, and how it is presented, despite the limited dialog, by describing use of facial expressions, physical gestures, short events, and scenery as plot devices. In fact, the previous information vacuum about the film had me stunned as to what happened to the concept that Wikipedia contains information: the most honored film of 2005? <i>Hello? What's wrong with this picture?</i> The censorship has gone too far about <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. Let's consider adding 10 pages about the plot, emotional impact, character development, directorial issues, acting abilities, award-winning song/score, award-winning cinematography, etc. Use 10 more pages to explain the most honored film of 2005.</p>
<p>Instead of obsessing about censoring people, let people who have real information put more substance in Wikipedia articles; Encyclopedia Britannica has a reputation for limited censorship, even though the intellectual freedom has allowed some radical statements that appear in Britannica articles. Wikipedia is being censored too much. --sbs 06-May-2006</p>

<dd>EE, are you editing in good faith here? I don't see how anyeone could look at the MOS and honestly believe it said what you claimed. There's nothing at all in the MOS about use of euphemisms, and there's certainly nothing stating that all instances of "died" should be replaced with "passed away". "Passed away in an accident" is particularly awkward, almost to the point of being comic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Liberal groups" section title</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that the section title "Liberal groups controversy" is appropriate. The term "liberal group" is POV, not to mention innacurate, as the section talks about criticism from journalists and others. I just can't think of a better title. "Pro-gay groups" would be POV.

<dl>
<dd>Brokeback Mountain cost about U.S.$14 million to produce, excluding its advertising budget.</dd>
<dd>As of March 5, 2006, Brokeback Mountain had grossed more than $78 million in North America and $51 million elsewhere, adding up to a worldwide gross of more than $129 million.</dd>

<p>And at the bottom of the same section</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to interviews with the filmmakers, Focus Features was able to recoup their production costs by selling overseas rights to the film so, from the outset, the film was not in danger of losing very much money.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does it means they had already sold enough to cover the cost even before the film was shown in the US?

Jack's dad is refusing to let Ennis have Jack's ashes, and then suddenly Ennis is looking at shirts in Jack's old closet?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Small plot point</span></h2>
<p>The plot summary says "Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a gay man in his hometown..." Wasn't it two gay men who were murdered? Or do I misremember? <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 21:31, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. It was definitely a gay couple in the book and I believe in the movie, Ennis also says it was a gay couple who lived in his town. But I don't know if both men were murdered (only one was shown) or only one. Someone should look at the screenplay or watch the DVD and see what Ennis says about it - were both men murdered? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 00:43, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe the original sentence read "a man suspected of being homosexual" (and if it didn't it should have). There was no such thing as "gay" in the time period being depicted. Also, it was one man who was murdered. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 01:10, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's fine to call the murdered man a "gay man." Modern terms are used all the time to describe long-dead people and past events. We don't have to call <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Tubman_fd00.html" title="Harriet Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> a "Negro" now just because that was the polite term used at the time she lived. I don't think the "gay" in "gay man" invests the described person with any sort of liberationist, implicit lifestyle attributes. You can be a "closeted gay man" or a "gay man in denial" quite easily. It's just a descriptor of his orientation, a more widely-used and up-to-date synonym for "homosexual." And I think it's pretty clear from the story that he <i>was</i> a gay man, not just that he was suspected of being one. That being said, I understand the reluctance to use "gay" (or, for that matter, "homosexual") to describe Jack or Ennis so I'm specifically talking about the murdered man in Ennis's hometown here. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 17:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I can understand your point of view on the word "gay," I disagree with your reasoning. The main sticking point is, how far back can you reasonably go before calling a person "gay" just becomes silly? A discussion is going on at <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_rights_timeline_66d3.html" title="Talk:Gay rights timeline">Talk:Gay rights timeline</a> on this very point at the moment: is it reasonable or correct to describe a Roman emperor as "gay"?

<dd>I think your "negro" analogy is off, too. A "negro" in Harriet Tubman's time is still "black" today. The change in words there doesn't imply any change in identification. But "gay" is a modern word for a modern identity, and it doesn't always equal "homosexual" (viz: how many modern "gay" people identify as "homosexuals"?). Just as it's incorrect to describe an <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">ancient Greek paederast</a> or an <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanshoku.html" title="Nanshoku">Edo-era boy-lover</a> as "gay," describing a 1960s rural US cowboy as "gay" is an anachronism.</dd>

<dd>Additionally, I'm not sure it's <i>that</i> clear in the story that the murdered cowboy was homosexual. Certainly, that's the suggestion.

<dd>I don't feel invested enough in this debate to fight about it. If you want to call the murdered man "homosexual," I won't fight about it. But I don't agree that "gay" is a "modern word for a modern identity" at all. I'd agree that "queer" is just that, but in most people's experience and semantic identification, "gay"/"homosexual" is <i>exactly</i> analogous to "Black"/"Negro." "Gay" is merely the new word used to describe what was once covered by "homesexual." Anything else is a construct of "Queer Theory." <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 20:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the comparison to ancient Greek and Japanese homosexuality is particularly apt here. The constructs of 1960s rural American society are not fundamentally different today. The degree to which gays are accepted has of course changed, but this is merely a quantitative difference, not a qualitative difference, such as that between contemporary American society and ancient Greece. If, assuming we accept the suggestion that the murdered cowboy was murdered for living with another cowboy in a "domesticated" homosexual relationship, I don't think that there is a qualitative difference between that relationship and the contemporary conception of domestic gay life. It was certainly much rarer then, especially in rural America, but I don't think there was anything fundamentally "non-gay" about the nature of the relationship. As such, I don't think it is necessarily anachronistic to use the word "gay" in that context, especially considering that at that time, the word "gay" had already acquired its modern meaning, and although it was not the most common term, there were certainly people who <i>at that time</i> could have used the word "gay" to describe the men or their relationship. If anything, it is merely an <i>anachorism</i> rather than an <i>anachronism</i>. Another point to consider is that even though the characters in question existed (if I have my chronology right) in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the characters were <i>created</i> in the late 1990s by a writer for whom the modern conception of "gay" was certainly part of her consciousness. Indeed, if anything is an anachronism, it would be the characters rather than the word used to describe them. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 22:23, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, whether or not the people in the story would have used the word "gay" to describe people with same-sex attraction is an entirely moot point (they wouldn't have used that word, of course). However, "gay" has since become a more modern-sounded, direct synonym to the formerly widely-used and "polite" term "homosexual." If EB or others mean to imply that using "gay" is anything but a neutral term to describe someone with a same-sex orientation, please provide specific examples. "Gay" is not "Queer." There isn't a liberationist, out-of-the-closet, swinging-seventies, whatever tint to the word today. Ask ten English speakers if they agree. I think they would. If you think it has some kind of other implicit meaning, please be specific about what that is.</dd>

<dd>EB says above that my Harriet Tubman comparison (using a term that wasn't in use then to describe her skin color) isn't valid because "the change in words there doesn't imply any change in identification" simply doesn't hold up. If you believe, as I'm sure you do, that same-sex attractions are deeply-rooted and not changeable, then how is that different? My contention is that while "gay" may have at one time been specifically a "modern word for a modern identity," it has since become merely a neutral descriptor and more polite-sounding word than the clinical "homosexual." It has <i>lost</i> the connotations it once had, in the 1970s. Which, come to think of it, is again exactly like "Black" - at one time a word that implied a certain pride, a self-chosen identity, a sense of empowerment, but then rapidly just became a neutral synonym (and then, if anything, began itself to send moderatly old-fashioned with the rise of the term "African American". That's what happens with words. They evolve.</dd>

<p>I added in some more detail. The first time I read the article, it was strange to me that there was nothing about their first encounter in camp, that after the first paragraph, it went straight to after they left the mountain. So I wrote up how the sexual relationship started. I also added some details at the end. The symbolism of the shirts is so important to the movie, I thought it should be in there. And, I added the last line, partly because it is so impossible to know exactly what Ennis says unless you have the DVD and watch the subtitles.

<dd>I think this is far too much. We don't need to have every aspect of the movie. Some of the terms chosen are a little awkward ("couple passionately"). There's just too much information. This is supposed to be a short summary that gives the main thrust of the action (sorry!), not a rewriting of the film. This section is always unstable I've noticed, but I think it's getting out of control. It's not Coles Notes.

<dd>"...Too much" "Every aspect" "out of control" "too much information" and "needs paring down" are somewhat vague criticisms that don't address any of the specific additions. Of course, improve any phrasing you find awkward. But the previous version, which started with them <i>leaving</i> the mountain, left out too much. Many other films on Wikipedia have much more detailed summaries, even scene-by-scene synopses. This certainly doesn't go that far, but does highlight some important points that were missing IMO. And I'm eager to see someone get a good handle on the first night in the tent scene -- "quick bout of anal sex"? "Drunken fuck"? "Passionate lovemaking session"? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 19:41, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's what I think the synopsis should look like (the part between the spoiler tags):</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The two men meet on a sheepherding job on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. One night, after sharing a bottle of whiskey, they have sex. After the two part ways at the end of their job, Ennis marries his fiancée, Alma Beers (Williams) and starts a family. Jack moves to Texas where he meets Lureen Newsome (Hathaway), whom he subsequently marries. Four years later, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack saying that he will soon be in town and hopes Ennis will want to see him again. The two men reunite and find their passion is as strong as ever. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together operating a small ranch. Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a man suspected of being homosexual in his home town, fears that such an arrangement can only end in tragedy. He is also unwilling to leave his family. Unable to be open about their relationship, Ennis and Jack settle for infrequent meetings on camping trips in the mountains. As the years pass, Ennis's marriage deteriorates. Alma eventually divorces him and takes custody of their children. Jack hopes that Ennis's divorce will allow them to live together at last, but Ennis refuses to move away from his daughters. Several months after their last meeting, Ennis learns that Jack has died when a postcard Ennis sent him is returned, stamped "deceased". In a strained telephone conversation, Jack's wife Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died in an accident. As she explains, a brief scene of Jack being brutally murdered illustrates Ennis's fears that Jack's death was not accidental. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wished to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, and suggests contacting his parents. Ennis visits Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to Brokeback Mountain. Jack's father refuses, insisting that Jack's remains be buried in the family plot. Jack's mother is more welcoming, and invites Ennis to go upstairs to Jack's boyhood bedroom. There, Ennis discovers two old shirts hidden in the back of the closet. The bloodstained shirts, with Jack's enclosing Ennis' shirt on the same hanger, are the ones the two men were wearing on their last day on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. At the end of the movie, Ennis opens his own closet to reveal that he has hung the two shirts, this time with his surrounding Jack's, inside the door with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Film vs. story as article topic</span></h2>
<p>Brokeback Mountain is a story, both a published short story and a film, but the article focuses almost exclusively on the film. I think the intro should emphasize Brokeback Mountain the story by Annie Proulx and include info on the film -- but not begin as if Brokeback Mountain is only a movie incidentally adapted from a story. Especially because this is one film that is almost a word-for-word recreation of the original short story. Otherwise, the title might be better as "Brokeback Mountain (film)" with a separate article on the short story. I'd kinda hate to see that split, but I'm not comfortable with this great piece of literature (what some have called the greatest short story ever published by the New Yorker, and that's saying <i>a lot</i>) being a bare mention in this article.

<dd>I said "is <b>almost</b> [empahsis mine] a word-for-word recreation..." Larry McMurtry, co-screenwriter, said (paraphrasing) they used nearly every word of dialog and description from the story in the screenplay. I have found only a few words of dialog that are in the story and not in the film. Even the non-linear sequence of events -- such as the flashback to the campfire embrace -- is carried over to the movie, though some incidents mentioned late in the story (the fight that draws blood from Ennis' nose) are moved back into linear sequence in the movie. Yes, of course it's an adaptation; it's two different media, after all. But my point was about this story in particular being so close to the film, that an article titled "Brokeback Mountain" should really begin by talking about the story, not just the film. It sounds like you agree with the basic premise anyway. Thanks for the comments. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 20:16, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Especially for this to become a featured article, I think it would be more robust to include both forms of the story. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 17:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it's done now -- I'm adding to the story article and hope others contribute. We especially need literary criticism sources to expand this; I haven't run across anything except film reviews so far. I wouldn't want the article on the story to be all quotes from critics, it would be great to be able to source comments on the literature from published sources. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 19:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy graf - removed 1</span></h2>
<p>Removed the graf on the supposed controversy of a school chastising an actress in the film. Preserving it here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Former School of Brokeback actress rejects her</dd>
<dd>The former school of actress <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Williams_%28actress%29_8a09.html" title="Michelle Williams (actress)">Michelle Williams</a>, Santa Fe Christian School in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, has shunned Williams as a result of her participation in the movie. Even though she did not play a controversial character, her former headmaster feels that they don't wish to be associated with the film. "We don't want to have anything to do with her in relation to that movie," said the school's headmaster, Jim Hopson. '"Michelle doesn't represent the values of this institution. <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a> basically promotes a lifestyle we don't promote."'</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unlike the significant events documented in the controversy section, this is one small person making a comment basically, with no response from the film company. The article is long, has a robust controversy section. I don't see much encyclopedic value in reporting the high school headmaster not liking the film. Maybe she was a bad student, too. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro upgrade</span></h2>
<p>Looking for input on the first two grafs. I'm really leaning toward whacking this down. It's overlinked, repeats much of what comes later, and buries the meat of the matter (the story comes after the stars; isn't celebrity-obsession unencyclopedic?). Rather than list the awards, "award winning" can suffice (different if it had won Best Picture). Rather than list five or more actors, (all in the info box), name the leads. Rather than mention McMurtry and Proulx's Pulitzer prizes, let readers read their articles. Any why mention <i>Trash</i>, I mean <i>Crash</i>, in the intro at all? How many other film articles, in the first graf, name the film that the subject film <i>lost</i> to at the Academy Awards? All in all, I think it's too dense with links and infobits; the lead should be spare and beautiful -- like the film. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:45, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, why mention <i>Trash</i>, I mean <i>Crash</i>? The Academy did itself bad in 2006! <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivertonplain_8a83.html" title="User:Rivertonplain">River</a> 17:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed plot analysis section</span></h2>
<p>Removed a section recently added that attempted to analyze some plot points and make conclusions about the characters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Brokeback Mountain Ending</b>: The quiet ending of the movie has confused many people; and the ending created many debates about the way events are resolved: one person even wondered if Ennis had a flashback of killing Jack, in jealousy. The author Annie Proulx was asked about the movie, and she replied that there is only one way the story could end [see ^AP]. The following detailed plot-points help to explain the subtle resolution of the film:</p>
<ul class="noindent">
<li style="list-style: none">Despite their final argument, Ennis still loved Jack; and wrote to meet him again.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Ennis travels to Jack's parents: Jack's father tells Ennis that Jack wanted to move to the ranch with Ennis but then with another man, a ranch-neighbor, that final year.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Ennis realizes that Jack revealed himself to others: Jack was killed, by tire iron, as evidenced by both the broken jaw &amp; broken nose.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Ennis goes upstairs to Jack's room and finds the 2 shirts. Ennis sees it is a shirt of his, not the ranch-neighbor, that is inside Jack's shirt: Jack truly loved Ennis.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">No other person wanted to take Jack's ashes to Brokeback: not his wife, not his parents, and not the new ranch-neighbor. Only Ennis loved Jack enough for that.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">The father knew of Brokeback, but decides to bury the ashes. Ennis agrees and smiles unexpectedly; as if making other plans, Ennis only smiles.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">It will be the family cemetery. (In the book, Ennis drives by the cemetery; but Ennis refuses to imagine leaving the ashes there.)</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Taking Jack's ashes to Brokeback is a major pending issue: for ending the story.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Ennis plans to attend daughter Alma's wedding: losing his job, which had kept Ennis from Jack.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Ennis folds Alma's sweater carefully and places it in the closet: near the 2 shirts. Ennis also buttons Jack's shirt carefully.</li>
<li>Ennis then promises, "Jack, I swear-": his final words in the movie and the book.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p>The short story seems to emphasize the unfinished and thwarted plans of Ennis; however, the movie emphasizes a change of attitude: Ennis plans to attend his daughter's wedding, losing his job which had kept him from Jack. Then, Ennis carefully places Alma's sweater near the two shirts, which have been carefully reversed with his shirt hugging Jack's shirt (as Jack's favorite memory was being hugged by Ennis over his shoulders). Ennis carefully fastens the top button of Jack's shirt: finishing unfinished business. Ennis has promised to do the right thing to attend Alma's wedding. Now, Ennis is willing to make another promise, as he looks at the postcard of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis says: "Jack, I swear": to do the right thing: to complete Jack's final wish on Brokeback, to avenge Jack's death, or even to change the world. The ending remains uncertain at that point.<br />
<br />
Ennis had been too afraid to make a commitment to Jack before. But, Ennis is no longer afraid, even of losing his job. Actually, this is hinted in the short story: &#160; "Jack, I swear--": he said, though Jack had never asked him to swear anything and was himself not the swearing kind. Around that time, Jack began to appear in his dreams, Jack as he had first seen him...." [last page of story].&#160; Finally, Ennis, who was not the swearing-kind, has changed. Finally, Ennis has sworn to live his life for Jack, with a new beginning on Brokeback Mountain.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This section strays into original research and personal conclusions that are arguable. Did Jack "reveal" himself to others or was he found out? More importantly, the assertion that Ennis has changed, and now would commit to a gay relationship is hard to support. The point of the entire story, the tragedy of it, is that Ennis rejects a relationship that he desperately needed; a sudden change in his entire outlook at the end makes for a happier ending than the story seems to demand. Also, the final scene between Ennis and Alma Jr. is not in the short story; Ennis deciding he can lose his job rather than miss his daughter's wedding suggests a new commitment to family more than a change in attitude regarding a relationship with Jack. In sum, there could be a place for some plot analysis, but it would have to be based on quotes from either published critques or commentary from the Proulx or the screenwriters, not the points made above, apparently the conclusions of one person, which others might easily disagree with. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 15:30, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
