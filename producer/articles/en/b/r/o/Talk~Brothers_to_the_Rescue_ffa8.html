<p>User Tjive did apparently not believe the claim that the airplanes had violated the airspace of Cuba and in response to his repeated reverts, I have upgraded the article. This information should suffice for a start. I will add more information later. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 21:30, 2 February 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have worded this article carefully, and believe it to be accurate. If you disagree, please argue your point here before editing - it is considered bad wikiquette to bypass the talk page. It seems to me beyond doubt that we are talking about violations of airspace here, as it would be if Cuban airplanes would enter US airspace without explicit permission. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 21:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would seem to me, based on your contributions list (which could be misleading) that you are relatively new to the processes of Wikipedia and "Wikiquette" yourself. The fact is that most edits and reverts <i>aren't</i> discussed unless there is a determined and ongoing but (at least ostensibly) legitimate dispute over something. I did not perceive my edit to be altogether significant or controversial and there is no particular requirement to discuss it <i>per se</i>. Please don't bring process into the question until you have at least asked whether I can speak on the question to begin with.</dd>

<dd>Personal insinuations regarding this edit hopefully resolved, I do find the word "violations" rather troubling in this context. We are speaking about a civilian humanitarian assistance group (albeit with an admitted political agenda). It appears (despite my earlier perception) that the group did not even make a habit of overflying ground and that the "pamphlets" were blown inland. Thus, saying of the pamphlets that they were dropped "over Havana" is either astonishingly pedantic (in the sense that they were dropped over <i>any</i> point below their elevation) or extremely misleading. That this is all being treated as an atrocity is astonishing to me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This means that "violations" constituted of broaching an invisible demarcation in the water. There is no insinuation in the report that these planes were acting threateningly, were violent, or were threatening violence. This was not a military operation enacted by one country in order to molest another country's sovereignty and provoke a response. Therefore I changed references to "violations" to the planes "entering" territory where not being specifically attributed to one party--either the report, the Cuban government, or an American administration. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 13:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, if cuban airplanes would enter US airspace without permission, it would be (justly) considered a violation of the airspace, regardless of whether Basulto's intentions were benevolent or aggressive. It does not matter whether you think or I think they violated the airspace. If they were forbidden entry by Cuba for whatever reasons, fair or unfair, entering is a violation. They were explicitly warned that they might be shot down and were definitely not welcome. Even mainstream US (a hostile power) news sources refer to them as violations, as does UN sources. It astounds me that you can then claim it not to be. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 15:17, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Addendum: I am sure there is offical treaty definitions somewhere as to what constitutes violations of airspace, but I dont see that as necessary. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=violate+airspace&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=violate+airspace&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">simple google search</a> reveals that violations need not involve military aircraft or any hostile intentions. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 11:28, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'violation' of airspace, compared to 'entering airspace' carries more information, namely that the act of entering was unwelcome. That information is accurate and relevant, and Tjive's removal of it reduces the value of the article. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 09:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The latest attempt by Tjive was to change 'The group has violated Cuban territorial airspace on numerous occasions' to 'The Cuban government has accused the group of repeatedly violating its territorial sovereignty '. The edit removes information from the article, and I have therefore reverted it. 'Accused' removes the information that it was not just an accusation, but that it is substantiated and indeed, accurate. Attributing the claim to the Cuban government, a disreputable source, is unhelpful when the claim can be established from more credible sources. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 11:28, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A few points justifying my latest revert (whatever is not discussed already). Stating that ICAO did not believe US+Cuban position data would 'suffice' is plain wrong, as would have been obvious to anyone reading the report. They found the disagreements between US and Cuban data so great they did not trust any of them. The court data from later years event suggest that the Cubans might have been right from the start. To err on the safe side, I did not draw that conclusion, though it is credible. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 15:34, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The semantic difference posed here is negligible. That they did not "suffice" for data from either country does not imply that one or the other is incredulous in particular, whereas "did not believe" insinuates this disregard as their position <i>prima facie</i>, which has not been demonstrated and is not even <i>excluded</i> in my word choice.</dd>

<p>'information did not suffice' implies the amount of information is the issue. 'did not believe information' is clearly different, it is not the amount, but the quality of information that is the issue, as was clearly the case and is obvious to anyone who is familiar with the ICAO source. Tjive's edit therefore distorts the information, and as the user is obviously has not bothered to read the sources, I find it hard to consider it as anything but a bad faith edit. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 09:23, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tjive reverted my text that Basulto was warned of the possibility of being 'shot down' to "Basulto was warned by an FAA official about the possibility of military interception". Again, it is a case of removing information from the article. 'Military interception' is ambiguous, it could mean several things apart form being shot down. If you read the source, it is clear that Basulto was warned with being 'shot down', a much more powerful warning than a vague reference to 'interception'. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 12:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm consolidating these edits rather than attempting to follow several separate sections which only involve the same two users at the moment. This is so I do not get confused, and you can not claim to have missed my remarks. First of all, stop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brothers_to_the_Rescue&amp;diff=38285913&amp;oldid=38154704" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Brothers_to_the_Rescue&amp;diff=38285913&amp;oldid=38154704" rel="nofollow">deleting</a> talk comments. In ordinary circumstances (not involving defamatory information, blanking, hate speech, etc.) this is considered vandalism. You do not guard this talk page, and it is not your decision to determine what is relevant or not, particularly as the main party to a dispute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I don't see the relevance of your comment</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The claim of "violations" can very well be consolidated in the intro. to all of the negative (source) charges levied against the organization by the same entity, as it is discussed and contextualized further in the next section in any case. As for the Cuban government being a disreputable source, if further evidence is said by you to prove their case then wouldn't this bring them into repute? This is irrelevant as all that is being established is a claim.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>'information did not suffice' implies the amount of information is the issue</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It implies no such thing, and states only that the organization did not consider this evidence adequate to determine the facts of the matter (therefore they conducted more research). This, far from being a matter of "bad faith", is a rather banal semantic edit as "believe" attributes inappropriate personal characteristics to the conduct of research for the report. Several words are preferable here in rewording--"suffice", "accept", "inadequate", etc.--which do not bring any more connotations than that which they literally say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>it is a case of removing information from the article</i></dd>

<dd>It is a case of nothing more than attempting to steer the article away from linguistic redundancy.

<p>Yes. As per both FAA and DOD procedure, that would be considered a violation of airspace.

<p>The many attempt by various anons and others to change 'The group has violated Cuban territorial airspace on numerous occasions' to 'The Cuban government has accused the group of repeatedly violating its territorial sovereignty ' reduce the quality of the article. These edit removes information from the article, and I have therefore reverted it. 'Accused' removes the information that it was not just an accusation, but that it is substantiated and indeed, accurate (and in fact not even officially disputed). Attributing the claim to the Cuban government, a disreputable source, is unhelpful when the claim can be established from more credible sources.</p>
<p>If Cuban airplanes would enter US airspace without permission, it would be (justly) considered a violation of US airspace, regardless of whether the pilot's intentions were benevolent or aggressive. It does not matter who thinks or claims they violated the airspace. If they were forbidden entry by Cuba for whatever reasons, fair or unfair, entering is a violation. They were explicitly warned that they might be shot down and were definitely not welcome. Even mainstream US (a hostile power) news sources refer to them as violations, as does UN sources, and the requested third opinion of a military expert wikipedian (see above) confirms that it is indeed a case of violation of airspace.</p>

<dd>The fact of entering Cuban airspace is not questioned. The dispute concerns essentially the entitlement to enter the airspace. Apparently, advocates for Brothers to the Rescue believe that because their incursions are well intentioned that they have a right to enter Cuban airspace, therefore the word 'violation' is inaccurate. In essence this requires the premise that there is not Cuban sovereignty of Cuban airspace. I see this as a valid, yet non-neutral POV position. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 18:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Edits can be made with this understanding in mind but I'm not quite sure the argument has been explicitly leveled by the group in question; hence it remains the observation of editors. My objection remains in regard to the word "violations" itself. Using the verb form of "violate" looks bad and there is no reason, beyond saving face in edit wars, to not change it to "incursions" or something similar as suggested here.

<dd>By entering Cuban airspace, an unauthorized flight <i>commits</i> (what the organizations in question refer to as) <i>a "violation"</i> (noun), but in the course of the action they are not merely <i>violating</i> - this completely slurs the entire issue of the circumstances of the actions (i.e. proximity and intent) and the group's perspective on them (they are serving a humanitarian purpose and disregard the government's claims). As an example of the use of a compromise term, Brothers to the Rescue could be said to have "made repeated incursions into Cuban air space" whereby the reader is informed of the same exact thing!</dd>

<p>Forget about it, the term is "violate". I can't believe that this is an issue <i>now</i>, let alone has been festering for months. "Violate" is the particular aviation term used in such cases <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=violate+airspace&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=violate+airspace&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> regardless of the surrounding context. None of the arguments by Tjive (and IP aliases) attempting to avoid this word hold much water. If the late Mother Teresa had piloted a plane over Calcutta dispensing gifts and goodies to the poor unauthorised, she would still have been arrested for offences described as "violating airspace".

<dd>Nobody has challenged the relevance of the terms in question or has argued that they do not appear in sourcing (note that this applies as well to others). The distinction has already been made, linguistically, between the appropriateness of "violate" in the verb form versus the the noun, e.g. "committing a violation". The article(s), as Jensbn would have it, have Brothers to the Rescue going around "violating" with their planes. This is shoddy work, and it can be better written. The problem is that any attempt to reword it is summarily reverted (by him) on the basis of who has done the work. If you need evidence for that, please take a detailed look through the diffs in the history (as well as the pages for Basulto and the Cuban Five); you will see innumerable examples of his reverts owing nothing to this particular dispute and accepted only begrudgingly. 151.205.36.69 15:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can see on this page, you've been in favour of "<i>been accused of repeatedly violating Cuban airspace</i>" against "<i>group has repeatedly violated Cuban airspace</i>". It's a minor difference. But no one <i>accused</i> the Cuban five of violating Cuban airspace. They <i>did</i> violate Cuban airspace, (by their own admission and the analysis of every source including the FBI). There is no need for a rewrite and certainly not for a protracted edit war.

<p>I propose the following as the intro:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Brothers to the Rescue</b> (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <b>Hermanos al Rescate</b>) is a <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>-based organization headed by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Basulto_7a47.html" title="José Basulto">José Basulto</a>.

<p>Please consider it. 151.205.36.69 15:32, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'Condemned' is not precise. It was <b>described</b> as violations by many who did not condemn the acts. Consider my amended compromise:</p>

<p>I am fine with that. I am not partial to "condemned" in that context. In fact you may find that there are still better alternatives, such as "designated", but regardless I do not find anything apparently wrong with this version. 151.205.52.68 18:25, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Consensus seems to have been reached on this article and possibly others. Perhaps this one should see unprotection? 151.205.52.160 20:57, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Talk%7EBrothers_to_the_Rescue_ffa8.html" title="Edit section: Shot down over international waters?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shot down over international waters?</span></h2>
<p>There seem to be some confusion over the topic of the planes being over international waters or not. Here are the facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The planes did enter Cuban airspace, as is also stated in the ICAO report and, well, just about any source. U.S. radar data put him 1.7 miles into Cuban territory.</li>
<li>The planes were shot down upon their return from their mission. Whether that occurred in international airspace or Cuban airspace is disputed. As is explained in the article, US radar data put them well outside Cuban airspace, Cuban data inside Cuban airspace, and combined data from two civilian vessels just outside Cuban Airspace. At the time, the ICAO commission found the data irreconcilable, but chose to find the fishing boat data "most reliable", but refrained from stating it as an actual fact. Since then, testimony from the Cuban Five trial has disputed that too, in support of the Cuban data. The Cuban view here is quite interesting. In a response to the security council resolution<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19960727.sc6247.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19960727.sc6247.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, they claim that United States only cooperated grudgingly with the investigation, causing numerous delays, were particularly slow in providing data on position of the aircraft, that the US provided record of radio communications had six minutes of communication omitted, and that US radar data from the nearest radar station had simply been deleted. This may well be true, but we'll probably never know the final answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Claiming they were shot down over international waters for a fact is dubious at least, and distorts the facts even more when fact #1 is not mentioned. The events are serious enough as they are, overdramatizing them serves only propaganda purposes. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 07:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone familiar please address this: "Juan Pablo Roque, unexpectedly left on February 26, 1996, the day before the two planes were shot down" then it says the shootdown wsa on Feb 24. So it should read either "Juan Pablo Roque, unexpectedly left on February 23, 1996, the day before the two planes were shot down" or "Juan Pablo Roque, unexpectedly left on February 26, 1996, the day after the two planes were shot down". Also the Roques part should be moved to after the shootdown part as it references the shootdown. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
