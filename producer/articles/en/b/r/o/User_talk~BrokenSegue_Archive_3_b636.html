<p>This image is part of our family's archive of photos; this particular shot was taken by my father, James Blish, of Virginia Kidd when they were married at some point during the 1950's. I own whatever rights remain on the photo, as they were left to me by my parents, both of whom have passed away. I uploaded the photo to WP with the understanding that it would/could leap from the page and go anywhere. That's fine with me.</p>

<p>Hi! Regarding photo that I've uploaded: I'm not familiar with GDFL and that other stuff, but picture is from Serbian Wikipedia, so i guess that it's not copyrighted. <a href="../../../../sr/d/j/o/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%7EDjordjes_ee0e.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Корисник:Djordjes">Djordjes</a> posted it on Serbian wiki, and here is his User page on Serbian wiki, where you can contact him in English (or tell me what to ask him). By the way, Jovan Ducic died in 1943, 62 years ago, so copyright of this photo (if any) should have expired long ago --<a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 00:55, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've contacted Djordjes, and told him to either reply directly to you, or to tell me what he knows about the proto. If he is present, you should soon get the info --<a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 15:51, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again! I've just found Djordjes answer on his talk page on sr: . He said that he understands English, but written his English isn't exeptional (unlike mine which is as you have noticed impeccable&#160;;) He wrote his response in Serbian, and here is my translation. --<a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 22:47, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to Serbian law, 50 years after the death of author, his copyright expire, and it passed 62 years since death of Jovan Ducic, and his works are printed in Serbia without any need to ask anyone for copyright.When it comes to Ducic photos, there are two of them (in the article), and it is basic assumption that Ducic held copyright for both of them. One of them is official, in uniform, and it is certain that it was made on Ducic's personal demand, and that it is property of Ducic, not photographer. Other photo is from Ducic's younger days, and is made at the beginig of XX century. Because the age of the photo, we can assume that its copyright has expired, and that copyright owner also was Ducic, as orderer and owner of photo. I found both of the photos on Internet (I can't remember where), and there was no ownership nor copyright stated&#160;? if someone had copyright, it would surely be stated. However no limitation for usage of this photos was stated, and because of all of this objective reasons I think that we may freely use this photos of Jovan Ducic on Wikipedia. --Djordje Stakic 22:15, 31 Jan 2005.

<p>I hope that this will work for you, and if may add something about your info (70 years) and Djordjes (50 years). In USA, law say&#160;? 70 years after work is published; Serbian law say&#160;? 50 years after author's death. --<a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 22:47, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw the template you put at the top of his page about it being a shared ip. Do you think I should unblock it? I'm not so sure, as I see nothing but vandalism from that account for more than the past month. Any valid contributors could easily create an account.

<p>That's the only project you have in there. The category you have seems to be more for individual aircraft than not. The sort of category you have in mind for this would fit well with articles for TFX, JSF, ATF, etc., Not the individual aircraft but competition projects.</p>

<p>Please see "Election 2012" in <a href="../../../p/o/s/User_talk%7EPostdlf_6e3d.html" title="User talk:Postdlf">User talk:Postdlf</a>. Basically, the 2012 election was deleted after a VfD. Unfortunately, this article would then get recreated by a user who wasn't aware of the VfD and didn't know why the community had decided that this wasn't a good article to create. So, I figured that a good solution was to create a redirect that would let new users know immediately why the page wasn't to be recreated. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> liked the idea, and so he made the redirect. He also decided that it might be a good idea to lock the redirect down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a redirect to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">U.S. presidential election, 2004</a> makes very little sense. If you want to redirect to the last presidential election page, that would be 2008. Either way is still highly confusing to your average user who will want to know why there isn't an article there, why they can't start one, and why the article is locked down.</p>
<p>Could you please revert your change? Thanks, — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> 01:00, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my opinion any supposed differences between Google the search engine and Google Inc are not noteworthy enough to require two separate articles, lots of duplicated content. If the Google Inc article was setup as a daughter article to a slightly more generic Google article then perhaps it could work. Though, I don't feel too strongly about it, was just a suggestion. I haven't checked but are there other articles on wikipedia that impose an artificial distinction between a company and it's product? Maybe I just think the Google article itself could use some trimming or change in tone, the article was seemingly written by a fanboi, the Google Inc article was perhaps the icing on the cake of that perception. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 04:22, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I saw your note to <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">Rovoam</a> about one of the images of Armenia and the nearby region he uploaded. Rovoam is one of two users discussing the content of the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> article on <a href="../../../n/a/g/Talk%7ENagorno-Karabakh_05f4.html" title="Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh">Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh</a>; the other is <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">Tabib</a>. I am attempting to mediate, with some success; they're posting to the talk page instead of reverting the article and engaging in other undesirable behavior. Anyway, Rovoam uploaded a bunch of maps in the course the talk to make his case. I commented to him that they needed tagging, and a quick look at the sources he gave wasn't promising. He did reply to you on his talk page, called them temporary. <i>They do help the discussion on the talk page.</i> Here's a list of the ones I know about: (he tagged some): <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArmeniamap1.jpg_6079.html" title="Image:Armeniamap1.jpg">Image:Armeniamap1.jpg</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArmeniamap2.jpg_8e01.html" title="Image:Armeniamap2.jpg">Image:Armeniamap2.jpg</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArmeniamap3.jpg_911d.html" title="Image:Armeniamap3.jpg">Image:Armeniamap3.jpg</a> Image:Bigmap.JPG Image:Armeniamap1907.jpg <a href="../../../1/7/6/Image%7E1760.jpg.html" title="Image:1760.jpg">Image:1760.jpg</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/Image%7E1831.jpg.html" title="Image:1831.jpg">Image:1831.jpg</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/Image%7E1842.jpg.html" title="Image:1842.jpg">Image:1842.jpg</a> Image:Kolco.JPG. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">Davenbelle</a> 05:51, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't mean to smack you down on WP:AN, I just realised this looks pretty harsh. I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but Adam Carr is 100% correct and Skyring is most definitely wrong over calling us a republic (call it wishful thinking...). Australia is most certainly <i>not</i> a republic. It is a constitutional monarchy. With this issue, I'd run with Adam. I have unblocked Adam because he is not the POV pusher in this case! I have also reverted out the material that Skyring placed into <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Government of Australia</a>, because frankly: he's again wrong. If the info stays in the article we'll be the laughing stock of most Australians, and that I do <i>not</i> want to see (given that I am one). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:04, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - at least now it says locked&#160;:-). There has been some questionable reverting and locking on that page. See the talk page there and the questions asked <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">user:172</a> - who now appears to be on 3rr block.

<p>Could you take a look at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#Violations" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#Violations</a> at the second subsection entitled User:Neutrality? Snowspinner has unblocked Neutrality, which I think is great--I'm all about mercy. But under the circumstances, including Neutrality's violation of block policy as noted, it does not seem the right thing to do in this situation. Of course, I am biased, but I do not think Neutrality was truly unaware of the fact that "partial" reversions counted; nor should he claim ignorance of the block policy. Thank you. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.245.12.39.html" title="User:24.245.12.39">24.245.12.39</a> 04:33, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for replying. Yes, I've thought about it. Anons sometimes seem to be "guilty until proven innocent" around here. That's what I think happened in this case with Neutrality, so I see how it could've happen. If he had warned me, or asked another admin to block me, or been treated equally, I would have no problem. I guess it's the combination. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.245.12.39.html" title="User:24.245.12.39">24.245.12.39</a> 04:59, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The number of major edits is one reason that I think protection is necessary. If it were a matter of a few facts that would be more easily handled. Instead the article is swinging widely from one version to another, and the editors do not seem to be searching for common ground. Thanks for looking in on it.

<p>Hello! I would like to know, why you`ve protected the side in the serbian version? There are three versions&#160;: serbian, albanian and international version. The whole time, I ve tried to kep the international position. Why have you decided like this&#160;?</p>
<p>How you`ve protected the side now, there aren`t so many facts, like we want in WIKIPEDIA. There s just politic and discussion. For this people is more important the name of Kosovo, as the informations about culture, economy, education, travel, etc. There are no informations about the diplomacie between UNMIK and belgrad; UNMIK and Pristina. There are just informations before the UNMIK came. From the Moment, UNMIK came, it happened a breakpoint in the history of Kosovo. And please, when you are neutral, you ve done the same, like UN did. I believe, that the UN is neutral. --<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipi_Zhdripi_c874.html" title="User:Hipi Zhdripi">Hipi Zhdripi</a> 00:38, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noted that you have protected the page yourself, and have noted <i>deal with vandalism</i> phrase. I am not sure who are you referring to, but Mel has been shown unruly behaviour. While I have proposed copyediting and did some edits, I do not understand why he has stepped and removed everything before he finished. It is very unfair for him to do that before I can even wind up everything! See Wikipedia:Request for comments/Mr Tan</p>
<p>As an admin, he even threatened artribation and stated that my behaviour needs to be changed. I however, do not understand where I have vandalised the page. If you stated that my actions are vandalism, I will never agree that is vandalism. In fact, I feel that is the reverse (Mel).</p>

<dd>Mr Tan, having been assured by a number of editors that the <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a> article is grammatically and stylistically fine, has placed the "gcheck" template on it and started to "correct" good English to bad (creating verbless sentrences, mangling syntax, etc.). He's done this repeatedly, and is immune to explanation. It's difficult to see that this is less than unacceptable, and it at least comes close to vandalism. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:57, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. Thanks for the question regarding the citing of <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_v._United_States_9664.html" title="Small v. United States">Small v. United States</a>. Sorry it has taken me so long to reply, but I have been on leave from Wikipedia for some months now.</p>
<p>I'm sure the situation is settled by now, but the article is currently correctly placed in the category of 2005 law. It is common for a case to be argued in the Winter term and the opinion to be delivered in the Spring term. Whenever a case is cited, it is cited by the year in which the decision was recorded. This is when it actually becomes law. Until then, it is simply a pending case with no legal affect by means of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare_decisis.html" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your work on Supreme Court case articles and I hope you continue in the future.</p>

<p>Well... Depends on how you want to view it. Does promotion mean when someone came around and tallied the votes up or when the bot does its work? If it is the former, I can have the bot assume that the last edit of the page is the date to use. If it is the latter, then I can have the bot just get the current date of whatever time it's running. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:17, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article Jefferson Food Mart appears to be a hoax—other articles along the same lines by the same editor are currently under consideration at VfD. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 02:23, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Re your comments on my talk page: The web page linked from the Jefferson Food Mart article does not exist, the article itself is just the <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kroger.html" title="Kroger">Kroger</a> article with the appropriate details changed, a google search for Jefferson Food Mart gets hits for one store in Nappa Valley—add Bloomington to the google search (where the article claims that the company is headquatered) and you get zero hits. The article claims that this company is listed on the NYSE but I cannot find any evidence of that. The article that the same user created on Charles Jefferson, the supposed CEO of Jefferson Food mart is clearly a hoax and looks like it is going to get deleted under a VfD. This is why I marked this article as a CSD—I think that it qualifies as 'patent nonsense'. -- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 02:35, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, you are correct, hoaxes don't qualify for CSD under the patent nonsense policy. I'm never sure where to draw the line between CSD and VfD cases—in the past I have been chastised for putting clear delete cases on VfD so I have adopted the policy of putting obvious deletes as CSDs. Maybe I need to swing back the pendulum in the other direction a little. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 02:45, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>In response to your comment on <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html#SD" title="User talk:Harro5">my talk page</a>, I add things to WP:SD in an attempt to get them moved out quickly. I've only been heavily monitoring speedy delete pages for a couple of weeks, but when I first started there were always over 50 articles in the category. I've found that updating the page, and then adding a comment to <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Speedy_Deletions" title="WP:AN">admin noticeboard</a> once in a while has really got things taken care of quickly.</p>
<p>I know many admins prefer to spend their time cleaning out VfDs and the like, but I believe speedy deletes are the ones that should be done first to ensure that at least anything that is on Wikipedia has some sort of value, even if it is later voted as deletable.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for taking notice of my work at SD. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 02:27, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just to help back up my point...its been less than 30 minutes since this above post. In that time, four SD items, plus a couple that have already been deleted. This stuff pops up quickly, and I like it when it leaves just as fast. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 02:47, May 22, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm hesitant to get involved in this one. I recommend that you read the talk page(s) and see for yourself. As a result of numerous disputes, mainly between Heimdal and other users, this page goes backwards rather than forwards. Quite frankly I find it all very sad. Talking hasn't worked, a straw poll hasn't worked, protecting the page hasn't worked. What else is there? It all reflects very badly on having a hands-on encyclopaedia. I hope this is an isolated example. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednaxela_0569.html" title="User:Rednaxela">Rednaxela</a> 18:52, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your speedy response. I agree that protection isn't the best option, but was not aware of the arbitration. I am now going to try to convince Heimdal that my edits to the introductory paragraph are beneficial.
