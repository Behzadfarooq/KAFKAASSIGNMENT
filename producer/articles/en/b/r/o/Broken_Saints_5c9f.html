<p><b>Broken Saints</b> is an award-winning, partially animated, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_cartoon.html" title="Flash cartoon">Flash-animated</a> film series by Brooke Burgess, Ian Kirby, and Andrew West. First published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, it is a hybrid of the comic and animation art forms that its creators refer to as a "cinematic novel." Like a comic, characters on the most part remain in static poses and dialogue is indicated by <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_balloons.html" title="Speech balloons">speech balloons</a>. However, rather than exclusively using sequential panels, animated sequences are used to switch scenes and help advance the story, while music (composed by Tobias Tinker and Quentin Grey, as well as licensed classical pieces from Mozart and others) and sound effects are included, lending a more cinematic experience than one would ordinarily achieve with a comic strip alone.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Saints_5c9f.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><i>Broken Saints</i> is some 12 hours long, split into 24 chapters published online between 2001 and 2003. The chapters become progressively longer, many with two or three acts. The culmination of the series, chapter 24, is five acts long - plus prologue and epilogue - and runs for 1 hour and 23 minutes.</p>
<p>Centered on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical.html" title="Philosophical">philosophical</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a> themes, it tells the story of four strangers from "the quiet corners of the globe" connected by a vision they all receive of a coming evil. Their search for the truth behind the vision leads them to each other and to far larger and more disturbing truths than they could have expected.</p>
<p>The details of their respective visions vary, but each one contains a giant red cat's eye (accompanied by a terrific electronic screech), the ubiquitous symbol of the series. After seeing it, the four main characters fall into a temporary coma. The Eye -- a red circle with a thin black slit in the middle -- can easily be mistaken for a simplified <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_of_Sauron_5d81.html" title="Eye of Sauron">Eye of Sauron</a>, yet it is worth noting that <i>Broken Saints</i> made its debut before the release of the first of the three <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy_1b2c.html" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy">The Lord of the Rings</a> films.</p>
<p>Several haikus (somewhat of a trademark of Brooke's) are presented as each episode loads, as well as quotes at the beginning and end from various sources, both tying in with themes and events of the episode. Several chapters contain animated scenes which introduce and close the chapter, and allude to various pop culture media such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Darko_1f86.html" title="Donnie Darko">Donnie Darko</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Club_%28film%29_0faf.html" title="Fight Club (film)">Fight Club</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29_b6ac.html" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>.</p>
<p>Each of the chapters was written and directed by Burgess, with Kirby doing the technical direction and West providing the artwork. The site was originally hosted (for the first 6 chapters) by Switch Interactive.</p>
<p>In 2005, a <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> version was released in association with Budget Monks Productions and Telefilm <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, featuring improved or wholly redrawn art for the first several chapters, numerous featurettes, and a voice track for practically all dialogue. The voice actors included <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_B._Davis_c769.html" title="William B. Davis">William B. Davis</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kaye_15d0.html" title="David Kaye">David Kaye</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby_Morrow_caef.html" title="Kirby Morrow">Kirby Morrow</a>, and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy.html" title="Emmy">Emmy</a>-award winner <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janyse_Jaud_4405.html" title="Janyse Jaud">Janyse Jaud</a>. Burgess himself provided a character voice as well.</p>
<p>Recently a new DVD release was in the works, for international retail release. A few changes have been made, including a reworking of Chapter 13's artwork and commentary for each chapter. It was released on August 1st 2006.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 1: Introitus</b></p>
<p><i>In the quiet corners of the globe, four strangers receive a chilling vision of the future. Will they stand to face the coming darkness... and if so, at what price?</i></p>
<p>The opening chapter introduces us to the main 4 characters: Shandala, Oran, Kamimura, and Raimi. Shandala begins with a short, poetic account of her dream. Next comes Oran, who is hiding out in a bunker, speaking of his guilt and faith. That transitions to Kamimura, who has returned to his temple to find it ablaze. After the fire burns itself out, he recovers a box from its hiding place, only to be confronted by his former student Goku. Raimi is then introduced, walking the streets of Coast City, returning to his apartment after being kicked off the project he was working on at work. He is going to find out why. As the chapter finishes, we return to Lomalagi to find Shandala confronted by a vision. The intensity of the vision causes her to faint, where she is discovered by the other members of her tribe.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 6: Synchronicity</b></p>

<p>Oran travels on foot, after Hassan's jeep ran out of gas. He begins to lose his mind when he is confronted by shadowy figures and then "The Other." In act 2, Raimi exits the BIOCOM building where he was taken after passing out from the occurrences of Chapter 2. He notices a vagrant wearing a sandwich board with the same message as his computer. Thinking it more than coincidence, he follows the man down a side street. After he talking to Gregory, a newsstand vendor, and buying a stroke mag and some Morley cigarettes, he heads down an alley to get one lit. There, he is confronted by the vagrant who talks in riddles, and foreshadows much of what is yet to come. Act 3, Kamimura finds himself in the back of a small truck, travelling through rural Japan. The driver, an egg farmer named Masayuki, makes some smalltalk, while passing on an important message. At a fork in the road, they go their separate ways, with Kamimura headed towards America.

<p>Rumors of a third person action-adventure Broken Saints video game have broken out on game sites in 2006. The game is expected to be developed by Gnosis Games, though information is not consistent in concerns of which <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh_generation_era.html" title="Seventh generation era">seventh generation</a> system it will be on (<a href="../../../p/s/3/PS3_bf2a.html" title="PS3">PS3</a>, <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>)--there's been a fair distribution of rumors of the game being on each system or one out of the three. At the moment, the storyline is supposed to be true to the original; an interactive remake of the comic. <a href="http://www.gamestats.com/objects/815/815428/" class="external text" title="http://www.gamestats.com/objects/815/815428/" rel="nofollow">Gamestats</a>, <a href="http://pc.ign.com/objects/815/815429.html" class="external text" title="http://pc.ign.com/objects/815/815429.html" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/607/607437p1.html" class="external text" title="http://cube.ign.com/articles/607/607437p1.html" rel="nofollow">IGN news on Broken Saints on Revolution</a>, <a href="http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-3/broken-saints/" class="external text" title="http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-3/broken-saints/" rel="nofollow">Gamespy</a>, <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/gameOverview?cId=3148396" class="external text" title="http://www.1up.com/do/gameOverview?cId=3148396" rel="nofollow">1up</a></p>
