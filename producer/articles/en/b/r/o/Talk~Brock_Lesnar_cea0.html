<p>Is this guy the strongest professional wrestler ever? I've been watching pro wrestling since the mid '80's, and I don't remember ever seeing a wrestler with as much burst strength as his. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 01:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I doubt you'd ever really find a definitive answer to that question because everyone has their opinion. I don't really think he was the strongest however. Aside from the wrestlers with the bodybuilder-ish physiques like Scott Steiner, Lex Luger, the Ultimate Warrior, Billy Graham, and so on and so forth, Andre The Giant was massively strong during his prime despite not exercising, similarly is the Big Show. I've seen old footage of Vader working out as well, doing a powerlifting routine. He was tossing around some pretty heavy weight Wreslters like Ken Patera and Dino Bravo, however, set legitimate powerlifting records back in their day. Patera competed in several of the annual World's Strongest Man competitions. Having a bodybuilder like physique doesn't always entail being the physically strongest. Some of the physically strongest men I've ever seen have been powerlifters that look as if they're nothing more than extremely overweight slobs. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 01:14, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>batista could never move him in a lockup in ovw neither could big show in their matches nor goldberg at wrestlemania..</p>
<p>I think he is about at least top 10 (<a href="../../../w/r/e/User%7EWrestlingfan4life_de4e.html" title="User:Wrestlingfan4life">Wrestlingfan4life</a> 03:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>He is one of the strongest indeed.</p>

<p>People please have peace around here. Let this man have his history correct not by your thoughts.</p>
<p>why does someone keep putting lesnar on vikings? he isnt there any more its better with the obsessedwithwrestling profile where it shows his whole carrer and why is the shooting star press is not his signature move he doesnt use it at all he has just done it</p>
<p>He is current listed as 6´4 and 295 pounds in japan</p>
<p>actually brock is like 6 ft 4 not 6 ft 2, and 300 lbs not 285 ive seen him u havent.----</p>
<p>You have no idea who I've seen in person. For the record, he is 6'2" and 285 lbs. These are stats from his football tryouts with the Vikings. The WWE stats are worthless. He's not 6'4"!</p>
<p>i noticed under un-active, it stated Lesnar was appearing onto the WWE on June 2nd.. but then went away the next day.. anyone know what that is about? -Cos</p>
<p>iono. hey does anybody wanna make note of the incident on Smackdown! where Lesnar superplexed Big Show causing the ring to collapse? <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlapslapslap_a81d.html" title="User:Slapslapslap">user:slapslapslap</a></p>
<p>Looking at this pic, if Brock was really 6 ft 4 in then The Rock should be 6 ft 7 in. obsessedwithwrestling.com/pictures/04/rockbrock1.jpg (<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 16:05, 3 June 2006 (UTC)) That thing aboot the discussion pages in my edit in the main page was a mistake, please ignore.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 16:09, 3 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>arrrrghhh god are u on drugs? since when has "rock" been bigger than brock? thats bullshit.ive seen the dude he's huge! so are u trying to say kurt angle is about 5 ft 6 or something? i dont think so. no one cares about his stats in his "burger flipping days", or his pizza boy delivering days. he's 6 ft 4 ok?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look at the oic, Rock has 2-3 inches on him.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kurt Angle is 5'10", and Brock Lesnar is 6'2". If you actually believe Angle is 6'2" and Brock is 6'4" then it shows how gullible you are to believe WWE stats, who bills BOTH Kane and Big Show at 7'0", and Big Show clearly has 4" on him. I could make several more points, but someone with your limited capacity for common sense makes it impossible and a waste of time.</p>
<p>oh by the way if we're gonna, argue about this can u at least get a decent picture of brock,not from his burger flipping days or something,like the one already up. get one from 2003 or something.</p>
<p>fuck it you dont know anything about wrestling anyway,and youve never seen brock lesnar. kiss my arse.</p>
<p>oh and you're so hard you have to delete my comments because you cant take it. and you know im right.</p>
<p>Your comments wouldn't get deleted if they had something valuable to say instead of just wasting space with useless name calling. Here is a link to Lesnar's football stats: <a href="http://img411.imageshack.us/my.php?image=lesnarvikings6vk.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img411.imageshack.us/my.php?image=lesnarvikings6vk.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img411.imageshack.us/my.php?image=lesnarvikings6vk.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Source for Brock's resigning with WWE for the ECW brand?</p>
<p>It has been listed tha Brock has signed with WWE to work the ECW brand as of the 14th July. I would like to see a source on this, as this news has not yet appeared on any of the major news related Wrestling sites. In addition, the date listed as his signing - 14th July - is an ambiguity as it was only made public that he had left New Japan on the 15th July, while still having one remaining match on his contract.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Talk%7EBrock_Lesnar_cea0.html" title="Edit section: Banned">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Banned</span></h2>
<p>Is he banned to come to the WWE until 2010, wrestle in th US until 2010, or wrestle period until 2010?</p>
<p>The detail of the deal he has made with the WWE is a secret. He seems to be intent on working for Pride or another shootfight organisation. I would guess that the reason TNA have not made a move or annouced they want him (and vice versa) is because he is not allowed to under terms of the agreement.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 22:07, 8 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>well if brock is supposedly 6ft2 then so is goldberg!! and everybody else are midgets!! and btw I REALLY HAVE SEEN HIM AND HE IS WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A FUCKING DOUBT, 6 FT FUCKING 4!! he's a big bastard. and his ' american footaball stats dont mean jack. ill get some pics of him standing next to taker, and then tell me he isnt 6 ft 4. theres like a couple inches height difference.</p>
<p>Goldberg is 6'3". He is 1" taller than Lesnar. Here is a pic to prove it: <a href="http://nori.boo.jp/results/img/senseki_wm20b.jpg" class="external free" title="http://nori.boo.jp/results/img/senseki_wm20b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://nori.boo.jp/results/img/senseki_wm20b.jpg</a> Also, he was listed at 6'3" in his football playing days. Again, here is proof: obsessedwithwrestling.com/pictures/f/football/goldberg.jpg Did it ever cross your mind that Lesnar wears lifts??? He is 6'2", end of story. Get over it!!!</p>

<p>Hogan is taller than Lesnar in that pic! Undertaker has about 5" on Lesnar in the second picture. That would make Undertaker 6'7" like I said above. Don't even tell me for a second you believe Hogan is 6'7" lol! He is about 6'3" to 6'4" right now. He has about an inch if not a little more on Lesnar. Look at the tops of their heads, Hogan is indeed taller.</p>

<p>I have looked at the Hogan/Lesnar pic. The top of Hogan's head looks to me to be 2 inches taller than Lesnar. Even though the picture might be deceiving because Lesnar's eyeline is above Hogans. Hogan has a huge forehead, while Brock has a tiny forehead. he reminds of of a goblin or someting similar.:o)(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>The Halo, don't worry about it. I am done proving myself right to this guy. I am content as long as the stats in the article stay the same, unless of course someone can prove and cite a RELIABLE source stating something different. Halbared, I don't know about you, but to me it looks like Undertaker is "50 inches taller than brock in that pic!!" LOL&#160;:)</p>
<p>If everyone's happy with that, then that's fine.

<p>well no offence ,but im not content if the stats stay the same. i think they should just leave the wrestlers stats at the official stats they have,unless its someone obvious like kane,then fair enough. in the words of matt hardy I WILL NOT DIE!!</p>

<dd>Well, if this discussion is going to keep going then, I shall say this. Firstly, The WWE has changed Kurt Angle's height more times than I can remember from anywahere between 5 10 to 6 2 whenever they feel like it, so WWE offical sats aren't always going to be reliable. Secondly, both Hulk Hogan, and even more so The Undertaker, are famous in wrestling circles for wearing lifts, so judging Lesnar's height by other wrestlers isn't going to prove anything. Thirdly, after doing a quick google search of Brock Lesnar + Height, I found that most sites had him as being 6 2, three of the sites being very crebible; The vikings stats page on Lesnar, theWrestling observer page, and IMDB (though IMDBpro has him at 6 3), and in an old issue of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_slam.html" title="Power slam">Power slam</a>, it listed him as 6 2. Also, a google search of his height shows that 6 4 only gets 11,700 hits while 6 2 gets 13,000, and 6 3 gets 14,200.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In closing, this evidence suggests to me that Lesnar is in between 6 2 to 6 3, and as such, should be considred one of these heights (my personal leaning is toward 6 2, as I believe he wears lifts, just like all the other 'Giants' in wrestling). While I hope this sloves the issue, though I doubt it will, I certainly hope this evidence has been helpful. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo">talk</a>) 23:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hey halo where did u meet brock lesnar? and how tall was he when u saw him? and its unfair that the stats just get left at that, its stupid. since when did people start saying he was 6 ft 2? coz it definately wasnt untill after he left wwe.and that picture of him wearing the tanktop and tracky bottoms, he easily looks 6 ft 4 in that. he cant have lifts in his trainers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How come you don't believe the Viking stats? I have collected Powerslam since it was SOW, and it was breaking kafaybe before other mags followed suit, it usually does try and get the most accurate stats (it has Sid Eudy at 6 ft 6 in).I'm not gonna go thru my 100+copies to look for Brock though!:oD(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 21:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I met Brock in Sheffield on one of the WWE's tours of England, and he was certainly much taller than I was (me being only 5 7). However, he was always sitting down, so I can't make an accurate judgement based on that meeting. It was quite a few years back now&#160;;). Hmmm...trainers huh? I don't know enough about lifts to comment if he could squeeze a pair in his trainers, so i won't even go there. The only way that this is really ever, EVER, going to get resolved is if we track Brock down and measure him ourselves.

<p>lol halo yeah lets go and track him down!! that would be solid!!! brock solid!!! but you gotta admit by the end of his wwe career, 2004 he had let himself go a bit, physically i mean. he's definately out of shape nowadays though, and he no way looks like he used to.he looked a bit flabby on his last match.but that was crud anyway. but i did have an old wwf mag,or raw mag or something ages ago before he was in wwe ,when he was in ovw and it said he was 6 ft 3 or 4. who knows.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he lost interest at the end, and has gone down hill ever since then. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo">talk</a>) 23:00, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>oops yes. i agree. good idea. lets hope he doesnt see this.</p>
<p><br />
omg give this guys personal information a break he is 6´4 295 pounds thats how he is listed in his matches if you have seen him in japan then you see thats how he is listed and how he is listed currently is what matters.</p>
<p>Wiki protocol is to go off the best stats available, when a wrestler gets measured by legit organisation, this is used. In former American footballers situations, their football stats. In Lesnar's case, the last time he was legitimately measured in 2004, he was 6 ft 2 in.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 13:07, 8 July 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>no way i think it should be left at 6 ft 4 and 295 pounds, if batista and everyone else have exaggerated stats because batista isnt 320 lbs or whatever they say, he's 300 at the most because he is no way bigger than brock.i hate the way they put stats THEY think are right on this website.and oh yeah how come brock doesnt have his own website? is it because he cant be bothered doing one. if brock was 6 ft 2,that would mean edge and loads of other people are 6 ft 2 ,when they obviously arent</p>

<p>yeah the legit ones you make up,or the actual official real ones they have in the first place? its silly, just leave it at 6,4 and 295 coz thats what he is...gods sake</p>

<p>yeah well he's not in the nfl any more so that means nothing. he wrestles now and it says he's 6'4 and 295 lbs. if everyone else are gonna get left at the official stats so is brock.</p>

<p>yeah your mum.</p>
<p>Even if he's isnt in the NFL no more, how would that change the fact he is still 6'2. Just because he left football doesnt mean he grew any. I dont see how that makes any sense at all. And when you did see Lesnar up to person, do you actualy measure him? Anyways.. Does anyone know if Brock has ever re-tried the Shooting Star Press after WMIXX (Being in the japan leauge)? And the fued between Holly and Brock, did that really break Holly's neck or was that part of the story to get Holly out of the ring for the time he did? I have the clip, cant really tell if he landed that unproperly since Holly's neck was tucked and seem to land more on his shoulders. I'll try cliping it on the net. - Cos</p>

<p>Is this guy the strongest professional wrestler ever?

<p>I doubt you'd ever really find a definitive answer to that question because everyone has their opinion. I don't really think he was the strongest however. Aside from the wrestlers with the bodybuilder-ish physiques like Scott Steiner, Lex Luger, the Ultimate Warrior, Billy Graham, and so on and so forth, Andre The Giant was massively strong during his prime despite not exercising, similarly is the Big Show. I've seen old footage of Vader working out as well, doing a powerlifting routine. He was tossing around some pretty heavy weight Wreslters like Ken Patera and Dino Bravo, however, set legitimate powerlifting records back in their day. Patera competed in several of the annual World's Strongest Man competitions. Having a bodybuilder like physique doesn't always entail being the physically strongest. Some of the physically strongest men I've ever seen have been powerlifters that look as if they're nothing more than extremely overweight slobs. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 01:14, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good eye JRHorse, but in fact, both are correct. In MMA it's not uncommon to train multiple camps. MFC is a great fighting system, but knowing pure BJJ can be a great asset as well. I offer this, from <a href="http://www.presstelegram.com/sports/ci_4401008" class="external free" title="http://www.presstelegram.com/sports/ci_4401008" rel="nofollow">http://www.presstelegram.com/sports/ci_4401008</a>:</p>
<p>"Among the fighters who could be found at the Miletich camp with Hughes during his training for UFC 63 was MMA newcomer Brock Lesnar.</p>
<p>The former amateur wrestling champion/pro wrestler/NFL wannabe is going to try his hand at MMA and is scheduled to make his debut in 2007 with K-1/Hero's organization. Hughes offered this on the 6-foot-3, 295 pound Lesnar, who he has grappled with during a few training sessions: "He's a heck of an athlete. He's so strong, he's definitely got a future in the sport. He doesn't know much about technique, yet, but he's learning. He's definitely going to be a force."</p>
<p>Ironically, Lesnar announced he will be trained by MMA legend Royce Gracie, who Hughes beat at UFC 60 in May." p6 06:26, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It says he's going to fight for k-1 in Las Vegas this Feb. but I can't find any such event.</p>
<p>According to website, mmaweekly.com, in an article posted on March 23, 2007, it made official the event “Softbank presents DYNAMITE!! USA in association with ProElite,” a major pay-per-view event at the massive Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</p>
<p>Among four of the key fighters for the event include Lesnar, Gracie, , 7-foot-2-inch K-1 fighter Hong-Man Choi, and former NFL player Johnnie Morton.</p>
<p>The pay-per-view event will take place on June 2, 2007. It seems, the main event of the show will feature Brock Lesnar making his MMA debut against Hong-Man Choi."</p>

<p>in the K-1 Hero's / Mixed Martial Arts (2006-present) section can we change the sentence about his first fight being in February 2007 so that it reads "Brock Lesnar announced on August 12, 2006 in Las Vegas that he has joined the K-1 promotion.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> His first fight will be on June 2, 2007 against Choi Hong-man of Korea. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
