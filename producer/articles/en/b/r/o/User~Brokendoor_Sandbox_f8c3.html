<p>Wayne's ideas (and NEFAC) are still a vanguard despite rejecting democratic centralism for decentralism. Most vocal NEFACers accept that the people can't legitimately self organize without radical guidance, but also accepting of liberal traditions in "technical unity" putting NEFAC to the right of the Leninist Bordiga within the communist tendency and in competition with the Democratic party rather than in opposition. I mention Bordiga because he also agreed with a structured political organization acting within the working class as a vanguard using a "leadership of ideas". Though NEFAC claims to be from an anarchist tradition they have more similarities to traditional Leninism than any other visibly functioning anarchist or ultra left communist group in America. If NEFAC were more powerful, we'd be in opposition to them and their interventions as much as any other leftist party. NEFAC would vote in favor of uniting with any coalition that pressed for union reform and against working people when they determined the time for strikes are over, despite attempts to the contrary. This is the ultimate conclusion of Wayne's ideas on technical unity and his rejection of spontaneous revolt. I'm surprised that NEFAC's contradictions with anarchy hasn't destroyed it internally yet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Marxism is diverse as well and while anarchist radicals reject the platform, Marxist radicals tend to reject Leninism. Marxist and anarchist radicals agree that spontaneous uprisings and self-organizing are the expressions for social revolt within the general dispossessed class. Platformists and Leninists lead with an intellectual and militant declasse`. Platformists favor the empowerment of unions, favoring but not necessarily limited to Anarchist syndicalist unions and seek to act as the primary influence on the labor movement, ultimately seeking to turn workers towards a specific anarchist union (that agrees with them) leadership (democratically elected and limited to delegate authority) while Leninists overtly seize the state, ideally organizing society in a similar manner, though the actual practice of democratic centralism has proven to be absolutely bankrupt of revolutionary potential. The platform does suggest "other areas" and that the labor organization is only "one area" of revolution, but because workers and their organizations are not separated from the platform's vision of revolution, spontaneous revolt will always be considered "disorganized" and illegitimate, because they lack an organizational firmness and purpose that defines a platformist revolution.</p>
<p>Wayne takes a step back from the platform with his strategy of technical unity with statist and reformist forces in the present, they don't even seek to turn workers towards anarchist purpose, but rather to simply assist their movements for reform with general union organizing and labor activism until the day comes when a specific anarchist union can rise above all other tendencies...only when this occurs will this technical unity ideally be cast aside. I feel that outside of the arena of activism and protest, anarchists will eventually find themselves in conflict with this anarchist tendency hostile to all other anarchists outside their strategy of organized revolution.</p>
<p>As radical Marxism has rejected Leninism, so radical anarchists must reject platformism. Technical alliances will occur, but the institutionalization of technical unity could prove more permenent than its ultimate intentions. Many times over platformists have expressed no desires for a technical unity with other anarchists should our movement ever overcome activism.</p>
<p>Those for anarchy today must overcome the 60s, the new left, the critiques of the situationists and the situationists themselves. Those for anarchy today must also overcome our fears for praxis.</p>
<p>NEFAC grasps the revolutionary period of anarchist upheaval developing their ideas of social revolution when their own struggle was on the wane. The platform is written by anarchists that lost to Leninism and wanted to compete with the Bolsheviks on Bolshevik terms. Bordiga died 37 years ago and his ideas are within the same period as Makhno's defeat and the Spanish Civil War, the two periods of struggle that NEFAC attempts to overcome in the present by latching onto liberal and left coattails. Every claim of power NEFAC makes pushes them further and further from the anarchist tradition, rather than towards it.</p>

<p>This is my second attempt at communication about this poorly written article. My attempts are primarily because I desire clear and honest discussion and to encourage this among those that consider themselves anarchists. It does little to help spread our ideas by using some of the worst methods of argument dismissal to create a foundation for discourse among anarchists. It is my opinion that platformism in America is weakened by the parallels they share with Leninism. This is how you draw parallels Randy. Leninism doesn't think the people can rise themselves and neither do many platformists. Self-organization is a foundation of anarchist theory, based on the spontaneous European insurrections of 1848, the social revolutionaries that were to call themselves anarchists weren't entrenched in institutions from the start. The platform may or may not suggest ideas of spontaneous revolt, my reading of it could go either way. However my discussions with many platformists suggests a move away from the practice of spontaneous revolt and towards institutions as the revolt. Most platformists that I've had discussions with don't think spontaneous revolt is valid. I've yet to find a platformist that did. Labor institutions, community institutions and the specific anarchist union, with the proper leadership can guide the people with ideas towards a revolutionary consciousness. A multi-faceted approach that has become more accepting of pure democracy than even their platformist founders. You'd think they would consider that institutions can take advantage of spontaneous revolt and those in these institutions would press for a militancy that would not compromise with the forces of the state. However, there is no discussion on this possibility, there is no consideration given outside of off-handed dismissal towards the struggle of people outside institutional organs. Bordigist Leninism holds far more revolutionary potential than the current faces of platformist thought. NEFAC and the other faces of a specific anarchist union are the right wing of the anarchist movement. Anarchists would benefit from learning from the ultra left communists and place the platform into the same dust bin of irrelevance as Leninism. They can continue their obscure battle for relevance wallowing in their own filth of fallacies that have contempt for the way people think.</p>

<p>A few things. Wayne makes a few predictions, which isn't bad since he's just trying to make a point, but I feel it weakens the depth of his article and almost demands an explanation.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I challenged Wayne about the Greeks and how he felt about them and he implied a disagreement in how the Greek anarchists that have been attacking and claiming space resently. I wouldn't imply that America has the same circumstances as the Greeks, but I feel that Wayne would of had a stronger article had he challenged this side of the fence, detailing was he feels is the line.</p>
<p>I don't think organic, spontaneous actions are embraced by Wayne (other than a sympathetic aberration) and the composition of his revolutionary views hardly break from views on how a 20th century political revolution be fought. But this is beside the point.</p>
<p>Why don't we talk about space creation, direct action and community engagement? Every individual is a walking hub, through their words and their actions they can speak volumes to the lives they touch and we should encourage people to live exemplary lives and not accept the bottom dollar. Yet Wayne suggests just this. Many anarchists promote ideas of no compromise, not as a bludeoning moral force, but as a tendency within the working class and an attempt to create something full with our lives. Because many anarchists promote the ideas of self-organization, working people can take or leave what we say, but we can decide them together. This is when we talk about violence as a force of revolt. Understanding social justice issues (or other pet issues of tension) and applying that knowledge to your projects can create a community that seeks more than the average dollar.</p>
<p>I feel that much of his article sounds agreeable, but he doesn't explain the role of institutions, like unions in such a struggle, which he's explained in other articles. I feel this needs to be addressed because Wayne's moral roadmap is drawing lines with big events and no consideration for resistance now. The differences in his strategy to the project of revolt begin with how he precieves the worker. Wayne does not see the worker as a full person. They are an individual that fits a description that is supposed to be revolutionary according to accepted norms. Wayne, do you think that if we get these cardboard cutouts to all dance the way they should, the state will collapse? The worker is a social creature and has many other problems. Wayne does present ways to address these if I'm not mistaken, though I am not searching for his body of work right now. His method of neighborhood intervention mimics the same methods for union intervention. The blueprints of the left stand in our way. We aren't AFL-CIO light or nice ACORN. We seek opportunities to bring tensions to rupture. In order for us to move forward we need to change things.</p>
<p>If we are to find synthesis with work and unions, it is with all unions staying out of the business of revolt. NEFAC doesn't discriminate between unions and the reforms won. NEFAC is only a political organ that seeks workplace interventions and their views are hostile to the project of revolt. To discover an American vision for revolt in the workplace we either must reject all unions or find a way to cope with what exists now.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is great as institution for collective bargaining when that is the bottom line accepted by the workers, but it is not the revolution. The IWW remains weak because it hasn't discarded those aspects of its revolutionary syndicalist past that hold it back. This union still demands a seat of power with the industrial organization of society within its structure. This is a pipedream.</p>
<p>Last century, IWW recogized workers as individuals wanting reforms through its body and their bureaucracy is built on this fact. Its one thing to say that workers can revolt, its quite another to invest worker empowerment in a structure built for an entirely different purpose. When a strike occurs, we succeed by not pressing for conditions on the strike, the strike itself is a measure of our success, not the end of the strike, which is where compromise and reform take place, this is the end of our success. We shouldn't press for reforms with our interventions, let others find that option and if that is the bottom line after all is said, so be it. This is how we don't fetish institutions while accepting the circumstances of the worker in their workplace. Perhaps its not an area of tension and we don't want to find revolt here, perhaps so, but we do it on our terms, not terms driven by mediation and paperwork.</p>
<p>Outside of the workplace, where the worker is actually concerned with the quality of life, other equally important tensions can be found. A whole world of possibilities exist for our interventions, each of which contains possibilities for violence whether we judge it or not. Our expressions for autonomy are often outside the workplace and our imagination is much more creative in such an environment. Power outside the workplace lets us do things like challenge the existance of certain types of work the world would be better without. It allows us to take on bill collectors, landlords, police brutality. It allows us to be positive. We want a life that is complex and interesting, where we express our desires for autonomy in ways that aren't bound by structure, that speak volumes about what we are for and not simply what we oppose.</p>
<p>This article is a great place to start a real dialog on what we can do in America now by what it is not. Though it is about violence, it also delves into revolution. It is not suggesting what violence means to us now, nor is it suggesting anything other than a moral compass, using the weight of the future to determine the outcome of revolution, presenting only two choices, civil war or a largely peaceful mass walkout. This is drawing lines where they don't exist. The tendencies of revolt don't breakout wholesale and we may never get the option to engage the ruling order in civil war or a mass walkout. Believing in their inevitable qualities doesn't help us. America has seen strikes and riots in the past century, but never had the circumstances to even assume something as bold as civil war or general strike as possible. What can Americans do?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokendoor_Sandbox_f8c3.html" title="Edit section: Practical Propaganda">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Practical Propaganda</span></h2>
<p>by High Priest Wombat, KSC</p>
<p>This article is in response to Jose` Antonio Gutiérrez D.'s article "Notes on the article “Anarchism, Insurrections and Insurrectionalism”" and the comments following it at Infoshop.org.</p>
<p>Jose`s article was attempting to tackle an area that Joe Black supposedly neglected in defining a theory critical of "insurrectionalism". This area is where "Propaganda by Deed" came from, which, according to Kropotkin in "Spirit of Revolt", is meant to shake the system. Jose` states that propaganda by deed appears historically when repression is high and struggle is low. His purpose is to hold us back til some other time to act, or to confine action inside of safe channels. During times of low social struggle I find that it is the best time to shake the system rather than accept things as they are. Had attempts to shake the system not been employed, who knows what the outcome of struggle would've been. The outcome of struggle cannot be predicted and analysis is only hindsight.</p>
<p>Exposing capitalism and the state as vulnerable can be an inspiring message. Jose`s article focuses on the areas where propaganda by deed was a bombing and assassination campaign without presenting any alternative way of conceiving propaganda by deed outside of terrorism. This is inaccurate and it ignores the many other ways that deeds have been and can be used by anarchists to become a credible threat to the system.</p>
<p>Chuck0 Munson presents the idea that propaganda by deed is like the Marxist concept of "praxis" which is a "Revolutionary practice [..] always informed by class consciousness and transformative cultural critique" aiming "at producing class consciousness by laying bare the false consciousness that ruling ideology institutes in the everyday. Transformative cultural critique, in other words, is always a linking of consciousness to production practices from which a knowledge of social totality emerges."[1]. Marx stated in his Theses on Feuerbach that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."</p>
<p>The differences between propaganda by deed and praxis are few. In the Red and Anarchist Action Network, the implementation of praxis and propaganda by deed at present have no conflicts of interest other than semantics. Our continuing dialog is both internal and directed towards the general social movements as we have no formal body to report to. The growth of both concepts will only find difference if or when our purpose becomes divided in action.</p>
<p>Today I seek a break with the stagnant theories that has paralyzed action in the United States. We have been paralyzed and have accepted the dominance of the pacifist movement for so long we have forgotten what class struggle looks like, what it feels like, its context and how the state reacts to active struggle. We are so used to peace that any activities that create the slightest response from the state is condemned by nearly all tendencies of reform.</p>
<p>Chuck0 continues comparing propaganda by deed with other strategies of practice, namely one that he is a big proponent of: "practical anarchy". I understand this term to be linked to the development and growth of anarchist and popular support structure. Basically what happens to mutual aid after it has had time to develop lasting reciprocal relationships. I can embrace these as deeds that create inspiring relationships, but practical anarchy is not completely synonymous with propaganda by deed or praxis, both of which imply that ideas of negation should be practiced on the existent. This practice is meant to make people more conscious of the machinations of the present order and what their role is in society to it.</p>
<p>Indirectly practical anarchy can serve this purpose, but it can just as easily offer space for talk shops to form and take the mustard from a practice that exposes why we need to negate the present order. The practical anarchy of today is built on several generations of anarchists and others that were marginalized to only supporting the big left of the 20Th century, only in the past few decades has the anarchist movement grown enough that a trajectory can break with the soley positive and aim towards deeds that promote resistance rather than escape or marginal relief.</p>
<p>Practical anarchy offers something worth fighting for when all else has been exposed as illegit, negative actions don't implicitly offer this, we can be more inspirational today with practical anarchy. Peace has become such a powerful force that mearly mentioning ideas of negation can create panick as if we were jumping straight into the conclusions of terror. Practical anarchy offers a balance, while we may fail to offer solid results to the popular imagination with the ideas of negation, we can point to the results of practical anarchy and its growth as an indicator of the strength of our movement when we've rejected all other previous indicators of the left, namely the fetish of institutional power and the growth of the movement through formal organization membership.</p>
<p>Activity against the dominating order justifies state repression, this is a given, let's not mince words. Attacking the system and defending ourselves from its onslaught are the daily routines of an active struggle engaged in resistance. Jose` thinks insurrectionalism is so simple that practitioners wouldn't even consider defense. Nothing is further from the truth. Another good reason to reject institutions is they are lightning rods for repression and thus can only present a conservative face for social struggle. They don't want the state to smash their unions, their federations, their insurance schemes, their direct Parliaments, their cooperatives so they tell us we should fear repression rather than stare at it through a handy set of binoculars.</p>
<p>I suggest a flexible movement that can attack and escape, something all institutions are completely incapable of handling. All institutions are incapable of offering more than a waiting period til civil war, when their dual power is supposed to take control of society. Til then all action must be linked only to labor or community rights and reform, a safe place to be radical because it doesn't target the totality of societal control and thus can be safely defused without any serious disruption. This makes the institution happy because they might be setback, but they don't have to take on the power of a controlled society full force and can continue to gain members.</p>
<p>Jose` decides to psychoanalyze militancy as romantic and imply vanguardism in their activities, as if the history of struggle is decided only when an institution is empowered by activity. Vanguardism is an idea linked to political opportunism, which the bureaus and cadres of the left mimic, so I mirror this analysis back at Jose`. Union interventionists still are nostalgic of the labor movement's past and their bureaucracies act as extreme forms of vanguard action, though they may claim delegation as something other than an internal decision-making body for an institution that represents a portion of society as if it were the popular struggle, pacifying a struggle already confined to mundane activity.</p>
<p>In other words "Revolutionary movements have to learn how to be flexible, how to accommodate to new circumstances without losing from sight their principles and their fundamental politics. We have to reject dogmatism not only theoretically, but also tactically" and "There are no intrinsic qualities for tactics: what can be valid today mightn’t be so tomorrow."[2] I could continue this mirror, but I've made my point with it.</p>
<p>We can avoid the pitfalls of agent provocateurs by careful consideration of how we arbitrate our activities. Our attitudes towards society can benefit from the wisdom of the Revolutionary Catechism. While I'm critical of its organizational suggestions, its attitudes towards society give a good point of reference so that propaganda by deed today doesn't mimick the bombing and assassination campaigns of the past. Our worst enemies today can inspire revolt without us. If we agitate against them through words and deeds, exposing a history of exploitation and how it interrelates with the general oppression of society, we can hope to see popular struggle expand beyond the presently accepted communities and towards the creation of a social movement in favor of total resistance. We need not measure our success with memberships, but rather in the quality of communities practicing anarchy and finding resistance that links society together beyond the hopes and dreams of the strongest industrial union. Our deeds should inspire strength in the face of state repression and be able to stand strong and make any justification for state repression illegitimate. Our struggle can become that much stronger despite any onslaught from the controlling order.</p>

<p>The optimists say a new age have come, the pessimists see a new age gone, yet we are still awakening. We clear our eyes and rattle our heads, almost every one of us stumbled to get here. Ideas of an anarchy separated from the left has already spread throughout the United States. "What is left?" is a question that reverberates within our movement, a double entendre only hesitantly answered in practice. On one hand, we ask this question to avoid the failures and the endless conundrums of the left, seeking not to repeat them. On the other we ask to find ways to press forward like nothing before. Our basic assumptions must be shook asunder so we can start a new foundation. The boundries of class and agency, of tactics and strategy, must be reexamined. The nihilists of Russia and the social revolutionaries of Europe attempted to answer these questions in the late 19th century, pushing boundries of radical thought outside safe activities before they became normalized. These movements offer a trajectory that can challenge the basic assumptions of ours. Their examinations may influence our reexaminations.</p>
<p>The Russian Nihilists</p>
<p>Starting as a cultural movement among the educated middle class of Russia, the "new people" of Russia rejected everything their society held dear, first the authority of their parents, followed by marriage, then religion. As these new people entered the universities, personal rebellion grew into social resistance finding ideas of revolution appealing.</p>
<p>As the student movement grew they began to shift from a variety of political causes and the rejection of this or that war, this or that state policy, to focus on the peasants of Russia, the Narod, and their situation. The peasants had been released from serfdom by the changing in Tzars but quickly declined into the recesses of poverty and debt. Some responded with desperate uprisings, dying in the streets and fields only to be confined to the Kulaks of wealthier landowners. Serfdom had been replaced with the modern freedoms of insufficient wages and forced working conditions.</p>
<p>The nihilists began by protesting, but proved to only be symbolic, it was not enough. As analysis of the peasants and their situation grew, a popular movement formed looking inspire their revolt. These new people were the Narodnik. They studied peasant dress, custom and language and eventually entered peasant life. Seeking to inspire the peasants towards revolt, the Narodnik often met a peasantry suspicious of them and their activities. When they failed, the Narodnik were rounded up usually to be imprisoned. When they succeededm they inspired open revolt in peasants as disaffected as they and then crushed by Tzarist forces.</p>
<p>These failures drove the nihilists to blame the Tzar and his regime. Success or failure, the nihilists couldn't stay idle as the Tzar decimated them. With their movements crushed the nihilists were driven towards violent reprisals. This lead the Tzar first to the savage policies of white terror, then in the end, to his doom.</p>
<p>The Narodaya Volya, the People's Will were the agents of this doom. Had they only attempted once, it would of been yet another sidenote, but they attempted numerous times with location after location mined for bombs, each time the Tzar escaped a close call. The Tzar's luck ran out when actual bomb throwers repositioned themselves after he escaped another bomb mined in the road. There would be no escape.</p>
<p>With the assassination of the Tzar, most of the Russian nihilists were repressed and many fled Europe only to join the anarchist movement, with the Jura Federation (under Bakunin's leadership) recieving the largest number.</p>
<p>The Late International Workingman's Association</p>
<p>The Russian nihilists had trickled into Europe during the state terror both before and after the assassination, which was the same period of upheaval that defined what was known then as the social revolutionaries of the International Workingmen's Association. The social revolutionaries were often lead by Bakunin's partisans, Bakuninists. The repression of the Paris Commune had confused the International on what they felt were their priorities, with the social democrats, lead by partisans of Marx, Marxists, defining their tendency in this period. The social democrats aimed towards the creation of political parties. This was an outrage, political parties were a deviation of the revolutonary struggle. Bakunin and the social revolutionaries of the Jura Federation denounced the positions of the social democrats and the Central Committee. At the Hague Congress of 1872 after this denouncement, with the help of Marx's political machinations, the social democrats invested more power in the executive committee and expelled Bakunin, then moved the Central Committee headquarters to New York City, where it ultimately assisted in laying the groundwork for both the social revolutionaries and the social democrats.</p>
<p>The following congress of the International at Saint Imier disregarded the decisions of the Central Committee, then developed the International on the principles of federalism. The congress after of 1873 in Geneva, the Central Committee was declared abolished, the social revolutionaries are the majority while the social democrats pretended the International had seen its heyday.</p>
<p>Those still siding against the direction of the First International and with the expulsion of Bakunin were often Marxists. Marxists defined themselves in this period often by their critical position to the other forms of social revolution and needed to express partisanship for the purposes of exclusion and to remain relevant. Though it could be said that the International of Marx never officially adopted political parties, Marxism had. By the founding of the Second International, it had become apparant that anarchists and socialists had nothing in common. Engels excluded anarchists in the 2nd, Stalinism eventually excluded the ultra left and anarchists in the 3rd, Trotsky excluded Stalinism in the 4th, the Situationists excluded everyone.</p>
<p>The anarchists began the development of their pluralist, inclusive, revolutionary international, never to exclude tendencies. The International continued on despite the withdrawal of Marx's partisans, so it still wasn't necessarily anarchist, it just had an anarchist majority. Those agreeing to political parties and those disagreeing with the developing anarchist practice usually left to join Marx's partisans within the social democrats.</p>
<p>The general strike is one of the first resolutions discussed, but because it was decided that no majority could impose its will on the minority, official decisions by the International were usually now mute. Anarchists debated the issue of partial strikes, agreeing they were reforms but also many considered them a means to succeed at general strike. Others contested this and a general position was not accepted.</p>
<p>The Congress of 1874 in Brussels was where the Intenational exposed its leanings towards the insurrectionist praxis with the Italian federation. Unable to attend, they had the following statement read to the congress “Italy will not be represented at the congress, for in Italy the International no longer has any public existence, and no group of our underground organisation is disposed to lose one of its members who might to-morrow, arms in hand, render a very different kind of service to our cause. Yes, in Italy, the International no longer exists publicly. For this fortunate issue, we are wholly indebted to the government. The Italian masses, who have a leaning towards conspiracy, were inclined, at the outset, to be suspicious of the International. Their mistrust was not directed towards the principles of our great association, but towards the fact that it was organised above ground .... However, the truth and justice of our principles triumphed in the end, and the International began to spread more and more widely, but at the same time its organisation assumed a very different form from that which had been adopted in other lands. This organisation made of the International in Italy a huge conspiracy organised in the full light of day. That simple definition suffices to show the absurdity of such a system.”</p>
<p>However, this Congress mainly tackled issues of blueprinting the revolution, transition periods and Worker states. The debate was divided with Bakunin's partisans dominating the opposition to any transition period. Bakunin and the Jura Federation had taken a new position as an alternative to political parties known as direct action. This federation was even railing at the very foundations of the International, namely the cooperative movement, seeing them as capitalists no matter their intention, some suggesting they recieve little or no support within the movement.</p>
<p>By this point social democracy was again on the rise, social revolutionaries were competing with the desires of universal sufferage and had failed to this point to instigate more than marginal success through armed insurrection, mainly through the Italian federation. However, the Italian's strength of the convictions in the face of these odds can be summed up in their own words “The Italian Federation believes that the insurrectionary deed, intended to affirm socialist principles by actions, is the most efficient means of propaganda, the only one which, neither cheating nor depraving the masses, is able to make its way effectively into the lowermost social strata, and to direst the living forces of mankind into the support of the international struggle.” Their strength despite the odds continued to be appealing to the people despite social democracy's gains in the political arena.</p>
<p>The International itself died out with support towards unions that go beyond reform in the 1877 Congress of Ghent, but was again revived in the 1880 Congress in London which rallied around the strategy of "Propaganda by Deed", with its strongest theoretician being Kropotkin. These were the first official anarchists and anarchist communists, this was the first Insurrectionist International. They rejected the foundations of Marxism and questioned the very basis of the proletarian class as a revolutionary agent. This tendency remained within working movements in countries like the United States creating an insurrectionary and syndicalist basis for social revolution.</p>
<p>These social struggles were done to combat the miseries of their times and for the basic necessities of life. These struggles were all a part of the struggles for socialism, done as part of the Enlightenment, for Progress and an extension of the idea of constitutional rights. In the struggles of today we seek to question all authority, challenge all coersion and to destroy all domination. Anarchists have done their part and continue to do their part to establish a basic foundation from which social revolution could flourish, a momentum of struggle established. The premise of anarchists in developed countries to continue to compromise to the ideals of socialism hold no water. Generally the struggle for worker rights only succeed in giving the worker a better chance at purchasing commodities. Where this doesn't hold true, perhaps a justification of socialism, libertarian or otherwise, might still be found. Our struggle is for something different.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokendoor_Sandbox_f8c3.html" title="Edit section: Today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Today</span></h2>
<p>Today we struggle against two things in the developed world, the brutality of civilization in its myriad of parts and against the mediocrity they want us to accept. The banal activities that lead the advancement of the worker into a consumer is not our purpose, this is working against our drive to destroy what now exists. I have other concerns.</p>
<p>I challenge the current tendencies of insurrection, in particular, the tendency favored by the Italians that has spread throughout the developed world. This international tendency emphasizes urges and passions while I emphasize the will to destroy. The International tendency remains vague in its description of class for inclusive purposes, I say we can't continue to learn if we don't get more specific. The International favors the liberation of the dispossessed through destroying the social order, I find affinity with those that aim towards the destruction of the social order, finding some measure of success despite everything.</p>
<p>The premise that tension is caused soley by a tension between two economic classes has been fetished for too long. The fetish of this kind of class division is a Marxist phenomenon, peasants and workers are in the same economic class, yet have varied in history. They have claimed that the peasants could not be revolutionary beyond a political revolution, anarchists never dismiss the revolt of any class and any class has the potential for revolt, both the International tendency and myself agree. To differ myself, I must break with the vague descriptions of class that this tendency uses. We are all dispossessed yes, I agree. But is that all we are? No, we are also educated radicals and not just isolated individuals disgruntled within a faceless mass. We can act against the existant as a class . Our social movements are of our choosing. Perhaps we are to "connect our conscious, ongoing conflict with the ruling order to these flare-ups of conflict in a way that fits with our aims, "principles" and methodology" as Wolfi Landstreicher writes in Green Anarchy. Or perhaps not.</p>
<p>Because we hold revolutionary potential as a class despite all others, I see it as a weakness within the international tendency to limit our possibilities out of fears from a specific struggle. I also disagree with their split with militancy based on these fears. As first a critic of this unacknowledged split and now a supporter of revolutionary specialty, If revolutionary specialists did a bad job in Italy, that is a problem for those in Italy. We can learn from their mistakes without taking away our abilities to act as an agent of insurgency ourselves. Radicals are a tendency within the educated class first, targetting the totality with their wrath. The Russian nihilists acknowledged this from the beginning, starting with themselves and then finding sympathy with the peasants and their plight because they rejected the miseries that autocratic Russia laid upon them. The Russian nihilists didn't limit their possibilities based on theorectic history from another place and another era, but rather the circumstances of specific practice, they also knew when to acknowledge that no revolt was to come through a repressed social revolution and acted as a revolutionary class to enact vengeance upon the Tzar and his regime.</p>
<p>If we are to be revolutionaries today, if we are to be uncontrollable insurgents, if we are to destroy this existing society, we must not start our drive towards revolutionary tension with a gloved fist. There is space in our struggle for revolutionary specialists, revolutionists. The method of insurrection offered by the italians holds merit, but their limitations shouldn't be ours. The struggles of different circumstances can learn from the other, but the present is always a new path with fresh possibilities, not to be hindered by the fears of another era's past. Our struggle today differs from yesterday.</p>

<p>On Insurrectionary Anarchy</p>
<p>by High Priest Wombat, KSC</p>
<p>Unlike insurrectionary anarchy, I do not support insurrection as an end all be all. I do support destruction. This means that while I do support the insurrectional project, I don't think that insurrection should be the constant focus of my attention. There are many reasons for this. Insurrection as an individual goal is unobtainable and the methodology of insurrectionary anarchists is geared to a method of probability. Every destructive action of an insurrectionary anarchist is an action of propaganda and vengeance perhaps for some greater future goal, perhaps not.</p>
<p>The tactics of the insurrectionary anarchist cannot break certain norms because it has a strategy in struggle, the creation of riots. Agitating through word and through deed, their strategy must involve a level of popular activity, acceptable activity, if only to a minority of the population. Their activity is based on creating mass discontent, mass disillusionment in the hopes of spurring activity outside of their interventions. The creation of a momentum of struggle is based on numbers, else a riot cannot take place. This isn't wrong, most any struggle needs a level of popular acceptance at some point in the battle, else the toppling of the dominant order cannot take place.</p>
<p>Some insurrectionary anarchists frown on other attempts at struggle, seeing them as a recuperating force or a force bound for power, a force of politics, a force of control. These other strategies must be seen as illegitimate if they cannot rally the populus in the early stages of revolt with the simplist, most easily reproducable actions that are as safely extreme as they can possibly be.</p>
<p>Really sticking your neck out never is popular, that is why sticking your neck out is scary, your head might get hit, shot or chopped off. Actions of the past or in other areas that are considered safe or radically popular suddenly become too extreme, too out of the reach of a greater participation in other times and areas. It is true that discontent sees protests, riots and insurrections and that intervention in struggles towards this aim can produce some level of results, given the context of the area that is being agitated. But because one form of struggle can see a level of success (a protest turns to riot, riot to insurrection) doesn't mean that it is the only method of success, nor does it mean that success can only be measured in the quantity of people participating nor in the level of destruction a mass can create.</p>
<p>How success is measured is dependent on those participating in activity. It is their strategies and tactics, their wills and their consequences that determine if they were right or not in doing what they did. If the insurrectionary anarchist is intervening, it is probably through a view of propaganda leading to insurrection. Every action and every word that is of worth to the insurrectionary anarchist are ones that promote this particular type of attack on the system. Because of this, insurrectionary anarchists share an ethical responsibility to each other not to spoil the party.</p>
<p>Insurrectionary anarchy has a meta-narrative that suggests that because insurrections are possible anywhere that this form of struggle is where radical focus should aim. A popular will that is filled with angst can only become real if their activity is public so it can be recorded. Things must be destroyed on the job site, in the hated communities, against hated businesses. The walls of every disgruntled community must be plastered with their hate.</p>
<p>The struggle of the insurrectionary anarchist must be known...not through happenstance, but through intention. The conspiracy of the insurrectionary anarchist is for their activity to be famous/notorious and not necessarily for any strategic gain. Because what they seek to destroy is social, they only seek to change minds and for people to see that minds have changed with real activity. Certainly the insurrectionary anarchist splits with the left on how a protest should be conducted...but they are still protesting. Insurrectionary anarchists splits with unions on how a strike should be conducted...yet they still strike. Afterall, that is where the people are...</p>
<p>As I stated, I still support the insurrectional project in my own way...sometimes. Othertimes I consider other strategies, other tactics and attempt to figure out what I can do to make them happen. Some of what I consider requires a level of popular will, but not the kind that requires people in the streets or on the sidewalks with a desire to break something that represents what they hate. Some of what I consider still attacks a controlling social totality, but places value outside the sphere of whether an insurrection could develop from the strategy.</p>

<p>In the past couple months I've read a great deal about "Propaganda of the Deed" and "Insurrectionalism" from several sources, mainly internet related. This is a hinderance based on current available resources. The focus of this writing is on two critical essays on the practice of insurrection and the campaigns of propaganda of the deed. These essays come from a current direction hostile to anarchy removed from the left as these tendencies were hostile to 19th century anarchists who rejected socialism. Labor movement oriented anarchists turned hostile to the tactics of the insurrectionary anarchists when police repression became a hinderance on their activities. Instead of providing solidarity and following the leading theoreticians of the time, they condemned and distanced themselves from tactics that didn't directly relate to labor movement intervention and the weight of any strategy from then on for the majority of anarchists and socialists had to benefit workers. Strikes held power and union members often armed themselves, but ultimately the militancy wasn't to last, loyalty to the nation was put to question for union members, as if they were unpatriotic and red scares dominated many countries. After world war II a cold war dominated the climate and international society stood polarized against each other, two methods of controlling society competed for dominance as one mimicked the other. In the U.S. the power of union reform was found in this climate and its credibility was to disintegrate significantly during the 60s and 70s with all other political corruption contraversies. Unions still stand as powerful institutions dominated by solidarity with the programs of liberal reforms and critical support for the Democratic party. Breaking support makes little sense, especially if the AFL-CIO is still treated as credible for political influence and benefits from that credibility.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokendoor_Sandbox_f8c3.html" title="Edit section: On dictatorship of the proletariat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">On dictatorship of the proletariat</span></h2>
<p>premise, dictatorship of the proletariat in a libertarian framework seems to suggest no compromise to other classes outside of the proletariat.</p>
<p>What suddenly becomes apparant is the importance of this semantic in all its little nuances. Libertarian Marxists, communists, anarchists and others do not need this term for their theories, but its use is insisted. Why? Orthodoxy. What sets the tendencies of communists apart from anarchists is its need for an orthodox jargon. By staying true to Marxist jargon, the orthodox language of revolution extends from every revolutionary situation since the International Workingmen's Association of Marx.</p>
<p>Dictatorship of the proletariat was used by the radicals of the 2nd international, while the social democrats rejected its use. The right wing interpretation of this term, which posed as left of social democracy, is rooted in the theories of Lenin and he has a historic basis for its use in a statist fashion. However, during the time when the actual debate on the use of this term came around, it has gained a broader interpretation from the left communists, which was based not on vanguards, but on the whole of the proletarian class.</p>
<p>This is important because communists want to exclude the bourgeois forces from the revolution and used this term to note this.</p>
<p>However as I stated, orthodoxy is important to the communist and while rejection of these terms would seem to make sense, it exposes their sides in the communist tendency to other communists. Proletarian, a right wing interpretation is that it is the working class, a left wing interpretation states that it is the lowest social class. How "lowest social class" is interpreted is defined in more nuances.[this logic is in error]</p>
<p>Libertarians of communism, the left communists, continue to use this term today, though I'd prefer to find a more suitable name for them to fit my own jargon and how I like to draw my own lines.</p>
<p>Many anarchists have broken with the left, even though some communists of the libertarian persuasion claim this can't be done or is a semantic detail of some sort. It definately draws lines though.</p>
<p>So lets get into this again. In order for anarchists and communists to be able to share the same language, the nuances must be understood.</p>
<p>We have a different language for revolution and the communists do not trust ours. Proletarian, Bourgeois, Dictatorship, Communism, Exploitation, Class...all these things are debated within communism while anarchists sit outside of this argument, opting instead to reject a language built to define revolt.</p>

<p>The Anti-globalization movement in Columbus is dead, the Anti-war movement is hardly changing and our confrontations have hardly created a new engagement in the war. We've mentioned anti-war direct action many times but our lack luster attempts at organizing around these principled concepts of resistance shows we don't feel any vested interest in acting in such a manner. Only a few remember the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Network (RAIN) in town and the radical blocs that were formed to create a radical voice for opposing the war at protests. RAIN only lasted til the war in Iraq and then it dissolved. Most may remember the failed kickball game in the alley, an attempt to claim space that left many confused. Until this protest, radicals had been a mute voice in the Columbus anti-war protest movement since RAIN dissolved. I don't think we should feel too bad about this.</p>
<p>We are discouraged with protesting. Some, like myself, choose to do support roles because protesting is sometimes very dull, though sometimes its very exciting. It's only exciting when things get chaotic. Sillyness is fun, but street claims are way more. The recruitment centers have only recieved minor actions against them, none have shut them down. Anti-war Columbus has done what it could and now SDS is wanting to confront the Wars of the Bush Regime. I feel that if we continue to flirt with direct action and not create a practice it must be for a reason other than we forget or don't feel like it at the time. So I think we should occupy our time with other activities that might not directly relate to the war, but rather in individual projects and community engagement.</p>
<p>Direct Action outside of protests can take many forms. We favor openness and shouldn't spook ourselves for doing what we feel we can as part of an overall campaign against the war. For small groups, eggings, graffiti and flyers seem to be the instruments of direct action against pro-war targets by word and deed. Resently we've discussed how to close a recruitment center and the Pittsburgh Organizing Group (POG) offers a method that is open and effective.</p>
<p>We need to find a direction in town. I feel that we need a stronger base of support within the city, this is why I'm working on developing the Eastside Praxis community engagement project. I'm not suggesting we stop attempting to challenge the war, but instead we may need to find ourselves and why we are actually wanting to stop the war. Are we doing it as isolated individuals or are we wanting to stop the war as a greater community, sharing in the wealth of diversity the city of Columbus has to offer. Or do we think other issues are as important as the war and we want to express interests that aren't so intertwined by the latest popular movement of the time. The thing about the anti-globalization movement was that everything was connected, but with the war, there is only the war. We need to rectify that.</p>

<p>Beginning Strategy</p>
<p>Arawak City ARA- Eastside Praxis (RAAN)</p>
<p>January 2007</p>
<p>This is the proposed strategy of "Eastside Praxis", a Red and Anarchist Action Network collaborative project with a focus of practicing anarchy on the Eastside.</p>
<p>We are Arawakans from Arawak City and our ideas fall in line with the general community that shares this name in the Greater Columbus, Ohio area. We benefit from having as many participants living fully on the Eastside as possible and we seek to expand that number, though those outside the area can help fill in the roles necessary to keep our project working. We seek to create an Eastside praxis because the apparant poverty of the Eastside is shared by our participants and we want to create projects with mutual aid in mind.</p>
<p>We use Anti-Racist Action's "Points of Unity". We give priority to anti-nazi and anti-fascist organizing. If it is known that such groups are rallying publically in town, we will focus on informing the public of their hate and shut them down. We agree with the Red and Anarchist Action Network's "Principles and Direction" and seek to impliment projects that share the spirit of liberation found in this document and we agree with the current practice that RAAN has put forward, suggesting mutual aid projects combined with print media.</p>
<p>We want to organically develop our community involvement in the Eastside. Our projects should bring together Eastside community involvement as well as challenge status quo attitudes on various aspects of poverty. Our outreach should expose our desires for prisoner solidarity, self-defense and social justice reciprocated with the desires of the general community and how we can help each other.</p>
<p>To start we will go door to door discussing issues and taking notes. We will not assume anything until we understand our neighborhood enough to begin. We should research and provide flyers and zines on what we know we are interested in now as we explore the neighborhoods we want to talk to. What we want to find out is where people feel stress. Is it work, the utilities, the landlord, insurance, medical bills or is it police brutality, gang warfare, drug addiction or is it disease, pollution, political corruption or is it conflict with specific corporations in the area or development groups, gentrification? Are there a lot of elderly and/or kids? When walking around do you see signs of homelessness? What are their conflicts?</p>
<p>Until we have engaged the community we cannot provide any sort of program on how any situation should be handled within the neighborhood. Our focus should be on discovering problems in the neighborhood where the people in general are exploited and thus a tension exists. We want to inspire people to assemble together and discover solutions that go beyond compromise.</p>

<p>Premise One Question Everything and mild wild statements</p>
<p>Yes, protest protest protest. The era of protests has begun us. Now is the time to toss it all aside! Question Everything! Make wild assertions and rile up everyone. Punch somebody you disagree with to teach them self-defence! Yes, you've heard it before, but for us to have a revolution within ourselves. Turn everything asunder, scare people with your darkness!</p>
<p>Questioning Class</p>
<p>The Working Class is not going to help you. They can only be helped by the labor movement. The working class in the United States is a petty consumer class. The service industry as the major field of unskilled labor, has created high turnovers for those strong enough to hate this work and those that stay are slaves to a working mentality to rebel is a rare exception. Unskilled warehouse and factory work creates a life of kissing up, as this unskilled laborer is lucky to get the bigger paycheck than the service laborer, or at least doesn't have to hold a coersed smile. For this benefit the laborer suffers from cronic health problems and addiction to pain medications, which do nothing but subdue the spirit. Getting into skilled labor is hard, sometimes individuals have problems holding down these jobs as the priorities of the nation shifts and technological processes outdate various skills. These jobs and all jobs above, dominated by business owners bureaucrats, professionals, politicians and the rich, are the strongest gears in the consumerist clock, satisfied only with their own selfish interests.</p>
<p>Our Rebellion</p>
<p>Our rebellion isn't one of necessity, as a rule, we are not starving. We rebel for a better life a life outside the mundane. Unlike the western theists, the utopians and the Marxists, we can achieve this life now.</p>
<p><br />
Nihilist Anarchy isn't Black Hat Anarchy</p>
<p>Despite my attacks on morality, I'm not seeking a return to political assassinations, bombings and other similiar plots. Rather, I think that learning revolutionary skills and how to defend oneself are a way of changing our confidence and those we want to struggle with will be affected by this. This opens other possibilities that wouldn't be available had we remained simple activists, propagandists, agitators and organizers.</p>
<p>Activists as a Class</p>
<p>Consider activists as a class. They are educated and hold many sympathies for radicalism. They are perhaps the easiest to radicalize because they are convinced by radical ideas and arguments. Now think 1984 Orwell. The activists are also a part of the Orwellian party and the thoughtpolice keep a close on on them (and probably you). The thoughtpolice make sure they remain the self-sacrificing sheep they are reknown for.</p>
<p>Professionals (Teachers, Military, Scientists, Lawyers etc.) as a Revolutionary Anti-Working Class</p>
<p>Radicalism in this class is more potent than within activists. They are capable of spreading propaganda in ways that persuade others that activists can never achieve. Their skills also make a movement capable of exerting their desired autonomy, which activists are never capable of doing as a rule. This class is also the one that has rebelled with sympathy to others more than any other. Though an insurrection can't be won with them, they can provide one of the great morale boosts to a paralyzed movement. Instead of accepting a generalized, lowest common denominator tactic that is easily reproducable, we can educate our revolutionary culture of what is easily reproducable.</p>
<p>Immitate enemy tactics</p>
<p>This defines our movement. Police taser somebody, buy a taser. Police beat protesters with clubs, find a situation of advantages and give what the protesters recieved.</p>

<p>Why do you see the nuances of class in the situation of Mexico as relevant to expose a reason to intervene? The tension between the state and those struggling against it seems overt to me. Where is the obfuscation? Radicals intervene in popular struggles and they agitate them. If we are to enter into these fights, our entry wouldn't be to join whatever sect seems to fit the theories of class the best, but rather to enter them as outsiders and use our own judgement to expand the struggle in the direction we can convince others to go, rather than be dragged around by abstract analysis. Our own networks and channels would learn through practice and experience as to whom is on our side and who is blowing hot wind.</p>

<p>People seem to enjoy exposing their ideas. Some think that they can influence or change people's minds through rational discussion. Though this can be somewhat true on a micro-level, attempting to change the mind of society is laughable. If it were that easy, then rational discussion would've granted us every freedom imaginable today. But this cheese is old and moldy. This discussion mirrors the reaction to the desires of the idealists which is well over a century old. Most who would call themselves radical today don't usually fall into the same pitfalls. My discussion does not lie in an old dichotomy based on the grounding of an understanding, my discussion needs to be exposed.</p>
<p>The current praxis of radicalism in the United States floats around several poles. One pole is the mass model, intervening around various issues in an attempt to agitate people involved in where the intervention takes place. Typically protests, activism, strikes and community based projects revolve around the mass model. Another pole is small group based.</p>

<p>What are nonleft anarchists? First, this is not a new trajectory I'm proposing, it was just a series of words thrown together. They are anarchists that have rejected the methods of past anarchists, such as an institutional based strategy of revolt, the continued uncritical acceptance of federalism, the teleological belief in progress which influences our understanding of revolt.</p>
<p>To announce solutions, I can only speak for myself, many may agree with me. Things like spontaneous revolt will result without our attention and that we can in fact play a disempowering role in our organizing of the working and/or poor if we approach it in ways that the left does. We don't control such situations from occuring, but we can be better prepared for when they do occur.</p>
<p>Wayne, we both agree such things occur. We both agree that we can be better prepared for when they do occur, but this is where our similiarities differ. I see this as the self-organization of the people and I assume you see the self-management of the people through an institution prior to a rebelling situation as the method.</p>
<p>What I don't get is why the (neo) platformists don't say that this other method is anarchy too. Sure, I can't say that NEFAC will necessarily help the situation, but when confronted with a situation of revolt, wouldn't NEFAC pull tight and try to offer leadership in such a situation of spontaneous assembly creation? Can't we just disagree in these assemblies and hate each other dogmatically here, rather than now?</p>
<p>Can't you just say "they revolted, but the lack of firm principles compromised the revolt, but I still love my anarchist comrades" or similar statement? I have love for some NEFACers, especially those that went to DC last year, they did a damn fine job in keeping everyone safe despite the police charges. But then I've had some theorectic disagreements with yourself and I've focused attention here because of it.</p>
<p>Is the myth of general strike so absolute that these assemblies have no bearing on your struggle?</p>
<p>As we are in a new era, it is a time of experimentation, a time to learn and a time to find strategies that are directed at the specifics of the people of the America. Perhaps we are to become full individuals ourselves first before we approach society, whatever that may mean. Perhaps saturating specific propaganda based on circumstance can be inspirational. Perhaps engaging your specific community, learn what they feel needs to be responded to and agitate them towards acting on that feeling. Perhaps we are to develop sustainable spaces so that we might better communicate with others that are diseffected or creating a center from which a neighborhood could find itself. Perhaps people can be inspired from graffiti, wheatpaste and vandalism of unpopular locations or unpopular people...or maybe they could be popular but they have a dark side that needs to be exposed because they aren't that great anyway. Perhaps we are to learn how to sustain ourselves in more than urban ways to be prepared for whatever crisises come our way and birth a community that enjoys such endevevors. Or so on.</p>

<p>I think I've moved my theory forward and I can present a case that exposes the "pre-revolutionary" endeavors of today to be similar to those of Russian nihilism. While the circumstances are completely different, it presents a counterpoint as to why our struggle is more empowered by expressing a "for power" formula, that presses forward towards autonomy, accepting those temporary moments won in our contest against the powers of the present.</p>
<p><b>American Praxis: Surf's up!</b></p>
<p>Anarchist praxis in America stands in a beginning tension. Activism must be overcome and it's answer isn't that which is proscribed by the IWW or NEFAC, which blends labor activism with more self-management and democracy than the AFL-CIO or the Democratic Party. The former institutions seek to turn revolt into a conflict of systems. They compete within the left tendency to become the dominant institutional power within the left and bring these institutions in conflict with the sovereign state.</p>
<p>As was predicted by the Johnson-Forrest tendency, the assemblies of self-organization will come to a tension with institutional bureaucracies. (enter a critique of NEFAC and the IWW)</p>
<p>being prepared for physical defence as we press for claims of social autonomy.</p>
<p>creation of semi-permenent centers, "sustainable autonomy", be it physical, like infoshops, squats, community gardens or be it a common vechicle of propaganda, like a magazine, a zine distro, or a website. In and of themselves these spaces will sit isolated and disconnected but by connecting with the drive for social autonomy, they can stand as a beacon in an era of banal grey.</p>
<p>Our motions can find a similar trajectory in Russian nihilism. They were acting against autocracy in general, some for revolution, some simply wanted to see the Tzar destroyed. It was arbitrated by the social movement of Russia that the extreme repression of Tzardom prevented revolution and grew resentful of the Tzar's regime and autocracy itself was all their power could claim in their era.</p>
<p>Our era is also an age of resentment, but its more over the precarious life we are presented with. Bureaucracy functions very efficiently as far as preventing or slowing expressions of dissent that fall outside of approved channels. High turnover makes it easy to lose a job and hard not to get a job. Our cheap fast food, garbage and social services stand plentiful enough to prevent starved conditions. We won't riot over a lack of food, but rather the quality of food.</p>
<p>If we aren't expressing a vendetta, then our struggle is for power, for autonomy. As the anti-authoritarian tendency we have chosen to be excluded from the power of the masters and we want no part in their order. Though circumstances stand in the way of all excluded from the present schemes of power, it is our desire to overcome all obstacles that stand in our way.</p>
<p>The tendencies for revolution have waned so far in America since the times of unrest of the 20th century that revolution is as much a teleological event as utopia. Crisis after crisis is handled to the satisification of the general dispossessed. Only those that are discontent with this situation desire something outside of the present.</p>
<p><b>Expanding the Ante</b></p>
<p>The language of revolt is always in flux, people search to answer the conundrums on why America isn't revolting like other nations. Some give their lives to passivity because the circumstances are docile when compared to the struggles against imperialism in the developing world and the struggles against capitalism in the developed world. Others want to up the ante and mirror other nations in struggle. And still others look into the past searching for the secret of creating a struggle for resistance. We want to emulate them, we want to emulate a foreign past, we want to emulate our forgotten past. We keep searching for how to overcome activism, yet we don't want to give ground.</p>
<p>The American black bloc didn't start in Seattle, but it did establish the tactics of our movement. From anti-globalization to anti-war, our rebel spirit has only reenforced these tactics. Outside of the protest, these tactics are mimicked throughout the nation. We show resistance with shattered glass and graffitied walls. ELF is the only tendency that has come close to mimicking Europe as far as upping the ante. With their extreme cover broken and their repression we realize that upping the ante didn't expand their attacks outside of their select group, but the black bloc did.</p>
<p>The black bloc isn't just about destruction, in fact, most of the times the bloc doesn't attempt to destroy property. It is more about searching for space to claim. It is an acknowledged norm that these space claims are temporary, yet we attempt to hold them for as long as we can and we feel alive because we do it. We sometimes try to connect with the general protest, but many times they don't want to involve themselves in our fight. We could blame the left tendency for pacifying struggle or we could blame the ignorance of others. But as many today realize, we are to blame because activism, militant and peaceful, radical and reformist, is not connected outside our struggle.</p>
<p>Rather than upping the ante, we should figure out how to continue expanding our current practice, connecting it with those that are diseffected and discontent. We need to engage society and overcome its isolated and precarious existance. We need to generalize our resistance and inspire others towards claiming space in their own ways.</p>
<p>We are the anti-authoritarian tendency within the dispossessed and excluded, our struggle starts with ourselves and the expressions of self-power in this time of mediocrity. We assert our lives in the face of circumstance and we pay the consequences for doing so. The authorities want to set an example by punishing our expressions and we want to set an example by rebelling against their control. As we continue our individual struggle, we realize we can't overcome authority by ourselves and others have similiar feelings within society, so we connect with them. In some places, the norms of community have been established, in others no community exists for us to find sympathy.</p>

<p>People not involved in politics (or in subverting them) often ask me why I seek an end to the current system. Most times I give a response that it is a misery machine, that it destroys lives, that it alienates us from who we really are. However many remain unconvinced. Does alienation mean anything to someone that knows of no other way to live, does a misery machine matter when the consequences of life in any other way of living grant as many ways to die as presently.</p>
<p>I could blame class privilege for why these people cannot see that almost anything is better than this system, but that is a cop-out. Most of these people have rejected their class position and accepted living alternative lives outside of the dominant system. I could then blame the national economics, given that we live in the richest country in the world, but that too fails to truly convince me. It just seems like a hollow analysis. The individual is to "blame".</p>
<p>People often fail to see that subjective conditions drive desire or they may acknowledge it but place a near religious quality on the reasons to rise up. Just as the Bible was created by humanity, so too is theory as well as the language that made political theory possible. There is no grand scheme, no true answer. People are guided by their interests and desires as well as the consequences of acting to fulfill them. If they see no reason to revolt, they are just as "right" as I am.</p>
<p>Class only matters because exploited people as a whole are affected in ways that makes radical realities possible. If people are satisfied with reforms or alternatives, they have no reason to revolt. I could offer utopia, direct democracy, hunting/gathering, agrarian, techno-scavenging or other anarchy, but that is an abstraction, more meant to rally people around a positive concept so people can concieve a life beyond the present one. Such a thing is like saying a prayer of forgivence and thanks to an animal before the slaughter. It does nothing and isn't necessary, but it may satisfy the individual's conscience that the destruction was not done for ill reasons. A vegan would be firmly against this, even with the prayer, only agreeing to the death of this animal as a last resort...after all vegan's are proponents of an alternative to the eating of flesh.</p>
<p>So even with a highly tuned theory that grants an understanding of the misery machine, the real reason people strike is simple veangence. If there is no vendetta, there can be no revolt. But can one simply find joy in destruction? Perhaps a few, but this joy will be tempered with hate as the consequences catch up to these playful destroyers. Such are the things that insurrections are made of.</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokendoor_Sandbox_f8c3.html" title="Edit section: Exemplary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exemplary</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Solution: As exemplary individuals (avoid self-descriptive terms like anarchist, communist, radical) we radiate a charisma and a confidence with our words and our actions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no revolution, but there is revolt. The purpose of revolt is no longer to push towards revolution, nor insurrection, but rather to define our period in history as localized sums of individuals that want to express power themselves at the expense of the power of the masters. These localized individuals are not seeking a "dual power" or to institutionalize their revolt, but rather to expand the expressions for power without masters throughout their community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>glossary of terms to define: work, revolutionary syndicalist, exemplary, revolt, institution, strikes, resentment, power, autonomy, epoch, anti-system</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a precarious civilization, how expressions of self-power outside of institutions can prepare the exemplary for a life without limits. Because there is no revolution, no whole revolt, the exemplary have no fixed method for expressing power, but the power of the exemplary can challenge the power of civilization simply by its expression.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>exemplary living rejects the urban prison as a given, civilization exists as an extended by precarious event that is not fixed and its circumstances of power are limited by its own totality. The exemplary is worthy of immitation because they are not fixed either and can adapt to the changes in the circumstances of power. The exemplary does not accept any given. An example of adapting to precarious civilization could be: One minute an exemplary individual could be expressing power in a social justice protest brought to rupture, the next minute the exemplary could be pressing for no compromise of power in a local assembly, or maybe they began an advancement on military forces or even fleeing into the woods and rural areas to survive their own expressions of power.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>an exemplary individual attempts to master their space and thus their circumstances. Autonomy is an expression of space mastery. Because conflict is inevidable between other individuals, all space mastery is not permenent, no matter how fixed it seems and the exemplary must be prepared for a give and take on their expression of power. The exemplary isn't trying to win anything. The exemplary is only trying to express power, thus "defeat" is not permenent either. success and defeat are not terms that an exemplary judges their expressions for power. Even when the exemplary finds union in the claiming of space, this union can just as easily collapse on itself as it can be taken external of the union.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Civilization is an expression of power as impermenent as any other claim on power. An expression of exemplary power is done despite the power of civilization. A crisis of civilized power also places the exemplary individual in a precarious situation which they must overcome.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>problems with my current analysis: My analysis is still "future looking" and needs to adapt a past to present,rather than a present to future examination.</li>
</ul>
