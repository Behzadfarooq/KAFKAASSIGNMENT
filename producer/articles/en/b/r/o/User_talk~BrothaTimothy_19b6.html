<p>I'm probalby stating the obvious, but I'm going to nominate it at <a href="../../../f/a/c/FAC_2e99.html" title="FAC">FAC</a>.

<p>I see, but I was about to edit some of that stuff because first, some of the names are misspelled, and some dates in the timeline, like on their Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame page, it says the Jacksons first performed at the Apollo in June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_Knight_a348.html" title="Gladys Knight">Gladys Knight</a> insisted to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berry_Gordy_19d7.html" title="Berry Gordy">Berry Gordy</a> to sign them but he refused to.

<dd>Yeah. The date I had came from an article I read here: <a href="http://www.j5-collector.com/spotlite/apr03/main.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.j5-collector.com/spotlite/apr03/main.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I know I'm a bad speller, so I just ran the entire article through Microsoft Word spell check (lol). BTW, I just made this: <a href="../../../j/a/c/Template%7EJackson5_aab1.html" title="Template:Jackson5">Template:Jackson5</a>. You can add it to a J5/Jacksons-related page by typing: "{{jackson5}}" at the bottom right before the categories. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 20:04, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm at my wit's end in trying to deal with the glut of heavily biased and infactual articles on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, and several other pop singers. The editors' actions in making all of these articles have gone unchecked, and are establishing bad precedents that are steadily decreasing <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> coverage of music in the WIkipedia. I have talked to one of them until I was blue in the face (and had wasted an entire Friday evening) to no avail; he thinks I'm "jealous" of "his" articles.</p>
<p>Man, I'm sick of the crap. Why are we sitting here writing all these articles, when these other folks are up in here gushing about every achievement Mariah Carey and them have ever done. Normally, I wouldn't care, but the problem became an issue when seperate Mariah articles for <a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Be_There_70fc.html" title="I'll Be There">I'll Be There</a>" and such began popping up. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 06:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's up, man; I've been meaning to have this conversation with you for a while. Be careful about using language that singifies a point-of-view (a bias, a favoritism, a dislike, etc.) Wikipedia articles have to adhere to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy, and I've seen a lot of cases where you'll say things like "fantastic", "smash success", etc and so on. I've been spending time re-wording a lot of the articles, and I just wanted to give you a heads up, since I've got Mariah Carey fancruft pushers calling Jackson 5 articles out for containing POV when I raise the issue about their fancruft, fangushing, and far-biased writing.</p>

<p>All I ever do is run an internet search, cross my fingers, and hope for the best. Only a few times have I actually had to scan an album cover (<i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_to_the_Music_1c46.html" title="Dance to the Music">Dance to the Music</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/e/m/Temptations_Live%21_d9ca.html" title="Temptations Live!">Temptations Live!</a></i> are both my own). When you upload them, just select "album cover" in the licsencin box, and it will add the right tag. In the "summary" box, you should write the name of the album (link it to the article). Were there any in particular you wanted to start with? The main article could use one or two more pics, but we also need several for the album articles and (where/if covers exist for them, you know how Motown was...lol) the singles. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 23:28, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I see. And usually, I check under the search for Amazon and I think pictures of singles can be find when you google it or search under Yahoo! They're there (the pictures for Marvin Gaye albums and singles). I'll see about this tho, thanks. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrothaTimothy_b64e.html" title="User:BrothaTimothy">BrothaTimothy</a> 23:45, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The copyright holder, and</li>
<li>The copyright status</li>
</ul>
<p>The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image copyright tags</a>. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.</p>
<p>There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a> licence</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Use_83e7.html" title="Fair Use">Fair Use</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">open content</a> license like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> licence. If you have the <b>express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence</b>, use the image copyright tag: {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}}. The <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> is another choice for licencing one's work. Again, if you have the <b>express permission</b> of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The copyright holder can also release his work into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>, see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Public_domain_dedications" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for images released into the public domain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Images from certain sources are automatically release into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a>. This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. (See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#USA_public_domain_images" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for images from the government of the USA and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Other_countries.27_public_domain_images" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for other governments) However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government (See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#UK_government_copyrights" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair Use</a>. To see if this image qualifies and then how to tag it, see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any other sources of for more information see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Vandellas.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrothaTimothy_7774.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrothaTimothy">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text; otherwise, people may think you're being sneaky or even vandalizing. Also, mentioning one change but not another one can be misleading to someone who finds the other one more important; add "and misc." to cover the other change(s).

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Marvinmaster.jpg</b>.
