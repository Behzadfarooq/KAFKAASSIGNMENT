<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookfield_Academy_235a.html" title="Edit section: Founding Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Founding Era</span></h2>
<p>Founded in 1964 by a group of Milwaukee area businessmen Brookfield Academy has become one of the premier college preparatory schools in the Midwest. Offering a plurality of AP and honors courses from highly qualified teachers and staff, the Academy has earned the respect of universities world wide. Students who graduate from the Academy are consistently accepted into top schools with most graduating classes placing 10% or more of graduates at Ivy League schools.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookfield_Academy_235a.html" title="Edit section: Building on a firm foundation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Building on a firm foundation</span></h2>
<p>Long-time Academy teacher and coach Robert Solsrud was named Head of School in 1993. In 1995, as enrollment crept up to nearly 600 students, a new opportunity surfaced: the purchase of a 100-acre farm on the west side of Brookfield Road, now developed into a first-class athletic complex serving the needs of more than 700 students.</p>
<p>Despite the tremendous physical growth of the Academy, the core philosophy has not changed. In the pursuit of excellence, the Academy decided long ago not to try to please everyone, at the risk of thereby pleasing no one. With the guiding values of Intellect, Character, Truth, Individuality, and Heritage, a demanding program, small classes, and texts and materials chosen for their consistency with time-proven Judeo-Christian values, the Academy pleases many students and their parents with an unparalleled education, preparing students for college and for life.</p>
<p>As an institution dedicated to excellence in education, Brookfield Academy is continuously searching for and selecting what appears to be best in everything it undertakes. The founding philosophical pillars of classical liberal education, free market economics, Judeo-Christian monotheism, constitutional limited government, and individual freedom with personal responsibility are exemplified by the Academy's Five Stars: Intellect, Heritage, Truth, Individuality, and Character.</p>
<p>The Academy has recently completed a multi-million dollar athletic facility and is now moving on to a massive capital campaign to finance an upper-school expansion project. Also in recent years the Academy has embarked upon an endowment expansion plan that will ensure that the quality of education received by students is never compromised.</p>

<p>"I feel that since attending Brookfield Academy I have learned more so than I would have had I continued attending my previous school... ...Brookfield Academy is an incredible school the teachers are well selected. (pause) I don't think I've ever had a problem with any of them. (pause) and the students are pretty well behaved..." (a Freshman from the upper school)</p>
<p>Personal attention and flexible programming enable students to grow intellectually and personally during their years in the Upper School. Small class sizes ensure individual attention as well as camaraderie among students. Our student: teacher ratio is 11:1. Most members of the professional staff hold advanced degrees; all have a heart for educating young people.</p>
<p>A solid college preparatory curriculum challenges every student. Students are required to take English, math, science, history, foreign language, art, and music. They have the option of taking several elective courses. Advanced Placement courses are offered in English, biology, chemistry, physics, calculus, art, and economics. Reading the classic literary works of major English and American authors is also part of the curriculum, as is studying the foundations of Western philosophy.</p>
<p>Preparation for college is an important part of what we do at Brookfield Academy. Our college guidance program works hard to match each student with a college that best suits the individual's goals and temperament.</p>
<p>Brookfield Academy offers a wide range of co-curricular activities and encourages students to become involved in clubs and athletics.</p>
<p>Students are given more responsibilities and privileges as they mature. Upper School students may participate in Student Council, organize and run club activities, and captain athletic teams. Upperclassmen enjoy some open campus privileges to help them prepare for college life. Students are frequently invited to leave campus to visit educational and cultural locations in the surrounding metro area. In February, the entire Upper School student body and faculty travel off campus for three days to participate in an interdisciplinary exploration of the implications of the Five Stars.</p>

<p>Middle School students continue to build on the basics and at the same time expand their skills and knowledge to prepare for Upper School. To tap into the energy of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders, teachers use creative methods and tools, including games such as History Tic-Tac-Toe, Math Baseball, Readers' Golf, and a Latin Declension Derby. Our Middle School curriculum prepares students for success in the Upper School.</p>
<p>Brookfield Academy Middle School students complete two years of U.S. history, read and write extensively in English courses, and build a solid foundation of understanding in science and math. Whether they're creating "novels" using their knowledge of word processing and computer graphics, participating in a simulation government and economy, performing plays in drama class, or attending a two-day camp and discovering the wonders of nature and the outdoors, students learn to stretch their minds in new ways.</p>
<p>Brookfield Academy's learning environment encourages strong relationships between students, teachers, and parents, helping our students reach high goals in both academics and character development. After school, students have an opportunity to sharpen their athletic, interpersonal, and leadership skills through involvement in a variety of sports and club activities.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookfield_Academy_235a.html" title="Edit section: Lower School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lower School</span></h2>
<p>Brookfield Academy's Lower School is a Pre-K through Grade 5 program. Lower School students begin with the basics. We teach the 4 R's: Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic, and Responsibility. Students are taught to read through a phonics program that helps them understand not only how to read, but also how to spell and write. As the students begin to write, they are taught the basics of grammar and the building blocks of good sentences and paragraphs, which later serve as elements of composition. Throughout the Lower School years, students are introduced to classic works of literature. The Academy's reading list prepares students for future academic and lifelong learning. We also teach history, science, languages (French, Spanish, and Latin), art, and music. Learning activities include hands-on experiments in physical, earth, and life sciences, nature walks, trips to the theater, and visits from artists and historians. Our aim is to spark enthusiasm for learning at an early age.</p>
<p>Homework is an important part of our program throughout the school. Parents in Lower School sign their children's homework, so they're aware of their child's progress through the curriculum and can help encourage good study habits. In addition, all parents are welcome to visit classes to share special knowledge and skills with students.</p>
<p>Brookfield Academy's small classes and family atmosphere make it a friendly and safe environment for learning. The teachers are caring, and the students show concern for the needs of others. Outside the classroom, students learn to play together and build lasting friendships.</p>
