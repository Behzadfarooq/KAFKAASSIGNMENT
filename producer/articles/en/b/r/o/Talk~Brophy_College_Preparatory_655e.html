<p>Shouldn't the final section simply be "Famous Alumni," including only those who actually graduated from Brophy? Seems to me to be milking it to include those who attended for a time but did not graduate, and those who are merely related to someone famous but have not achieved their own fame. <a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJsch_cb3b.html" title="User:Jsch">Jsch</a> 01:55, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been tempted for some time to dispute the neutrality of this article. The parts of it that aren't straight facts read like a sales pitch. Passages like "Brophy teaches students not only the substance of the coursework but also how to be effective lifelong learners" and "Brophy strives to provide levels of acceleration and challenge in all sections of required courses and in the elective program" are uncited opinion. It would also be awfully nice to get a cite for the statistics given in the introduction. 'Everybody knows that' isn't enough. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksasami_31e7.html" title="User:Darksasami">Darksasami</a> 17:17, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'generally regarded` covers that. the school is indeed generally regarded as the best in AZ and west. i totally agree about those two sentences you pulled out though. sounds like a brophy catalogue and not an encyclopedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"generally regarded" doesn't cover claims such as "Ninety-nine percent of Brophy's graduates attend four-year universities." Without citation, that sounds like something somebody made up--even if it happens to be true. It's so hard to come up with NPOV information when the only people who care are faculty, students and alumni...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh goodness. I just found the source of the "effective lifelong learners" line...it IS a sales pitch. The entire paragraph is taken from <a href="http://www.brophyprep.org" class="external free" title="http://www.brophyprep.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.brophyprep.org</a> &gt; School &gt; Academics.

<p>Brophy is selective. They choose who goes there. Should it not be expected that they would have a high number of the above. And I just love the fact that Charles Keating's name is on something there. Kinda says it all, don't ya' think?</p>

<p>I attended Brophy for a year. Academically I did things there as a freshman that I didnt see again until college. Unfortunately, the bullying aspect negated the advantages. The best recomendation I could give a parent would be to save your tuition money for college. Most public schools now have advanced studies programs which would be similar to what Brophy would offer. My second best recommendation would be to at least transfer there as a junior, when most of the bulliers and the bullied have left. That is, if their parents havent donated heavily to the Brophy auction and other fundraisers. Yea, I know, a little sour grapes. But you reap what you sew, right?</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I experienced at Brophy as compared to many of my public school friends there is less bullying at Brophy than at most public schools. However, I do understand that some students do feel intimidated by some of their classmates' wealth. Brophy is a great school academically (prepared me well for my Ivy league university), spiritually, and it teachs it's students discipline, values, and ethics...things that most public schools don't really focus on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Its not just the wealth aspect, although one of the things the Jesuits taught me well is that a rich man can always do more than a poor man. It's more of a "Total Package" For example, who you know, what you (or your parents) can do/contribute (or help cover up) attitude. I know, I've been there. By the way, I also find it curious that some "less outstanding" graduates/attendees have been omitted. That I believe helps to make my point, Emphasize the positive and downplay (or omit) the negative. Congratulations, the 'Brophy Way" is doing fine. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.154.74.91_2e55.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.154.74.91">4.154.74.91</a> (talk) 00:18, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I took out the links to the Republic article and the Brophy Web site. These are hardly verifiable or neutral sources. The Republic article states, "Brophy thinks of itself as the Stanford of high schools..." which is hardly the same as saying that the Republic has called it that. In fact, if this is the source of the quote then it should be removed altogether.</p>
<p>The other link was directly to Brophy itself, which is like asking a Congressman's PR staff to write the entry for you. Find a citation published by the National Merit Foundation, or a disinterested third party, and then you can call it sourced. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksasami_31e7.html" title="User:Darksasami">Darksasami</a> 20:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does the paragraph about the wall really have to be there? It was a pathetic attempt on behalf of disgruntled students to bring down a wall that was simply making commuting from one end of campus to the other slightly more difficult. Personally, it didn't cause all that much of a stir if not a couple of laughs. Plus, the website is shotty and juvenile.

<p>Below the logo a section titled "Website" has been added that links to a web site that is obviously not the school site. Can that be corrected to point to www.brophyprep.org like the link below the logo?</p>
<p>Also, the correct enrollment for this academic year was 1265. This is the largest enrollment Brophy has ever had.</p>
<p>Under Athletics you'll find a source for the 2004-05 National High School Swimming Champions from Swimming Magazine (Aug. 2005), who determines this title: <a href="http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/articles/swimmingworld/tocs/200508-01sw_toc.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/articles/swimmingworld/tocs/200508-01sw_toc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/articles/swimmingworld/tocs/200508-01sw_toc.pdf</a></p>

This statement: "The school's web site states that Brophy historically has produced more National Merit finalists and semifinalists than any other school in Arizona and the United States, and reports that 97 percent of Brophy's graduates attend four-year institutions."</p>
<p>I have never seen the claim on the school's web site that Brophy has more National Merit Finalists or Semifinalists than any other school in the United States. In Arizona? Probably, but I don't have a source for that. And I believe the percentage going to four-year schools is 99%.</p>
