<p>The <b>Brooks-Baxter War</b> was an 1874 political struggle between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican Party</a>, nicknamed "The Minstrels", and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Liberal_Republican_Party_28ff.html" title="United States Liberal Republican Party">Liberal Republican Party</a>, nicknamed "The Brindle Tails", over the governor's office of <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>.</p>
<p>The struggle began with a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a>—the physical removal of the sitting governor—and escalated to armed conflict.

The new state constitution conferred broad powers upon the state government.

Joseph Brooks</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This state of affairs caused a great deal of resentment from native-born Republicans (known as <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalawag.html" title="Scalawag">scalawags</a>). Many were upset that state offices had gone to immigrants from the north, as well as with the questionable financial maneuvers of the Clayton government. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, the Arkansas Republican Party split in two. The new Liberal Republicans opposed Clayton and included Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson. They were nicknamed "The Brindle Tails" after their leader <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Brooks_2cc1.html" title="Joseph Brooks">Joseph Brooks</a>, who was said to speak like a brindle tailed bull. Brooks had been central in rigging the election of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> and getting Clayton elected to the governors office, but he had not been rewarded with a state job, a common practice in <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> American politics. Therefore, Brooks turned on his party. The Brindle Tails platform included a new constitution that would roll back the Reconstructionists' legislature and re-enfranchise ex-confederates. Johnson and Brooks appealed to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrats</a> and pre-war <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Whig_Party_bdd4.html" title="United States Whig Party">Whigs</a> to join, and they began gaining support among the disenfranchised and Liberal Republicans. Johnson unsuccessfully attempted to seize the governorship while Clayton was out-of-state on business.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks-Baxter_War_078f.html" title="Edit section: Compromise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Compromise</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>, Clayton lost control of the General Assembly, and they elected him to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> to sequester him from state affairs. Clayton was afraid that if he left for Washington and Johnson became governor, Johnson would immediately begin rolling back reconstruction legislation. Thus, he moved Johnson to the secretary of state position and replaced him with loyalist <a href="../../../o/z/r/Ozra_Amander_Hadley_d619.html" title="Ozra Amander Hadley">Ozra Amander Hadley</a>. This was seen by the legislature as overreaching his power, and he was <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeached</a>. The popular outcry was so great that a compromise was reached. Clayton went to the Senate, Johnson became secretary of state, and Hadley became governor. In March, the legislature dismissed the impeachment charges; Clayton left the state for the Senate, leaving Hadley as governor, much to the delight of the states most prominent newspaper, the <i><a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Democrat_Gazette_ae3a.html" title="Arkansas Democrat Gazette">Arkansas Daily Gazette</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will be a source of infinite joy and satisfaction, to the oppressed and long suffering people of Arkansas, to learn that, on yesterday, the tyrant, despot and usurper, late of Kansas, but more recently, governor of Arkansas, took his departure from the city and his hateful presence out of our state, it is to be hoped, forever and ever.</p>

Elisha Baxter</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the election of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Brooks_2cc1.html" title="Joseph Brooks">Joseph Brooks</a> ran for governor on the Brindle Tails ticket. The Claytonist Republican faction, now being referred to as "The Minstrels" (their leader, John Price, was a musician), nominated <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisha_Baxter_9799.html" title="Elisha Baxter">Elisha Baxter</a> as their candidate. They believed that Baxter, a native Unionist, could split the scalawag and carpetbagger votes.</p>
<p>During the buildup to the election and the days afterward, predictions and reports of fraud were printed daily in The Gazette. Because of the relatively slow communication of the day, messages from other counties were often delayed up to a week. There were numerous reports of anomalies in state polling centers, including names being inexplicably stricken from the voter registration and people voting without proof of registration. <i>The Gazette</i> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be as great a farce of yesterdays election to designate it otherwise that a fraud. It was one of the worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often. (Gazette #299)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, the day after the general election, <i>The Gazette</i> reported that: "The election was one of the most quiet in Little Rock we ever witnessed"<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. The returns on that day were too small to report with any certainty who had won yet, and the newspaper reported fraud. Reports were received claiming that registration had been cut short or extended in many counties to suit the needs of whoever controlled the polling places. The following Monday, <i>The Gazette</i> published incomplete tallies from the various counties showing a small majority for Baxter. They also reported more forms of attempted fraud. Some unofficial polling places had apparently been set up, but only those cast at the regular polls had been certified<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. By <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <i>The Gazette</i> was claiming victory for Brooks<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>, but by the next day, given all the irregularities and votes that would be thrown out, the projected winner had changed. <i>The Gazette</i> named Baxter as victorious by only 3,000 votes<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To everyone’s astonishment, as governor, Baxter did not toe the Minstrel line as expected. He began dismantling the corrupt systems put in place by Clayton and the Radical Republicans. He appointed honest Democrats and Republicans to the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it under the control of Arkansas, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-confederates<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, re-enfranchisement of ex-Confederates was adopted to the delight of most of the state population and the anger of the Republicans. A special election was held in November to replace 33 members of the legislature, mostly Brindle Tails, who left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, Democrats swept the election, gaining a small majority. The Republicans realized that Baxter would have to be removed from office. If they ever hoped to regain control, a coup d'etat would be necessary.</p>
<p>The political backers of Brooks and Baxter had switched. Baxter was now being supported by the Brindle Tails, re-enfranchisers, and the Democrats, whereas Brooks was finding support among the Claytonist, carpetbagger, scalawags, and the Minstrels.</p>

<p>Brooks' new supporters appealed to the friendly <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulaski_County%2C_Arkansas_c561.html" title="Pulaski County, Arkansas">Pulaski County</a> Circuit Court. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, Judge Whytock ruled in favor of Brooks on the two-year-old lawsuit. Without notifying the legislature or Governor Baxter, he swore Joseph Brooks in as the new Governor of Arkansas. With the aid of General Robert F. Catterson and state militia, Brooks marched to the Arkansas Capitol building, now known as “The Old Statehouse”, located at Markham and Center streets in downtown <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas_8f37.html" title="Little Rock, Arkansas">Little Rock</a>. They ordered Baxter to abdicate his office, but he refused to do so unless physically forced. The mob dragged Governor Baxter out of the Capitol building and onto the street.</p>
<p>By the end of the afternoon, nearly 300 armed men had converged on the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks's men seized the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tower_Building_of_the_Little_Rock_Arsenal_d703.html" title="The Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal">state arsenal</a> and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in signatures were sent to <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Grant_346b.html" title="President Grant">President Grant</a> supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegrammed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegrammed the President asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The state senators met with President Grant, and a message was sent to Brooks giving their support.</p>

<p>Coups normally result in the imprisonment of the ousted official; however, for some unknown reason, Baxter was allowed to remain free in Pulaski County. He set up headquarters in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_House_40b5.html" title="Anthony House">Anthony House</a>, three blocks away from the State Capitol. Ads placed in <i>The Gazette</i> indicated that the Anthony House continued to function as an upscale hotel during the entirety of the crisis, even though fighting continued outside, and at least one man was shot dead while standing in a window in the building<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>. Baxter issued two proclamations to the press from his temporary office, asserting his rights to the governorship by vote of the people and the decision of the legislature; both were printed in <i>The Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>There were now two armies marching and singing throughout Little Rock. Each makeshift army gathered arms and sent detachments to other cities and states seeking more<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>. It was at this point that the Baxter men retrieved “The Lady Baxter”, a cannon that had been spiked and abandoned by the Union Army and left sitting on the bank of the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_River_0bd9.html" title="Arkansas River">Arkansas River</a>. It was repaired and made ready for battle; however whether it was ever fired is doubtful. It now sits in the lawn of the Old State House on permanent display.</p>
<p>Overtones of the Civil War were evident. Brooks' men numbered 600 by this time, and were all African American former slaves who supported Republicans as their emancipators. Baxter’s men were all white Democrats. The Baxter forces continued to grow steadily during the conflict until they reached nearly 2,000<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>. Several bloody skirmishes occurred on the streets of Little Rock, one in front of the Anthony House. There was also a small naval battle on the Arkansas River, where Brooks's men attacked a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatboat.html" title="Flatboat">flatboat</a> named <i>The Hallie</i>, thought to be bringing supplies; they killed nearly everyone on board. It has been reported by various sources<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> that at least 200 men were killed during the fighting, most of whom were African American.</p>

<p>As the two continued to scramble for support in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, Grant pushed for the dispute to be settled in Arkansas. Baxter had the support of the legislature, but they were unable to convene because they could not enter the capitol building. Brooks, on the other hand, had the support of the courts, which were still controlled by Clayton, but Baxter’s men had kidnapped two members of the Supreme Court to prevent it from functioning<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that the intervention of the Federal Government was required to settle the dispute; however, the general policy of the Grant Administration was to stay out of the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who insisted that federal troops extinguish various outbreaks of violence. Grant and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Attorney_General_7e47.html" title="United States Attorney General">United States Attorney General</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Fish_fed0.html" title="Hamilton Fish">Hamilton Fish</a>, issued a joint communique stating that the State Legislature should handle the problem and ordered both armies to disband and Brooks to vacate the capital<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>After the conflict subsided, a general election took place in which the entire electorate was allowed to vote for the first time since before the Civil War. However, Clayton and Brooks, claiming support from other Republicans, announced plans to overturn the government of Arkansas and the new constitution. They also assured that if successful, similar revolutions would spread to other Southern states, which were now becoming solidly Democratic. It was to no avail since the new state constitution was passed on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>.</p>
<p>Baxter lost his reelection bid to <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Hill_Garland_0aaf.html" title="Augustus Hill Garland">August Garland</a>, who was the first Democratic governor of Arkansas in a decade. The following 35 governors of Arkansas were all Democrats.
