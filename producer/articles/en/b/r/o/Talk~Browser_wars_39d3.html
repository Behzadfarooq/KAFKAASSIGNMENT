<p>Given the fact that there has yet to be any significant IE "worm", does this really do the article justice? Blaster and Sasser spread without IE. Nearly every definition of the term "worm" indicates compromising a large number of machines without the users having to do anything.</p>

<p>Guys, the chart is completely miseading and bad. The percentage on the left only applies to IE/Win, otherwise it would look like Netscape still has a 90%+ share in the early 21st century.

<p>Re FrontPage: The current version (from 62.252.0.4) has a paragraph about about web designers not using "best viewed in Netscape" with an explanation that this was because of IE's "more complete support for web standards such as CSS" and obscures the original point about Microsoft's FrontPage producing IE-friendly HTML (at the expense of Netscape interoperability). I've reverted this comment once. In context, this is a list of advantages Microsoft exercised in the browser wars. IMO, releasing and promoting the use of a tool that generated HTML that favored one browser over another was one of the many subtle or not so subtle ways Microsoft used to kill Netscape. The effect (as was desired by Microsoft) was that some web designers stopped using "best viewed in Netscape". Could we perhaps move the bit about "best viewed in" to another place in the article and leave Microsoft's promotion of FrontPage in the list? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> 14:14, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 2 is a security related update. While it has "new features" such as the information bar, these are not truly new features as much as security related changes. Windows 2000, for example, is a version of Windows. While there are more than a couple service packs for Windows 2000, Windows XP is the new version, not Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. A new version of Internet Explorer would, in kind, be a new <b>version</b> of it.</dd>
<dd>That means that "there have been no new versions of Internet Explorer since version 6.0" is totally true. And, my above statement - "There has not been any major feature-driven update of Internet Explorer for quite some time" is also true. Service Pack 2 was not a feature-driven update. It was not a new version - if it was, it would have been called 6.1 or something. This is of course the standard versioning system in computer science, and the way I and Microsoft both describe releases of our software. Had Service Pack 2 been a new version of Internet Explorer, you would see a new version number in your about dialog.

<p>Can anyone substantiate the first and second paragraphs under history? These attribute specific motives to Microsoft that I don't know are verifiable, or even true. My impression (also probably not verifiable, and perhaps not true) is that Microsoft saw the web and the web browser as a potential threat to Windows as the dominant computer/user interface and therefore had to gain control of it (to limit its functionality and ensure the continued dominance of Windows). The point is if users spend most of their time in a browser, and browsers can run equally well on any OS, the OS becomes irrelevant. I think it's somewhat POV to make any claim about Microsoft's motives in this case (even, perhaps especially, direct quotes from Microsoft about their motives). My suggestion is to delete the entire second paragraph under history and delete the "Microsoft saw the success ..." clause from the first paragraph (leaving the sentence "Microsoft licensed Mosaic ..."). I think the facts are that Netscape was the defacto standard web browser and <i>for whatever reason</i> Microsoft decided to put them out of business. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> 19:11, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
