<p>Hi, I created an article about Lazydork, a huge internet star and you deleted it really quickly - even after I tried to dispute it on the talk page. This is really unfair. I'll repost what I wrote on the talk page since you apparently didn't bother to read it.</p>
<p>"Hello, I created the Lazydork page and was stunned to see it had been marked for speedy deletion because the subject was "unremarkable." As seen by the links I added, the Miami Herald, the Washington Post, the New York Times, MSNBC and youtube itself all disagree this is an unremarkable person. I wish I could also add a link to his live interview on CNN's American Morning. It is absurd that Emmalina would have a Wikipedia page and Lazydork would not since 1) he is an active poster and 2) has now surpassed her in popularity. His relevance to the internet video sharing phenomenon has been recognized by all outlets of major mainstream media, and Wikipedia should allow the article to stand.</p>
<p>His journey from prosecutor to internet star to professional poker player has captivated the attention millions, and deserves to be recognized on this site." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gigicat (<a href="../../../g/i/g/User_talk%7EGigicat_6356.html" title="User talk:Gigicat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gigicat_e2f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gigicat">contribs</a>).</small> 13:19, October 14, 2006</p>

<dd>HOWEVER, as I learned from bainer, the previous articles that were written on him were pretty much pure nonsense and were written by people who I have no connection to. If you would just stop and read the article I posted, it is straightforward, factual and encyclopaedic; it also refers to massive mainstream media attention given to the subject. Just please read the article you deleted and see that it is not mere puffery or the garbage that had been posted on the topic previously which is now leading you to delete it without even considering the material.

<p>Hi, I'd ask you to reconsider your deletion of this. In paticular, I think it passes 'WP:BAND' on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...) (one of the references was from the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a>; others can be provided</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. (It includes <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_White_0091.html" title="Jack White">Jack White</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore I woulde expect - although I can't claim this of course - for it to have passed the 'charted' criteria by November, when the album; whose release date I was about to add, has been released.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:27, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am neither a vandal, nor am I seeking a "Vanity Page." I completely misunderstood the purpose of Wikipedia, in that I thought that information about independent musicians was OK to include.

<dd>Well if you really can't recognise poor quality stuff then I'm not sure what I can do to help - but posting such clear encyclopedic phrases as "During the transition Apesmash dropped a couple of faces and picked up some fresh ones as Nexile, Chem, and Arom joined the victory bound team" should give you a hint. Go get some fresh air and find something better to do!

<p>Hi Brookie,</p>
<p>Yesterday i created two pages, one about Sidney De Haan CBE, the article was not opinionated and written in no way as an advert. I also wrote what i felt was a factual history of Saga.</p>
<p>I admit that in the past i created articles which, were clearly not appropriate for the site, though i feel the latest two were objective and not adverts.</p>
<p>Please can you let me know what i need to do to amend these so they are suitable?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<dd>The De Haan article was if I remember deleted by another admin as being a copyvio - which is of course a no-no. The other ones read like cheap adverts. If you read the guidelines and try again then they should be okay. I posted a Welcome message on your userpage which gives some links to policy etc. Good luck and be bold! <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 12:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please visit it and make any alterations or tweaks you feel are necessary. I have rewritten the first paragraph to deal with alternate terms - please make any redirects from those to <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flypast.html" title="Flypast">flypast</a> if you feel so minded. (and indeed, if feasible). I've also jettisoned the list format in a couple of sections (WWII anniversaries and Royal flypasts since the millennium) and gone to paragraphing.</p>
<p>Does this qualify as a "good" article? Could it be a FA?</p>

<p>My test(?) did work I suppose, but the results of the test concluded that I have failed at some task (such as helping spread knowledge to a database that did not have that knowledge before) that I would normally conjure such an action as a prudent gesture. I provided very limited knowledge (Encyclopedic content) to the page due to time constraints, and do not quite yet see the logic of removing , er, reverting submissions to nothingness with a snide little remark. I understand the need of formats, but you did not even allow this to build a format of it's own. Seeing that Wikipedia depends on the submissions, corrections, and revisions of its content, it would seem a counter-intuitive action then to delete a former un-existing submission without letting the original submitter have some time to manage when it would be a good time to vouluntarily invest time and effort on their part. I suggest by allowing this criticism to really be effective for society, maybe you should take it upon yourself to use your brain.<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoigetit_3d17.html" title="User:Noigetit">Noigetit</a> 23:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

That means it is replacable, we only allow "fair use" when there is no other alternative. Tagging it as promotional instead of generic fair use doesn't change this fact. If you believe a free licensed image of equal use can not be created then please explain why on the image talk page. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 16:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brookie, You recently deleted the page that I along with some other UCLA students and alumni created titled Matt Dodge. I understand that perhaps you may have never heard of Matt, but rest assured he borders the celebrity status on the UCLA campus. He is only a first year there but has already appeared in numerous articles of the campus newspaper, The Daily Bruin, and is very well known. Several Google searches and a little bit of research will definitely prove that the details provided are in fact true and that he is a good candidate for a Wikipedia entry. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:Mdawg414 (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUser%7EMdawg414_34cf.html" title="User talk:User:Mdawg414">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EMdawg414_def3.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Mdawg414">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I started to create an article on Alan Bryson and it was deleted before I had a chance to finish it. Then I got a comment that I'd tried to recreate it, when in fact I was just working on the page without the knowledge that it had been deleted while I was editing it. Seems unfair to delete an unfinished article; I admit I'm a newbie but it was pretty confusing - I would think the software should give me an error if I'm trying to edit an article you've deleted, but instead we got into some sort of loop. I saw (after the fact) that I was supposed to add some sort of {{hangon}} tag but didn't even have time to save a change before the page was gone and the subject "protected." Not exactly the sort of open system I imagined when I signed up. Its ok if you don't want my article, but a deletion or editing delay or better error handling might make the system less confusing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rbhm (<a href="../../../r/b/h/User_talk%7ERbhm_9a2c.html" title="User talk:Rbhm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rbhm_b2ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rbhm">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi Nikki - thanks for the note - just keep up teh good work - we need all the help we can get! When you've been around for a little longer you might like to think about being an Admin - so you get your own mop! <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 17:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Can you please help me, Brookie&#160;:)</p>
<p>I have been having issues with MartinDK for the past week involving the AfD of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chicken_and_Rice_4dc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chicken and Rice">Chicken and Rice</a> even though I been professional to his insults and have dropped the issue, it seems he will not stop insulting me until he achieves whatever he is trying to achieve. I'll try to summarize what he has been doing:</p>
<p>First he attempted to sway the AfD by personally attacking me claiming that I have violated Wikipedia policy and that my statements were bogus. <i>"AfD is a voting process. You cannot "Restate" your keep and tell everyone else they cannot vote because of it. Doesn't matter if you are in school. If you continue this way you are disrupting the voting process/AfD. People do not make reliable sources. Stop making up your own policies, they are bogus"</i>. He also makes it sound like I was forcing everyone to agree with me. All I have been doing was telling people to read my statements because I have cleaned the article of POV and added new citations.</p>
<p>Then he when I confronted him on his talk page and very politely asked him not do it again, he responded in the AfD telling people I have told him to "shut up and he is going to leave it in the hands on others" suggesting that I was not allowing him to talk. He responded on his talk page by telling me "now go away silly person". Then I brought it up with an admin, <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a>, and told MartinDK not to insult me when I was being serious. He responses on <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">Merovingian's talk page</a> and distorts things I said and then continued to insult me on his <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinDK_Archive_1_a218.html" title="User talk:MartinDK/Archive 1">talk page</a>. After I said I am dropping the issue, he suddenly trolls me on his user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinDK&amp;oldid=88188659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinDK&amp;oldid=88188659" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (the insults there are pretty personal and obvious). He clearly states that he wanted to provoke me and insult him back so he can "ban me" for trolling when I have been nothing but professional during the whole situation. Later he edited his attack to the current version on his talk page. I find the last sentence to be a direct and inappropriate attack on me. I have tried to be courteous and have already warned him twice, I was hoping for admin intervention. I did not want to ask Merovingian again because MartinDK had complemented him so that would put him in an awkward position. I was wondering if there was anything you could do about this maybe a warning for trolling?

<dd>Just to reply quickly to this one. The above is exactly the kind of incoherent rambling paranoid nonsense I gave up on to begin with. I can't even tell what his point is. Frankly I feel sorry for you. Now yet another admnin has to suffer because of his rambling on. Read his talk page. This guy even tried to convince an admin that a "no consensus" should be changed to "keep" even though the end result was the same. Needless to say the admin didn't even bother to read his incoherent nonsense. This guy is borderline paranoid.

<dd><i>I did not want to ask Merovingian again because MartinDK had complemented him so that would put him in an awkward position</i> this one in particular I like. He is implying that an admin running for Arbitration Committee can't be neutral because I complemented him. Now there is a personal insult on a highly regarded editor and admin. Just thought I would illustrate how manipulative he is. I have never posted on his talk page, I asked to be left alone. He was told by the admin to leave me alone. But he wouldn't. So I pointed out to the world how pathetic all this crap over a food-cart is. And now he is back complaining to a new admin. And so it will continue and continue and continue... So you can give me a warning (I ridiculed him to illustrate to the world how pathetic he is. It was worth it.) and you may even block me. But this guy will just find another editor to stalk and a bunch of new admins to complain to and bother with petty details such as the exact wording of an AfD decision. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for showing Brookie why you need to blocked. Why would you response on my talk page? Hmmm ... because flaming me there would be an instant block. Insulting and attacking me on your page is no different then responsing on my talk page. And stop saying you want to be left alone, I want to be left alone as well, in fact I havent said anything to you in two days. If really wanted that you would have just dropped it not attacked me anywhere. EDIT: and to clear one more thing up I did not want to ruin the relationship between you and Merovingian, therefore I did not want him to block you. Is that so hard to understand? And just to reply to "But this guy will just find another editor to stalk and a bunch of new admins to complain to and bother with petty details such as the exact wording of an AfD decision" you are the first person I have ever had an argument with. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 10:07, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

Hi, really no reason to be rude, I apologise that I am not use to the slang on this site...but just because I'm new doesnt give you any right to be a jerk: i.e. "Copyvio - as is quite clear from the deletion log!" Getting back on issue, how could ANOTHER admin delete something you already deleated? i.e. How can you delete something twice? Also, how do I fix this? How do I get this page back up and running? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Asiangrade (<a href="../../../a/s/i/User_talk%7EAsiangrade_b321.html" title="User talk:Asiangrade">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Asiangrade_2e99.html" title="Special:Contributions/Asiangrade">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Look calling people a jerk and then asking for help is hardly sensible! It was re-deleted as you had re-created it! You have to establish notability in a way that does not breach others' copyright - i.e. re-write it in your own words. Spend some time reading the guidelines which should make things clear. Learning to get on with people will get you further than being a pain!

<dd>I altered the original page before it was deleted. I don't know what content was 'spamlike' and was in the process of setting up the sources but didn't get that far before it was deleted from underneath me. It was my first attempt at a wiki on Wikipedia so forgive my ignorance. And how do you sign posts?</dd>

<p>Hi, Sorry I'm a first time user on this in terms of creating a page. Can you please point me into the direction of what criteria is needed to create a page on Wikipedia? What are the things I specifically need to include so the page won't be deleted?</p>

<p>Image:Tsigganes-Greek Gypsies.jpg, which had previously been deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Tsigganes-Greek_Gypsies.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Image:Tsigganes-Greek_Gypsies.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> on en.wikipedia as a possible copyright violation is now on Commons: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/image:Tsigganes-Greek_Roma-Gypsies.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:image:Tsigganes-Greek_Roma-Gypsies.jpg">commons:image:Tsigganes-Greek_Roma-Gypsies.jpg</a>. Could you take a look at it? I'm just not familiar with the whole suspected copyright violation flagging procedure, especially on Commons. This image looks suspicious to me--it appears to be done by a professional, and the user who posted it, claiming it was their own work, has not posted other original photographs. Given the deletion history on en.wikipedia, it seems odd that it shows up on commons a couple of months later, uploaded by a different user. I do not find it in any non-Wikipedia context on a Google image search, however.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../c/o/l/Image%7ECollinsplaque.jpg_3d02.html" title="Image:Collinsplaque.jpg">Image:Collinsplaque.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Image%7ECollinsplaque.jpg_3d02.html" title="Image:Collinsplaque.jpg">the image description page</a> and edit it to add {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}}, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>
