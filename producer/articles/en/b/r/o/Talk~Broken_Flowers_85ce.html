<p>I added the ending interp. What do you guys think?</p>
<p><br />
I don't think the article needs it. It also attempts to defeat the director's attempt to make the audience think for themselves. I'd like to see it removed.</p>
<p><br />
It is one interp, perhaps not my initial stab, but I came to wikipedia looking for other's thoughts so I was glad it was there to read and consider. After watching the DVD bonus material I had the impression that the director had intended no conclusion, that he was trying to create a Rorshock. I wouldn't mind reading more alternatives.</p>
<p><br />
That's what IMDB's message boards sections are for.</p>
<p>if anyone can find postmodern criticism for this movie, i think that would be helpful. murray definitely seems hypertragic in some ways, and the search for meaning is both futile and at some times absurd and ironic. i think that might be a good way to clean up the interpretation section -- find interpretive criticism instead of plot theory. not to diss whoever did this section first, but i think that wouldn't step on anyone's ideas for how this movie should be revealed. i think there's definitely a spot for plot speculation too, personally. 71.56.70.127 17:04, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a couple of lines onto the end- observations off of the final sequence, where "Kid in Car" played by Homer Murray (Bill's real-life son) makes eye contact with Don. Don't worry, I saved my theories for elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelord_f7ce.html" title="User:Adelord">Adelord</a> 07:11, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"as Carmen appears to have developed a lesbian relationship with her attractive assistant (Chloë Sevigny)."</p>
<p>I didn't catch that at all. This article has a tad bit of original research.<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 03:40, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They were in a Lesbian relationship. It's not gratuitous. It's more subtle - long longing touches on the thigh. I don't like the use of the word "developed" there.</p>
<p>I completely agree with the conclusion of the lesbian relationship. My suspicions were confirmed by the almost hostile manner in which the assistant returns the flowers to Don as he is leaving.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Definitely noted in the long thigh touch, Sevigny to Lange after she delived a message out in the driveway, plus her long stares. However, it could be a one-sided affection. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabuBhatt_d0d9.html" title="User:BabuBhatt">BabuBhatt</a> 08:34, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree about the hints of an attraction between Carmen and her assistant. The hints are (a) that the assistant touches Carmen after she has escorted Don to his car and (b) the jealous returning of the flowers, which were an obvious gift to Carmen.</p>
<p>It looks like Dora served grilled tofu for dinner instead of fish as per the plot summary.</p>
<p>Another possible (weak) clue is that Carmen's office has a painted portrait of boy with a dog. This painting appears behind Don's head in some closeups. I say weak because the dog isn't Winston and Carmen's office has another painting, of a girl with some cats. So the paintings may be pure office decoration.</p>

<p>I do not think the various 'ending interpretations' are appropriate for wikipedia. This movie is very vague, and there could be millions of personal interpretations. Too much speculation here.

<p>So there are at least two of us. I have removed the section again. If you are able to source any of it from outside Wikipedia, then it can go back. It doesn't matter how many people contributed to it here, if it is original research or speculation, it simply cannot go on the page. If you find any sources, then you can dig the section out of History and put it back in. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 22:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is just a movie. A movie article is not obliged to reference Maltin and Ebert for every sentence (it could). The section's text is collaborative, converging and generally enlightening. Weasel words could be avoided, but what for? The sole problem is created by a controversial "wikipedian" who brought absolutely nothing to the article otherwise. Go clean the article about JFK death conspiracies.82.120.114.161 01:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, what a strange comment. First, what do you know about whether someone just joined or not? WP:NOR says nothing about movies. It is allowed to attack actions of a contributor, this is not a personal attack (Crculver does not have any significant content on his personal page, so it would be difficult to comment on him <i>personally</i>). Crculver is controversial - look at his Contributions page, and he brought no content - look at the Article history page.82.120.120.72 10:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you look at the Talk pages of people who have complained on my Talk page, you will see that they themselves were warned for vandalism or violation of other policies. As for bringing "No Content", I've brought plenty of content to Wikipedia in my three and a half years here to many, many articles, but the removal of something that violates WP:NOR or any other policy is just as productive an edit as adding something. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 11:19, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section clearly violates WP:NOR as is. If any portion of it can be cited, it must.

<p>A reminder: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is an <i>article</i> policy, which does not apply when voicing opinions on non-article pages. If you'd like to create an account and post your opinion of the article on your user page, that's fine. If you'd like to discuss it (within reason) on the article talkpage, that's also fine. Articles are any public-facing page, category, or template. Anything else you're free to voice your opinion within reason (see the rules for the specific area). I suggest a compromise of moving the interpretation section of the article to this talkpage and allowing people to compare interpretations interactively. Thanks! <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 23:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have been reading and re-reading WP:NOR, and I just cannot find any reference to movies, and more generally art, inside. Maybe this should be made more specific? Or let's take another route: IMHO interpretations of a movie's meaning cannot be "original research" because research concerns exploring a reality, objective and accessible to several people, while a work of art is mostly subjective and personal. It is actually quite a miracle that several people were able to put together a section which is (was) internally consistent.</p>
<p>Overall, I have the impression that the topic discused here does not really have an official policy.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I am pretty sure that people wanting to brutally remove such content are, pardon my french, nothing but common-law assh*les, who use Wikipedia rules as a pretext to exert agression towards other people.</p>
<p>Maybe there should be a specific "movie reviews" wiki site, where interpretations can find a home? A "talk" page talks about the article, while we need to talk about the subject of the article. But it is better than nothing. 82.120.123.78 01:56, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipediatrix has asked me to have a look at this debate. Frankly I don't understand why there's a mediation at all - the situation is plainly that of a user wishing to add his own <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If it was based on a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> source such as a published critique by an established film critic, I don't think there'd be any problem. However, an anonymous unpublished critique plainly doesn't qualify. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the anon's critique simply doesn't belong in the article. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 09:56, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipediatrix must have misrepresented the reality to you (which often happens when trying to get somebody's support or sympathy), but you could have checked the article's history before making a judgement. There is no "anon unpublished critique". The section in question has been written by many people, over a period of several months, many of them using regular usernames, and it constitues a very substantial part of the article's body (and by far its most interesting one). All that happened recently was removal and restoration of content written earlier. Geez... 82.120.123.78 11:28, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
