US Marine Corps M1917 Brodie pattern helmet</div>

<p>The <b>Brodie helmet</b> (also called the <b>shrapnel helmet</b> or <b>Tommy helmet</b> and colloquially as a "tin hat", and in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> known as a <b>doughboy helmet</b>) was a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel.html" title="Steel">steel</a> <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmet.html" title="Helmet">helmet</a> designed and patented in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> by John L. Brodie.</p>
<p>During the first year of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, none of the combatants offered steel helmets to their troops. The soldiers of most nations went into battle wearing simple cloth caps that offered virtually no protection from modern weapons. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> troops were wearing the traditional <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather.html" title="Leather">leather</a> <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickelhaube.html" title="Pickelhaube">Pickelhaube</a>, also of little protective value.</p>
<p>The huge number of lethal head wounds that modern weapons were inflicting upon the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Army_282d.html" title="French Army">French Army</a> led them to introduce the first of the modern steel helmets in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. None of the steel helmets introduced during this era were intended to protect against bullets, but were primarily aimed at reducing headwounds from shrapnel. The first French helmets were bowl-shaped steel "skullcaps" worn under the cloth caps. However, these rudimentary helmets were soon replaced by the Model 1915 <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_helmet.html" title="Adrian helmet">Adrian helmet</a>, (designed by August-Louse Adrian). It replaced the traditional French <a href="../../../k/e/p/Kepi.html" title="Kepi">kepi</a> and was later adopted by the Belgian and Italian armies. At about the same time, the British <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Office_e75c.html" title="War Office">War Office</a> had also seen a similar need for steel helmets.</p>

<p>The War Office Invention Department was asked to evaluate the French design but they decided that it was not strong enough and was too complex to afford swift manufacture. The design submitted by John L. Brodie offered advantages over the French design as it could be pressed from a single thick sheet of steel, giving it added strength. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> first utilised the helmet in September of 1915 but it was not until the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> that the helmet began to be issued to British troops in large numbers. It was first used in battle in April of that year at the Battle of St Eloi. Troops from other countries in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> also used the Brodie helmet as did the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Armed_Forces_b778.html" title="United States Armed Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> when they entered the war in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. The United States Government initially purchased some 400,000 helmets from Britain. From January <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> the US Army began to use helmets manufactured in the US and these helmets were designated M1917.</p>
<p>The helmet had a shallow circular crown with a wide brim around the edge, a leather liner and a leather chinstrap. The helmet's "soup bowl" shape was originally designed to protect the wearer's head and shoulders from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fragmentation.html" title="Fragmentation">fragmentation</a> falling from above. The shallow bowl design allowed the use of relatively thick steel that could be formed in a single pressing while maintaining the helmet's thickness. Although this made it more resistant to projectiles, the design offered less protection to the lower part of the head and neck than other designs. The steel helmet was known to the troops as a "tin hat" or for the officers a "battle bowler" (from <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowler_hat.html" title="Bowler hat">Bowler hat</a>) and, with typical <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_humour.html" title="Black humour">black humour</a>, a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a> was sometimes called a "tin opener".</p>
<p>The original design (Type A) was made of mild steel with a brim 1.5–2 inches wide. The Type A was in production for just a few weeks before the specification was changed and the Type B was introduced. The Type B was made of hardened <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manganese.html" title="Manganese">manganese</a> steel, had a narrower brim and had a more domed crown. In May <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> the Mark I began to be issued. The Mark I had a matte finish textured with sawdust or crushed cork to prevent reflection. The Mark I was issued in large numbers and saw out the rest of the War. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> the liner was modified to include a <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber.html" title="Rubber">rubber</a> cushion to make it more comfortable (this was not adopted for the M1917). Helmets were often painted with unit insignia towards the end of the war, and are often called "parade helmets" by collectors.</p>
<p>The basic Brodie-patterned helmet was used by the U.S. Army until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> with minor modifications, including a totally new liner and canvas chinstrap. This basic design was used into <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, until finally completely superseded by the <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_Helmet_333b.html" title="M1 Helmet">M1 Helmet</a> in 1942. The Brodie pattern continued to be used (as the slightly modified Mark II) by the British and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces throughout World War II. During this period, the helmet was also used by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_e109.html" title="British Police">police</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_brigade.html" title="Fire brigade">fire brigade</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Raid_Precautions_22bd.html" title="Air Raid Precautions">ARP</a> wardens in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>. There was also a "civil" pattern available which was a little deeper but made from ordinary mild steel, and which was available for private purchase.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the British replaced it with a significantly modified design known as the Mark III. Many collectors today refer to this helmet incorrectly as the "turtle" helmet. This was a deeper helmet with a smaller brim and provided 38% more protection than the Mark II, particularly at the sides. The Mark III helmet was issued primarily to assault troops for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a> in June 1944, and a large number of helmets from British stocks were issued to the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Canadian_Infantry_Division_eb6b.html" title="3rd Canadian Infantry Division">3rd Canadian Division</a> in addition to British units. Small numbers also went to the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_Canadian_Infantry_Division_b81c.html" title="2nd Canadian Infantry Division">2nd</a> and <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Canadian_%28Armoured%29_Division_199d.html" title="4th Canadian (Armoured) Division">4th Canadian Divisions</a>, and all Mark III helmets in Canadian stores were returned to the British at the end of the war.</p>
<p>A Mark IV helmet was issued after the war, very similar to the Mark III, but with the rivets holding the chinstrap to the helmet placed much higher up on the shell. There were also other differences in liner details.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> the British replaced steel helmets with <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">kevlar</a> ones.</p>

<p>Brodie helmets are still being used today, most notably by the Pakistani army and up until just recently, by the Israeli Civil Defense forces. The steel shells of these helmets are most likely WW2 British surplus, with domestically manufactured replacement liners. It is safe to say that this design has enjoyed the longest duration of use in military history.</p>
