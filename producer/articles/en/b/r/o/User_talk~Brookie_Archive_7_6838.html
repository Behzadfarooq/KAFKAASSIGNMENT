<p>Corduroy were a 4-piece acid jazz outfit based in London, Corduroy released three eclectic albums on Acid Jazz Records and then moved over to Big Cat Records. Several singles from their 1993 album High Havok charted in the U.K. Top Ten. (they've never had a top ten hit in the main chart, and I wonder like So/Honeyroot had this had a nob box left on it too???)<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.166.17.214.html" title="User:195.166.17.214">195.166.17.214</a> 14:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I am wiriting to inquire concerning <b><a href="../../../c/a/m/Image%7ECambridge_Seven.jpg_d515.html" title="Image:Cambridge Seven.jpg">the picture of Cambridge Seven</a></b> that you uploaded about a year or so ago. First, do you know the <b>author or source</b> of this picture? And secondly, what is the <b>reason for this picture being released into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a></b> (cuz the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Public_domain" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">copyright tag</a> there is obsolete)?</p>
<p>I ask all these since I uploaded this picture to the Chinesse Wikipedia yesterday and it is now being chanllenged (and is under the voting process) for deletion due to unkonwn source and unclear copyright status. Therefore I want to ask you for your kind assistance to provide the information if you happen to have it. I think the copyright status is a greater concern to the adminstrators of the Chinese Wikipedia since copyright laws in some Asian countries are not the same as in the US. Thank you for your gracious contribution of this picture and wish you have a wonderful and enjoyable vacation! --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Chen_a5ec.html" title="User:Will Chen">Will</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Chen_999e.html" title="User talk:Will Chen">Talk</a>)</small> 03:15, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Brookie, I wonder if you can assist? I have just recieved a telephone call (on our consumer advice line)from a chap pretending to be contacting me from Wikipedia.co.uk and complaining because I have twice removed his link spam from a category.</p>
<p>He said and I quote "you are preventing me from doing my work so stop removing my links" Incredulous I know! I informed him that the links had been removed because he is simply spamming on behalf of a commercial IVA lead finding company. He has since continued to add the links and I have removed them but I am assuming that there must exist an easier method of stemming such activity?</p>
<p>The pages in question are below:</p>

<p>What exactly is your objection re: notability to <a href="../../../s/o/_/So_%28band%29.html" title="So (band)">So (band)</a>? That they had only one album, one moderate hit single? They were not a huge act, but they did have a radio single in the US in the 80s.</p>
<p>As for notability, what's your threshold? They were releasing music on a major label, after all, not just making CDs on their home PCs like folks can do now.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETaniwha_931e.html" title="User:Taniwha">Taniwha</a> 16:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They don't sound notable to me - quite the opposite in fact: and as you detail their mediocraty above! Also - please sign your edits. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 15:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>First, it's "Mediocrity" you meant to type. Second, the fact that their US album as a sideproject didn't break gold, but had a radio single, hardly makes it 'mediocre'. The album was successful enough to be in the top 40 during its release in the US charts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are plenty of bands without big hits, or one-hit-wonders who get pages on Wikipedia. There are also plenty of non-notable artists who haven't exactly changed the face of music, who continue to have pages on Wikipedia. I'm really just asking if you track 'em all down and question their notability on their pages. If you're looking to remove artists who had record contracts but were not notable, you must be very busy.</dd>

<dd>For that matter, I see you've queestioned the notability of the band The Opposition, which was SO in another guise... do you feel that their number of albums are not enough, or they haven't had big enough hits, or...? If you're wanting it deleted, just put it up for a vote, no? I'd even see it reasonable to merge the SO page with the Opposition page. But together, the band has had a long career. If you feel that's mediocre, that's your choice, but they have had, you know, actual record contracts.&#160;::<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETaniwha_931e.html" title="User:Taniwha">Taniwha</a> 16:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Brookie, Thank you very much for deleting Big Royal Dig Article and Talk Page at 08:02 this morning. I am writing to you because this has been a traumatic, devastating and humiliating experience for me. I am in tears as I write, and I never thought I would feel that way in producing work for wikipedia, which has given me joy.</p>
<p>I would like you to read {<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scott_Wilson#Big_Royal_Dig_deleted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scott_Wilson#Big_Royal_Dig_deleted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scott_Wilson#Big_Royal_Dig_deleted</a> this], which is my note of today's date to Scott Wilson, who really showed utter bad faith and inimicality in his dealings.</p>
<p>I won't rehearse the whole thing again because you will find it both there and on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Team_4e18.html" title="Talk:Time Team">Talk:Time Team</a>.</p>
<p>Mainly, I am writing to you because I would like you as an administrator to warn Scott about this behaviour. I hope and intend to write more; I have asked him not to read or edit my work again. I now feel scared and inhibited. I am sure that he will not be above repeating these bullying actions again.</p>
<p>Please would you do whatever you can as an administrator to ensure that he is reprimanded under whatever machinery exists for this. I consider that he robbed me of the joy of producing a new article - and it was a sparkling one (I'm not in the business of turning in pallid works). He also robbed me of a readership by killing the article with a merge proposal while it was being written and then slamming the proposal on again as soon as the article was completed.</p>
<p>Something is wrong somewhere. It's utterly unethical behaviour and I'm tremendously saddened and damaged by the whole saga (sorry, still crying). Please take this as an official complaint. I was given a fight or flight option by a hostile reader, showing a complete lack of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a>. I never want him to touch my work again. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 13:20, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> - thanks for the note - I will go and have a look at this user and see what's what.

(Stephen has also asked me why the deletion on my Talk page. I will refer him to my remarks elsewhere.) Scott of course has shown no remorse - not that I care - dismissing the deletion with an "it's done now." He would have carved the article up and watered it down into <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Team_bfdc.html" title="Time Team">Time Team</a>. I am not sure whether his true objection was political or whether he resented the fact that it had been written at all.</dd>

<p>Hi Brookie - when you get a chance, would you look over the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Page_naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">page naming conventions</a> for disambiguation, to see how links such as the ones in <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Masters_a7c1.html" title="Ian Masters">Ian Masters</a> should be constructed? In short, the hyphen is not necessary, and parenthetical descriptions such as (songwriter) should not be capitalized. I'm already working on fixing the old edits, so don't worry about those, I just wanted you to be aware of the style guidelines in the future...

<p>Dear Brookie - I'm the one you helped with Big Royal Dig deletion. I would like to ask you to delete a very recent redirect of <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flypast.html" title="Flypast">flypast</a> to <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flyby.html" title="Flyby">flyby</a>. I did not make the redirect, but I highlighted the word "flypast" in all its appearances a few months ago throughout the encyclopaedia, intending to write an article on it.</p>
<p>That time has now come - this weekend, I am going to write a very full article on flypast (mainly ceremonial) with many links. However, the very recent redirect has stopped me using that word as a title. It just happened over the last couple of days. Please could you delete the redirection or propose the deletion for me? Please reply to my talk page on this matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could also add that I will probably propose merging the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flyby.html" title="Flyby">flyby</a> stuff (which has been an unsatisfactory stub for a long time) into the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flypast.html" title="Flypast">flypast</a> article which should be much more fun...although, actually, what the US understand by flyby is NOT equivalent to flypast, which has a more ceremonial connotation - hence my upcoming article.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help, and for comforting me the other day. By the way, I've just been accepted on the City of London Guides training course given by the Corporation of London, and am starting it on 4 Oct. Best wishes. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 00:53, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Brookie please read in conjunction with the above. I wondered if I should for the moment call the article "Ceremonial flypast" - which means I could at least get it written. Then I would ask you to do a disambiguation page, and I would propose the deletion of [flyby]. ( I consider that article to be just a definition, which does not meet Wikipedia's standards for an article. It has not really been worked on for a while.) Then we could rename my article flypast, which is what it really is. But I would prefer the redirection to be deleted ASAP. I have read about deleting redirections and I understand that an early deletion of redirections is preferable, before people get confused. Please reply at my talk page and thanks again. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 02:02, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Brookie, Hello - you will remember me from the ill-fated Big Royal Dig article. Finally I have made a good start on writing Flypast, which we discussed a while ago. Please refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FClef/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FClef/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">my progress so far</a> and let me know your impressions on my talk page. I would value your input. Please note the article is an incomplete draft.</p>
<p>I would also like to refresh your memory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Brookie#Redirect:__flypast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Brookie#Redirect:__flypast" rel="nofollow">my enquiry</a> and remind you of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FClef#Flyby_etc" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FClef#Flyby_etc" rel="nofollow">your reply to me</a>.</p>
<p>I expect to finish this article soon. When I do I will take the following two steps: 1. I will call it "Ceremonial Flypast" as we agreed. 2. I will propose merging "Flyby" into it.</p>
<p>I would then hope that you would 1. take the actions we have previously discussed, culminating in changing its name to Flypast.</p>
<p>2. Please also put a watch on the article so that I do not undergo a malicious merge or deletion suggestion as happened with Big Royal Dig.</p>
<p>I will write again as soon as I've finished the article. In the meantime, please reply to my Talk page. Thanks for everything. Hope you have had a happy autumn equinox.

<p>Hi Brookie,</p>
<p>Thanks for your recent message.</p>
<p>I was having some difficulties understanding why the Simon Malian article keeps getting listed as not citing relevant sources? There a three main claims within the article - (1) that Simon Malian is the founder of the Foundation which is evidenced within the cited radio interview, (2) that he completed his education at the University of Technology, Sydney which is evidenced within the cited alumni profile and (3) how the Foundation came about which is evidenced within the cited radio interview.</p>
<p>Is there something I am unaware of?</p>
<p>I appreciate your guidance.</p>

<p>Dear Brookie - Thanks for your message on my Talk page. I have now done around two-thirds of the article. It is turning into a much bigger thing than I thought!</p>
<p>Please take another look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FClef/Sandbox#Special_flypasts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FClef/Sandbox#Special_flypasts" rel="nofollow">the draft so far, starting from WWII anniversaries - the 60th anniversaries</a>. I appreciate your copyediting changes and hope to complete this weekend. - another 3 sections/subsections to be written.</p>
<p>Regarding your changes so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>thanks for the copyediting.</li>
<li>I'm not sure about the header change ("Examples of flypasts" made a section with subsections). Perhaps we can review that once it is finished, for these are probably sections, not subsections.</li>
<li>the beginning - when I inserted the pic I deleted the words "Ceremonial Flypasts" the copy below it is not the first section, it's the article header. "Ceremonial Flypasts" will be the interim title once it goes live!</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the photograph, do you prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Golden_Jubilee_Palace_43.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Golden_Jubilee_Palace_43.JPG" rel="nofollow">the one I've used</a> or is <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:ConcordeBG.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:ConcordeBG.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a> better?</p>
<p>When ready to go live, I will let you know. If you give me a local time - British - I will start the new page with the "Ceremonial Flypast" title and import the copy from my sandbox. You could then do any final editorial tweaks and immediately take the requisite actions to rename it "Flypast". (Early this Sunday evening will be good for me - between 1800-2000 hrs. - is that OK for you? - let me know please)</p>
<p>This has been a special situation because of the pre-existing redirect which is my article's title. I would like to thank you again for letting me do this under your <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegis.html" title="Aegis">aegis</a> and for straightening this out. (reply please to my Talk page) Best wishes. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 14:38, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have deleted the existing flypast article with its redirect - so you can just recreate as your new article with that name - this save us having to try and match our times at the computer - and it achieves the same end. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 16:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi and thanks for minor layout change and syntactical change as well. I have posted <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flypast.html" title="Flypast">flypast</a> on Wikipedia, as it is already quite substantial. Will add to it over the weekend. You're right - the second photograph is better. Can you increase the size of it? I've tried unsuccessfully to do so, but think I am not understanding the instructions at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_4162.html" title="Wikipedia:Images">Wikipedia:Images</a>.</dd>

<p>Hey Brookie, I was sure who to turn to, but I feel that JDoorjam recent action is "questionable" I didnt take it up with him yet because i dont want to start unnecessary problems with an admin unless I am certain he has violated a rule.</p>
<p>He recently speedy deleted an article which did not fall into the category for speedy deletion. The article was a serious non advert article on pornographic actress <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_Ashley_77a7.html" title="Brooke Ashley">Brooke Ashley</a>. He deleted this article without an AfD debate which I felt was necessary. The deletion log shows that it is <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> who deleted her (even though it does not show on his contributions). I have evidence to supporting her notability as well. She is one of the few adult entertainer who contracted HIV and formerly holds a pornographic record. Her name brings over 110,000 hits on google, she has an article on German wikipedia, has AVN article <a href="http://www.avn.com/articles/236349.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avn.com/articles/236349.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and has been referenced (mentioned) by <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Ford_6a4b.html" title="Luke Ford">Luke Ford</a> <a href="http://www.lukeford.net/luke_ford/clips/clips.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lukeford.net/luke_ford/clips/clips.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.lukeford.net/luke_ford/clips/clips4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lukeford.net/luke_ford/clips/clips4.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 08:12, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I would like to put JDoorjam through a Wikipedia administrator recall since I feel his violation is a repeated offense. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 16:54, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Simply added data about me from an existing link that was created by someone about a project that I am executive producer for; i.e. to remove the RED link that exists for me.</p>
<p>Please reconsider leaving data that I submitted.</p>

<p>You say that the trivia section is unencyclopedic? I agree that it's not paper-encyclopedic. However, you should know <b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki_is_not_paper.html" title="Wiki is not paper">WIKIPEDIA IS NOT PAPER</a></b>.

<p>Hello, again. I was wondering about re-creating the teensay.co.uk site, again. If I can make it more "neutral" and cut down on the advertising and so on, will you let me do it? Thanks again.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That would be better - but you do need to establish notability - can this be done? - read the Wiki guidelines. I suggest you create the article first in your sandbox <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrillz_Teensay_033f.html" title="User:Trillz/Teensay">User:Trillz/Teensay</a> to get it up to speed first. The article is currently protected against re-creation - so let me see it first and I can unblock it if necessary. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 09:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, I get that it was under a different name, but it has met all the damned requirements, I see nothing wrong with it. I would have waited for a response by yourself, but that took too long, so I decided to make do with what I could. The article was fine, it met the criteria, I say you should let it be reposted.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why not follow the advice above and when you think it's okay go to the three or so users who had marked it before and get a view on it? This way you get to develop your article without constantly fighting fires with it - and when it's good it comes back alive? I have created you a sandbox - see above link - give it a go&#160;! Also, please can you sign your notes with a ~~~~? <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 14:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
