	    <p><b>Brotherhood of War</b> is a series of novels written by <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._Griffin_8b7d.html" title="W.E.B. Griffin">W.E.B. Griffin</a> about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> from the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> through the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. The story centers around the careers of four US Army officers who were lieutenants in the early 1940s. The series is notable for the amount of attention it <i>does not</i> devote to combat—rather than skipping forward, it follows the main characters though their peacetime service as the Army evolves in the forties, fifties and sixties, particularly in the development of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_aviation.html" title="Military aviation">Army Aviation</a> and the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Forces_0f3a.html" title="Special Forces">Special Forces</a>.</p>

<p>Craig Lowell is an extremely wealthy <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> drop-out who was drafted and sent to the US occupation forces in Germany. Because of his <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo.html" title="Polo">polo</a> skills, he was assigned to manage a polo team for the commanding <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a> "Porky" Waterford. Since he was essential to the general's team and a game against the French could only be played by officers, Mac MacMillan figures out how to get him commissioned before the game. When the general dies at the end of the polo match, the Army doesn't know what to do with him so he is sent off to be an adviser to the Greek Army in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Civil_War_e2ef.html" title="Greek Civil War">Greek Civil War</a>. Lowell takes command of a large group of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> forces and is eventually awarded the medal of the Order of St. George and St. Andrew. Lowell is a superb aviator and a de-facto <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Beret_a5a2.html" title="Green Beret">Green Beret</a>.</p>
<p>Lowell's escapades with women often nearly cost him career, and his last affair with a wife of an Air Force POW in Vietnam sees him immediately retired. His administative skills, along with his planning ability and superb leadership abilities, make him an invaluable asset to almost every unit he is assigned to.</p>

<p>However, this friendship with Craig Lowell often works against his career. His career is very nearly ended in Korea due to his being charged with murder. He is subsequently acquitted of the charge with the help of testimony given by Craig Lowell, but they are both branded as troublemakers.

<li>One minor point is that when receiving landing instructions, winds are often reported as "negligible" The correct terms would be "calm" or "light and variable". Also in "The Majors" clearance to land on "Runway 45" is given. Runways can't have a number higher than "36" for a heading of 360 degrees is the highest possible.</li>
</ul>

This was skillfully pushed aside, however, in the three novels written after "The Generals". However these three books were set before the last book.</p>
