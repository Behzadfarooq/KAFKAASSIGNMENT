<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Cowboys"</span></h2>
<p>It's incorrect to say that Ennis and Jack are cowboys. Cowboys work with cows. Ennis and Jack met on a sheep operation, which makes them shepherds. This is a very annoying meme that shouldn't make its way into Wikipedia. I am going to change that in the main article. Chris64.131.157.221 20:23, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why not just say ranch hands? That's pretty much what they do as far as I can understand. After all, the men are not shepherds by trade. They're general labourers who work with cows, sheep, laying asphalt, whatever work they can find. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustADuck_4c5a.html" title="User:JustADuck">JustADuck</a> 20:27, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They were NOT "shepherds." If you want to say they herded sheep in the summer of 1963, fine. To call them "shepherds" as if that was their permanent job is ludicrious. I could settle for ranch hands, but not shepherds as an introductory description of them. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 20:40, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, "A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others." The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, anonymous, unsigned person, I do know what a shepherd is. However, that term was being used as an introductory, defining adjective for these two men, which is as ludicrious as defining you now, and in an overall way, by the job you held in the summer of your nineteenth year. It isn't that anyone was disagreeing that they were sheep herders at age 19; it was that we were disagreeing that "shepherds" was an appropriate introductory descriptor of these two men who are the protagonists of a movie that spans twenty years. I have no objection though to how this issue was resolved. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 17:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a "rodeo cowboy" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris64.131.157.221 19:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Except now there's no place to link to the Wikipedia article on shepherds, which most definitely is the most relevant article. I'll let someone else add the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepherd.html" title="Shepherd">shepherd</a> link if they want, since I seem to be in a minority here. I do know what I'm talking about in this particular case, though, unlike certain other commenters. Chris 19:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Didn't they call themselves "Cowboys" in the movie? The Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboy.html" title="Cowboy">cowboy</a> says that rodeo performers are called "cowboys", and "The long history of the West in popular culture tends to define those wearing Western clothing as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not." "Cowboy" has meanings beyond the precise definition. I do not think calling them cowboys is incorrect or even a stretch. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 20:22, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lets see what Proulx herself had to say on the subject:
<dl>
<dd>"Excuse me, but it is NOT a story about 'two cowboys.' It is a story about two inarticulate, confused Wyoming ranch kids in 1963 who have left home and who find themselves in a personal sexual situation they did not expect, understand nor can manage."<a href="http://www.planetjh.com/testa_2005_12_07_proulx.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.planetjh.com/testa_2005_12_07_proulx.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So per Proulx, they should not be called cowboys. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger">Autiger</a> 21:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, but the quote goes on to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Yet both are beguiled by the cowboy myth, as are most people who live in the state, and Ennis tries to be one but never gets beyond ranch hand work; Jack settles on rodeo as an expression of the Western ideal."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>No point arguing, "Two poor young men who meet on a sheep herding job" is a good solution. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 22:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a petty and pointless argument, in my opinion. I don't think it's inacurate to call them cowboys, given their upbringings and work choices in later life (not to mention the way they dress). <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 02:17, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ah, thanks for the link showing what Proulx has to say about this. I think that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are not intended to be cowboys, since she's the one who created them. I think the current version, "Two poor young men who meet on a sheep herding job," with a link to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepherd.html" title="Shepherd">shepherd</a>, is a very good solution. I'm just glad this counteracts the very wrongheaded, misleading, and anti-Proulx meme about "gay cowboys." Chris 64.131.157.221 08:26, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In a making-of-the-movie feature, the actors repeatedly refer to their characters as "ranch hands".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV?</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, this is my first post on Wikipedia, so forgive me if I am doing this incorrectly or am stepping out of line, but I question the NPOV of this article. In the "Praise and Controversy" section, it references "commentators Bill O'Reilly and Cal Thomas, accusing Hollywood of pushing an agenda while telling their viewers that the Christian themed Narnia has more merit for "best picture of the year." I fail to see how Narnia is relevant to the article at hand and the statement was obviously written in such a way as to be persuasive or to make a point. Also, in the links section, perhaps links to some of the sources of this controversy?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah it is a bit off somehow. I think it makes it out to be more successful than it is too. It's doing alright, but after reading this article I got the sense it was this enormous blockbuster or something and wondered why I've heard little of it. It's really not unusual for a smaller film, as this one is, to have higher per-theater sales. The way it's word is slightly misleading somehow.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 08:54, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you and the previous anon commentator are talking about the same thing but I'm not really sure since you only use pronouns (without any context reference). The anon seems to believe the O'Reilly <i>Narnia</i> reference is off-topic and included merely to push an anti-<i>Brokeback</i> POV attempting to minimize its success. You seem to be talking about <i>Brokeback</i> itself. The film continues to maintain high per-theatre box-office numbers even as it expands its theater count - this weekend saw it pull in almost $12K/screen compared to Narnia's $4400/screen and Kong's $3600/screen. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 15:48, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is written in the most neutral voice possible. I think the person who claims it is not NPOV may be taking issue with the opinions being deescribed in the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Praise and Controversy"</span></h2>
<p>I'd simply like to go on record as saying that the division of this section may be a serious mistake. Giving the "controversy" its own category is rather unnecessary, especially when many of these sections are no more than a few lines in length (or in the case of the Concerned Women, a single piece). Furthermore, it seems to add more to the notion that the film is really more debated than it is, or that a serious "problem" continues to exist. A reversion to the initial format would be far more appropriate. - AWF</p>

<p>I'd like to add information or a section on the widespread effect this movie appears to be having both within the gay community and, to a leseer degree, outside of it too. I don't want to overstate the case at all, but I think it would be worth a shot to try and describe quantifiable, sourceable effects it's had - i.e., increased number of blogs about the film, quotes from published articles that give context, that sort of thing.

<dd>I don't know how you would be able to source facts that were quantifiable and not speculative. The fact that the film has received much attention in the gay community was to be expected and I don't think that that in and of itself constitutes as 'cultural effect'. Similarly, I imagine <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_%28film%29.html" title="Philadelphia (film)">Philadelphia</a> would have generated much interest when it was released, but quantifying the effect that it had is more difficult. I don't have any suggestions unfortunately, other than to suggest that you discuss any proposed changes here first so as to avoid potential edit wars.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Awards noted upfront?</span></h2>
<p>Hmmm. Mention of this movie garnering a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_Award_e2c2.html" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a> upfront, despite their importance, appears rather unbalanced and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">perhaps too Americentric</a>. Precision of this sort isn't required in an introduction: the movie has garnered more than a dozen awards and nominations worldwide, which are listed further down in article. I recommend replacing this notation with either "acclaimed" (point taken) or – actually, in retrospect – merely "award-winning." Thoughts? This isn't a big issue, BTW. Thanks!

<dd>The Golden Globes aren't exactly "Americancentric" since they are given by the Hollywood Foreign Press. And it's by far the most prestigeous, recognizable award given to the film so far. If the film wins an Oscar, than I would think we'd change the introduction and include that note instead. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 17:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even the lead for the GG article indicates they are American awards. I'm not challenging their importance or rationale for selection, but merely that such a statement upfront might obviate or occlude the plethora of other awards and acclaims the movie has garnered around the world. And, while this varies, movies like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schindler%27s_List_e7d2.html" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, et al. are not as precise upfront regarding the awards they've received ... though I'd be easier about noting an Oscar if BBM received one.&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 17:38, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Acclaimed", your proposed change, is actually rather POV as an adjective for the film but we take care of it in the next line with "critical favorite" which is more factual. It's ironic that you would call the Golden Globes "American-centric" considering that Americans don't vote for GG winners, the non-American press does. I think the fact that BBM is a GG winner is important enough for the introduction and I'm one who believes absolutely in streamlined and not-overly-detailed introductions. For all the awards that BBM has won, the GGs are by far the most important and noteworthy so I think they merit inclusion in the intro. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 17:50, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also think that, like the rest of the article, that intro can be changed as the situation warrants. For example, I expect next Tuesday "Oscar-nominated" will replace "Golden Globe-winning" in the intro, which would be entirely appropriate IMO. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 17:57, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See above regarding "acclaimed" (point taken) – in retrospect, the preferred term is "award-winning". The overarching point here is to better <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balance</a> the introduction and note that the movie has received <i>many</i> awards, not just one albeit important one; this is something the introduction still doesn't account for. As for if it'll win an Oscar, that's a point of view I'm unwilling to concede just yet. &#160;;) E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 18:07, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>&gt;Brokeback Mountain is an award-winning 2005 film directed by Ang Lee. The film, which has been a commercial success and critical favorite, stars Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and Randy Quaid. Its frank depiction of a same-sex relationship, including its physical and emotionally romantic aspects, has generated praise as well as some controversy.</dd>

<dd>I guess my issue with that version is that many, many films have won awards. Pretty much every film critics' society in any municipality gives out an award. All kinds of little film festivals give out awards. You might as well take out any qualifier for "2005 film" if you're going to say "award-winning." It doesn't mean much. (Did it win an award for best adapted screenplay from the Toledo Critics' Association? Who knows?) Noting that it is "Golden Globe Award-winning," on the other hand anchors the film as having won a particular kind of acclaim and puts in a particular, unique category. That being said, if BBM had won some relatively minor category in the GG, it wouldn't need to be in the intro. But the GGs are the biggest award ceremony so far this season and BBM won Best Picture-Drama. That's an important enough fact about the movie right now, January 27, to include in the first graf. We can put this to a vote if you want.</dd>

<dd>Yes: many films have won awards, but even fewer have garnered ones of global note ... as BBM has. I wouldn't expect just any article to note that, however, or upfront. And note that all of the awards/nominations are noted below – including multiple GG awards? – and I believe an upfront mention of one can dually anchor the intro and obscure it. This isn't a huge issue (i.e., a vote is unnecessary), though – upon perusing, the GG mention merely leapt out at me as being too specific/focused for an introduction.

<dd>True: my concern was in having <a href="../../../t/m/i/TMI_d259.html" title="TMI">TMI</a> in the introduction – many awards and nominations are noted below. Prior notation of the GG award (in the first sentence) leapt out at me as awkward and unbalanced (I'm trying to objectify the topic matter). You'll also note above, however, that I'm more comfortable with noting an Oscar award/nomination vis-à-vis others in the introduction: it currently reads fine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Love and Lust, Two separate fields, in Plot Section</span></h2>
<p>I’ve edited the main page’s plot section to reflect that loving someone of the same sex is not frowned on by most, it is lust. Loving people of any sex has never been a question, it’s lust and sexual act, so please stop removing the edited sentence of, “Through it all, Ennis and Jack struggle with societal and family pressure, and their own fears that prevent them from fulfilling the lust and love that captured them both during their first summer together.”</p>

<dd>Love is a general term and in context to the plot, lust would be more appropriate. A mother can love her children and there is zero lust, along with two friends of the same sex. Lust is in question and is a more fitting word in the sentence used in the plot section.</dd>

<dd>Calling same-sex love impossible is YOUR POV, based on your assumption that two people of the same sex can't fall in love, which counters what we know about sexual orientation and which would make us ignore the many millions of long-term gay relationships on this planet. Obviously the two are not in platonic love, such as the love a parents has for a child; don't be insulting. Your "review" above (now removed) makes clear your agenda.
