<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:WSU 1916 Rose Bowl Team.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, ie in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{gfdl}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you can claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> use {{fairuse}}.)

<p>If you have uploaded other images, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.
