<p>Hi! Welcome to the broom closet. &#160;:) Protecting pages is easy. You now have some extra tabs at the top of your page, one of which reads "protect." All you do on the article is blank it and replace the text with {{deletedpage}}. That'll place the template, but you still need to protect the page. Click on the "protect" tab and the admins-only protect page pops up. Give the reason for protecting and click the "protect this page" button. You'll have to hit the "back" button on your browser to return to that protect page. From there, click on the link of "list of protected pages" and add the page in question to the bottom of the "pages protected against recreation" section, or whatever section is most appropriate. Boom! No more "27 deleted edits" or equal nonsense clogging the works.</p>
<p>Call on me anytime. I'm flattered that you chose to ask me for advice, by the way. - Lucky 6.9 21:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created a new template, {{deletedmiscpage}}, which should work better than {{deletedpage}} for non-article pages (and should avoid the creation of "talk talk" pages). --cesarb 15:43, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Paul here from Sharplands. Just a quick note to say I've made a start on a website for Grendon, www.grendonvillage.org. I've accidently removed the word "prototype" from every page, I need to add that back in. If you have any problems viewing it please let me know, I've tested it on several different browsers/machines and its looks fine.</p>
<p>As you and others in Grendon are active members of Wikipedia it seems fitting that you might want to add some content to the site. Let me know if you are...</p>
<p>At the last Parish Plan meeting Jon Newman volunteered to setup a website as no one was told I'd already been asked to create one! We're meeting up on Sunday so we don't duplicate effort and come up with some sort of plan. If you wish to be contacted in the near future let me know via email, see the link on the front page of the Grendon website for Paul Mooney.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, Paul.</p>

<p>I have just been reading the latest thread regarding the commercial status of Payplan. Payplan are not a non profit making organisation and are part of Totemic Ltd. Totemic also own a commercial mortgage broking business amongst others.</p>
<p>(see: <a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/d29b3ca0ce357a61b33d3aa03f8ec906//compdetails" class="external autonumber" title="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/d29b3ca0ce357a61b33d3aa03f8ec906//compdetails" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)</p>
<p>True not for profits operating in the the free debt advice arena include Consumer Credit Counselling Service <a href="http://www.cccs.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cccs.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> , Christians Against Poverty <a href="http://www.capuk.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capuk.org/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, Advice UK <a href="http://www.adviceuk.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adviceuk.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, Myvesta UK (<a href="http://www.myvesta.org.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myvesta.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>and Citizens Advice <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Payplan were for many years called Federated Credit Limited (Shaws Insolvency) and exist on a commercial basis by providing Individual Voluntary Arrangements and dealing in corporate insolvency matters for Ltd companies.</p>
<p>They also offer a debt mangagement plan service where they receive a % (ish) debt recovery fee from contributing creditors similar to the way that commercial debt collection firms are remunerated.</p>
<p>Payplan deal with unsecured creditors only and as I understand do not get involved with the direct management and intervention with priority creditors (such as council tax, magistrates court fines etc - the difficult stuff!) as is the case with the CAB for example.</p>

<p>Hi there, dear Brookie! Indeed, I loved your picture of those beautiful swans a lot - it is so moving. The first time I saw it I just went staring it with a silly look in my face - you know, that "aaawwwwww..." expression?&#160;;) As you see, I liked it so much that it was my choice to greet my friends for Valentine's day, as it conveys such a pure expresion of tenderness that I preferred it over any other images I could find. As I consider you from now on as my friend too, allow me to send you a belated hug and the wish that you had a beautiful Valentine's day yourself. For that marvelous pic, a big big "Thank you!" I hope we talk again soon. Kisses! <i><b><a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedriel_2584.html" title="User:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">Phædriel</font></a></b></i> <font style="color:navy;">♥</font> <i><sup><a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">tell me</font></a></sup></i> - 22:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's good to hear from you always. That's a great picture. I tried to get in touch with you for a chat a couple of days ago but, there was one of those rare blocks. I mean I could edit everything except your talk page. Some dumbnut nominated <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norma_Candal_62ec.html" title="Norma Candal">Norma Candal</a> for deletion, however it turned out a fast Speedy Keep. You know how it is sometimes. Anyway it's great to hear from you, we'll keep in touch.

<p>You'll probably get a bunch of these pileon thanks... we've never worked together but I just wanted to say thanks for sharing the swan picture with Wikipedia, it's really neat! What's cool about neat pics is that sometimes they get used in ways their creators don't expect, and by taking it and sharing it, you've enabled a really wonderful person to brighten the day of <b>many many</b> editors. So thanks and best wishes.

<p>Hiya, remember me? (discusssion re payplan, etc?&#160;:) As you're also into financial stuff, could you give me your opinion of the multimedia links being added by User:Seantyrer? My feeling is that they're well meaning, but somewhat over inserted. I did leave a message on his page, which he's replied to. I'm not overly happy with the tone of his last reply, so am going to leave it for the moment. *sigh* (I don't remember inserting payplan links, btw, when you removed them, I remember explicitly not re-adding them, but asking you why instead. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:33, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, me again. I see you've removed the link in the Bankruptcy article. While I do think it's over inserted, I don't think it's commerical (the web site has "Not-For-Profit" plastered all over it). So while I agree with taking it out, that's propably not the correct reason to give, especially if you see the history, it's been in and out several times (also mentioned in the talk page, from the last time) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 19:19, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I believe that your blanking the Jack Thompson article borders on vandalism, and as I do not know the policy for dealing with this when an administrator is the one doing the vandalizing, I will be seeking out Informal Mediation as per WP:Resolving Disputes. This has been discussed in Talk:Jack_Thompson, and as I have said there; in the interest of civility and good faith I will be waiting 48 hours before going forward with the Dispute Resolution process, in order to give you adequate time to respond to our concerns and ideally reach some sort of consensus without requiring any sort of third-party intervention. I hope that you can get over your "boredom" and deign to acknowledge and address our concerns on the Talk:Jack_Thompson page. I would also appreciate if you would not delete my comments on your user:talk page, as it makes it look like you are attempting to cover up legitmate criticism of your actions.

<dd>&lt;Sigh&gt; Oh please grow up and move on - my changes were superceded some time ago and there have been 13+ further edits since then by other users, I have accepted that and moved on - now you should do the same!

<dd>Fine - But you still havent gave a reason as to why you blanked the page (aside from "cruff" and "advertsing")<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanC_3430.html" title="User:IanC">IanC</a> 20:47, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The page was not ever "blanked" by me - but rather large and tedious chunks edited - what you lot are moaning about was a good faith edit of a tedious article which I am quite entitled to make; if others don't agree then they can (which they have) supercede them - so no damage done by them- however attacking such contributions made in good faith is itself bad faith and then hounding those contributors just because they're an admin is in my view a personal attack.
<dl>
<dd>But - After you removed these sections and someone came and put them back, you then came along again and edited them again - Thats why people thought your where blanking the article.</dd>

<p>psssst - be careful with calling users childish, it might fall under WP:No Personal Attacks. makes me wish there was some kind of private message function here, i didn't really want to make this a public message. Nortelrye 22:49, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah they should implement one. Ill remove my childish attack (well it is really aint it?), though he could still see it via history. IanC 23:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
