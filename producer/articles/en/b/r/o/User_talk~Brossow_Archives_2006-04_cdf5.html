<p>I noticed that you recently edited a page on my watchlist, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Middle_School_Science_Bowl_44fc.html" title="National Middle School Science Bowl">National Middle School Science Bowl</a>, using the <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>. I myself use the AWB but I usually check such automated edits when I see them to make sure they abide by <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html#Rules_of_use" title="WP:AWB">AWB's rules</a>.

The first rule (and the most important) is to "check every edit <i>before</i> you save it." The AWB is a program, not a human, and it can sometimes make unnecessary or incorrect changes. In the above-referenced edit, I can tell you were probably using a regex to redirect links from <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_28d2.html" title="General Motors">General Motors</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Corporation_a513.html" title="General Motors Corporation">General Motors Corporation</a>. The AWB, as programmed, also changed mdashes from the little code to actual dashes. However, it malfunctioned, as you can see very well towards the bottom. I will bring this error to the attention of other editors, but, please, check <i>every</i> edit <i>before</i> saving.

<p>One question however: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28schools%29_15e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools)</a> states that "school article titles should use the full official name of the school <i>as provided by the school itself</i>." If you take a look at the Stony Brook web site, <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu" class="external free" title="http://www.stonybrook.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.stonybrook.edu</a>, the name that the school supplies is very clearly "Stony Brook University". I'm not opposed to the move, but I'm left wondering whether it was correct. â <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the other hand, the school's seal clearly gives the full name as "State University of New York Stony Brook." Looks like they're providing it both ways, unfortunately. I'd also note that http://sunysb.edu (clearly short for "State University of New York at Stony Brook") also is a valid URL for the school. Further, a WHOIS lookup on both domains lists the first registrant as "State University of New York/Stony Brook" (stonybrook.edu) and "SUNY at Stony Brook" (sunsyb.edu). Adding to the issue is that both registrations ALSO list Stony Brook University on the registration, but the first line in each registration is SUNYSB. Even though the "marketing ploy" change you noted above may have been considered vandalism, I think the point the editor made is valid and the Stony Brook U. moniker is much more a marketing name rather than an official name change in the state university system, if you see the distinction. <b>â <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 16:22, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Despite the information in the WHOIS database, the name that the school publicly provides is most definitely "Stony Brook University". Also, regardless of the assumed of the name, is it appropriate for us to decide the name by which the school presents itself? If it chooses to refer to itself as "Stony Brook University", and the students and public come to be familiar and comfortable with that name, who are we to say otherwise? â <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite: the "University Marks" section lists both. Given that the school appears to use the name "Stony Brook University" preferentially over the older "SUNY Stony Brook", and given that it's the name by which the university is known among the students, parents, and faculty, and given that it's the name that's used self-referntially not only on the web site, but on most other forms of written media, I propose that we consider "Stony Brook University" to be the official name. â <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 16:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Howdy. Thanks for working on the AAU page, but please do not change n-dashes to hyphens as an n-dash is the correct punctuation to use in, say, the University of WisconsinâMadison.

<dd>As someone with a degree in English education, I'm aware that the en dash is the "correct" punctuation. However, as a matter of practicality I changed it to a standard hyphen in order to streamline the page and remove several bytes of data. A drop in the bucket, perhaps, but it all adds up and 99.7% (an actual factual number I made up on the spot) of all readers would never notice the difference. My changes make the page load faster and take less space in the database; your preference is technically correct. It makes little difference to me but thought I'd at least explain my reason for the edits. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 01:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently the above-cited page either linked or contained a template that linked to one of those pages. I'm currently using <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">AWB</a> to edit links to those pages to avoid redirects, either by piping or entirely replacing links depending on context. As a side effect of this process, articles with links to these articles also are having Unicode characters inserted in place of things like &amp;Phi;, excess white space removed, categories and interwiki links sorted, etc. Hope that clears things up! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 03:06, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, apparently not--I see I was looking for a category rather than thinking about what the template was doing. Thanks for fleshing this out; the edit summary is rather opaque and your earlier message didn't really succeed in making things clear (to me). Since no templates got changed, it seemed rather confusing (well, still does, but I'm sure it makes sense somehow&#160;:). I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.

<dd>If there's no consensus, then there's no problem, right? Typographic quotes don't always display correctly for all users on all platforms and all browsers, whereas "straight" quotes generally do. Further, in my edits I have encountered several examples of an opening quote being of one style and the closing quote the other, and/or a micture of quote styles throughout an article, both of which create a "messy", unprofessional appearance. Therefore, as part of much more significant edits I have chosen to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and make this change in articles I edit.

<p>Hello - think of this as me, knocking your door, asking for your vote and or support. A young user has indicated that he would like to merge the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Alliance_4c59.html" title="Renault Alliance">Renault Alliance</a> article into the Renault 9 article. I feel that the two should be seperated because the Alliance is an imprtant vehicle due to its business strategy for AMC.

<p>You recently made some cleanup changes to the <a href="../../../g/_/_/G.html" title="G">G</a> article on 25 March 2006. One of those cleanups, although typically a correct one, was in this case wrong. Specifically in the Codes for Computing section you changed some "<tt>&amp;amp;</tt>" markup to just "<tt>&amp;</tt>".

<dd>Sigh... I'm not going to ask this on the talk page, but honestly, where does this "free-for-all among school articles" rhetoric come from? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 03:10, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's what it amounts to when there's a guideline in place that affects an entity that can reasonably be known by a number of different "common" names with no reasonable way to reach consensus. It's one thing for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a>, who is universally known as such. But schools and universities can be known by a number of different, equally valid names. The best way (IMHO, obviously) to resolve this is to provide strict guidance with regard to article naming. Redirects will bring people searcing for any of a variety of common names to the actual article, and the title of the article will be as correct as possible â something I think should be a goal for <b>all</b> Wikipedia articles â according to the school itself. When a school has (for example) "Leland Stanford Junior University" on its seal and its diplomas, I think its beyond arrogant for anyone to suggest that they are, in effect, "wrong" and subsequently name the article about that institution with an abbreviation of its proper name.</dd>
<dd>Plus, I'm really having trouble figuring out why you and Jesuschex are so all fired up about what a school article is named when there's no dispute that it is the correct, official name of the school. Sigh all you want, but thus far I'm the only one (again, IMHO) involved in the discussion who's presented an actual explanation with several examples of why I think the naming convention should be one way instead of the other. You and Jesuschex have ignored virtually all of my reasons and just keep throwing up the "common name" argument, which I feel is invalid in this situation. And for that matter, the <b>only</b> reason he's involved in this is because he's bitter about losing a page move vote on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon%27s_Rock_College_of_Bard_d0bb.html" title="Simon's Rock College of Bard">Simon's Rock College of Bard</a>.</dd>
<dd>I really am about done discussing this, as I've given about as much explanation and reasoning as I can on the topic. I'm not fond of arguing, and although I enjoy rational discussion quite a lot, there's not much of this taking place and it's a real drain. I think it really is time we step back and let the rest of the community have its say. It's quite clear that neither of us is going to change the other's mind, so I think we need to give it a rest and agree to disagree. Ultimately it's not going to be up to either of us to make the decision. And it should go without saying, but there's nothing personal in any of this and whatever the outcome I assure you there'll be no hard feelings on my part; I hope you feel the same. <b>â</b> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow"><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#333399">B.</font><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#000066">Rossow</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow"><font color="#993300">Talk</font></a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow"><font color="#FF6600">Contr</font></a></sub> <small>03:38, Saturday [[April 8]] [[2006]] (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small>

<dd>I'm all fired up because I object to your tactics. You moved Stanford without discussion, when from Nightstallion's talk page you already knew that such moves are controversial. You and Nightstallion both profess a disdain for <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a>, but you make no effort to challenge that guideline on its talk page. Instead you adopt some other guideline no one has heard of as your battle standard, and you confine your arguments to a talk page watched by approximately three people. You dodge direct questions by claiming they have been answered. Now you wonder why I'm frustrated?</dd>
<dd>I understand that people make mistakes. <i>Oh shit, guys, sorry, I thought that was policy, and I was supposed to interpret it by myself.</i> Instead, when I pointed out your error, you got all holier-than-thou about established guidelines and reverted almost everything I did, claiming you were justified in personally moving Stanford until other users got involved. Even after that, and even now, you demonstrate no regret over your actions. So, no, I don't feel the same. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 05:05, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry you're frustrated. I'm sorry you didn't know about the then-guideline. But I certainly do not regret my actions. Page moves following a posted guideline (which <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28S%29_f775.html" title="WP:NC(S)">WP:NC(S)</a> was at that time, until you changed it, whether or not you like it) really don't require permission. NightStallion's move at my request was done as an admin, who also read the then-guideline, agreed with it, saw no problem with it, and consequently performed the move, which I would have done myself without asking had the move not been blocked by a history on the target page. If you're bitter and/or frustrated about this situation, then I humbly suggest maybe you could take a step back and get a good night's sleep. Let the community decide if the guideline is a good one or not; you've made your effort. There's been absolutely no harm done, aside from a considerable waste of several people's time because a couple guys have their undies in a bundle over the name of an article or two, as if people would never be able to find those articles now that they bear the proper names of their respective schools. At last count, the "vote" was 3-2 in your favor on the naming convention, hardly a landslide showing but perhaps a small comfort as you get some rest this evening. Have a good night. <b>â</b> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow"><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#333399">B.</font><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#000066">Rossow</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow"><font color="#993300">Talk</font></a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow"><font color="#FF6600">Contr</font></a></sub> <small>05:14, Saturday [[April 8]] [[2006]] (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small></dd>

<dd>Wow. That's quite the attitude you seem to have; it's rather ballsy for someone with fewer than 200 edits to lecture someone with considerably more experience about avoiding a revert war. Sorry you didn't care for my addition, which is a VERY common misinterpretation of the term. The source for this new addition is my father, who spent 13 years as an editor at a major regional newspaper before getting his doctorate in mass comm and teaching at a major university for the past 22 years. So yeah, there are an infinite number of things for which the term may not stand, but the omission of this one was a considerable oversight IMHO. No need to take that kind of tone with me. And if you don't like my changes to the punctuation (which I never said were "corrections," BTW) then, by all means, go right ahead and change it back. And while you're doing that, go ahead and pare down the list of things for which <i>sic</i> doesn't stand, if it bothers you enough to gripe about it on my Talk page. Sheesh. (Having said that, I'd note that you didn't seem concerned about the length of the list when you made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sic&amp;oldid=40691586" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sic&amp;oldid=40691586" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>.) <font color="grey">â</font>&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow"><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#333399">B.</font><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#000066">Rossow</font></a>&#160;<sup style="margin-right:-11px"><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow"><font color="#993300">talk</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow"><font color="#FF6600">contr</font></a></sub>&#160;<small>[[Monday]],&#160;[[April 17]],&#160;[[2006]]&#160;@&#160;02:53&#160;(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small></dd>

<dd>Thanks. I'm really not worked up about it. Really. It just seems heavy-handed and exceedingly rude (IMHO, of course) for a newbie admin (Jan '06) to delete a page that's clearly under construction, marked as "in use," etc. It would be one thing if the page had been there for weeks with no action, but I had <i>just</i> created the page and was in the process of working on it when it disappeared. Frustrating, but I'm ignoring it for now and will approach it from a different angle when things have settled down. Sometimes you just need to let people have their way, even if they're wrong.

<p>Please turn off automatically alphabetizing categories in AWB. That turns a nicely ordered list of categories, ordered by say theme, so that the list of categories it is more managable, and turns it into a random list.

<dd>Please turn it off. Sportspeople categories are much more managable when the categories are listed thematically. Date of birth category paired with living people category/date of death, this makes it easy to see if those required categories are there without have to hunt for them. Keeping together a sportspersons teams that they have played for so that you can add any missing ones, or update them as neccessary, there are many reasons for such a group that alphabetically plainly screws up.</dd>
<dd>And if the ordering is a personal preference as you assert, then you shouldn't be mass editting many different articles ruining the order that already existed just to enforce your personal preference. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 20:56, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's be perfectly clear: I'm not making edits to enforce my personal preference. The alphabetizing of categories is a "bonus" to the other much more significant edits I'm making. I see your point about grouping categories one way, <i>your personal preference</i>. In editing categories, whether for sports or for any other topic, I find it easier to look alphabetically rather than searching through a list grouped, as it appears to me, near-randomly. Looking at the edits you've made to <i>my</i> edits, I honestly find it harder to find a given category using your "system." Consequently, while I appreciate your point of view, I don't agree with it.

<dd>You're deluding yourself if you think everyone is going to agree with every edit on WP. What you're suggesting is that your personal preference is more important than mine.

I do, and so do a LOT of other people. I dare say it wouldn't be an option in AWB if many others didn't find this to be the case.

<dd>Actually I am not, because I am not the one going to hundreds of pages and enforcing my personal preference, you are the one who is changing existing pages to your own personal preference.

I am saying that you should not enforce your personal preference, I am <b>not</b> saying that you should enforce my personal preference, I am saying that you should leave it alone. I don't care if the articles that you spend time editting by hand you order the categories your way, because you are editting that page, and that helps you edit the page.

<dd>And how exactly do you know which articles I would or would not edit? And how does scale factor in? Your perspective is that your random-seemign order is better; my opinion is that alphabetical order is better. I fail to understand why you believe your opinion, your <i>personal preferences</i> to be of greater significance than mine. You're enforcing your personal preference by reverting my edits no less than I am by alphabetizing in addition to other edits that benefit WP. IMHO, alphabetizing categories benefits WP and makes it easier for others to edit. You disagree, and while I find that unfortuante, I have absolutely no plans to change my preferences just to keep you happy. I'd further recommend that you stop reverting my edits â for the <b>sole</b> purpose of enforcing your own personal preference â in order to prevent an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>. I have no intention of engaging in one, but sometimes I'll touch an article more than once with AWB for various reasons and yes, the categories will be re-alphabetized. I don't think you'd want to find yourself in violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> simply to prove a point or push your personal preferences on everyone. <font color="gray">â</font>&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow"><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#333399">B.</font><font size="4" face="Brush Script MT" color="#000066">Rossow</font></a>&#160;<sup style="margin-right:-11px"><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow"><font color="#993300">talk</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow"><font color="#FF6600">contr</font></a></sub>&#160;<small>[[Sunday]],&#160;[[April 30]],&#160;[[2006]]&#160;@&#160;21:48&#160;(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small>

<dd>Obviously we both have different opinions on this matter. Your solution is that you continue to enforce your personal preference on every article. My solution is that you leave articles in the condition that they were in. (I reverted maybe 5 of you hundreds of edits, and have since stopped.) This will make everyone happy (except apparantly you), because articles that are alphabetized will stay that way, and articles that have a different structure will stay that way. If you want to alphabetized the articles that you do much editting to by hand then that is fine because it will help you edit. Let me reiterate (because you seem to have gone back to this) I am not enforcing my personal preference, I am asking that you not enforce your personal preference on hundreds of articles at a time, there is a big difference. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 21:57, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
