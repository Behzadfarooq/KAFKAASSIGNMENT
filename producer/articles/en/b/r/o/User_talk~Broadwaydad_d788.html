<p>Hello, I have a concern about a possible, threatened deletion for Chelsea Opera Organization. It seems the most important objection as been lack of references. However there are several footnotes that are verified nicely this opera company and their work. Their website is first rate. However as I look around the Wikipedia site, I find many small opera companies that do not list any references, and some not even their own website, yet they have not had any threats of deletion. Example is the Muddy River Opera Company that I reasearched and the Lancaster Opera company that has been listed by another Wikipedia contributer in trying to get information as to why this deserving group is even being consideref for deletion. They are young, but well supported by the public, and New York higher ups, in their work with young people and the USO care packages and other public service endeavors. This is exactly the type of small company that Should be part of Wikipedea. It seems to be a concern also of unfair treatment by one of the Editors of Wikipedia and I hope you can perhaps step in and bring some reason and clarification to the ongoing discussions. Thank you sincerely,<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 06:28, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not taking any sides, but may I ask just who the editor giving "unfair treatment" is? <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 19:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, Mr. Darcy has claimed that we need certain things done that doesn't seem to be required on other pages of groups such as this one. Such as references and more. But I will move ahead and see if we can get past this with a bit of work and trying to clean up this article. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 01:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, instead of fighting Mr. Darcy, who is correct. please take the time to tag all the articles that don't meet the standards, so they, too, may be fixed. The references and more are required of all articles, and there's no need to get past them not being required of others, because they are indeed. Mr. Darcy is only one person, if you're finding articles that need attention, tag them, please. Thank you. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 04:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, MrDarcy is simply doing his job, both as a Wikipedian and an Administrator. There is no need to use personal attacks. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 19:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My apologies, I was the one who posted that information. I only posted it on the discussion page to answer the question asked of me to show proof of Chelsea's incorporation. I didn't realize this is "solociting".. never entered my mind. PLease understand I am new to this and with all the information to try and sift through, it's impossible to know all the "rules'. I will cease all editing on Wikipedia, if you wish, so no more mistakes will happen.. Sorry..<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 18:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am closing my account, The stress is just too much for me, and I just don't seem to be able to be a help in this journey to try and do something positive. I don't want to cause any problems for anyone of these good people who have worked so hard on these pages. I will depart immediately from editing on Wipikedia. My best to all and good luck everyone. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 18:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Broadwaydad (great name, by the way!). I see you have been having some trouble getting started here. I would hate to see you leave, since you seem to want to contribute to Wikipedia in a positive way, and we need all the help we can get here! If you have any questions at all, please feel free to call on me for help. We were all new once, and I remember how unsure I was about everything here when I started. Once again, welcome, and don't stress about little mistakes on the road to happy encyclopedia editing. Sincerely, <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 19:09, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Thank you jeff for your kind words, but I think it's best I depart. Being new and not even knowing that I cannot delete an account,(just found that out on the Help page) I realize I just don't know enough of how things work here. I walk on eggshells everytime I edit or even put a message on the discussion page. Seems it should't be that way, however it's a tough world we live in, even via our computers. It truly is very stressful when one does their best and results in what so often has been the case. So I leave the work here in the hands of more capable, and clearly more intelligent folks.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 19:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, if you do change your mind, please drop me a line on my talk page. You managed to bump into a crabby editor, who was reminded to <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">be gentle with newcomers</a>. Sorry 'bout that. Like I said, I'm here if you need any help, so don't be shy. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 22:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
==Jeff==I want to tell you again that your kindness is appreciated. If only this were the rule instead of the exception. The climate here is not one for anyone unfamiliar or inexperienced. The world is already far too hostile and chilly, and to find it here is very disheartening indeed and not something I or my family expected when we signed on. The best of luck to you and continue, perhaps you will make a difference. I will visit this site, however I will not be contributing again.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroadwaydad_b373.html" title="User:Broadwaydad">Broadwaydad</a> 12:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
