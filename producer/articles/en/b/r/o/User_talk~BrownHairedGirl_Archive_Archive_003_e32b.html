<p>I've seen it on an article you had worked on before. I know the website; very good idea to use it on Wikipedia. And regarding the 'advertisement': Sláinte! <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoe_4759.html" title="User:Phoe">Phoe</a> 17:49, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I have to inform you, that your template does not always work. To search in the NPG archives, the template uses the article's name, however Wiki writes names in other forms than NPG: normally we don't use middle names, don't abbreviate baronet or don't add honorics, so the links the template creates lead to no result. Perhaps you can change the code to the effect, that the name is'nt taken automatically, but you have to enter itself: instead of {{<a href="../../../n/p/g/Template%7ENpg_name_f638.html" title="Template:Npg name">npg name</a>}} also and as example {{npg Peregrine Andrew Cavendish, 12th Duke of Somewhere}} <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoe_4759.html" title="User:Phoe">Phoe</a> 19:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Phoe, I'm the one who should be sorry! It's my fault for not pointng you towards the instructions, which are at <a href="../../../n/p/g/Template_talk%7ENpg_name_b783.html#Instructions" title="Template talk:Npg name">Template talk:Npg name#Instructions</a>.</dd>
<dd>Using those, I deployed the template as follows: {{npg name|id=70093|name=Peregrine Andrew Morny Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington}}, which creates this efect:

<dd>P.A.M. Cavenish isn't a great example, because there is only one portrait of him, so the template is possibly overkill for him (it might be easier just to link conventionally to the one picture), but a few other examples show the template deployed more usefully:

<p>Just to let you know, I changed the Parliamentary and London Assembly consituency links you placed in the article to Holborn and St Pancras and City and East respectively. I am sure <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farringdon%2C_London_9bd6.html" title="Farringdon, London">Farringdon</a> isn't in the borough of Islington, it is a parish of the City and is situated in the appropriate admin districts.

<dd>Hi Sandy, I'm afraid that when it comes to constituencies, it's unwise to assume&#160;:( Constituencies do not rigidly follow local authority boundaries, and the constit links have usually been added by someone who has checked. I didn't actually add those links myself, I just bypassed the redirects, but I have just checked and they were accurate.</dd>

<dd>Hi. Aha. But Farringdon Lane isn't in "Farringdon", it is in Clerkenwell (just as Finchley Road isn't in Finchley, or the numerous "London Roads" which appear around the home counties aren't in London!). Farringdon Lane is a small street linking the end of Clerkenwell Green to Farringdon Street. Farringdon St itself only runs <i>through</i> Farringdon, but it doesn't all lie within it - indeed that street goes right down from Blackfriars up to King's Cross, and all of that area isn't by any stretch of the imagination in Farringdon.</dd>
<dd>I live in the immediate area and I am sorry but I am still not sure I agree with you on this one. The only area that can sensibly be called Farringdon is the area of the old parishes of that name, which lie in the City of London and not in Islington South and Finsbury. On the other hand, as you say, constituencies don't follow other admin boundaries... --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 13:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I note that following the link to the statutory order you helpfully linked to, it clearly states that all of the City of London is in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency. No exception of the parishes of Farringdon, and no mention of same in the definition of Islington South &amp; Finsbury. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 13:50, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, I thought maybe a re-check was going to point away from Islington, so I looked at <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&amp;X=531750.700879219&amp;Y=181750.028160976&amp;width=700&amp;height=400&amp;gride=531630.700879219&amp;gridn=181840.028160976&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=GB&amp;addr1=&amp;addr2=Cowcross+Street&amp;addr3=london&amp;pc=&amp;advanced=&amp;local=&amp;localinfosel=&amp;kw=&amp;inmap=&amp;table=&amp;ovtype=&amp;keepicon=true&amp;zm=0&amp;out.x=7&amp;out.y=5&amp;scale=5000" class="external text" title="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&amp;X=531750.700879219&amp;Y=181750.028160976&amp;width=700&amp;height=400&amp;gride=531630.700879219&amp;gridn=181840.028160976&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=GB&amp;addr1=&amp;addr2=Cowcross+Street&amp;addr3=london&amp;pc=&amp;advanced=&amp;local=&amp;localinfosel=&amp;kw=&amp;inmap=&amp;table=&amp;ovtype=&amp;keepicon=true&amp;zm=0&amp;out.x=7&amp;out.y=5&amp;scale=5000" rel="nofollow">Cowcross St</a>, which the map shows splot beside Farringdon Station. I checked out 32-33 Cowcross Street EC1M 6DF, and <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/commons/postcode/search/l/EC1M+6DF.html" class="external free" title="http://www.upmystreet.com/commons/postcode/search/l/EC1M+6DF.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.upmystreet.com/commons/postcode/search/l/EC1M+6DF.html</a> puts it in Islingston South+Finsbury.</dd>
<dd>However, the map shows the boundary running along Charterhouse St, so maybe it depends on the definition of "Farringdon". If a substantial chunk of the Farringdon area is south of Charterhouse St, then may be the other constituencies should be added? But Islington S+F shouldn't be removed unless you are defining Farringdon as being all south of Charterhouse St. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 14:05, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I am concerned Farringdon is/was parishes of the City of London - always has been, always will be - and all of the City of London lies in the Cities constituency. <i>BUT</i> I accept that most people would consider that Farringdon Station lies within the area which would be considered "Farringdon" these days (though it would seem the station doesn't lie in the actual parish of Farringdon, rather in Clerkenwell). So perhaps both constituencies should be listed? --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 14:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi BrownHairedGirl,<br />
No, I contacted you because you had edited one of the affected articles (maybe Dignity?), and I wanted input from potentially interested parties before restructuring the topic. (What I want to do is split the topic into [1] a general article, with the list of denominational terms/organizations from the existing article, and [2] a UU-specific article to consist of the first and last sections of the current article. Then the various denominational articles can link to the general article rather than (as is now the case) having all other denominations pointing to UU. I'm also hoping for some sort of consensus on what the best title for the general article would be, and (especially if the general article is titled "Welcoming Congregations") what the UU article should be renamed. If you have opinions or suggestions on this, I hereby solicit them. If not, my apologies for bothering you with it. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHaruo_def2.html" title="User:Haruo">Haruo</a> 08:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. All I could find as that I had categorised one of the articles while on a category-sorting exercise. It was kind of you to let everyone know, but I think I'd be better to leave the discussion to those of you with the expertise in that area.</dd>
<dd>Having read the discusion, though, there is one comment I would make to you: it's not clear whether the discussion is about an USA-only phenomenon, or an international one. If it's USA-only, a generic article needs to say so in the opening para; if not, it needs to give more attention to christian denominations in the rest of the world (the current list appears to me to be entirely USA-based). --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 09:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, that's a very useful observation. I'm sure the intent is to cover the globe but those who have contributed so far—pretty much all of us US folk I imagine—have (except for one mention of a Canadian church, and of course UFMCC is a worldwide denomination) not known and therefore not written about the situation beyond our borders. Will try to rectify this when I deal with this topic in a week or two. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHaruo_def2.html" title="User:Haruo">Haruo</a> 09:18, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Tom, I have never been involved in a mediation case myself, but I just looked at <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases" class="external free" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases" rel="nofollow">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases</a> , and the lists there suggest that it may take up to a fortnight. I'm not a mediator myself, but I hope you'll forgive me for suggesting that this may be something which you should try to resolve yourself, by <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and trying to start a dialogue by asking her about <i>why</i> she is making those changes, rather than starting the conversation with accusations of error and vandalism. <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a> would be useful here. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 14:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have tried to resolve this myself by contacting her via her Talk page several times, asking her to list for me specific items she feels should remain and why, but she has never responded. If you check the history for <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Sebelia_b036.html" title="Jeffrey Sebelia">Jeffrey Sebelia</a>, you will see the language she uses in her explanations for reverting the article suggests she is rather young and somewhat immature.</dd>

<dd>When I first joined Wikipedia, I was eager to learn how to use it correctly and welcomed all advice and constructive criticism. This newcomer seems to believe because she created the article, she owns it and its original version should remain intact. I have listed on the discussion page all my reasons for amending it. Yesterday she vandalized the discussion page by removing everything, apparently believing support inexplicably offered to her by someone you defended as a "quite prolific editor" (who became involved, I feel, only because we were differing on the Routledge matter) meant she was authorized to do as she pleases. I find the dialogue initiated at <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/User_talk:SweetNSpicyGal" class="external autonumber" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/User_talk:SweetNSpicyGal" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> offensive, if Kittybrewster allegedly is the "quite prolific editor" you described her to be.</dd>

<p>Actually, that is not a cross, it is called a 'dagger', †. Examine it using a large font, say TimesNew Roman 18, and you will see the difference between the dagger and a cross. For nomenclature, see for example <a href="http://fermat.nap.edu/books/0309096502/html/386.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fermat.nap.edu/books/0309096502/html/386.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a> compositors' handbook mentions this usage of the dagger to mark deceased. See, for example, biographical articles in the German Wikipedia. Blind translators, at least Kurzweiler, pick up * for birth and † for death. I agree that the MOS says one thing, but for succinctness I prefer the older style of *, †, and place. Someday I may mount a movement to change the MOS. But not today. Pillar 5: “Wikipedia does not have firm rules besides the five general principles elucidated here.”</p>
<p>Oh, with regards to the dagger being confused with a cross, we all see what we chose to see. By the way there is a related symbol the double-dagger, ‡ , which is not an Orthodox or Lithuanian cross. Sometimes the *, †, and ‡ are used for the first three footnotes on a page. &#160;&#160; <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 19:36, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I look at it in the size it appears in the default wikipedia theme (monobook), which is how the overwhelming majority of wikipedia readers will see it, and in that size/font it is almost identical to a christian cross. I don't really appeciate sarcastic comments about people "choosing" to see what we chose to see: the similarity is objectively there. Maybe the subtle differences appear more clearly in higher-resolution printed output, but wikipedia is (for now) an online publication.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, you are using this format in the crucial first sentence of an article, which exists to provide a very concise summary of the person and their notability. When the overwhelming majority of articles follow the format in the MoS, introducing a variant from a different publication serves only to confuse the reader, and it's hardly more succinct. Compare the following two entries:
<ul>
<li>Sir David Salomons (22 November 1797 – 18 July 1873)</li>
<li>Sir David Salomons (* 22 November 1797; † 18 July 1873)</li>

<dd>Sorry, but as it stands this is a single-source article which really serves only as an advert for the book.

You should read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, item 4): it specifically says that "Wikipedia articles should not include instructions or advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes"</dd>
<dd>You also say "we are still developing a fan base", which implies a breach of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT a social networking site</a>; wikipedia should not be used to develop your fan base.</dd>
<dd>I have checked the article again, and it seem clear to me that the article is structured like a manual, rather than as a guide to the game's significance and history. As pointed out elsewhere in the AFD, there are plenty of free wikis available if the gaming community wants to use a wiki to develop their manual, but wikipedia is <i>not</i> the place to do it.<br />
I think that the AFD is a useful opportunity for us to stress to you and to other gamers that we do mean what we say in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: if you try to use wikipedia as a repository for your manual, the article will be deleted. Good luck with the game development, folks, but wikipdia is the wrong place for it. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:08, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I am sorry for the confusion i have caused. I thought you were trying to delete the Empires own Wiki, not the Wiki Page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I cleared this up on the discussion page, by putting a line through that quote where i said it was a player manual, which is what the Empires own Wiki is, and then a note afterwards apoligising for the confusion and retracting the statement. however, some FUCKING ADMIN completely went back and DELETED ALL of these changes, just to further their point that the artical should be delted. (I'm not incinuating it was you at all, but someone did it.) There are people now out there that do not CARE what the artical is, they just want to prove their worth as a member of wikipedia that they can delete stuff, and get one over on a whole group of people. and it's really upsetting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do admit, i guess part of the point (imo) of the artical, is to raise attention. if people see it or come across it, they may try the mod and enjoy it. however, this is definately not the entire point of the wiki, and so i don't think it's grounds for deletion. this is the same reason why any mod or game is not going to want theirs to be deleted, we need to be recognised.</dd>

<dd>Nuka5, I hope that you wil take this in the friendly spirit in which I intend it, but have to say that your participation in the discission is doing nothing at all to help your cause, and that if you want the article to stay, you would be best advised to drop out of the AFD discussion. Let me explain why:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid that if you didn't bother to check whether you were talking about wikipedia or another wiki, then it's not reasonable to expect anyone to pay much attention to your comments about how wikpedia should be run. This is is <i>not</i> a discussion about whether this game is good, bad or indifferent: it is about whether wikipedia's policies allow the an encyclopedia to have any article on it. That's why these discussions give more weight to people who have track record of editing wikipedia, because they will have a greater knowledge of of wikipedia's policies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I'm sorry to say that it seems that you have very little understanding of how wikipedia works. The only policy or guideline you referred to was the which you one referenced at the top of the AFD yesterday, in which you tried to persuade people to follow a policy <i>proposal</i> which had been rejected. That was not a good idea: it only gave editors further reason to believe that despite yoyr obviously great knowledge of the game, you did not understand how wikipedia works.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I'm afraid that saying now that you want a wikipedia article on '<a href="../../../e/m/p/Empires.html" title="Empires">Empires</a>' "to raise attention" misses the point again. Wikipedia does <i>not</i> exist to help subjects "raise attention": it exists to provide information on topics which are <i>already</i> notable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to why your edits were removed, it's simple: don't edit other people's comments. They wrote what they wrote, quoting you: if you have changed your mind, you can add another comment saying so, but do not edit what someone else wrote. Posting angrily expletives about the admin who tidies things up doesn't help you at all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:29, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but what i was trying to get at when i say that it will attract attention, i mean that that is not the purpose of the article, but a byproduct that is one of the reasons that i do not believe it should be deleted. People will want information on the subject, and so if they look for it on wikipedia then they may find information and then go to the game. that's what I'm trying to say, not that the wiki is soley for advertising, in which case, it would fail to meet wikipedia standards.</p>
<p>I know that it is awkward to change someone elses' posts, and i was at first reluctant to do so: however, reading through the article there are entire posts crossed out by the admin kingslayer because he seemed to dissagree with them. I however, felt that people reading the article and seeing my (mis)quote would be confused and get the wrong impression on the issue. I think you would agree, that if you read at the top of the page that someone has said "do not delete our player manual", they would get the impression that someone thought that the article was indeed a player manual.</p>
<p>as to the confusion, it was mainly because they look very much the same. Empires does have it's own wiki and the front pages were much the same (the wiki page previously to have the EMPIRES logo at the top as well.) .<a href="http://empiresmod.info/index.php/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://empiresmod.info/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://empiresmod.info/index.php/Main_Page</a>. I admit, i didn't read the page, because i have read it several times before. I think it's an easy mistake to have made, and i have done my utmost best to rectify it.</p>
<p>As for trying to persuade people to follow for policy that was rejected, that was my ENTIRE POINT! haha, the policy appears to say that wiki's should be only created according to notority, and it was rejected. i did read the essay there as well.</p>
<p>I do understand how wikipedia works, and i use it often. I'm not trying to say that the game is good or bad, just that it is quite notable. I just don't see that it's wiki needs deletion, and i don't want to fight with admins at all. <a href="../../../n/u/k/User%7ENuka5_f7a6.html" title="User:Nuka5">Nuka5</a> 19:54, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nuka5, please read <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines</a>, and in particular the section<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Behavior_that_is_unacceptable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Behavior that is unacceptable</a>, where it says "Don't edit others' comments". You were <b>not</b> misquoted: you were quoted accurately, and had changed your mind. In such cases, it's fair to add a note <i>below</i> the relevant contribution, but <i>absolutely unacceptable</i> to edit the other person's words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hvaing done that, please stop and read through the rest of the policies listed in the welcome message which I have just posted to your talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kingslayer is an experienced admin, and was doing his/her best to try to undo the damage done to the discussion by people editing each others posts etc. Not easy, but a good job was done (whether or not it was perfect). I see nothing in Kingslayer's work that suggests anything inappropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the rejected guideline, I don't know what you were trying to achieve. There is an official policy and guidline covering that area. If what you now say about knowing the status of the other document is true, then trying to draw people's attention to a rejected draft instead of the real policy looks suspiciously like an attempt to disrupt a discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You say that you "do understand how wikipedia works", but I have to say that I'm sorry, but I don't see much evidence of that so far. Editing other peoples comments, not signing your posts, asking people to ignire formal policies in favour of a rejected document: those are just not acceptable behaviours on wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nuka5, I can only urge you again not to participate in a discussion such as this until you have learnt more about wikipedia's policies and guidelines. I don't have time to engage in a lengthy correspondence about all this, and I do have to warn you that if there is further disruption, I will have to put on my admin hat and start issuing you with official warnings. I do not want to have to do that, so please please stop this. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heho Madame, wouldn't it be better to disambiguate with something other than the year? You could use a version with middle name (Edward) for the son and without for the father; or you could add an addition like MP, businessman or even father and son. However if you insist on the year, it would be more beautiful to use the years of birth <b>and</b> death (1850-1929).

<dl>
<dd>Phoe, you are right! That <i>is</i> ugly and birth+death would be much better, so I have moved it to <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Dockrell_%281850-1929%29_5f10.html" title="Maurice Dockrell (1850-1929)">Maurice Dockrell (1850-1929)</a>. And along the way, I spotted that I had made a mistake on the dab page, putting them down as father+son rather than grandfather+grandson.</dd>
<dd>I did wonder about some other disambiguation, but the problem is that this family seems for several generations to have called their many sons only Henry, Percy, Morgan or Maurice. For about 150 years they ran Dublin's biggest hardware store, but some of the family became lawyers etc, and oodles of them went into politics. There is now another Mauruce, a barrister who has shown signs of getting into politics, and I reckon that if anyone writes up the history of the business there will be legitimate grounds for so many substantive articles that I wonder if even birth+death will be sufficient to disambiguate them all! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'll take your suggestions into consideration although I'd argue that unrelenting stubbornness and adamant refusal to see another's point of view (i.e. being a pain in the ass) is more deterring to editors than actually calling someone a pain in the ass. In the future I will make sure to directly criticize the editors' methods as opposed to the editor themself.--Lairor 11:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reviewed those exchanges, and the issue seems to me to be quite simple: you saw grounds for speedy deletion, but other editors did not. That's a perfectly legitimate disagreement: as far as I can see, the other editors understand your POV, but disagree. It would be quite proper for you to nominate some or all of those articles for AFD if you want to, but please don't characterise an honest disagreement as "unrelenting stubbornness". --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 12:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but it was an 'honest' disagreement without any facts to back it up. I gave my arguments and user Nunh-huh's rebuttals were "verified.", "it's verified by the references provided." and "of course it's verified." So Nunh-huh's disagreement with me plus his unwillingness to back up his arguments, that's what I saw as being unrelenting stubbornness. And while this is not a justification, but rather an explanation for why I may of been as hot headed as you perceived, is that on another similar issue, another fellow editor who appears to be a regular with the "peers" decried my good faith editing as "vandalism". Of course that word is often used as a synonym for edits that some people disagree with. I know I shouldn't generalize but all the editors I interacted with from the peers project have been, as I have perceived, somewhat stubborn. It seems they've got a strong cabal set up that if someone is editing one of "their" articles and doesn't agree with "their" views (which is just a project, not a policy or a guideline) they will be quickly shut down. That's why AfD's for any project that is slightly established are inevitably going to fail because are the people for keeping it the way it is are going to be focused on it and perhaps pointed to it by their fellow project members but all those opposed could form an overwhelming majority but their just single editors here and there floating in the ether and are completely unaware of this issue they may well want to make a firm stand on. I just feel when one is up against a brick wall and no matter how hard they try noone will even listen to their side of the story: that's when people throw their hands up and quit Wikipedia. That's my two cents.--Lairor 12:23, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have just reviewed the discussion again, and Nunhhuh's first response on the talk page was:

<dd>"In fact, Henrietta Maria Stanley was de jure suo jure 4th Baroness Strange, as may be seen by consulting the Complete Peerage, vol XII/1, p. 338, or Burke's Peerage 1999, p. 2726. Charlotte Murray was the 8th Baroness Strange, succeeding in 1764."</dd>

<p>I noted that you have followed up with <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurkem_a4a4.html" title="User:Burkem">User:Burkem</a> on his edits. It is concerning that he has so many edits since being blocked. Some of the information may be valid, but since most/all of them seem to rely on sources that don't meet Wikipedia standards, they may all need to be deleted / reverted. Sadly, it seems that Burkem is a candidate for a indefinite block/permanent ban. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 01:08, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Burkem returned and added false references to a series of articles. I blocked him for one month, but, I think an indefinite block might be in order. Your opinion? — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 02:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the one-month block was the least that could be done. As you pointed out on his talk page (at <a href="../../../b/u/r/User_talk%7EBurkem_bdbf.html#Invalid.2Ffalse_references" title="User talk:Burkem">User_talk:Burkem#Invalid.2Ffalse_references</a>), Burkem had received numerous warnings and numerous offers of help, and had ignored all of them despite previous short blocks. Yesterday, I was tempted to impose a block after the latest vandalism, but I thought that it was worth trying a further warning and a further offer of help. If the text on <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurkem_a4a4.html" title="User:Burkem">User:Burkem</a> is to be believed, this is a 16yo boy, and I don't like being harsh on kids.</dd>
<dd>Sadly there was no response to that offer, and not even an acknowledgement of it. I don't see any reason to expect that any further warnings or offers of help will fare any better, and this young man has already been indulged a lot more than any other editor I have seen.</dd>
<dd>Given all that, I don't think that there is any alternative to an indefinite block. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a> recommends a much faster escalation than has been used in this case, so I think that we have been very generous. I have therefore imposed an indefinite block. I think that a permanent <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> would also be in order, but I am unsure of the procedure involved: if you want to get that going, I would be ready to help.</dd>
<dd>I will also post something on <a href="../../../b/u/r/User_talk%7EBurkem_bdbf.html" title="User talk:Burkem">User talk:Burkem</a> about undoing the vandalism.

<dl>
<dd>I support your extension of the one month block I imposed. As I saw how quickly he was adding the deceptive "references" (more than one a minute), I felt it was important to quickly block him and then have a more extensive review to decide on a possible longer block. It is my mind that his behavoir on Wikipedia reaches the level that "exhausts the community's patience" (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Bans" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy#Bans</a>). On the referenced page, it indicates that taking it to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> is one approach — which I think is probably the most straightforward in this case.</dd>
<dd>A couple of points to note:
<ol>
<li>The editor seems to have enough basic understanding of Wikipedia in order to Wikilink topics and make succession boxes. This indicates that he does not lack the ability to understand the suggestions about edit summaries and signing his posts.</li>
<li>In addition, his insertion of the unpublished book and the unrelated link as references shows that he understood that references would be required; but, he did not take to heart the importance/policy behind this.</li>
<li>As Wikipedia is a references for so many, the potential for damage outweighs the possibility that Burkem may have a few valid edits (and I've not yet seen any that are verified by Burkem).</li>

<dd>ERcheck, I agree with all of the above. I'm afraid that the evidence all points to someone who is capable of understanding policy, but who doesn't just satisfy himself with ignoring policy. After all the warnings, some who knowingly and systematically adds false and/or deceptive references is a serious threat to the integrity of wikipedia. I think that this is one of those extreme cases where the encyclopedia needs to be protected. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 13:22, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you, BHG. I don't see blocking as punishment as Phoe suggested - but as a defense mechanism in protecting wikipedia and saving a lot of people a lot of work. In this case, probably Choess who seems to know more about the subject than anyone else. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 12:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BrownHairedGirl. This fellow has been referred to as the worst provincial Premier BC (where I live) ever had. Not sure about that, but he has the record for the shortest term of any BC Premier. Having been elected federally, been involved in historically significant events in Manitoba where he was elected provincially and served as Attorney Generals, having been elected in BC and served as AG and Premier and then gone on to be Mayor of Vancouver and a two term MP in the UK, he attracts my attention. I don't know of anyone else with as diverse an election history. I added him to <a href="../../../m/p/s/MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1910_%28December%29_593d.html" title="MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1910 (December)">MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1910 (December)</a> but I am not sure I have referred to him correctly by riding and I am wanting to chase down sources. I have not come across records online that help. Anyway, your name often pops up in my watchlist and I thought I would bother you with these aimless comments. . . . Cheers. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenWalker_32b5.html" title="User:KenWalker">KenWalker</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKenWalker_b9f6.html" title="User talk:KenWalker">Talk</a> 19:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there BrownHairedGirl,</p>
<p>I am fairly new to Wikipedia, although I have been trying in vain to add my entry into the "David Lightbown" page for quite some time.</p>
<p>Although I do understand that there is already one David Lightbown, he is listed as "David Lincoln Lightbown", and I do not have the same middle name. Why create a new entry "David James Lightbown" when "David Lincoln Lightbown" is under the page titled "David Lightbown"&#160;?</p>
<p>For example, this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith</a> lists several different people named "John Smith", is this page any different&#160;?</p>
<p>I understood that in previous times that I attempted to edit this page to add my information, it was listed as "Vanity". I assumed this was because I did not add references. This time I added 4 websites which contain information backing up the small amount of information I left.</p>
<p>I should be clear that I do not feel as though I own the page in the slightest. What I would like is to understand how to go about editing that page without my information being removed</p>
<p>I'm not trying to argue your side. You're a much more experienced Wikipedia user than I am. I would like simply to understand what makes this page different than, for example, the John Smith page which is a general page for multiple sub-pages.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon&#160;!</p>

<dd>With regard to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lightbown_44b5.html" title="David Lightbown">David Lightbown</a>, the first thing is: please read <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, which says <i>inter alia</i> "Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged". If you are notable enough to merit a wikipedia article, someone else will eventually write one about you. So I'm afraid that you should not have been trying to add your personal information into any article in wikipedia. I'm not suggesting anything underhand, because you probably didn't known that, but I hope that <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> explains the reasons.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry taht he trm "vanity" was used: it should not have been, because we are tryingto get rid of that term, because it can cause unintended offence. But basically, the point is that none of us is the best person to decide whether we ourselves are notable, and an autobiographical article appears to be self-promotion.</dd>
<dd>The other questions are also important ones, so I hope I can explain a bit. First, plase read <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>, which I hope will explain some of the background. Basically, yes, he <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> article <i>is</i> different.</dd>
<dd>The general rule at wikipedia is to create an atrticle on something under the name it is generally known by: so, if George W. Bush was usually known as GWB, the article should be titled GWB, and the text should begin "George W Bush, usually known as GWB ...".</dd>
<dd>Most people are usually known as <i>firstname lastname</i>, which works fine as an article title if the name is unusual, as with "<a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Stardust_8097.html" title="Alvin Stardust">Alvin Stardust</a>". However, many names are shared by two or more notable people about whom wikipedia has an article, and in that case, wikipedia needs to <i>disambiguate</i> the names.</dd>
<dd>For people, there are basically two approaches: one is to use a middle name or initial, and the other is to use some aspect of what makes them notable as a "parenthetical disambiguator". i.e. something in brackets after the name. So if there was another Alvin Stardust who was best known as a footballer, we would probably call the article "Alvin Stardust (footballer)". We would then put a link at the top of <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Stardust_8097.html" title="Alvin Stardust">Alvin Stardust</a> page, saying "For the Mongolian footballer, see Alvin Stardust (fotballer)".</dd>
<dd>That starts to get cumbersome if there are more than two Alvin Stardusts, so in that case we create a disambiguation page, which is a list of article on similarly-named subjects. You can easily recognise a disambiguation page (once you know what to look for!), because there will be a note at the bottom saying it disambiguation, and because it consists solely of one-line entries pointing to other articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> is an example of a disambiguation page for a very common name; <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Irving_e18e.html" title="William Irving">William Irving</a> is an example for a much less common name.</dd>
<dd>Where the articles are all of similar levels of noatbility, the "article name" page will usually be the disambiguation page; but if one person is much more prominent than the others, the disambiguation page will usually be at "article name (disambiguation)" - see, for example <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>.</dd>
<dd>I hope this helps explain a little about how things work here. And sorry again for appearing to growl at you rather rudely when I reverted your edit. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:28, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, and thanks for your useful contribution to the NPG UK renaming debate that is currently ongoing! For my part, I don't see the situation as deadlocked and hence I'm not sure than any unusual measures are necessary, although I've no objection in principle. However, I've left a full reply at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENational_Portrait_Gallery_%28London%29_b893.html" title="Talk:National Portrait Gallery (London)">Talk: National Portrait Gallery (London)</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 03:21, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your response. I have replied at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENational_Portrait_Gallery_%28London%29_b893.html" title="Talk:National Portrait Gallery (London)">NPG talk</a> with two suggestions, which again I hope are helpful … but please do try to refrain from saying that MO is "plain wrong". I understand how you may feel that way, but I honestly don't yet see <i>either</i> side of the debate as having produced any decisive evidence. I think that the anserrs will have to come from external sources, whereas it seems that both sides are currently inferring things. In contentious issues, it's dangerously easy to draw legitimate but ultimately unhelpful inferences from an incomplete set of facts&#160;:) --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:46, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The least I expect from an editor is that a) they discuss major changes before they make them in order to assess consensus; b) that, especially if editing on a topic with which they are unfamiliar, they at least do a modicum of basic research in order to support their assertion, whatever it may be; c) they respond to the reasonable queries of other editors. I don't "feel" that MO! is plain wrong, and I do not mean it in the pejorative. It is a manifest fact. My feeling was that clear evidence had already been provided, although this has now been amplified considerably, as per your request. My frustration stems from the fact that this evidence was far from recondite- I found it in 2 minutes flat on the NPG's own website. It is obvious that MO! either didn't do this, or did do it but was then too obdurate to admit his mistake. Either way, very unhelpful. He has reverted (twice) my efforts to return the page to the status quo prior to discussion, the first time before joining the debate on the talk page, which he failed to do for some time despite being specifically asked to do so. To speak bluntly, on the occasions that I have had contact with him, MO! has consistently come across as boorish and uncooperative, and for no good reason (if there can ever be one?). Regardless, I know from experience that there is little point in attempting to change his behaviour, but what I <i>would</i> like is to render the NPG article as factually accurate at least. Hopefully this will be possible, and thanks for your help towards this end. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 04:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I note that yet again Badgerpatrol cannot desist from the repeated personal attacks. On every single post he repeats his attacks - like a Pavlovian response. I have a vague recollection that I have had to deal with this person before, but cannot remeber where. They obviously harbour a grudge against me. That is their prerogative, but I request that they desist from the constant sniping and slander. Their objective is clearly to shut me up and discredit me. It is Badgerpatrol who loses all respect by behaving so, not I. (Holding grudges is bad for ones health by the way - do yourself a favour and drop it.) --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 10:07, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure of the best approach, but if you at least make them aware that a discussion has already been initiated at the Talk page, perhaps they may withdraw to allow you to do it properly.

<dd>For now, since it's agreed that the category should be renamed, I think I'll leave my comments as they are. The only main difference I see on the linked discussion is that you wish to use the abbriviations UK and MP. While UK and US are slowly coming into accepted usage on Category names (in some instances), <a href="../../../m/p/_/MP_c90a.html" title="MP">MP</a> is rather ambiguous (military police, for example), and the current convention is to spell out abbreviations (With UK and US being notable though rare exceptions, as I mentioned). I think you're doing important work, though. Keep it up&#160;: ) - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 10:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respect your point about the abbreviations, though I disagree; but shouldn't the series of categories be named consistently? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 10:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

I quite respect your right to make alternative proposals, but it does seem to me to be unhelpful to to take an existing proposal which has achieved a degree of consensus and make new proposals which do not include the options which have been already discussed with support from all participants.</p>
<p>I don't want to sugggest bad faith (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is very important!), but I hope you can see how your nominations could be read that way, which I don't think helps anyone.</p>
<p>One option for is now to edit every one of those CFDs with a note about how these nominations were made without representing the options which achieved suppoet at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html#Renaming_subcategories_after_restructuring" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British_MPs#Renaming_subcategories_after_restructuring</a>, which I'm afraid woud appear rather confrontaional, but I don't see any other way of getting the options into the discussion. Bearing in mind that it's now late, I think that this is the only ay I can get these options on the table, so I will go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>However, I would very much prefer if you would agree to withdraw those nominations so that we can make new CFDs which offer all the options?

<p>It is outrageous that when you decided to "clean-up" the vote your still tried to pin all the blame on me. You started the problems and I am not the only person you have abused.

<dd>No, I didn't start the problem.</dd>
<dd>1) You tried to abuse CFD, by trying to use it to override a issue long since settled in guidelines, to score a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> over another CFD (which also breaches guidelines). You have at no point even acknowledged the existence of those guidelines, let alone exolained why you think that they shoukd be breached.</dd>
<dd>2) You objected to the joining of that nomination to other gendered categories, so you split up the CFD, and in the process removed ALL the votes against.</dd>
<dd>3) You then denied removing any votes, but removed them again.</dd>
<dd>4) I restoed hem, so you then littered with CFD with personal attacks.</dd>
<dd>I have not removed any votes, and have not split a CFD to remove one side of an argument.

<dd>Thanks Phoe, I'm sure you're right on that. I can see a case too for restoring them to article title on the other categories too, and I wouldn't object if someone did change them. Actually thinking about it, they <i>should</i> all be changed back: she was known as Mervyn, the article name begins with Mervyn, so that's where the article should be found. I'll do that now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All a bit odd, though.

<dd>Oh, for Germans many English names sounds funny or strange, therefore this one does not stand out particularly.&#160;:-) ... Concerning the sorting: sometimes the title is different to the surname, or there are life peers with the same surname and different territorial designation e.g. Baroness Young of Hornsey, Baroness Young of Old Scone and then Baroness Young. Using names in these cases mixes the order. (and to stay consistent it should be used the title generally).

<dd>Hi Phoe, I should have read the diff before replying&#160;:( Because now I think you are wrong&#160;:(</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Surely those peers you list should be indexed as follows (I have invented the names as an example):</p>
<ul>
<li>|Young of Hornsey, Alice Young</li>
<li>|Young of Old Scone, Sarah Smith</li>
<li>|Young, Jane Murphy</li>
</ul>
<p>This will sort as</p>
<ul>
<li>|Young, Jane Murphy</li>
<li>|Young of Hornsey, Alice Young</li>
<li>|Young of Old Scone, Sarah Smith</li>
</ul>
<p>However, whether we include of exclude the name from Jane Young, she will still be at the top of the list: it will only affect the sort between her and any other Baroness Smiths without a territorial designation (can there be more than one?)</p>
<p>So what matters in the example is whether the terrotorial designation is included. It doesn't affect Mervyn Pike, either way, because she is the only one. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:27, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, <b>if</b> people would use always the form <b>|Young of Hornsey, Alice Young</b> there would be no problem. But usually they look to the wrong example - they (will) see <b>|Young, Jane Murphy</b> and (will) transform |Young of Hornsey, Alice Young to <b>|Young, Alice</b>. This would let your list look that way:
<ul>
<li>|Young, Alice</li>
<li>|Young, Jane Murphy</li>
<li>|Young, Sarah Smith</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>or if it gets quite bad (and I've seen this many times):
<ul>
<li>|Murphy, Jane</li>
<li>|Smith, Sarah</li>
<li>|Young, Alice</li>

<dd>Therefore, in my opinion, it is better to use generally the title only - identically whether it really is needed or not.

<p>I'm still sorting through the precedents on the issue of "Female X" categories, and it's clear that there's a certain amount of dogmatism involved here, but constructing an equivalence with a large chunk of the peerage categories and asking that they be deleted, too is an absolute textbook example of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>.

<p>Yes, sortkeys are difficult. This is the same problem, that I have with Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury in example. He is also a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_peer.html" title="Life peer">life peer</a> with the title <b>Baron Gascoyne-Cecil</b>, but who would look for him under G in the category? Or who would look for <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Hughes_73f6.html" title="Roy Hughes">Roy Hughes</a> under I. Therefore I have thought over whether it would be generally better to add the life peer category to the redirect (in the first case <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Gascoyne-Cecil_803e.html" title="Baron Gascoyne-Cecil">Baron Gascoyne-Cecil</a>) with a notice on the main page. This is partly made also at peerage titles. Unfortunately, this would not work in your case, since courtesy titles refer mostly to various persons. Personally I would prefer the indexing under Wolmer, however only because it was handled in similar cases also so. Have you already noticed it, I like consistency?&#160;:) le gach dea-ghuí <span style="color:darkgreen">~~ <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoe_4759.html" title="User:Phoe"><span style="color:darkgreen">Phoe</span></a> <sub><a href="../../../p/h/o/User_talk%7EPhoe_94bb.html" title="User talk:Phoe"><span style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkgreen">talk</span></a></sub> 16:10, 11 November 2006 (UTC) ~~</span></p>

<p>Ok, people. I've closed every nomination regarding this that I could find. Please get together and figure out a way to renominate the categories that will cause the least amount of bickering. BTW, I didn't remove the tags from any category, so when you all decide to renominate them, you'll need to re-tag them so they point to the right CFD subpage.

<dd>I guess it wasn't exactly a duplicate, but I wanted to close every one to wipe the slate clean, as it were. As for a next step, I'd get together with BHG and see if you two can't come together on how to nominate the categories again. You don't have to agree on what the end result will be, that's what the discussion itself is for. But you'll need a starting point. Perhaps something like the one I closed that had option 1 and option 2. The one thing you don't want to have happen is another set of competing nominations. I think it's better to have none while things are hashed out. I'm not sure what to do with the Female life peers one. Right now I'm not going to do anything besides sigh, drink coffee, and put off doing the yardwork for another hour or so. --<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 13:19, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

Those two comments don't quite seem to tally, so I hope that the earlier one is what you meant, and that you will take Kbdank's advice to discuss options first, before making any further nominations.</p>
<p>I would be happy to do that, and I'm sure that if we set this difficult episode behind us and try to explore the issues, we will find a lot more agreement than we may think now ... and that where we don't agree, we can clarify a set of coherent alternatives.</p>
<p>Is that OK with you?</p>
<p>I am going to be away from my computer for the next six days, so I'm afraid that any involvement from me will have to wait until next weekend, and maybe it'll do us all good to have a bit of cooling off time. In any case I suggest that discussions on ways ahead should run for a week or so, to give as many people as possible a chance to contribute. There are a lot of interlocking categories here, and by giving more people a chance to consider things away from the deadlines of CFD, I think we we can ensure that whatever decisions are eventually made at CFD made will be ones that work.</p>
<p>We've gotten off to a bad start, and I hope we can start again and let bygones be bygones.</p>

<dd>As for "discussion". My last comment is the one I plan to do. Your contributions seem to show a rather extensive activity of adding articles to categories. I think (at this point, anyway), I'll wait until you're done doing whatever it is you're doing than to "jump in the middle" of what is starting to look like a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> mess.

<dd>Oh dear&#160;:( So much for my olive branch.</dd>
<dd>However, if you think that what I am doing is a mess, why not explain how you think it's a mess, and discuss ways forward? I'm open to suggestions, and have tried to seek consensus at each stage for the directions to take.</dd>
<dd>I am really am very puzzled as to what you reckon is to be gained by holding private discussions before going to CFD rather than discussing the options with the editors active in this area.</dd>
<dd>In the same spirit as your reply to me, I notice that a very high proportion of your contributions seem to be on CFD or related matters. That's important work, and I'm not knocking it, but I suggest that it would be a good idea to remember that CFD is a process designed, in the end, to make articles more useable: it does not exist in a vacuum, and it is not an end in iself.</dd>
<dd>Categories don't just exist in a vacuum: they are usually developed out of a knowledge of the subject area, and there are a lot of editors working in that area with a deep knowldege of the subject. The category structure in that area has evolved over time, and contains some residual anomalies, but is moving in a direction which better relflects the underlying complexities of a multiparty system covering many different constitutional structures.</dd>
<dd>Before you accuse me of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, I think that you should re-read it. It does not say that CFD can only mentioned at CFD, and I acted within guidelines.</dd>
<dd>You are quite right that at the moment I'm doing a lot of categorisation. That's a task which as discussed at length at category talk, according to a structure devised in collaboration with other editors.</dd>
<dd>For those working on a set of articles like that, it's frustrating to find that the CFD process can be used to undermine ongoing work rather than support and guide it. I fear that you don't realise how a premature rush to CFD can lead to bad decisions, without all the options having been explored. You felt that there was a better way forward than the options being discussed: fine, that's your privelige. But it's a real pity that rather than explore why other editors disagree, you then rushed to CFD and sought to exclude the other options from consideration. That looks depressingly like an attempts to use the rules to stitch up a discussion&#160;:(</dd>
<dd>I saw that you were planning to discuss this with a third party, which is great: let's get more people involved. But rather than having private discussions, why do I get the impression that you are reluctant to discuss these matters with the editors most active in the area, without the deadline of a CFD?</dd>
<dd>As a final comment, I hope that you will reflect on the way that you promised in the public dscussion on ANI to follow kbdank71's advice ... and now, privately, say that you intend to do the opposite. That's not good practice.&#160;:( --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 05:20, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've debated with myself over whether it was a good idea or not to respond. The trouble is, your sense of "drama" in responding tends to lead you to make, what I would consider to be false statements, or at the very least misrepresentations of the truth. (Drama evinced by "Oh dear", etc.)</p>
<p>The trouble is, I have this inner preference to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, even in situations when it seems rather obvious that there is a distinct <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias/agenda</a>.</p>
<p>So I'll take a moment to respond in the continued hope of communication.</p>
<p>You seem to be a zealous, or perhaps even "over-zealous" editor (especially when it comes to gender-related issues, or anglo-centric issues). As such, sometimes you apparently have missed some things. Understanding CfD is one of them, but I'll leave that for the moment. Why do I think this? Well, the most glaring example for me was:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I am really am very puzzled as to what you reckon is to be gained by holding private discussions before going to CFD rather than discussing the options with the editors active in this area."</li>
</ul>
<p>The irony for me is that you wrote that in response to:</p>
<ul>
<li>"(laughter) Understood. I think what I'll do at this point is take my own advice. Once she's done creating/depopulating/nominating categories, I'll do a comprehensive nomination dealing with MP, though that may depend on if I ever am able to finish the now aborted discussion with User:Steve block about it&#160;: ) - Anyway, have a great day&#160;: ) - jc37 13:44, 11 November 2006 (UTC)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now... Who do you think I may be wanting the opinion of? Was that information "private"? Or perhaps was it actually transparent in my response? And if you actually read over the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_6_4d50.html#Category:Current_British_MPs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 6">CfD you were modifying</a>, you may even have seen the "aborted discussion".</p>
<p>The fact that you missed that in your flurry (and there are other examples, such as apparently missing me saying "no accusation", but this will do for now), pretty much cleared that up for me.</p>
<p>While I have doubts that you'll accept this in the intent I offer it, I would like to suggest that you should calm down a bit. The <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> issue in the later CfD is a good example of where you allowed your strong feelings to let yourself get carried away. It happens, life goes on.</p>
<p>I also am going to copy one of my comments from above, in the hopes that you'll now understand it in the way it was intended:</p>
<ul>
<li>":The thing is, in watching everything, I don't think you even realise how you've been disrupting CfD discussions. Whether you disagree with my <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a> and (at the time) thinking I was helping by completing the nominations (something rather common at CfD), or not, the fact that you have been arbitrarily confusing nominations, and thus biasing the votes in a discussion is a rather "bad thing". I really hope you will reflect on that and modify how you respond/act in CfD.

</ul>
<p>As for the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.) Steve block and I have disagreed in the past, so I felt/feel that he is a rather good choice to ask for a "third-party" opinion. But he's been rather busy these days, (and I think I've innundated him with other, non-related queries), so I've left further discussion with him on this on the "back-burner".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2.) I'll just post part of my last response to him, here:</li>

<p>Oh, and "no opinion" on whether UK should be expanded to "United Kingdom", since both are standard practice in category naming.</p>

<li>Okay, Jc asked me for my thoughts on all this. My bone of contention is with the expansion of MP to Member of Parliament, based on the thorny issue of the usage in the English language. What we have in the UK has evolved over 400 years or so, and the language depends very much on context. Parliament in the United Kingdom is composed of the Sovereign, the Lords and the Commons. I'm not sure where Jc is from, so I can't relate it to his own system analogously. So the Queen is a member of Parliament, just as much as Tony Blair is. The problem is, the usage stems from the fact that we elect the Commons, so those people are constituency Members of Parliament, and are "our", i.e. the voters, Members of Parliament. So, given we tend to expand abbreviations, then the way I would propose to expand is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Members of the House of Lords, which can be sub categorised into those which are elected, those which are law lords, those which are life peers and those which are hereditary, and the temporal/spiritual peers;</li>
<li>Members of the House of Commons, which can be subcategorised by country and party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those are my thoughts. The subcategories are merely suggestions not a hard and fast rule and can be disregarded or expanded as people see fit. I've just done some digging, and it looks like although I'm right, I'm perhaps being overzealous in my thinking. I still like the above system, it more correctly explains the position, but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82552.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82552.stm" rel="nofollow">the BBC</a> describe the position as <i>"Technically, all members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are Members of Parliament ... However, convention dictates that the term Member of Parliament, or MP, only applies to members of the House of Commons"</i>.

<dd>Hi Catchpole, it's the standard way of indexing people whose names begin with "Mac" or "Mc", to ensure that vagaries of capitalisation etc don't lead to the names being separated (see any telephone directory to see it at work). McLeish is technically an abbreviation of MacLeish, and usage is often inconsistent within families, and even those named "Mc" in English will be named "Mac" in Gaelic. Similarly, the letter after the "Mac" or "Mc" is inconsistently capaitalised, and wikioedia's indexing is case-sensitive, so unless the indexing is standardised on "Macleish", the Macleishes end up in four different places in the index: under McLeish, Mcleish, MacLeish, Macleish. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi, do you know if this is standard throughout the English Wikipedia, and if it has been discussed anywhere? I look at Category:First Ministers of Scotland now and McLeish appears before McConnell. Are you going to go through every Mac and Mc and index them all this way? - you might want to find a helpful bot-operator to assist - otherwise all these categories are going to be inconsistent. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 15:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Pathoschild, Thanks for the note. I have removed the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag from the article, because I believe that the article <i>is</i> properly referenced. The two sources for the information in the article are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?id=2483" class="external free" title="http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?id=2483" rel="nofollow">http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?id=2483</a> , which confirms her electoral history</li>
<li>the <a href="http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/" class="external text" title="http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/" rel="nofollow">Oireachtas members database</a>: the article links only to the front page of the database, but the data on O'Carroll is at <a href="http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=15&amp;MemberID=838&amp;ConstID=85" class="external free" title="http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=15&amp;MemberID=838&amp;ConstID=85" rel="nofollow">http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=15&amp;MemberID=838&amp;ConstID=85</a> , including her dates of birth and death.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I understand you correctly, the reader does not claim that O'Carroll did not exist or that she was not a TD, and that the only issue at stake is the date of death (or rather whether she died at all). We have two conflicting sources: the reader's email and the Oireachtas database. Of the two, it seems to me that the Oireachtas database is the more reliable (it is a published source, run by the parliament itself).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have corresponded on several occasions with the officials in the <a href="../../../o/i/r/Oireachtas.html" title="Oireachtas">Oireachtas</a> who run that database, and I have found then to be very conscientious and approachable: like Wikipedia, they insist on verifiability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>May I suggest that the best course of action would be to suggest to the reader that they either point us towards another published source, <i>or</i> contact the oireachtas (see contact details at <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/" class="external free" title="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/</a> ) to offer them whatever evidence they have to show that the database is wrong? It seems to me that to prove a negative (viz that O'Carroll is not dead) probably requires some original research, which Wikipedia cannot do, but the Oireachtas can.</dd>

<dd>That sounds fair enough. The Oireachtas database members database is not perfect, but it is a published source and it has very few errors.

<dd>Hmmm. The electionsIreland site is an independent one run by volunteers, and I have found this sort of error before on that site, when two candidates of different names end up being conflated (I had spotted that in this case, and gave it little weight). Maureen O'Carroll the TD would have been 86 years old at the time of the 1999 local elections, and 91 years old when the next council elections were held in 2001. That in itself would be unlikely, but the entry on O'Carroll at the <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/Irish%20bios/TDs_2.htm#ocarroll" class="external text" title="http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/Irish%20bios/TDs_2.htm#ocarroll" rel="nofollow">Centre for the Advancement of Women in Politics</a> not only confirms the birth and death dates, but adds the information that she was a mother of ten children.</dd>

<dd>Such an active political career in Tramore all seems highly improbable for a ninety-year-old mother-of-ten from Dublin: if it was indeed the same person, her career would have been so remarkable that her age and political career would have been mentioned in some of the reports in the local paper and she would have achieved widespread coverage in the national media, rather than merely routine mentions in the local paper. (With ten children, the Dublin O'Carroll would probably have been a great-grandmother by then).</dd>
<dd>So as well as expanding the article, I have reverted your removal of her date of death. I will also write to electionsireland.org to ask them to check their records and see if they have anything other than a shared name to link the Tramore and Dublin candidates. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 05:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, the reader asked me to pass the following message to you.</p>
<div style="padding:1em; border:1px dashed #2f6fab; text-align:left; color:#000; background-color:#D7CEFF;">
<p>Hi BrownHairedGirl</p>
<p>Sorry, I've probably posted this message in entirely the wrong place - I've searched through where else to leave a message for you but couldn't work it out!!!</p>
<p>My name is Trish, I'm the reader who was querying the death of Maureen O'Carroll... Having read through all the correspondence, I think I can now see what has happened. There are (or rather, were) two Maureen O'Carrolls who took up a career in politics after teaching!</p>
<p>The one that the article was written about was not 'my' Maureen but a different person altogether! The Maureen O'Carroll I was concerned about is actually my aunt which is why I was so adamant that she is still alive! She is still a very vocal character in local politics despite being 'of an age'!</p>
<p>The other big difference between the two is that my aunt is a spinster and I don't think she has ever looked after a pet let alone 10 children!!!</p>
<p>It can only be as you surmised, the ElectionIrelands.org site has added the wrong information to the bottom of the Dublin Maureen O'Carrolls political history.</p>
<p>So, adding my apologies, I will now bow out and continue my enjoyment of reading Wiki articles rather than writing them!!!</p>
<p>Apologies for any upset I may have caused.</p>
<p>Trish</p>

<p>Regarding your comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_28#Category:Anti-Judaic_people" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_28#Category:Anti-Judaic_people" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There is a fine distinction between people practicing antisemitism and those holding anti-Judaic views. Most antisemites are not anti-Judaic, and many anti-Judaic people are not necessarily antisemitic. You bring up questions about verifiability, but that warning on WP:V applies to category <b>naming</b>. Right now you're voting to <i>move</i> this category to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Semitic_people_c721.html" title="Category:Anti-Semitic people">Category:Anti-Semitic people</a>. How's that going to make verifiability any easier? Most anti-Judaics are well-noted for their anti-Judaism. This is not true of antisemites, for they usually try to hide their antisemitism behind different guises (one being anti-Judaism). Right now the only person in this category is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>. He's a <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html#Homilies_Against_the_Jews" title="John Chrysostom">well-noted anti-Judaic</a>. But many (if not most) scholars believe he was not antisemitic (see <a href="http://www.chrysostom.org/jews.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chrysostom.org/jews.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>).

<p>Hi, BrownHairedGirl. I have just proposed the renaming of these categories to People who have endorsed the UK XXX Party in the deletion discussion (requiring a citation for each name included) and wondered if you wanted to express your view on this? Or perhaps a better word than "supporters" or "endorsed" would be appropriate because I still believe there's a case for keeping the cats in a better format. Thanks and best wishes. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovea_3426.html" title="User:Dovea">Dovea</a> 19:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dovea, I'm sorry for the belated reply, and I know that the CFD has now closed, but "endorsed" seems to me to run into the same problems as "supporters", as well as adding a few problems of its own. What exactly constitutes an "endorsement"? Does an endorsement have to be a mark of general support, or is support for a particular person or policy sufficient?</dd>
<dd>That's the question which you never came near answering in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_11_baab.html#Category:Supporters_of_Plaid_Cymru" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 11">the CFD discussion</a>, and before I could support <i>any</i> such category, I would want a clear and durable definiton of who could be included, and a category name which made the usage fairly obvious.</dd>
<dd>I quite agree with you that there are some people whose allegiances are very clear: e.g. Sean Connery and the SNP, or Billy Bragg and Labour. But what about someone who says that the Conservatives have the best policy on ID cards? Or that the LibDems are the best of a bad bunch? Or a socialist who says that Labour is still the best option for a socialist voter, but is pursuing a lot of policies which they consider reactionary? Or a right-wing eurosceptic who gives similarly grudging support to the Tories?</dd>
<dd>I can't see any form of words which doesn't end leaving a lot of ambiguity. Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you can come up with something, but I'm araid I can't see any ay of namking a category such as this in which it passes the self-evident test in <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">WP:CAT</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because the issue I see here isn't size, it's how well-known the city is. Houston isn't so well-known outside the US, where it's generally known only as the site of <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s mission control, and I suspect that a lot of Europeans think it's in Florida (as I did when I was young, because I thought that was where all space stuff happened).

<p>Hi BrownhairedGirl. Just a general query really. What was the reason for splitting off the 'Historic' Blackburn constituency from the extant one? I thought it was normal practice to combine them on the one page. Thanks <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalloglass_a610.html" title="User:Galloglass">Galloglass</a> 16:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Galloglass, this one of those "it seemed like a good idea at the time" thingies.&#160;:(</dd>
<dd>My logic was that as a two-seat constituency, it would have covered a much bigger area than the later single-seat constituency, and that confusion would be reduced by separating the two-seat and single-seat incarnations. I have since come to the conclusion that I was wrong, and that the two should be kept together for a whole variety of reasons, which basically amount to it being less confusing. I looked at it again only yesterday, and thought that it really ought to be merged back into <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_2ec3.html" title="Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)">Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)</a>. If you or someone else felt like doing that, I'd be delighted!</dd>
<dd>As a general point, I now think that it's by far the best thing to <i>always</i> keep constituencies of the same name together, even if the boundaries barely overlap. I also split <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wrekin_%28historic_UK_Parliament_constituency%29_15b2.html" title="The Wrekin (historic UK Parliament constituency)">The Wrekin (historic UK Parliament constituency)</a> and reckon that was a mistake too, and <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Martin</a> split one of the Croydon seats, which I also think was a bad idea.--<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 16:37, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Unfortunately my wiki skills are letting me down again because I'd like to change his 1918 description to Coalition Lib and his 1922 one to National Lib.

<p>Hi BrownHairedGirl. I think you may have misunderstood a point in your comment "The distinction between Métro and RER will be initially lost to most English-language readers, who will have to read the category to see whether the RER is included." - the reverse is actually true. These categories relate specifically to Métro stations, not to metro stations which could include both Métro and RER stations. By accurately replacing metro with Métro in the category names, it will become completely clear that these categories are for Métro stations, not for both Métro and RER stations. By leaving the categories incorrectly labelled as metro stations, there remains confusion as to whether or not non-Métro metro stations (e.g. RER stations) are included. Hope that makes sense - let me know if not!

<dd>Yes, I think&#160;:P There exist also a Baroness Lee of Ashridge and a Baron Lee of Trafford and furthermore the hereditary Barony of Lee of Fareham, so the territorial addition is important to divide between them. I believe somewhere at WP:PEER or at Naming Coventions (royalty) exists also a paragraph that if titles are added to a name, it should be used the correct form (if you want read it, I will search it).

<dd>Your example is a little bit wrong, since the Dukedom of Buccleuch and the Dukedom Queensberry are two different titles owned by the same person. In such cases the rule is to use only the higher title, and if they are just as high to use the most senior title.

<dd>After saying not to include honorifics in front of names it does give some exceptions: <i>"Note that in the case of some historic people, an honorific is so commonly attached to their names that it should be included. Thus, in the U.S. in the 1930s, "Father Coughlin" (Charles Coughlin). Likewise, include the honorific for Father Damien, ...."</i> By giving these specific exceptions surely the norm must be not to use such religious forms or why mention them as exceptions. I could raise it at MoS talk to get a specific mention in the MoS but i've not seen rev included enough in articles to worry.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 18:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you look at Category:Episcopacy in Protestantism and tell me what you think? As far as I can tell, it is simply redundant with the "Bishops" categories; "episcopacy" simply refers to the governing body of a church (i.e. the bishops). <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 19:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Episcopacy" refers to the concept of episcopal governance, but this category is being used to categorise the individual holders of episcopal offices. I can see that there would be a case for a category by that name <i>if</i> it were used to categorise articles in, for example, the debates witin methodsim about episcopacy, or the Scottish rejection of episcopacy, but that is not what it is being used for here: its sole function here is to add an extra layer to the categorrisation of bishops.

<dd>Mairi has said that the "episcopacy" categories may be useful for more than just subcategorizing bishops.

<p>I changed my vote because the categories for episcopal areas serve a practical purpose (the bishop is directly associated with the episcopal areas) and because I think the categories could be populated over time. The categories by state, however, are impractical since the bishops' episcopal areas may cover multiple states. Does this explain my viewpoint adequately? <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 10:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, it does, and I agree most of the way: the states categories are impractical, but the area categories do relect an organisational reality, and I agree that they <i>could</i> be populated over time. My concern is about that word "could", because I think that these categories are premature: PW has been creating articles on these bishops for about a year (he seems to be the only one working on them) and there are still only 55 of them in these area categories. At the curent rate of progress, it'll be three years or more before there is even one the lsiting in a single category spills onto a scond page, so it seems to me to be way premature to sub-categorise them. I would support retaining individual sub-cats where there are at least a dozen entries, as offering some promise of reaching a useful size, but I don't think that any of the area categories is there yet. I note that (AFAICS) none of the area cats even includes a list of those who have been bishops in the area, which does not bode well for future expansion. It seems to me to be a bad idea to create a category because it <i>might</i> become useful in a few years' time; I prefer to create categories which <i>are</i> useful or which show reasonable likelihood or being sufficiently populated in the near future. Surely lists are the way to go for now? --11:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I worry about a similar problem regarding galaxies, but in most cases, the galaxies are united together in a few general categories (such as <a href="../../../s/p/i/Category%7ESpiral_galaxies_cce6.html" title="Category:Spiral galaxies">Category:Spiral galaxies</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/l/Category%7EElliptical_galaxies_8888.html" title="Category:Elliptical galaxies">Category:Elliptical galaxies</a>). The situation with bishops is insane. As you have indicated, the categories are no longer useful for navigation when subdivided this way; the articles end up separated from each other and hidden within small niches of a giant category tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also worry about category clutter. Some of the articles on individual bishops already contains 20 or so categories. Above 10 or 15 categories, the list of categories at the bottom of an article page becomes difficult to navigate.</dd>

<p>The area cats reflect how the church is set up and reflects a logical way to orginazize the bishops. You could make the point that it is too early to set up this large number of cats. However they will be populated over time since articles on the individuals who filled those positions will be ceated and remain. Yes, the point about the small number is valid, however fixing the state cats once is just as important. Leaving the area cats provides a place and structure for new ones. Hopefully no more state cats will be created after this. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your logic, but I didn't think that it was usual practice to create categories because they <i>might</i> be sufficiently populated in future. I would have no objection to those cats <i>if</i> there were enough articles, but there are not; why not delete with no prejudice to them being recreated as needed, say when there are at least a dozen articles in each new sub-cat? Wikipedia's categoisation system would become unwieldy if we sub-divided everything this far. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, by your count we have 569 bishops. That calls for sub categories. I guess the question now is which ones. The by Area ones are logical and fit with the way the church is run. So, either we stay with those and let them become populated over time, or there is a proposal for sub categories that work in that direction. Categories that are part of a reasonable series generally accept the fact that some will be small. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We have 569 bishops, but not 569 <i>articles</i>. So far, I can count about UM 55 bishops (plus a a few dozen from the precessor denomninations), and that does not need sub-categorising. Our usual practice is to sub-categorise when there enough articles to resaonably populate even some of the articles in the category, but we are not there yet: I think that the most populous so far has 6 articles in it.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, if the categorisation is by area, then nearly all of the categories will be small, even if and when they are fully populated, and we are a long long way from that.</dd>
<dd>Part of the problem here is that it is misleading to talk of "the church". The figure of 569 includes the four precdecessor denominations which had bishops, and they had diferent area structures. I have suggested to <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> that he creates lists of the bishops for each episcopal area; if he did, we could see which if any of the areas have had enoug bishops that they might ever justify categories.</dd>
<dd>In the meantime, however, we could stick with the existing categorisation of the bishops by denomination. That way the biggest current category has 55 articles, and even if <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">PW</a> susttains his current rate of progress on article creation, it will be a year or more before the categories become too full. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>When a CFD is closed, then the tags should be removed from discussions once any necessary actions have been taken or where the categories are to remain unchanged (i.e. not deleted or renamed or merged). The categories on which you changed the tags are all to be upmerged per the decision at CFD, so there is no need to remove the tags: once the merger has taken place, the categories will be deleted, along with any CFD tags.</dd>
<dd>Given your track recird of creating so many problematic categories, and your notable reluctance to contribute to the CFD discussions or to respond to other attemts to discuss the issues, I would strongly recommend that you do not remove any CFD or similar tags from any articles or categories.

<p>They need not be one article subcats. They only are at their creation, as need arises (as I am sure many, many cats and subcats begin). Obviously, there are other Bishops to fit these categories.

<dd>Hi Wayne, the discussions are of course at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>. I also placed on your talk page a direct link to each individual CFD discussion as soon as I created each CFD: see <a href="../../../p/a/s/User_talk%7EPastorwayne_f54c.html#CFD_for_Category:Episcopacy_in_Christianity_and_some_sub-categories" title="User talk:Pastorwayne">User talk:Pastorwayne#CFD_for_Category:Episcopacy_in_Christianity_and_some_sub-categories</a> for several links to the CFDs. The comment which you replied to above, about one-article subcats, is in that section of you talk page.</dd>
<dd>One of the biggest problems with these categories is that, as I set out at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_December_17_8a1f.html#Category:Methodist_bishops_of_Japan" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 17">the CFD for Methodist bishops of Japan</a>, you have created more categories than articles. At the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_December_12_9b9d.html#Category:United_Methodist_bishops_by_U.S._State" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 12">CFD for Category:United Methodist bishops by U.S. State</a>, one of the editors explained <i>why</i> this is a problem:</dd>

<ul>
<li>The answer is that subdividing by state is mainly helpful for organization when it subdivides a large number of articles. When only a small number are subdivided, though, it just adds an extra layer of division that makes it harder for readers to find the article they're looking for because rather than having one page worth to scan, they instead have numerous subcategories to browse each of which is on its own page. So I think it's best to hold off on this sort of subdivision until it's actually needed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:48, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I think that's the nub of it. What I don't understand is why having said on 12 December that you woudn't create subcats "until largeness of cats suggests it", you then created on December 19 another single-article subcategory (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Methodist_bishops_of_the_Buenos_Aires_Area&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Methodist_bishops_of_the_Buenos_Aires_Area&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>). <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMethodist_bishops_b545.html" title="Category:Methodist bishops">Category:Methodist bishops</a> only contains 22 articles not already sub-categorised, so largeness does not seem to be an issue.</dd>
<dd>I have no doubt that many more articles <i>could</i> be written on Methodist bishops, and I expect that you will write more, which is great. But the categories should be created when enough articles exist to make the categories helpful, not before. A situation where there are more categories than articles is deeply unhelpful, both to readers and to other editors. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I see that Pastorwayne has not ceased to create categories despite your messages to him.

<dd>I think that would be very useful. I hoped that we might avoid admin action by starting a dialogue, but I have been disappointed that <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> doesn't seem interested in engaging in dialogue. When I have made CFD nominations, I followed recommended practice and left a note on his talk page linking directly to the CFD, but as you can see above the response was to ask me where the discussions were, and then silence. Similarly, I had no response to my request to him to desist from creating categories.</dd>
<dd>I was particularly disappointed that when we were discussing Category:United Methodist bishops by Episcopal Area, he didn't mention <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_Methodist_bishops_by_Jurisdiction_050b.html" title="Category:United Methodist bishops by Jurisdiction">Category:United Methodist bishops by Jurisdiction</a>, which was the obviously solution. But it seems that as fast as we can delete the superfluous categories, he is busy creating new ones, and the result is the categorisation of anything Methodist remains an almighty mess. (I have to say that I find it rather bad manners of PW to keep on creating new categories when so many of his most creations are up for CFD, usually without so much as a comment from him. I don't know what he is trying to achieve, but he must be aware that this is very bad practice).</dd>
<dd>He now seems to be extending his efforts beyond Methodists: see today's creations of <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_Brethren_ca5a.html" title="Category:American Brethren">Category:American Brethren</a> and its sub-cats. Again, these categories are a mess: none of them are even linked to a category for the churches themselves, and there is no reason to believe that the membership of these churches needs to be sub-categorised by nationality. I will nominate them all for CFD when I get the time, unless someone else beats me to it.</dd>
<dd>Given the lack of dialogue and the continued creation of categories which are at best ill-considered, I can't see much alternative to admin action, much as I would like to avoid that. So a list of merged/deleted categories would be very useful, particularly if it was balanced (as you suggested earlier) with a list of categories he created which were <i>not</i> deleted, so that people can get an idea of the proportions. Once we have that, I suggest asking other people from CFD to offer their comments and suggestions before taking the issue to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> — it might be that someone else could have had more luck than I have had with dialogue.</dd>
<dd>But I think that the only way we can unravel the mess of methodist categories is by stopping PW from creating new ones and I think that a ban would need to apply to all categories (not just religious ons), because his actions in the other fields are equally disruptive. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 14:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here I am! What dialogue do you want to have? I am more than willing. Indeed, when a cat was CFD'ed I almost always offered my 2cents worth. Obviously, I am always outvoted. But when I did leave messages, no one (with very, very few exceptions) offered any dialogue. You speak of dialogue. Let's have some!! If there is a place to discuss the value of creating a new cat, I am very willing to visit such a place and have a discussion before such creation. Indeed, I believe I asked YOU specifically about such a procedure. But no dialogue even about that! I create cats and subcats in keeping with the official guidelines for such (in places where I have some knowledge and expertise, and where it seems logical to have such cats/subcats). I have absolutely NO intention of being disruptive or harmful to wikipedia. Please accept my sincerest apology for any such misunderstandings! Apparantly all editing on wikipedia is subject to majority rule (of those who have an opinion), rather than subject only to the logic of having such cats/subcats.

<dd>In the same time period, you have created dozens of new categories, many of which have been nominated for CFD. Any CFDs which I have started have been accompanied by a notice on your talk page, at <a href="../../../p/a/s/User_talk%7EPastorwayne_f54c.html#CFD_for_Category:Episcopacy_in_Christianity_and_some_sub-categories" title="User talk:Pastorwayne">User talk:Pastorwayne#CFD for Category:Episcopacy_in_Christianity_and_some_sub-categories</a>. On most of the recent CFDs, you have not even offered a comment, let alone provided any explanation of what you are trying to achieve. That is surprising, but I'm afraid that to continue creating new categories while you don't respond to CFDs or to calls to stop is at best rude, and at worst intentionally disruptive.
<dl>
<dd>please try to understand me feeling <i>attacked</i> by all these CFD's. I have offered some explanation/defence. But after a while, after so many are nominated, one can only offer the same ideas so many times. I had hoped with ALL of them that the LOGIC of having these cats and subcats would speak for itself. Evidently such logic is overruled by a belief by others in the unhelpfulness of such cats/subcats. So, if you or others think these bad cats, then who am I to stop what you think is better? <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 15:34, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PW, your understanding of what categories are appropriate is clearly very different from anyone else's. By participating in CFDs, you might learn how categories can be created which are useful and do not get deleted. And by "participating", I mean just that: explain <i>why</i> you created the category, and why you think it should stay. I don't mean simply reading the discussion and moving on to create another round of categories which themselves end up being rapidly nominated for CFD: that, to my mibd, is ignoring the debate.</dd>
<dd>So, I ask again: please Pastorwayne: will you <b>stop creating new categories</b>? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, it is impractical to respond to EVERY CFD. You who nominate them must know what you are doing. I appreciate your telling me that you are nominating them. When I have something to say, I say it. But since so many of these CATS are similar, what I say for one generally applies to all of them.</p>
<p>Nor, for that matter, can I necessarily respond to every single message, either. I am willing to engage in dialogue. But I am not sure I can answer every question, especially perhaps not to your satisfaction. I am constantly learning. I strive to offer only what seems helpful. Evidently much of it is not. That helps me learn, too.</p>
<p>I appreciate, also, allowing us all to get through Christmas before going further with all of this. I know I have much yet to do before Christmas and will be here less. Thank you!

<dd>PW, if you have time to create the categories, you have time to participate in the CFDs. If you have time to create lots of new categories, you have time to respond to discussions about the problems they cause. That doesn't require any xtra time from you: it could be done simply by responding to CFDs etc <i>before</i> creating new categories.</dd>
<dd>I am also very disappointed that you say "since so many of these CATS are similar, what I say for one generally applies to all of them". If you agree that hey are so similar, why on earth are you continuing to create categories so similar the ones deleted?</dd>

I do regret that this has been necessary, but having looked at PW's latest round of category creations, I really can't see that there is any alternative to seeking a ban. Not only is there a whole slew of new categories, many of them of very tenuous utility (such as Category:Non-combatant people of World War I, which potentially includes the overwhelming majority of the several billion people alive at that time), but there is also a batch of categs of bishops by episcopal area, even though there was a previous decision at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">CFD</a> to delete such categs for now ... and all the new ones include just one article. At this point I have to conclude that there are only two possible explanations: either PW really is not capable of understanding what categories are for, <i>or</i> that he does understand but is determined to ignore the conventions. Either way, it's now time to place a block on this activity, which has been far too disruptive for too long. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 14:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You continually point out (in CfD's) that something should be deleted because it is "yet another example of [my] ill-conceived cats..." or something like that. I appreciate that you find me illequiped to create cats. But just because I created a cat is no reason for it to be deleted. Vote on deletions based on the merits of the cat itself. It matters not who created it, or why, or if such creation was illconceived, etc. It matters only if it is a good cat or not. Please refrain from including such attacks. I believe you are as bad at not assuming good faith as you believe I am at being "disruptive" in cat creation! Thanks. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 20:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>PW, I do wish that you would read those CFDs. I am not aware of any instance where I have recommended deletion solely on the grounds of it being one of your ill-conceived categs, though I have on many occasions mentioned the fact because I think it is important to draw the attention to other contributors the fact that so much of the traffic at CFD results from your disruptive editing practices. If I have on occasion failed to mention other reasons, it becasuse I have agreed with the reasons cited by others, and rather than recite the list again, it is sometimes quicker to point people to the pattern of your disruptive category-creation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, you are also mistaken in calling these "personal attacks". I have criticised your actions, not you as a person, and I hope that you understand the difference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On your second point (about good faith), let me be direct and blunt. (But before continuing, please read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, particularly where it says in bold <b>This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I asumed good faith for months. When others were calling for a ban on you, I was the one who tried to start a dialogue with you, but I got no response from you until I issued you with a formal warning about a related technical matter. When you eventually responded, I pleaded with you, repeatedly, to stop creating new categories, and to start by discussing them first. Despite the fact that scores of categories you had created were being nominated successfully for deletion, and that your disruptiveness as being widely commented-on, you cntinued to create new categories at a truly phenomenal rate, most of which ended up at CFD, where most were deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At that point, any person acting in good faith would have stopped categ-creation and sought dialogue. But instead of responding to my repeated pleas to you to stop, you set to at the end of December 2006 and created dozens of more categories, most of which were subsequently deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PW, your actions have gotten to a point where anyone assuming good faith could do so only by ignoring the evidence. Instead of whining about being the subject of what you mistakenly call personal attacks, why not simply stop being this disruptive creation of scores of inappropriate categories, and take time to learn how the categorisation system works?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your disruptiveness has consumed a lot of the time of a lot of other editors. Rather than complaining about the editors who are giving up their time to tidy up the mess you have been creating, I suggest that as a Christian minister you might find it helpful to read <a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/7-3.htm" class="external text" title="http://bible.cc/matthew/7-3.htm" rel="nofollow">Matthew 7:3</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Brown Haired Girl</p>
<p>I came across your user page while researching something, and noted tht you are 1. an administrator 2. sane 3. you are enthusiastic about accuracy. I would be interested in your opinion on a question of spelling I encountered while trying to contribute to the entry on <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipu_Sultan_c2f4.html" title="Tipu Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>. I noticed that another user <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> had systematically altered the spelling in the article from 'Tipu' to 'Tippu'. When I queried this, he argued that the spelling was a matter for Mysore residents and 'natives'. The discussion/argument we had may be read at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tipu_Sultan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tipu_Sultan" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. I think it is wrong that the spelling in this article is now at odds with modern historical writing on Tipu Sultan. But I can see that questions of spelling &amp; transliterations of Indian names have a political &amp; cultural dimension. I would be interested in your opinion.

<dd>Sorry for the slow, reply, Mick. I did take a look at this, but couldn't quite get my head around how to establish authoritative sources either way. I have a lot of sympathy with the notion of using native-acceptable transliterations, but would want sources, and I think thatn the issue here is what sources are avaialble to support "Tippu".

<dd>Sorry for the slow reply, and for misunderstanding your suggestion: I thought you meant place all in states categories, not just those where numbers justify it. But I'm still not sure that you will get any useful categories that way: the most nuclear-generator-populated state is Illinois, with six plants, and the next is Pennsylvania with five (there several with four), and all of hose are too small for my liking.</dd>
<dd>The more I look at the possible NRC names, the less I like any of them, but that ugly subdivision does have some use and it does divide the list a bit.</dd>
<dd>However, I still think that the best idea is to start by creating power station categories for every state, and then see if those need subdivision by type.

<dd>The change is made and I like getting rid of titles like 'NRC Region 1' that provided no information. The way it was closed sounded encouraging for more work. I'd thought that I might go look at the breakdown by state sometime this weekend, but based on your research I agree that breaking them down by state wouldn't be helpful.</dd>
<dd>The biggest problem that I see with the region breakdown is it is difficult for laypeople to put articles in the proper categories. I found an image at <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/region-state/" class="external text" title="http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/region-state/" rel="nofollow">nrc.gov</a> that I'm going to upload and put on the main page that will help with the subcategorizing.</dd>
<dd>It would probably be possible, since the regions break on state boundaries to create the state categories (as needed) within the region categories. At a later point we could decide whether to remove the regions as a middle layer. I'm not going to do that now.</dd>
<dd>I will also look into whether it makes sense to create power station categories for some/all of the states and start that work.</dd>

In addition, the respective data are mostly in the opening of an article, so in these cases the Persondata is only a repetition (if there is an infobox in the article, we still have a copy more). In any case only few people use it, I think, however for these your work will be very sensible and usefull.

<p>I've been giving some thought to these bishops. It seems hopeless to try to lever all these 'UM' people into a single coherent scheme whereas to start with constituents and move up looks feasible.</p>
<p>We have <a href="../../../b/i/s/Category%7EBishops_of_the_Methodist_Episcopal_Church_2a77.html" title="Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church">Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Category%7EBishops_of_the_Methodist_Episcopal_Church%2C_South_2bcb.html" title="Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South">Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a> (the 2nd a split from the first) for instance.</p>
<p>I thought (cf UK MPs) that it would clarify matters if we called them Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church 1784-1939 and Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South 1844-1939 (if this is correct, of course).</p>
<dl>
<dd>For what its worth, the M.E.Church, South did not in fact organize until 1845. Some Bishops went with it (from the M.E. Church), but it did not elect its own (new) Bishops until 1846. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 14:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think your view is that someone pre-1968 shouldn't have UM anywhere in the cats at the bottom. So someone who was a Bishop of X just goes into cat Bishops of X xxxx-yyyy, in an obvious fashion.</p>

</dl>
<p>(I was not thinking of subcats, but subcats of Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church 1784-1939 could be made using some relevant subdivisions of the era.)</p>
<p>Does this sound OK? If so, the UM church would be Category:Bishops of the United Methodist Church 1968-? (post 1968? 1968 onwards?). (No em dashes. That was a surprising suggestion.)</p>

<p>Since the lineage of The United Methodist Church generally coalesces, it makes most sense for there to be one category, "Bishops of The United Methodist Church and its predecessors". If someone wants to label each person with the contemporary denomination, so be it. The main divergence occurs with the departure of the Wesleyan Church in the early 19th century. Not sure how many bishops, if any, left the main branch at that time.</p>
<p>Maintaining separate categories for episcopacy of the various ancestral denominations over the years is awfully messy and of doubtful usefulness. JoelleSatz 15:06, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I have been thinking about "clergy" as a categorization. It often gets placed in occupation cats. But it really isn't an occuption. Pastor, minister, Bishop, etc. are all occupations (which are usually done by a clergy-person). But clergy is more of a status or achievement. Almost like an academic degree, though obviously not that exactly. A clergy is a person who is ordained or licensed or in another way "set-apart" for some work of ministry, etc. But "clergy" says nothing about WHAT work. It is not an occupation. It is like someone achieving a certain level of training or recognition in a profession, but not the profession itself.</p>
<p>I wonder if you have any thoughts about a better way to categorize clergy? I know, you don't want more categories. And maybe this is too esoteric (sp.?) for the average wikipedian. But you are wise in these ways. I'd be interested to know what you think.

<dd>Hi PW, just a quick reply because I'm in the middle of a big <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_UK_Parliament_constituencies_3ca4.html#Categories_for_establishment_and_abolition" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK Parliament constituencies">recategorisaton of UK Parliamentary constituencies</a> ... but my initial inclination is to think that while you have a point, it's not really one which helps us make workable categories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have just looked at the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a>'s definition of clergy, and it offers a lot of variations, including:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The clerical estate or order
<ul>
<li>The clerical order; the body of men set apart by ordination for religious service in the Christian church; opposed to laity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The priestly order in the Jewish and other non-Christian religions.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that the second of those is how it is most widely used: "the body of men set apart by ordination for religious service". Obviously, those so set apart have a variety of functions: liturgical, pastoral, administrative, academic, educational etc. (Amongst my own relatives who were clergy, I can think people whose jobs at various times would have fitted neatly into each of those headings).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are other similar profesions, and maybe a good comparison would be "medical doctor". People are trained as doctors, and qalify as such; but after further training they may work as surgeons (of many difft sorts), physicians (in the UK, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_practitioner.html" title="General practitioner">General practitioners</a>), psychiatrists etc. The difference there is that extra formal training is required, whereas a clergywoman or man is usually licensed to perform most of the roles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that since the average clergyperson may without further qulaification perform some or all of the roles (liturgical, pastoral, administrative, academic, educational), that what you suggest would require a whole extra dimension of categorisation for each individual ... so that as well as categorising someone as a Methodist minister, they would also be clasified as on or moe of a pastor, administrator, etc (depending on waht jobs they actually did). I'm not sure that so much detail in categories is really helpful: it seems to me that this is too much detail for the category system, and that in most cases the dedatild info will not be available from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, answering your question, yes I do think that it is too esoteric <i>in most cases</i>. But there are some aspects of a clergyperson's work which may merit separate classification, such as accademic work (and we already have useful categories for some of that). But labelling a clergyman as (for example) a pastor or preacher will be tautological in the vast majority of cases. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 14:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not understanding your objections. All 9 districts listed in the Historic Districts of Ontario category ceased to exist by 1849, years before Ontario ever existed.

<p>Hi Brownhairedgirl. Just a bit of into really. Both these pages have the older 'Fife West' &amp; 'Fife East' Designator within the body of page to a large degree still, mainly in the info boxes titles but also in reference to past by-elections throughout the page. I assume you have the automated tools to deal with this. If not I'll get around to sorting sometime in the next few weeks.

<dd>I'm glad some else spotted this!

<dd>Thanks for your help. It might be useful to give an example like this on the guidance page. Whilst we're on the topic, how would you represent a box where an MP serves with several people during his elected period (e.g. the box for Hay would have him serving alongside Pitt, along with the 2nd Vis. Gage (twice) and Sir William Gage, Bt). Would you just list each one with the relevant dates (i.e. it just seems a bit overly complex)? Stephennt 15:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more - would just like your advice as to whether you'd rate the office of Gov. General (Viceroy) as a Policital or a Government Office? It seems to me it should be Political, even though it's not an elected post, as it's not really the post of a Civil Servant either.Stephennt 15:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I haven't read it, but Cronin has long been on my must-read-someday list, so I have just ordered it. It does look rather suitable! But actually, the thing this makes me think of is all my relatives who were missionaries. I try to stay off too much discussion with them about it, because I have a rather difft take on it all. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for your recent edit to the above, I try to fix up dates to [dd mm yy] too if I am editing a page; I'm Australian so we use that order too. You did make a <i>little</i> typo, you left off the "d" in "ndash" - Do you (g)nash you teeth?? I read about using the ndash character from the insert menu below the edit box and I use that, saves typos!. I have fixed up <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hart%2C_senior_9ba6.html" title="John Hart, senior">John Hart, senior</a> birth/death dates (after using another source to get the exact d.o.b.) to read:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>([[25 February]] [[1809]] – [[28 January]] [[1873]])<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>(Note the ndash is inserted from the "Insert:" line, not typed from the keyboard.</p>
<p>I also used the lifetime and DEFAULTSORT templates as shown below, may be of interest to save having to specify the sort for each category:<br />
{{lifetime|1809|1873|Hart, John}}<br />
{{DEFAULTSORT:Hart, John}}<br />
[[Category:Premiers of South Australia]]<br />
[[Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George]]</p>
<p>You have to use firstname, lastname in 'lifetime'; the DEFAULTSORT won't work with it. Can save a bit of time though were multiple categories are used. ---- <a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDiverman_0055.html" title="User:Diverman">Diverman</a> 20:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Diverman for fixing that typo. I usually do use DEFAULTSORT, but for some reason I don't like lifetime; maybe it's because it requires separate indexing, and one the advantages of DEFAULTSORT is that it simplifoe sindexing and reduces the chance of error, but my main objection is that it doesn't <i>look</i> like a category entry, which makes it less readily visible to me. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 00:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Dierman, I'm afraid that it was a wrong move: see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html#Other_non-royal_names.29" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)#Other_non-royal_names)</a>, baronets are an exception to the general principle of not including homorifics in article names. So I have moved both Eardley-Wilmots back again.</dd>
<dd>In this case, the links are noiw correct again, but in general, the advice is not to bypass redirects <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html#Don.27t_fix_links_to_redirects_that_aren.27t_broken" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect#Don.27t_fix_links_to_redirects_that_aren.27t_broken</a>.

<p>Thanks for sorting this out. I must admit to having been reluctant to use moving when I could use cut and paste - but I can see the point of it, of course. Put it down to a mixture of laziness, ignorance and impulsiveness (I am a bear of little brain, and long words bother me ...) . The only other time I have done this was when I shifted the text of <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aceldama.html" title="Aceldama">Aceldama</a> to <a href="../../../a/k/e/Akeldama.html" title="Akeldama">Akeldama</a> (which seems to be the version used by most modern sources). The edit summary does clearly explain that this was done, so looking at the history of both pages should show this. I also included some of the text from <a href="../../../h/a/c/Haceldama.html" title="Haceldama">Haceldama</a> (which is the same subject) in Aceldama before I did this.

<p>Sorry but according to my understanding of the MOS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louth_by-election%2C_1969&amp;diff=107381702&amp;oldid=107009587" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louth_by-election%2C_1969&amp;diff=107381702&amp;oldid=107009587" rel="nofollow">your edit</a> is incorrect.

However I'm not going to get into an argument over which way round should be used. But your addition of an ordinal suffix is specifically listed as an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Incorrect_date_formats" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">incorrect date format</a>.

<dd>I don't usually argue about which way round they should go, but when someone is editing articles specifically to impose the American format on an article about a British topic, I do object per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Disputes_over_style_issues" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Disputes_over_style_issues</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 22:14, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I am not referring to whether 8 comes before December or after.

<dd>Thanks v. much for that clarification. In my experience, "I'm not going to get into an argument about this" usually means something on a spectrum from "this is unimportant", via "you haven't persuaded me, but whatever" to "I couldn't care less what you say, you *^%%$$%!", but I'm glad to see that I read that wrongly here.

<p>I admit I follow the pages you create. I find parliamentary history quite interesting, and its facinating to see the many pages etc you create. One question I would like to ask if I may; In the many unopposed by-elections during the War, when there was only one candidate I presume the public didn't vote? Was the candidate then declared winner on the day by-election would have taken place? --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 09:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the basic answer is yes.</dd>
<dd>The purpose of a parliamentary election is to allow the electorate to choose between candidates when there are more candidates than seats, so when the number of candidate matches the number of seats, there is no choice to be made, and hence no need for a vote. The only exception that I am aware of to that principle in parliamentary elections is the system which used to exist in the USSR, where voters always had the opportunity to reject all the candidates; an election was held even if there was only one candidate, so that the electorate could vote "none of the above". I rather like that possibility&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>In the unreformed House of Commons, it was common for two-member constituencies to be carved up by agreement: the Whigs and Tories might agree to each nominate only one candidate, so that both could avoid the cost of a contested election. When there were no limits on campaign spending, the costs could be high: the government as so determined to defeat the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig.html" title="Whig">Whig</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_James_Fox_c5a4.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_3ec3.html" title="Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)">Westminster constituency</a> that
<dl>
<dd>"The Treasury spent the enormous sums of more than £8,000 in 1780 and £9,000 in 1784, in unsuccessful attempts to defeat the opposition Whig leader Charles James Fox. So expensive were these contests that for the next general election in 1790, the government and opposition leaders reached a formal agreement for each to have one member returned unopposed." (see <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_3ec3.html#History" title="Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)">Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)#History</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The only thing I am uncertain about is exactly when a candidate is declared elected if there is no contest. The usual process nowadays is for a voting day to be set when nominations are opened; if nominations close without the need for an election, there are three possibilities for when the candidate is declared elected: the point at which nominations closed, the last day for nominations to be withdrawn (if that possibility exists, which I think it does in some elections), or the designated polling day. I'm afraid that I don't know which applies here.</dd>
<dd>Hope this helps!

<p>Thanks for your note, I've responded on the CfD page. Perhaps we're approaching this from quite divergent angles. I have a background in UK Constitutional Law so I am perhaps prone to take a somewhat legalistic approach to these questions, however I really can't see any acceptable reason to describe the Assembly as a Parliament.</p>
<p>The prime authority is the Act of Parliament which established the body, the Government of Wales Act 1998. Nowhere does this Act use the term 'Parliament' to describe the Assembly. As such I think that it is thoroughly inappropriate to suggest otherwise within Wikipedia (OR, etc).</p>
<p>I really do think than in terms of Law, we must strive to be exact. It may be that some might refer to the Assembly constituencies as 'Parliamentary', however they are wrong. The Law sets things out in fairly black-and-white terms, and if this encyclopaedia is to fulfil its aims, it has to reflect this.</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that despite your background in Constitutional Law, you have missed the point here, and I suggest that you re-read <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_February_13_0369.html#Westminster_constituencies_in_Wales" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 February 13">the nomination</a>: <b>this is <i>not</i> a proposal to categorise the NAW constituencies as "Parliamentary"</b>. The Welsh Assembly constituencies are named and categorised as such: it would be quite wrong to label them otherwise, because (as you rightly point out), the body is called "The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assembly_for_Wales_2e41.html" title="National Assembly for Wales">National Assembly for Wales</a>".<br />
The purpose of the nomination is to clarify the distibction between the Assembly and the Westminster Parliament names of the categories containing the constituencies of the Westminister Parliament, by giving them a more specific name which is still entirely accurate.<br />
As a constitutional lawyer, you will be alert to distinction in names, and a political operator, It's stuff I eat and breathe too. All I am trying to do here is to clariffy the issues for the readers who may not be so familiar with the distinction. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 01:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
