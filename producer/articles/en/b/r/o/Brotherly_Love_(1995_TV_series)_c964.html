<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherly_Love_%281995_TV_series%29_c964.html" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>
<p><i>Brotherly Love</i> starred the Lawrence Brothers (Joey, Matthew, and Andrew) as three brothers with a widowed mother, or, more precisely, an older half-brother, two much-younger half brothers, and a <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widow.html" title="Widow">widowed</a> mom/step-mom (<a href="../../../m/e/l/Melinda_Culea_a825.html" title="Melinda Culea">Melinda Culea</a>). Both stepmother Claire and big brother Joe were naturally take-charge types, and the late father had left Joe one-fourth of his car customizing business, so naturally there was some conflict. Another subplot involved Joe's fighting his attraction to Louise David (<a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Vassey_37db.html" title="Liz Vassey">Liz Vassey</a>), a female mechanic who worked at the business.</p>
<p>The series is about a family of 4, Joe, Matt, Andy, and Claire. Along with Lou Davis, and Lloyd Burwell. The show takes place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but it was filmed in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Pedro%2C_California_5d03.html" title="San Pedro, California">San Pedro, California</a>. They struggle through problems of their own due to running a small-time customizing business.</p>
<p>Joe Roman is a 20 year old motorcycle racer who lived on the road ever since his parents separated when he was very young. A year removed from the auto accident that killed Joey's dad, he returns to the Philly to claim his portion of his dad's automobile repair garage. Joe finds he just can't leave.</p>
<p>Joey last saw his step family at the funeral. Joe's step mom Claire has been trying hard to keep the garage afloat and look after the family.</p>
<p>Joe's half-brothers are in need of a father figure as 15 year old Matt seems to have every intention of making his traumatic teen years as dramatic as possible and 7 year old Andy is a bundle of mischief and vivid imagination who needs a strong hand to help him through life.</p>
<p>The garage is slowly going downhill because Claire is not the best business person. The two shop mechanics Lloyd and Lou are not much help. Lovable Lloyd is a few spark plugs short of an engine, and Lou is a feisty intellectual who's absorbed in creating her conceptual art when she's not under a car.</p>
<p>After coming home, Joe discovers the family he has never known needs and he likes it. With so many new responsibilities and adjustments to make, sometimes life with his family is bumpier than Joe's roughest motorcycle race, but love and laughter make it all worth while.</p>
