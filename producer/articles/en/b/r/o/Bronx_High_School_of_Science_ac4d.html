Original Bronx Science Building (1938-1958)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Bronx High School of Science was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> as a specialized science and math high school for boys, by resolution of the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Education_of_the_City_of_New_York_7767.html" title="Board of Education of the City of New York">Board of Education of the City of New York</a>, with <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_Meister_724d.html" title="Morris Meister">Dr. Morris Meister</a> as the first principal and guiding light of the school. They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street. The building, built in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walton_High_School_%28New_York_City%29_1504.html" title="Walton High School (New York City)">Walton High School</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>) and by an annex of <a href="../../../d/e/w/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School_37c3.html" title="DeWitt Clinton High School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>). The initial faculty were comprised in part by a contingent from <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Dr. Meister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors "green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_High_School_of_Science_ac4d.html" title="Edit section: Expansion to co-education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion to co-education</span></h3>
<p>Bronx Science started with about 150 ninth year students and 250 tenth year students, the remaining facilities of the building being used by DeWitt Clinton. As Science became larger, the Clinton contingent was gradually returned to its own main building. During their joint occupation, which lasted for 2 years, until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, the two schools had separate teaching staff and classes, but the same supervision and administration.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, as a result of the efforts of Dr. Meister, the faculty, and the Parents Association, the school became co-ed, preceding its rival schools Stuyvesant (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>) by 23 years, and Brooklyn Tech (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>) by 26 years. This opened the doors to gifted and talented girls of New York, giving them equal opportunity to pursue a quality education in a specialized high school, previously denied to them.</p>
<p>In February <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, Dr. Morris Meister, after 20 years as the principal of the school, resigned to become the first president of the newly organized <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_Community_College_fb58.html" title="Bronx Community College">Bronx Community College</a>. Dr. Alexander Taffel succeeded Dr. Meister as principal.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, a campaign for a new building was conducted by the Parents Association, and sparked by the tireless dedication of Dr. Meister. Working with the Board of Education and the City of New York took twenty years to see the dream become a reality, but under Dr. Taffel's guidance, plans were finally completed for a new building specifically designed and equipped for the Bronx High School of Science. The new building would be on 205th Street near Bedford Park Boulevard, in a predominantly institutional area, commonly referred to as the "Educational Mile" between DeWitt Clinton High School and its large football field on one side, and Harris Field and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_College_78be.html" title="Hunter College">Hunter College</a> (now <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehman_College_2b16.html" title="Lehman College">Lehman College</a>) on the other. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, students and faculty occupied the new building for the first time, solving the problem of how to move the books from the old library to the new in typical Bronx Science manner: on Friday afternoon each student took home five library books from the old building, and on Monday returned them to the new one.</p>
<p>They entered a school equipped with the most modern facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories, classrooms, and technical studio areas, all designed to the specific needs of the specialized Bronx Science curriculum. Gracing the main lobby entrance was a large, 63-foot, Venetian glass mosaic mural depicting major figures from the history of science such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Curie_d2ae.html" title="Marie Curie">Marie Curie</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> under the protective hands of a God-like figure representing knowledge, with this quote from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dewey_0ff3.html" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>: "Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination". The mural is an original work of art by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_J._Reilly_d1bc.html" title="Frank J. Reilly">Frank Reilly</a> entitled <i>Humanities Protecting Biology, Physics, Chemistry</i>, reflecting the breadth of the school's mission: to excel not only in the sciences and mathematics for which it was founded, but also in the humanities. Legions of students over the years, bemoaning the lack of swimming facilities, have sarcastically referred to the mural as "the Science swimming pool", perpetuating the idea - perhaps apochryphal - that a choice was made to fund a mural rather than a pool in the new building; but the mural continues to epitomize the special nature of the Bronx High School of Science.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The move was not without incident. In the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_gangs_%281950s-1960s%29.html" title="Bronx gangs (1950s-1960s)">youth street gangs</a> were coming to the school, and that the Fordham Baldies would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did happen that spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in skimpy shorts/t-shirts (which probably showed less than in the average high school in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>), some students from the neighboring, all-male <a href="../../../d/e/w/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School_37c3.html" title="DeWitt Clinton High School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a> charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors for the remainder of that year.</p>
<p>When Bronx Science celebrated its silver anniversary in June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Kennedy_acd6.html" title="President Kennedy">President Kennedy</a> hailed it as "a significant and pathfinding example of a special program devoted to the development of the student gifted in science and mathematics." The President had occasion to know the quality of the school's product since he had recently selected one of its graduates, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Brown_%28Secretary_of_Defense%29_cb7b.html" title="Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)">Dr. Harold Brown</a>, of the class of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, for the position of Director of Defense Research and Engineering; he'd later serve as Secretary of Defense under <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Carter_4b20.html" title="President Carter">President Carter</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, a popular Social Studies faculty member, Stuart Elenko, founded a Holocaust Museum and Studies Center at Bronx Science practically single-handedly. It has been funded by grants, donations, and the New York City Council. The Museum was one of the first of its kind in the United States, and houses an impressive collection of rare documents, photographs, artifacts and other material from the Nazi era; the Studies Center sponsors speakers and puts together and distributes educational materials about the Holocaust. The Museum has had over 60,000 visitors, and has received wide acclaim from leaders in the field. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the Museum celebrated its 25th Anniversary with a gala. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> an anonymous benefactor - an alumnus of the school - made a very large donation which is allowing the Museum to modernize and be totally revamped; eventually it will move out of the library where it now resides, and turned into a full-sized museum. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the Museum finally moved out of its original home into a larger space. It has upgraded its facilities to include a plasma television screen and a computer to display presentations about different topics related to the Holocaust. Renovations are still being made to improve the aesthetics of the new location.</p>
<p>Tours of the museum are given by students in the Holocaust Leadership Class to any guest that requests one, as well as to sophomore World History students. The Museum and the tours have received tremendous reviews and only add to the excellent educational experience.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>When Dr. Taffel retired in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, the chairman of the Biological Science Department, Dr. Milton Kopelman, became Principal. He remained so for over ten years.</p>
<p>Upon his retirement in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, long-time faculty member and Biology Assistant Principal Vincent Galasso became Principal. He was followed by Physical Science Department Assistant Principal Stanley Blumenstein, a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> graduate of Bronx Science.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> William Stark, a popular Assistant Principal of the Social Studies Department, was appointed Acting Principal. He was expected to move up to the Principal's office, when Chancellor Harold O. Levy decided to try to find a Nobel laureate to become Principal; that effort failed, and before being offered the job as Science's Principal, Stark accepted a job as Principal of Manhasset High School. Many faculty and parents were upset that Stark was not appointed in a timely way and thus had left the school; Vincent Galasso agreed to step up again, for one term, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>Although not a popular choice, Valerie J. Reidy, Assistant Principal of the Biology Department, was appointed Principal in September 2001; she is the first woman Principal in the school's history. Despite that distinction, she has been a controversial figure and still remains one.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Bronx High School of Science has a student body of about 2,800 students. Admission is based exclusively on an entrance examination, known as the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test_964d.html" title="Specialized High Schools Admissions Test">Specialized High Schools Admissions Test</a> (SHSAT),<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> open to all eighth and ninth grade New York City students interested in attending one of the specialized schools. Each year, thousands of students from the five boroughs of New York City take this comprehensive examination covering math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension, logical reasoning, unscrambling paragraphs). Out of the 26,000 students taking the entrance examination only about 700 are admitted to Science, based on a system of ranked scores.</p>
<p>The student body comprises an extremely diversified group: almost every ethnic group in New York City can be found at Bronx Science. Currently, about 60% of the school is of Asian descent. The students are fairly evenly split between males and females.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are no feeder patterns. All New York City students entering high school must apply to schools, as there are no zoning boundaries for high schools in New York City.</p>

<p>Bronx Science students take a rigorous, well-rounded, college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of life science (biology) and physical science (chemistry/physics), math, English, foreign language, social studies, and fine arts, with required courses and a wide selection of electives, including AP classes. Over 600 classes are offered.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Students have an opportunity to do independent research, and many compete in the annual <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Science_Talent_Search_1d86.html" title="Intel Science Talent Search">Intel Science Talent Search</a> (formerly known as "Westinghouse"). After the completion of four years at Bronx Science, and the fulfillment of the Bronx Science academic track, students graduate with a Bronx Science degree - more advanced and more prestigious than a typical New York State Regents Degree.</p>
<p>The basic science courses chosen are typically earth sciences, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>; many students choose to take the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_5c2b.html" title="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a> version of these courses, which allows for students to place out of introductory science courses in college. In the life sciences, the students have the additional option of taking a special "double honors" biology course, which features extra laboratory exposure. Science electives include microbiology, physiology, forensic science, human genetics, evolution, astronomy, organic chemistry, electronics and others.</p>
<p>In mathematics, beyond the standard AP courses in AB/BC <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, courses in multivariate calculus, probability and statistical inference, and computer science courses are among the choices.</p>
<p>Students take four years of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, which also allows for electives, including courses in <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_writing.html" title="Creative writing">creative writing</a> and AP English.</p>
<p>Social studies and history classes are required, and include US and world history, economics, with electives in psychology, law, finance, and global studies, among others.</p>
<p>Three years of languages are required. Bronx Science offers <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Language_5826.html" title="Russian Language">Russian</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Language_bfb9.html" title="Italian Language">Italian</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Greek_1ff0.html" title="Modern Greek">Modern Greek</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>, and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_language.html" title="Korean language">Korean</a>.

<p>Students are required to take Technical Drawing (formerly known as Mechanical Drawing) and a Science Techniques Laboratory course; technology courses include engineering and architectural drawing, telescope making, computerized graphics, robotics technology, and medical illustration. Art and Music Appreciation are also required courses, with a range of studio art electives and music performance electives available.</p>
<p>Health and Physical Education courses are also required, with many activities to choose from.</p>

<p>Along with a rigorous academic foundation and an array of extracurricular choices, students are provided with original research opportunities in the biological, physical, and social sciences, and programs that hone students' investigative skills and prepare them for academic competitions. Interested students may apply for research programs in their freshman year and begin a three-year sequence of voluntary work on their projects in their sophomore year. During this time, students collaborate with scientists at local laboratories to develop and complete an independent research project, usually concentrated during two summers. The program culminates in the writing of a scientific paper in the senior year, which is submitted to various competitions, such as the Intel Science Talent Search ("Westinghouse") competition. Since the inception of this prestigious national competition in 1942, often referred to as the "junior Nobel Prize," Bronx Science has accumulated the highest number of finalists, leading the nation with 125.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_High_School_of_Science_ac4d.html" title="Edit section: Dress code">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dress code</span></h3>
<p>The school's dress code has evolved over the years. Once boys were required to wear ties and "collar" shirts and not allowed to wear "patch-pocket" pants (jeans) or hats; girls were required to wear skirts or dresses, no matter what the weather. Offenders were sent home if they were not dressed according to the rules. Many girls walking to school in the winter along wind-swept Goulden Avenue between the Jerome Park Reservoir and Clinton's football field, wore slacks under their skirts and removed them when they arrived at school. Boots also had to be removed.</p>
<p>In 1968 the students successfully demanded that the dress code be relaxed; girls then were allowed to wear slacks and boys could wear t-shirts.</p>
<p>Today's students still are not allowed to wear hats (a NYC Department of Education rule), and the dress regulations are less specific, forbidding clothing that is "distracting", "offensive", or "degrading"; anything promoting drug use or offensive language is similarly banned; and "undergarments must not be visible, and tops and bottoms of outer garments must meet or overlap".<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx_High_School_of_Science_ac4d.html" title="Edit section: Faculty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Faculty</span></h2>
<p>The Bronx Science faculty is comprised of educators who represent one of the most highly qualified high-school teaching staffs in the world. Many hold advanced degrees, including the <a href="../../../p/h/2E/Ph.D._5b53.html" title="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a>, in their field, and many have taught or are capable of teaching at the college level. A unique and rigorous hiring process ensures a distinctly qualified staff: Unlike most New York City public schools, teachers are not hired according to seniority. Instead, teachers are interviewed and a committee of current teachers from the department meets to decide whether or not an individual upholds the qualities of a potential Bronx Science faculty member. So, although many new teachers are young and untenured, they come to the classroom familiar with the most up-to-date methods of instruction.</p>
<p>Strong alumni relations are apparent at Bronx Science. In fact, many teachers are alumni of the school: Michael Contente, the coordinator of the Department of Mathematics, is a 1966 graduate of Science; Jean M. Donahue, Ph.D., the assistant principal of the Department of Biology, is a 1977 graduate of Science; Fred Levy, the current assistant principal of the art, music, and technology departments, is also a graduate of Science; other members of the alumni-faculty include David Cohen (math and technology), Sherill Mirsky (math), and Polly Schoenfeld (English) among others. Distinction in the faculty of the Bronx High School of Science is also common. For example, one member of the Bronx Science faculty, Lateef O. Giwa, <a href="../../../m/2E/d/M.D._394d.html" title="M.D.">M.D.</a>, was a cardiothoracic surgeon for 39 years prior to becoming a science teacher at the school.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most teachers are approachable and willing to help students in any way possible. Students can speak to their teachers before and after class, or schedule a conference with their teachers during lunch or a free period. Students can also communicate with their teachers via <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a>, which is provided free of charge to the entire Bronx Science staff, faculty, and student body, through the school's extensive <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_network.html" title="Computer network">computer network</a>.</p>
<p>Many teachers also play an active role in the advancement of the school's vision. For example, Fanny K. Ennever, Ph.D., a teacher in the Physical Science Department and adjunct lecturer at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[20]</a></sup> was responsible for securing a $27,500 grant in both 2004 and 2005 for developing and modifying the Bronx Science chemistry laboratory curriculum, in order to make sessions less "cookbook" and more inquiry-based.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[21]</a></sup> Such faculty responsibility and initiative is not uncommon.</p>
