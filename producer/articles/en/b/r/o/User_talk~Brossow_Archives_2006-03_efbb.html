<p>I am concerned that this article violates the spirit of <a href="../../../l/%26/p/WP%7EL%26P_574c.html" title="WP:L&amp;P">our policy on lyrics and poetry</a> (although it is a video-game script rather than lyrics), because the text of the introduction is surely still copyrighted. The translations also seem like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If this is somehow open-source, it might be more suitable for Wikisource, but I am considering nominating the article for deletion and wanted to know if you had any thoughts.

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your concern, but there are several considerations here:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Avoid_copyright_paranoia" class="extiw" title="meta:Avoid_copyright_paranoia">Meta:Avoid copyright paranoia</a></li>
<li>These are neither lyrics nor poetry, not even in spirit.</li>
<li>These are used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> guidelines for both the <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> articles.</li>
<li>If translations are fair game for deletion as original research, I fear much of Wikipedia will need to disappear.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The text was originally found in the AYBABTU article but moved as it applies to both articles. The amount of space the text used in the AYBABTU article was also a major sticking point in its recent FAC debacle. There is a legitimate fair-use reason for the text to exist and there is a legitimate reason for it to exist as a separate page as stated above. With all due respect, to nominate the page for deletion seems mean-spirited and short-sighted. The text has existed on Wikipedia for years without issue and has survived similar suggestions in the past; to suddenly and unilaterally decide that it needs to go doesn't seem right. Again, with all due respect. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 14:09, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the claim that the use of the entire opening script to a video game constitutes legitimate fair use, and I do think I should go ahead and nominate the page for deletion. In reference to your individual concerns:
<ul>
<li>That meta page contains a debate among many interested parties, and is certainly not a settled issue. Further, I don't think this is "copyright paranoia", but rather a clear situation where copyrighted material has been reproduced in full.</li>
<li>I know they are not lyrics or poetry, but I think that the logic in that policy applies here, as it would to the reproduction of any other copyrighted script.</li>
<li>I'm not saying the translation is original research, but the presentation of several possible translations is, in my opinion, against the use of Wikipedia as a secondary source - we stop reporting what sources say and become our own source, which is the definition of original research.</li>
<li>I don't understand the claim that this is a "mean-spirited" move - to whom am I being mean? the article? If it's not the sort of material that belongs in Wikipedia, it doesn't hurt anyone to remove it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, it wouldn't be a unilateral decision; the decisions made by editors at Articles for Deletion are consensus decisions, and if consensus finds that the article should remain I would respect that decision.

<p>Brossow- I may need some help. I've spent part of the afternoon removing number of images that were uploaded by user:Take Me Higher, and placed by that user into articles. In some cases I reverted the article to its last good edit. In each case, the images were 1)unlicensed, 2)poor examples of the vehicles photographed. In some cases I removed them because snow mounds or snow covering blocked the vehicle. In four cases, I removed the images because bystanders either blocked the subjects, or had looks on their faces that I found distracting. I understand that I may have stepped on this users toes, but it takes a lot for me to devote this amount of time to correcting something of this scale. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">Stude62</a> 19:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed a couple unlicensed images in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Uplander_e1c4.html" title="Chevrolet Uplander">Chevrolet Uplander</a> and tagged them as such earlier today. I agree entirely that the photos are poor quality and have no business being offered as encyclopedic content. Whatever help you need, you've got it to the best of my abilities. An email link is above if you'd rather discuss anything privately to avoid stepping on toes.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 19:50, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure that it's going "well" but at least there's more positive than negative. Even the oppose votes, for the most part, say that I'm a great editor. The time requirement is fairly arbitrary given what I said above, but I can deal with it. Being an admin will allow me to contribute more, but if others feel that my help is not needed, I'll keep doing what I'm doing and try again later. What's bother ing me most are these new-user votes. I deleted one a few minutes ago and at this point, though it may sound paranoid, it <i>almost</i> feels like sabotage by someone opposed to my nomination.

<p>Hi, I appreciate your effort on image tagging - just wanted to let you know that we can assume that the "source" of a corporate logo such as Image:VCX.gif is the company itself, and the {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">logo</a>}} contains all the appropriate verbiage.

<dd>I understand that. My purpose in tagging them and notifying the uploaders rather than just doing it myself is so that the uploaders learn the proper way to do it. "Teach a man to fish" and all that. If we who already know the proper way to tag images simply assume the workload for ourselves, we've really done nothing to actually <i>stop</i> the problem and we're taking time away from other more proactive contributions to Wikipedia. That's my take on it, anyway.&#160;:-) <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 14:08, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would work if the uploaders were actually still around. If they're gone (which I personally define as "no edits for a month"), then there's nobody to educate, and the net result is that somebody else goes and does all the work again later. At some point we'll get caught up enough that we can do like commons and flag images within 24 hours, which will have a much better chance of informing uploaders. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 14:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A large number of the images I've tagged have subsequently been tagged by the uploaders. For others I've been notified by the uploaders that the images are no longer needed and can be deleted. In both situations, I feel that the uploaders have been educated and my time and effort was justified. Having said that, I'm not prepared to do a "background check" on each uploader to determine whether or not s/he is active before tagging each image. I understand that in many cases someone may have to come along later and tag the images properly if the original uploader can't or won't, but I think that extra effort is offset by the education of the others who've benefited from my tag-and-notify approach. I think it's just a difference in philosophy, and I don't have any problem with that at all; I hope you don't, either.&#160;:-) <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 14:45, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see you disagree with my math. I wrote a script that reads the link counts off the page and adds them up, calculates the percentage, etc. I have a few error checks (like making sure it counts the correct number of articles, doesn't find any zeros, etc.) to catch formatting glitches. Now, I haven't gone through the entire list manually to see which totals are correct, but I'll speculate that you haven't either.&#160;:-) You probably just worked off the last subtotal and added the recent entries; however, if there is an error way back in the earlier subtotals, you'll never catch it that way. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">(talk)</a> 23:14, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't total the whole list, but I went back three or four sections and re-totalled as no one had segregated and subtotalled the last complete block of ten, and the one before that had the section total correct but hadn't changed the grand total from the previous block. Anyway, I just ran the current list through Excel and get a total of 57,390 completed. Somewhere in there is a block of 9 instead of 10, too, according to Excel. I'm going to go through and fix it up. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 03:34, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've listed Studebaker Motor Company for AfD and am surprised to find that there is an effort to save the page by a user and a "new" user which posted its only comment to date on the AfD page, which is a good place for newbie start, don't you think? The writing for this article is on par with a grade schooler, as is the prose on the "company web site", both of which bears striking resemblence to the articles creator's style. I also found a "press release" on a Studebaker forum page in which the PR Department for the Studebaker Motor Company incorrectly spells "President". I can also find no state of incorporation, or address of record for the "company".</p>
<p>My concern for which is that Wikipedia is not a publicity tool, and while any company that would hope to manufacture a "car" in today's market, spelling, professional marketing, etc. would be high on their priority lists.</p>

In this case, however, it was such a mess with <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESettinghawk_10a9.html" title="User:Settinghawk">Settinghawk</a> ineptly defending "his" page that I felt it the best option in preserving a modicum of organization. Move it back if you think it can be managed, but as said user continues to blindly add commentary to the page I feel it best to keep it on the Talk page and ask said user to make his comments there, too. After all, is that not the reason for the Talk page's existence, to carry on discussions and make comments not directly related to the vote? A brief comment or two in response, sure, but a running dialog is not appropriate to the vote page, IMHO. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 18:47, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My comment about the "mess" wasn't directed at your efforts, BTW. Just thought I should mention that. It was the continued "additions" by the other user that made it an ongoing mess. Ideally, education of the user would occur and he'd learn how to more appropriately intersperse comments; however, I guess I wasn't feeling terribly optimisitc when I made the move. I don't know that it's too late to move the discussion back, but it looked like considerably more work than I'm feeling up to at the moment. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 19:28, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

You can weigh in on the issue on the DeSoto Airflow's talk page. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">Stude62</a> 21:26, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You got it! They're very different vehicles and should in no way be merged into the same article. There are many, MANY examples of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badge_engineering.html" title="Badge engineering">rebadged</a> vehicles that enjoy separate pages when in fact nothing more than plastic trim differentiates them. Suggesting these be merged is ridiculous. In his defense, the kid is only 16 and, while enthusiastic and eager to help, has made some questionable edits (IMHO, of course) that I'm in the process of cleaning up at this very moment.

<p>Hey, I saw your edit to your monobook.js on recent changes. Are you having problems with rollback now? There was a change in metawiki a few days ago that makes the rollback hang on IPs. If that is your problem, go to my monobook and check out the diff in my last change.

<dd>Thanks, but the problem I'm having is that on Special:Contributions pages the rollback link is not correct and looks like this:
<dl>
<dd>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Brossow/monobook.js&amp;fakeaction=rollback&amp;vandal=title=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Brossow/monobook.js&amp;fakeaction=rollback&amp;vandal=title=" rel="nofollow">Brossow</a>&amp;token=5a23f012c9572b3689d96a3cb8deb421"&gt;rollback]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>instead of saying <b>[Rollback]</b>. Clicking on the link gives this error on a new page:
<dl>
<dd>Please wait, reverting edits by title=...</dd>
<dd>Bad authentication token!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I get this error even using the straight script direct from Sam's page with no other modules/scripts. I've cleared my browser cache, of course, after each change. Maybe an issue with Javascript on my particular computer? I dunno. It appears that the URL is simply being written incorrectly by the script, but while I'm very good with HTML, I know jack squat about JS. (What I find most odd/frustrating is that the rollback link is perfectly fine on diff pages, and as far as I can tell from the JS code, it's using exactly the same code to generate the link on each page (diff &amp; Spec:Contr, that is).) I'll mess with it on my Windows XP machine at work on Monday if I remember, but for the most part I edit on my Mac mini running OS X 10.4.5 and the latest Firefox. Certainly not a major deal, but frustrating nevertheless. On the plus side, everything else is FINALLY working the way I wanted in terms of scripts/modules....</dd>
<dd>I should also note that rollback links have NEVER worked right for me on Spec:Contr pages. Until tonight, I always got an error on diff pages, too, about a wrong token (even though the link itself appeared normal). That seems to be resolved with my latest changes to my monobook.js page. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 04:44, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, check out the code in my monobook.js it works with the latest version of FF. It will NOT work on Internet Explorer. The latest code on Sam's page doesn't work with the latest version.

<dd>Just tried it, but unfortunately it makes the rollback link disappear completely from diff pages yet doesn't fix the Spec:Contr rollback link problem. (I'm out of patience and energy tonight to troubleshoot further.) Guess I'll just stick with using Lupin's popups to revert when needed instead. No big deal.

<p>Stop right now please and modify your AWB find/replace filters. You are inserting nbsp's instead of spaces in a template. This is not necessary and makes the code very difficult to read.

<dd>Nonbreaking spaces keep units of measure tied to the numbers with which they are associated. Thus, if there is a line break it keeps the unit with the number, which actually makes it easier to read, not more difficult. Not sure I see your beef, and I hope you don't just do a mass reversion as I'm afraid it will get caught again as I replace <b>[[General Motors]]</b> with <b>[[General Motors Corporation]]</b> to avoid the redirect. If you can explain how it causes a problem, aside from your perception that it makes the code harder to read (certainly the vast majority of Wikipedia readers aren't reading the source code), I'll gladly take it into consideration. With all due respect, however, unless there's a clear reason NOT to do this I have no intention of stopping as, clunkier code aside, it makes things more readable for the end user. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 06:10, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do a significant amount of work on the back end in WP:Air so nbsp's are a major pain when reading and editing specs both manually and with AWB (a few extra seconds per article really adds up when you do 1,500 of them). Sorry I missed the GMC link in the Wildcat article. I did catch it in the XB-39. - <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEmt147_6c59.html" title="User:Emt147">Emt147</a> <a href="../../../e/m/t/User_talk%7EEmt147_88d0.html" title="User talk:Emt147"><small><sup>Burninate!</sup></small></a> 06:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But once those specs are in place, I assume that they're not a source of perpetual change. Given that, I don't see how the benefit for the reader of nonbreaking space as described above is outweighed by the slight inconvenience for an editor who quite likely shouldn't need to change the specs once the initial edit has been made. I apologize for any inconvenience my edits have caused you personally, but at this point I'm not convinced that your convenience is more important than assuring proper and legible display for end users.

<p>Please do not remove non-printing spaces and blank lines in articles, as you recently did for <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youngstown%2C_Ohio_46da.html" title="Youngstown, Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Youngstown%2C_Ohio&amp;diff=44911463&amp;oldid=44903123" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Youngstown%2C_Ohio&amp;diff=44911463&amp;oldid=44903123" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There is no compelling reason, either stylistically or for conservation of bytes, to do so, and there is a very compelling reason to <i>add</i> such space — to make it easier for editors to edit. I see that you have attempted to make the argument on a related issue that the source text of an article isn't as important because "the vast majority of Wikipedia readers aren't reading the source code". This is a very bad philosophy to base tiny changes on, because one of the key features that distinguishes Wikipedia from other encyclopedias is that it is easy to edit. The tendency of many editors (often with computer programming experience) to treat blank space as a sin hurts the effort to make articles easy to edit. (I say that coming from both a programming and professional writing background.) If anything, I would encourage you to <i>add</i> such spacing, not only between headings and image tags, but also between bullets and indentation colons, because (A) such markup is much easier to spot when spaces are included, and (B) many bulleted lists in Wikipedia article sources are so crammed fully of text without spacing that they are extremely difficult to read, let alone edit. Of course, you should not do these edits, either to add or remove spacing, except as part of more significant edits, per <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html#Rules_of_use" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB#Rules of use</a>, but you probably know that already.

<dd>Since you seem to be up on AWB, I'll assume that you know that AWB removes excess space automatically as one of its features. Given that "remove all excess white space" has been a feature of AWB for as long as I've been using it (which admittedly hasn't been years and years) I'm taking that as a good indication that many editors feel there <b>is</b> a compelling reason to remove unneeded spacing as part of broader edits. (My argument above for the use of nonbreaking space doesn't relate at all to what you're talking about here and so I'll simply ignore that part of your note.) As for the edit you mentioned, comparing the source of the two revisions side by side, I'm having trouble seeing what your complaint is. Aside from the GM-related edit I mentioned in response to someone else (above), the major difference between my edit and your previous edit is that my edit has a single space after periods while yours has two. <b>This</b> makes it harder to read and edit? You commented about using a space after bullets. If this is important to you, why did your edit of the article you cited not have spaces after the asterisks in any of the sections of neighborhoods, external links, etc.? And for that matter, I did not remove any spacing in this fashion, so I'm not sure why you feel it necessary to lecture me on this point.</dd>
<dd>And as for the AWB rules, yes, I'm familiar with them and no, I'm not doing spurious edits simply to remove space. In my current run, I'm avoiding redirects as described above.</dd>
<dd>With all due respect, I'm just not seeing the egregious edit I made that compelled you to issue a virtual cease-and-desist order on my use of an integrated feature of AWB. I hope you aren't similarly addressing everyone who ticks that box in AWB before making their edits and that you've simply singled me out raandomly. <b>⇒ <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 13:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
