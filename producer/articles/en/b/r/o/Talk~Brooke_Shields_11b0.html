<p><i>However, while much of the plot and content of the movie were sexual in nature, the scenes in which Shields appeared nude were rather benign.</i></p>

<dd>"Benign"? This is a point of view, yes? Not having seen the film, I have no opinion on the matter, but in any case, this statement is editorial opinion, and should be replaced by references to what known critics have said. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 00:39 7 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
This film and its critics were only scorned in the US, it had a worldwide distribution and was looked upon favorably around the world. Having seen the film, the nude scenes were incidental indeed (as critics have pointed out).</p>
<p>The bigger point is the controversy which lead up to the making of the film, a lengthy Supreme Court battle over the pictures from a series by photographer Garry Gross, which depicted Shields in very erotic nude poses at the age of 10. One photograph from this series, in the Musuem of Modern Art was auctioned for an amount close to 1 million dollars. Though she was a model even as an infant ...this was the actual start of her career.</p>

<p>You cant use these images here for that purpose. Read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> - you can only use them to comment on the particular magazine cover as fair use, not just because you have no free picture. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 12:27, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That elephantine article makes no sense. What makes a lot more sense is the tag on both those photos. Those picture are free advertisements for those magazines. Mind your own business. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:29, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Copyright law may or may not make sense to you. It matters to wikipedia. Fair use only applies to very restricted circumstances, when you are commenting on the copyrighted image specifically. Just copying it in is not fair use. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 12:33, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it your avowed intention to wade through all the thousands of articles and delete all the thousands of covers and videtapes, DVDs and magazines which contain tags asserting that they ARE FAIR USE, even if YOU don't think they are??? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not at all. The images can be used in a fair use way. Just some of them aren't. I know it is a big task, but someone has to start on it sometime. The magazine covers are the ones used in ways furthest from fair use - using a DVD cover to illustate the specific film is fine for example. As is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_in_Playboy_1970-1979_3fba.html" title="List of people in Playboy 1970-1979">List_of_people_in_Playboy_1970-1979</a> I think too. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 12:40, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether it's a DVD cover, a videotape cover or a magazine cover, it still serves as free advertising for the object in question, and thus is not harmful and is very likely helpful to the copyright owner, and that's one thing in that fair use <i>megillah</i> that <i>does</i> make sense. So this complaint of yours appears to be largely YOUR PERSONAL OPINION. FYI, I did not even put the "magazine cover" tag on the photo, that was done by <a href="../../../2A/d/r/User%7E_drew_2c46.html" title="User:*drew">User:*drew</a>, who apparently agrees with me that it IS fair use. You seem to think you know something he doesn't know. So take your complaints to him and leave me out of it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:45, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <i>Guideposts</i> cover is connected with the post-partum depression section, which according to Hektor's interpretation of the rules should qualify as fair use. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:19, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What Hektor said was simply a counter-example; magazine cover art qualifies as fair use "for identification and critical commentary" of the magazine in question, and nothing beyond that. This is also stated in the copyright template for magazine covers, which is included in the images in question. (For reference, it's <a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazinecover_03ec.html" title="Template:Magazinecover">Template:Magazinecover</a>) --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarco_d844.html" title="User:Varco">Varco</a> 01:27, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then he needs to get busy and delete every book, magazine, CD and DVD cover in this so-called encylopedia, because 99% of it is going to be used for illustration rather than for "identification and critical commentary" of the object itself. So, how many suits have been filed against wikipedia by companies to whom we've provided this free advertising? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Due to the whole spat between Tom Cruise and Brook Shields I recomend that we add her to the list of Critics of Scientology. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 8:34, 26 March 2006</p>

<li>Is she really a critic of scientology? I thought she was just reacting to Tom Cruise's offensive and none-of-his-business comments, not criticizing scientology itself. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But the reason nutty old' Tom made this an issue in the first place is because of his beliefs in Scientology, so at most she would be an <i>indirect</i> critic of Scientology. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 7:34, 26 March 2006</li>
<li>If you can find anything with her specifically criticizing scientology, that's one thing. But she was upset by what Cruise said, and the fact that scientology was the reason he said it was secondary. He could just as easily have been a Christian Scientist or an organic farmer. It was his comments that got under her skin, not his so-called religion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It might be fair to call her a "critic of one scientologist", which seems like a rather narrow category, although it would now include the writers for <i>South Park</i> also. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, it has that quote. It's actually taken a little out of context, as it's really lampooning Michael Jackson, and how he is (or at least was) acceptable to the white public, thus it was OK with the white public when he escorted her to an awards show. It's from <i>Eddie Murphy: Raw</i>, so I think I'll cite that film and be done with it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone explain this to me? Isn't it just an op-ed? I don't see any scientific citations or references, so I don't see how this is a "scientific and individual case". Please enlighten me. (On this page if possible, not on my Talk page - though you can certainly leave a message there telling me someone has clarified this for me -- maybe I'm just tired right now) <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 04:14, 9 September 2006 (UTC) Don't mean to come off as biased or stand-offish or anything, I just think the wording is a little biased.

<dd>If you check out the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_partum_depression.html" title="Post partum depression">post partum depression</a> wiki, they reference research that shows that there is no proof that hormonal changes are what cause PPD. From what I understand, there is no scientific literature that says depression is a chemically caused condition. It's caused by a variety of factors, and the drugs are acting in essentially the same way as cocaine. They block the pre-synaptic membrane so there is less reuptake, and the neurotransmitters have a greater effect. In my own un-medical opinion, depression is just a weakness that can be beaten with willpower and help from friends. 70.231.232.70 19:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I decided to eliminate the following. I considere necessary to cite accurately -if there is any - the assumptions these paragraph is presenting.</p>
<p><br />
"Actor/comedian <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Murphy_7d8e.html" title="Eddie Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a>, in his concert film, <i>Eddie Murphy: Raw</i>, called Shields "the whitest woman in America". Her paternal grandparents are <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Xavier_Shields_b74c.html" title="Francis Xavier Shields">Francis Xavier Shields</a>, a tennis star of Irish descent, and Italian <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Donna_Marina_Torlonia_di_Civitella-Cesi_16f2.html" title="Princess Donna Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi">princess Donna Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi</a>, who was a sister of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Alessandro_Torlonia%2C_5th_Prince_di_Civitella-Cesi_0e75.html" title="Don Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi">Don Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi</a>, husband of the spanish Infanta Doña Beatriz de Borbón y Battenberg (aunt of King <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain_a3b9.html" title="Juan Carlos I of Spain">Juan Carlos I of Spain</a>). Their granddaughter, Sibilla Weiller (b. 1968), Brooke's cousin, married <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Guillaume_of_Luxembourg_3bc4.html" title="Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg">Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg</a> (b. 1963), the youngest brother of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg_e2e6.html" title="Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg</a>, in 1994.</p>
<p>Through her Italian grandmother, Shields is a descendant of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucrezia_Borgia_edeb.html" title="Lucrezia Borgia">Lucrezia Borgia</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_Charles_V_fc15.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor Charles V">Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</a>, Honoré I of Monaco and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_IV_of_France_71ad.html" title="Henry IV of France">Henry IV of France</a>. Shields is "a 23rd generation descendant of Francesco I Gattilusio, the founder of the Lesbian Gattilusii dynasty," according to the monograph "The Lesbos Island Ancestors of Prince Rainier of Monaco, Dr. Otto von Habsburg, Brooke Shields, and the Marquis de Sade."[1]</p>
<p>Through her Irish grandfather, the branch of the Shields family from which Brooke Shields descends, traces its ancestry to William Shields, born 1600, at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lough_Neagh_8e9f.html" title="Lough Neagh">Lough Neagh</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Armagh_05d8.html" title="County Armagh">County Armagh</a> and killed in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Antrim_a9ae.html" title="County Antrim">County Antrim</a> in 1655. He had four sons, William, James, Daniel, and John. William &amp; James were deported by Cromwell to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> in 1655 (they may have been conscripted to serve in the invasion of Spanish America — the “Western Design” that collapsed at <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispaniola.html" title="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> in that year). Both relocated to Middle Plantation (now <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williamsburg%2C_Virginia_af81.html" title="Williamsburg, Virginia">Williamsburg, Virginia</a>) in 1658 as indentured servants. James and his descendents became tavern-keepers. Shields Tavern is a restored public house in Colonial Williamsburg. John Shields, the gunsmith of the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_%26_Clark_7de7.html" title="Lewis &amp; Clark">Lewis &amp; Clark</a> expedition was of this line as was United States President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyler_b85c.html" title="John Tyler">John Tyler</a> through his mother. William migrated to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_County%2C_Maryland_5259.html" title="Kent County, Maryland">Kent County, Maryland</a> where he gave rise to the prominent Tennessee political clan, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> family of white jazz musicians. The third brother, Daniel, was a Catholic partisan who would die in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Boyne_4acd.html" title="Battle of the Boyne">Battle of the Boyne</a> in 1690. His son, one of the <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Geese_299f.html" title="Wild Geese">Wild Geese</a></i>, associated with the Spanish and wound up in Cuba as governor general. Other descendents include the Civil War General James Shields, who would become U.S. Senator in three different states. The youngest of the four sons, John (born 1650), died on his voyage to America in 1732. His son William Shields was fostered by the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_County%2C_Maryland_5259.html" title="Kent County, Maryland">Kent County, Maryland</a> cousins and would found <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmitsburg%2C_Maryland_e213.html" title="Emmitsburg, Maryland">Emmitsburg, Maryland</a>. Among many notable descendents were Arthur Shields, a controversial 19th-century Presbyterian, who was expelled from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> and from this branche belongs Brooke Shields."</p>
