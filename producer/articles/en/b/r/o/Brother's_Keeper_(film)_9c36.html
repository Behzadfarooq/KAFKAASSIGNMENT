<p><b>Brother's Keeper</b> is a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary</a> directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky. The film is about the alleged <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> murder in the village of <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munnsville%2C_New_York_1036.html" title="Munnsville, New York">Munnsville</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>
<p>In a rural farming community near Syracuse, New York, four brothers lived in a dilapidated house (some might have called it a shack). William, Adelbert, Lyman, and Roscoe Ward were barely literate, had no formal education, and farmed land that had been in their family for generations. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ward_894d.html" title="William Ward">William Ward</a>, who had been ill for years, was found dead one morning. Adelbert was accused of killing him, perhaps by smothering. Later, accusations surface that there might have been incestuous homosexual undertones to the alleged murder. Adelbert Ward was acquitted at trial, largely because the New York State Police violated Adelbert's rights by coercing him to confess (which he later denied) and by having him sign a written statement which he was unable to understand due to illiteracy.</p>
<p>The film contrasts two groups of society; farmers and the big city urbanites. The story, which became national news, appealed to normal people who viewed the Ward brothers and their town as a facinating oddity. The city "folk" treat and speak to the farmers, in particular the Wards, in a condescending manner.</p>
<p>This movie displays two completely opposite views of the Ward brothers. One opinion is that of the locals who find the Ward brothers to be humble old country folk. The other is that of the press, who stereotype the brothers as uneducated hicks. Through these varying opinions you find yourself caring about the Ward brothers and hoping that the verdict is not guilty.</p>
<p>The film shows how the media flocked to the town to cover the story.</p>
<p>The moving documentary depicts the brothers as gentle, shy, harmless, toothless, uneducated, and undeniably likable "rural folk," with Adelbert as the victim of investigative overzealousness and perhaps even corruption (maybe arising from an effort to get the Wards' land) in the State Police. One of Adelbert's friends even mentions how Adelbert looks like Jesus Christ. The community comes to embrace the Wards brothers, for they are part of their town. The viewer is left with the impression that Adelbert did not murder his brother even out of mercy. Repeatedly, the people of Munnsville say that Adelbert is incapable of murder. Adelbert even puts his hand over a friend's mouth, and his friend just laughs as Adelbert is unable to suffocate him at all. The most disturbing scene of the movie consisting of the killing and butchering of pig illustrates how the brothers have to hire someone to kill their own animals because they can't bring themselves to do it.</p>
<p>Although the movie is about the trial of Adelbert, it also represents the fight of a community to survive. Because the town is sitting on prime suburb property the town is slowly being sold off to developers. However because the murder trial finally gave the town a place in national media the townspeople are taking advantage of their newfound voice and are defending themselves through the brothers. The more they defend Adelbert's innocence the more they show the nearby developers that they are going to be able to defend their property.</p>
<p>The brothers themselves are very interesting people--they all have different personality traits. Lyman Ward is a very nervous person. When they had him on the stand he was shaking and looked like he was ready to die of a heart attack. Roscoe has no teeth and can barely be understood but he likes birds, and he keeps a motley collection of them in an old school bus. He likes the birds because of the way they sound when they make noises. He names two of the birds after the makers of the film. To quote Roscoe, "Gobble gobble gobble gobble."</p>
<p>Adelbert has since died at the age of 67 in 1998, cause of death unknown.</p>
<p>The Ward's sister was not featured in this film because of her untimely death in the 1980s. However, her daughter Pat makes an appearance in the DVD's special features.</p>
<p>This film grossed $1,305,915 (USA) (sub-total).</p>
<p>The title "Brother's Keeper" comes from the Book of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. When God asks <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a> where his brother <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel.html" title="Abel">Abel</a> is, Cain replies, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" Obvious connections can be made between Cain who killed his brother and Adelbert who was charged with the same crime. However, the verse also applies to the town of Munsville as symbolic brothers. When their brother Adelbert needs help they gather around him and lend support because they have a responsibility to their brother.</p>

<p>The dialogue in this documentary was very unique. Instead of watching the actors, the point of interest was turned to how the "boys" talked and trying to understand them. An example of this is when the Ward brothers are interviewed in their shack and instead of listening to what they are saying, the viewers attention is focused on how they talk and their filthy surroundings.</p>
