"At the age of sixteen, you're not jelled yet. The first thing you look at, you fall in love with."</p>
<p>Her husband, the son of the financier and conservationist Col. Anthony Rudolph Kuser and grandson of U.S. Senator John F. Dryden, later became a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> Republican councilman, assemblyman, and state senator.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Worst years of my life" was how Astor described her tumultuous first marriage, which was punctuated by her husband's <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spousal_abuse.html" title="Spousal abuse">physical abuse</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a>.

'"They didn't know how to treat people." Her husband was scarcely better behaved. A year after the marriage, according to a published account of the divorce proceedings, Dryden Kuser "began to embarrass her in social activities, ... told her that he no longer loved her and that their marriage was a failure."</p>
<p>Astor with Dryden Kuser had one child, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Dryden_Marshall_fa0a.html" title="Anthony Dryden Marshall">Anthony Dryden Kuser</a>, born in 1924.</p>
<p>In June 1929, Kuser insisted that his wife leave him.

<p>Her second husband, whom she married in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, was Charles Henry "Buddy" Marshall (1891-1952), the senior partner of the investment firm Butler, Herrick &amp; Marshall, a brother-in-law of the mercantile heir Marshall Field III, and a descendant of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Lenox_7ebb.html" title="James Lenox">James Lenox</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenox_Library_a039.html" title="Lenox Library">Lenox Library</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Astor later wrote that the marriage was "a great love match."</p>
<p>She had two stepchildren by the marriage, Peter Marshall and Helen Huntington Marshall.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, Anthony Dryden Kuser, then 18 years old, changed his name to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Dryden_Marshall_fa0a.html" title="Anthony Dryden Marshall">Anthony Dryden Marshall</a>.

<p>Her husband's financial fortunes turned in the mid 1940s, at which time Brooke Marshall went to work for eight years as a features editor at <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_%26_Garden_%28magazine%29_fe0f.html" title="House &amp; Garden (magazine)">House &amp; Garden</a> magazine.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, eleven months after Charles Marshall's death, she married her third and final husband, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Astor_a191.html" title="Vincent Astor">Vincent Astor</a> (1891-1959), the chairman of the board of <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> magazine and the last notably rich American member of the famous <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astor_family.html" title="Astor family">Astor family</a>.

<p>"He had a dreadful childhood, and as a result, had moments of deep melancholy," Astor recalled. "But I think I made him happy. That's what I set out to do. I'd literally dance with the dogs, sing and play the piano, and I would make him laugh, something no one had ever done before. Because of his money, Vincent was very suspicious of people. That's what I tried to cure him of."</p>
<p>According to an oft-told story in society circles, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife, Minnie, only after she had found him a replacement spouse. After first suggesting Janet Newbold Ryan Stewart Bush, the newly divorced wife of James S. Bush, who turned down Astor's proposal with startling candor -- "I don't even like you," she reportedly said -- Minnie Astor suggested the recently widowed Brooke Marshall.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During her brief marriage to Astor, whom she called "Captain," Astor participated in his real-estate and hotel empire and his philanthropic endeavors. Between <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, she redecorated one of his properties, the Hotel St. Regis, which had been built by his father.</p>
<p>Though she received several proposals after Astor's death, she chose not to remarry. "I'd have to marry a man of a suitable age and somebody who was a somebody, and that's not easy. Frankly, I think I'm unmarriageable now," Astor said in an interview in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, when she was 78. "I'm too used to having things my way. But I still enjoy a flirt now and then."</p>

<p>Though she was appointed a member of the board of the Astor Foundation soon after her marriage, upon Vincent Astor's death in 1959, she took charge of all the philanthropies to which he left his fortune. Despite liquidating the Vincent Astor Foundation in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, she continues to be active in charities and in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>'s social life.

The story details how Astor's grandson, a historic preservationist and associate professor at <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Williams_University_34fb.html" title="Roger Williams University">Roger Williams University</a>, has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of his father as the socialite's guardian and the appointment of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_de_la_Renta_c741.html" title="Annette de la Renta">Annette de la Renta</a>, the wife of designer <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_de_la_Renta_baa6.html" title="Oscar de la Renta">Oscar de la Renta</a>, instead.</p>

<p>The day the story appeared, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Supreme_Court_239b.html" title="New York Supreme Court">New York Supreme Court</a> Justice John Stackhouse sealed the documents pertaining to the lawsuit and granted an order appointing Annette de la Renta guardian and <a href="../../../j/p/m/JPMorgan_Chase_%26_Co._b95e.html" title="JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</a> to be in charge of Astor's finances, according to news reports.

In the interim, Astor was moved to <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenox_Hill_Hospital_17fe.html" title="Lenox Hill Hospital">Lenox Hill Hospital</a>, where an unidentified nurse called her appearance "deplorable"; according to the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a></i>, Anthony Marshall unsuccessfully attempted to have his mother transferred to another hospital.</p>
<p>Astor was released from <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenox_Hill_Hospital_17fe.html" title="Lenox Hill Hospital">Lenox Hill Hospital</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_29.html" title="July 29">29 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and moved to Holly Hill, her 75-acre estate in the village of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briarcliff_Manor_1f82.html" title="Briarcliff Manor">Briarcliff Manor</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>

Marshall, through a spokesman, said that Astor knew of the investments and approved of them. Perdue countered that Marshall had advised her never to send to his mother any documents of a financial nature because "she didn't understand it."</p>
<p>On August 8, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_F._Buckley_Jr._ce8d.html" title="William F. Buckley Jr.">William F. Buckley Jr.</a>, who lived in the same building as Astor, wrote about the ordeal in his syndicated column.</p>
