<p>Some of the former elevated system of the BRT, dating to 1885, remains in use today, though most of the surviving structure was either built new or rehabilitated between 1915 and 1922 as part of the <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_Contracts_%28New_York_City_Subway%29_4a44.html" title="Dual Contracts (New York City Subway)">Dual Contracts</a>.

<p>The BMT was a national leader in the transit industry, and was a proponent of advanced urban railways, participating in development of advanced streetcar designs, including the <a href="../../../p/c/c/PCC_car_b516.html" title="PCC car">PCC car</a>, whose design and advanced components influenced railcar design worldwide for decades. The company also sought to extend the art of rapid transit car design with such innovations as <i>articulated (multi-jointed-body) cars</i>, lightweight equipment, advanced control systems, and shared components with streetcar fleets. The BMT was also the original proponent of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-four.html" title="All-four">all-four</a> concept of integrated urban transit.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interborough_Rapid_Transit_Company_464a.html" title="Interborough Rapid Transit Company">Interborough Rapid Transit Company</a> (IRT), the other private operator of subways in New York City, the BMT remained solvent throughout the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> and showed a profit, albeit small in its last year, until the very end of its transit operations.</p>

<p>The BMT was pressed by the City administration of Mayor <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiorello_H._LaGuardia_7d9a.html" title="Fiorello H. LaGuardia">Fiorello H. LaGuardia</a> to sell its operations to the City, which wanted to have all subway and elevated lines municipally owned and operated. The City had two powerful incentives to coerce the sale:</p>
<ul>
<li>the BMT was forced by provisions of the <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_Contracts_%28New_York_City_Subway%29_4a44.html" title="Dual Contracts (New York City Subway)">Dual Contracts</a> to charge no more than a five-cent fare, an amount set in 1913, before the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>.</li>
<li>the City had the right of "recapture" of those lines that had been built or improved with City participation under those <i>Dual Contracts</i>. This meant that, if the City forced the issue, the BMT could have been left with a fragmented system and City competition in many of its market areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BMT sold all of its transit operations to the City, completing the deal on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>.</p>
