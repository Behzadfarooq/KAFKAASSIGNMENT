<p>It's already been decided (see below) to keep the info about the sexual harassment case. If you feel strongly that it should be removed, please discuss it here <i>first</i> - don't just remove it. Otherwise your edits will just be considered vandalism and will be reverted. <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> 16:33, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I imagined placing the sexual harrassment case up there would not be popular. But this is Wikipedia, an encyclopedia. It is meant for facts that happened. Even if we didn't like what happened we still have to acknowledge it. I will keep it up. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry about that. When I read the article it seemed really out of place. It's a current event dealing with a subject that gets spotlight all the time and therefore doesn't merit a spot on the page. The other notable stories (Sacco and Vanzetti, Edison throwing the switch) are things that go in history books and thusly seem pertinent to someone reading about Brockton. Some silly sexual harassment case seems to pale in comparison, doesn't it? And I don't really see how you would consider it to be vandalism either? Isn't the point of Wikipedia to edit things in and out depending on whether or not people feel they are important, accurate, or correct? This sexual harassment blurb contributes nothing and makes it seem like Brocktonians are desperate to have stories about their city on the Wikipedia page. As a Brocktonian, this doesn't sit well with me, so know that my intention was not vandalism -- it's not like I took down all of the facts and replaced them with links for discout Viagra and mail order brides --24.218.85.216 09:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My initial reaction was the same as yours - I was about to take it out, when I noticed Yanksox's post here. From my (somewhat limited) experience here, i've seen that it's best to discuss controversial topics here on Talk pages before removing them, and when a topic's already been brought up on the Talk page, to reach a consensus there before making the change to the article. You make good points on this, however - i'm of the mind that articles on Cities, States, etc. should reflect truly historical information, not current events (unless the current event turns historical). Can we perhaps get a Wikipedia expert to chime in here please? <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> 13:58, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On Feburary 7, 2006, A first-grader was suspended from the Downey Elementary School, after school officials said he sexually harassed a female schoolmate. The young boy was accused of touching a fellow first-grader's skin underneath the rear waistband of her pants. The boy's mother was outraged stating, "He doesnâ€™t know those things, he's only six years old."<a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=124930" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=124930" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The boy was later transferred to another school and the school committee revised their policy of sexual harassment.

I ate at Christo's tonight. I love it as much as the next Brocktonian but there's no need to shit up the Wikipedia with your half assed attempts at promoting the restaurant. I'm sure Christo's has the money to advertise if they want to do that. --24.218.85.216 07:57, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It turns out that they turned on a new sorting facility in Waltham at that time. 024 was used for the new codes assigned to that station, all those used to be 021 (for Boston). The old 024 was shuffled over to 023.
