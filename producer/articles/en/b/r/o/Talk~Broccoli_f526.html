<p>I agree that we desperately need a section on health benefits and nutrition of broccoli!</p>
<hr />
<p>Desperately need a section on health benefits of broccoli and especially broccoli sprouts. Just searching wikipedia for broccoli pulls up a few good points</p>
<p>What about include a photo from the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>&#160;???. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac_0174.html" title="User:Mac">Mac</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So what, if anything, is to be made of the oft-repeated claim that broccoli as we know it was a cross between cauliflower and peas, and that this cross-breeding was done by an ancestors of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Broccoli_7ef0.html" title="Albert Broccoli">Albert Broccoli</a>, producer of most of the James Bond movies? (Who, BTW, deserves an article.) -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 07:03, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is the dumbest question I’ve ever heard. It was also the exact same question I was going to ask. So I guess I wont throw stones! Someone please answer. Baddog 02/11/06 08:56 CST</p>
<p>The alleged link to the family of Albert Broccoli is absolute bunk. The history of broccoli is certainly not clear, but it goes much farther back than Albert's family. Similarly, using the word 'broccoli' to point to its Italian origins is highly questionable. The word is probably not from Italian at all, but may be of Dutch origin instead (from <i>Boorenkole</i> meaning <i>farmer's cabbage</i>). The plant mentioned by Apicius may or may not be broccoli.</p>
<p>I have a more detailed set of notes on the subject on my website [<a href="http://www.medievalcookery.com/notes/broccoli.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.medievalcookery.com/notes/broccoli.shtm" rel="nofollow">MedievalCookery.com</a>]. -- Doc 63.250.143.9 15:39, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- is it necessary to state that George H.W. Bush was in the first generation of american children to have broccoli? that seems fairly meaningless and random.</p>

<p>Am I the only one that noticed that the serving sizes are entirely different (something many readers may not notice), thus making it non-trivial to compare the nutritional data? The site those data came from lets you standardize to 100g; someone needs to do it. (I haven't yet figured out how to upload pix.)</p>
<p>I have heard that it was a cross between califlower and rabe not peas and here is a link to a website about Albert "Cubby" Broccoli that makes that claim. <a href="http://www.cubbybroccoli.com/biography.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cubbybroccoli.com/biography.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cubbybroccoli.com/biography.html</a></p>

<p>Broccoli normally tastes awful, but <b>it tastes great if deep fried</b>. So there must be some drawback to this method - how does this affect the nutritional value? It would be nice to have nutritional data according to the preparation (raw, cooked, steamed, ..., deep-fried) --138.251.194.49 15:16, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For a start, I think broccoli is delicious in whatever form. As for the nutritional values, raw will be best, steamed less so, boiled less so again. If it's deep fried, particularly in batter as in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakora.html" title="Pakora">pakora</a> (delicious!) it's likely to retain nutrients better than steaming, but will also be vastly higher in fat. 86.0.203.120 01:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Personaly, i think broccoli is very delicious either raw &amp; dipped in ranch dressing, or steamed with butter and salt on it... I highly reccomend trying it...(if you don't like it, i think you are CRAzY!!!!) HAHAHA! love ya'll!</p>

<p>Broccoli is purple and is sometimes called purple sprouting broccoli, whereas calabrese is what you get in supermarkets described (erroneously) as broccoli!</p>

<dd>"broccoli" is what it's known by colloquially, so that's what the page name is. Technically speaking calling it "broccoli" isn't "erroneous" in any real sense, since language-wise, <i>that's what it refers to</i>. Nobody thinks of purple plants when they think of broccoli; just check any cartoon rendition of it, ranging from that MTV show to the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerpuff_Girls_4573.html" title="Powerpuff Girls">Powerpuff Girls</a> episode where they fought mutant broccoli stalks (no, I'm not kidding. That was a real episode. My hand to God.) - all of them are green, green, green in modern Western culture. So, the name of the page is NOT wrong, and please don't change it or anything like that. You may, however, want to note that the plant used to be referred to (or "is less frequently, but more properly referred to") as calabrese... so long as you can cite sources for it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's possible that the two different origins that were on the page previously are due to the confusion of calabrese and purple broccoli's origins, I suppose. 63.21.36.163 05:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
