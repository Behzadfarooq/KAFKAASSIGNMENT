<p>Have you looked at a few people recently? Look at my <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">user page</a> to see the difference between the alleged black person and the black dog, to claim that people arent brown is likle claiming the sky isnt up, it is a defiance of reality, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 01:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user page is irrelevant, as is who I have looked at. If you want this article to put forward the thesis that all people are brown, then you must provide a source for that thesis. The article currently has a source that states unequivocally that "brown people are not brown". Therefore that is what the article says. Please read our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policies. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So one poor reference makes for a truth, eh? I have now referenced that some people do think skin colour is brown, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've removed the content. You appear to be basing your content on <i>song lyrics</i>. Please use good sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please dont delete references, it amy not be ana academic ref but this isnt an academic encyclopedia either, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary: This is meant to be an accurate and reliable encyclopaedia. Basing articles upon song lyrics, as you are doing, does not lead to either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Song lyrics are fine, we are not talking about an academic subject but about yoyur absurd claim that no people are brown. If you keep deleting anything that contradicts your own beliefs we end up with a really useless article, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Song lyrics are <i>not</i> fine as a basis for an encyclopaedia article. I strongly suggest that you read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. And as I said above, my beliefs, which you have no way of knowing, are irrelevant. This is an article based upon sources, and <i>is</i> an academic subject, as clearly evidenced by the several sources cited that treat it as such. Problems with such articles only arise when editors decide to write articles on such subjects based upon song lyrics rather than upon good sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not an academic subject. What, you think we'll rely on your word for that? The article starteed as troll bait and what has changed? Are there any people who study brown people (who you on the one hand claim dont exisdt anyway)? Stop throwing WP articles at me which I am at least as familiar with as you. nothing about song lyrics in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, if it can be sourced that many black people think they are brown none of them need to be academics to make this true, as I am sure you well know, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not think that it is an academic subject. There are currently 15 cited sources that disagree with you. I have made no claim about the existence of brown people, incidentally. As I wrote below, please stop constructing straw men. As for what many black people think they are: You have cited no sources that discuss that at all. I strongly suggest that you read the cited books and journal articles first. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:32, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Squeakbox, your suggestion that song lyrics are good source for this is pretty unreasonable. You obviously have strong feelings on this subject, but you have to understand that our individual opinions on the subject matter mean very little- we use proper sources instead. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If 'Blackies' aren't Brown, then I must be colourblind. My eyesight is perfect. I'm, supposed to be 'White', but I'm anything but. I agree entirely with Squeakbox. You'll be saying ginger haired people aren't ginger haired next, because it's 'politically incorrect'. White, Black, Brown, Yellow, whatever, so what? It doesn't need an 'issue' making of it.

<li>Agree, this is an entirely unnecessary and contradictory fork that does no more than make wikipedia a laughing stock and unreliable source of info amongst those who arent racially obsessed, which Americans clearly are and seeme to want to impose their racial theories on the rest of the world. Shame on wikipedia, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article does nothing of the sort. You don't have to be "racially obsessed" to study the history of physical anthropology. Nor does this article impose American "racial theories" on the world. In fact, it was a <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach_f10a.html" title="Johann Friedrich Blumenbach">German</a> who first characterized five races that included SE Asia as "brown people". Please edit and discuss this article from a more neutral PoV. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Take into account that I speak of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coloured.html" title="Coloured">South African group</a> referred to in this article. The phrase "who were largely, and erroneously, believed to have been the production of black-white sexual union out of wedlock" -- what exactly does it suggest? Also, in Afrikaans, one uses the diphtong "ui" instead of "y" in the words "bruin", "bruines" and "bruinmense". <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooBooSpooki_5b7b.html" title="User:BooBooSpooki">BooBooSpooki</a> 22:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The source, which is a study of such words, spells the words as they are written, and contains no occurrences at all (in 500 pages) of the words that you give. Please cite an equally good source for the spelling that you are claiming. Similarly, the sentence fragment quoted is based upon Adhikari's discussion of the "stigma of illegitimacy" and an "enduring myth" in popular thinking. Please read what the source says. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:32, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for clearing that up! Well, the author of your source hardly speaks Afrikaans fluently, whereas I do. I suppose it reflects the document when such spelling is used, but if you wish to refer to the way it's spoken lately, you need to use the spelling in the article about <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coloured.html" title="Coloured">coloured people</a> in South Africa, where "ui" is used instead of "y". Hopefully I can get hold of the source and read it properly over the week. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooBooSpooki_5b7b.html" title="User:BooBooSpooki">BooBooSpooki</a> 09:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your spelling might simply be outdated. Adhikari talks about an article "Ons Bruinmense" that was written in 1962. Patterson (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0415178266</a>) talks about "Bruinmense" on page 140. But that book was written in 1953. In contrast, Stone, who discusses "brynmense" and related words, was writing in 2002. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ouch. Now I don't speak Afrikaans, but being German can read it, and tend to believe someone who speaks it. Here are some results of a quick search: Google for South African pages containing "bruin" or "bryn": <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bryn+site%3A.za" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=bryn+site%3A.za" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bruin+site%3A.za" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=bruin+site%3A.za" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. On the one hand you have 2000 mostly English pages talking about people with the name "Bryn", on the other hand mostly Afrikaans pages, of which several use "bruin" for denoting a person's skin color or race. Add "swart" (black) and "wit" to your query and it becomes more obvious. The Afrikaans Wikipedia even has no pages containing "bryn", but several with "bruin": <a href="http://af.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=bryn&amp;fulltext=Soek" class="external autonumber" title="http://af.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=bryn&amp;fulltext=Soek" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://af.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=bruin&amp;fulltext=Soek" class="external autonumber" title="http://af.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=bruin&amp;fulltext=Soek" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I thus have serious doubts about the existence and reliablity of Uncle G's sources mentioned in this page. --84.56.240.166 17:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm going to guess that when they use the word "bruin" in the context of honoring a monument to the language, then they probably got it right (it's also housed on the government' website so it should be reliable). The term is also given as "bruin" elsewhere on Wikipedia, particularly the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coloured.html" title="Coloured">Coloured</a> article. I'd agree that bruin- not bryn- is more appropriate given everything I've found online. However, I do <b>not</b> agree that this somehow invalidates any other contributions by Uncle G.

<li>Just to clarify: this is only about how one spells the Afrikaans word for brown.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Posel (2001) refers to an appellant at the Cape Town Race Classification Appeal Board, where the appellant states "my kleur is tussen donker en lig-<b>bruin</b>" ("my colour is betweek dark and light brown") - Posel, Deborah. 2001. “What’s In a Name? Racial Categorisations [sic] Under Apartheid and Their Afterlife.” Transformation 47 (2001): 69.</li>
<li>Wardrop (2002) writes: "In South African colloquial speech, members of the so-called 'Coloured' population, are often referred to as the <b>bruin</b> Afrikaners (brown Afrikaners)" - Wardrop, Joan; Australian Journal of Anthropology, 2002, vol. 13, issue 3, p 384, ISSN 10358811.</li>
<li>Robins (2002) writes: "The term 'coloured' (kleurling) is highly contested and unstable. Other terns [sic] used to describe people of mixed ancestry include <b>Bruin</b> mense (Brown people) or Black. There are some 3.6 million South Africans who identify themselves as 'coloured'" - Robins, Steven; Planning Suburban Bliss in Joe Slovo Park, Cape Town. Africa, 2002, vol. 72, issue 4, p 530, ISSN 00019720.</li>
<li>Kriel (2002) refers to an interview with Theuns Eloff, principal of the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, where he states that: "Daar is verder 2,9 miljoen <b>bruin</b> mense wat Afrikaans as moedertaal praat." ("Furthertmore, there are 2,9 million brown people who speak Afrikaans as their mother tongue") - Kriel, M. Approaches to Multilingualism in Language Planning and Identity Politics–A Critique. School of Language, Media and Communication, University of Port Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Finally, on page 381 of Adhikari, <i>Stone refers to research conducted between 1963 and 1991</i> and then mentions that "members of this community have tended throughout the period of research to identify themselves informally as bryn". This is not to say, then, that he encountered this spelling in 2002. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooBooSpooki_5b7b.html" title="User:BooBooSpooki">BooBooSpooki</a> 00:00, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with SqueakBox. Neither Mexicans nor Hispanics are brown people, either in shade of color or in ancestry. The article does not make this claim, <i>but</i> it surely implies it for three reasons: (1) It says that "Americans" refer to mestizos and Hispanics as brown people. (2) It doesn't acknowledge that this is wrong at more than one level. One editor claimed this was addressed in the introduction of the article, but this is not the case, as even if we are to consider "brown-looking" Hispanics or "brown-looking" Mexicans, you'll find that this is a subset of both groups (see <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Mexico_de61.html" title="Demographics of Mexico">Demographics of Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanics.html" title="Hispanics">Hispanics</a>). (3) Some editors, including SqueakBox and myself have tried to rectify the matter, and are reverted with no legitimate justification. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 00:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to your logic one cant criticise articles. Absurd!

<hr />
<p>I do not need to say what a racist charlatan this Gobineau was or what stuff all these Nazi websites are made of, but following the arguments that I can see here, why should we speak of Americans as white people at all, if white people live mainly in Europe, with a population of 728 million people, "some" of whom seem to view Americans as suspicious "whites" who are really not "white"? <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 03:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted it because it is unsourced PoV and not applicable to an article on "Brown people".

<dd>That is simply not true. The term "white" can be sourced from Latin/Greek comparisons to other people in the Mediterranean (see <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White people</a>) and is not just some "igorance of being brown". The source of calling white people "white" is also much better addressed in that other article and is simply not applicable in discussing the term "Brown people". <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term brown doesnt really exist in the way it does with white and black people, which is why this article should be deleted or if not redirected to people, and why this article doesnt do anything other than to stir up conflict.

<dd>This is also not true. Do a Google search for "Brown people" and you'll find hundreds of references just the same as the usage of "white people" or "black people", nevermind the fact that this all stems formally from the 5-color classification system by one of the original physical anthropologists.

<p>I insist. I do not agree with the article, but if we are to analyse the concept, white people, who like to invent all these terms to refer to other people, ignore the fact that they are also some shade of brown and that they are certainly not "white".

<dd>That is false, PoV, and not applicable. Plenty of civilizations have ways of describing themselves from other civilizations based on physical traits like skin tone.

<p>I have a firm commitment to NPOV, that's why I tagged the article. Turning even minor sociological subject matter into an article on people who are brown and then filling it with ridiculous, highly lunatic fringe ideas such as that there are no brown people, and then to contradict that with all sorts of examples of people whose brownness happens to have caught the attention of someone else is not making for an NPOV article, however allegedly well referenced (it takes more than referencing to make a good encyclopedic article and a bad article can be well referenced).

<li>Yes, it is widely written about. And one of the people who has written about this particular aspect of it (note the chapter title) at length is Forbes. He has a lot to say — several pages in fact — on the subject of "everyday observation", quoting people such as <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> on the subject of colour perception. Three particular sentences are apposite here. The first, from page 96, is is: "Anyone who takes the time to carefully look at another human being or at one's own body will immediately be struck by the fact that <i>there is no single color at all</i>." (Forbes' emphasis). The second and third are from page 99: "The practical problem is that we cannot know what a Spaniard of 1560 meant by 'stewed quince' color or what an Italian of 1530 meant by 'olive-ish' color. Nor can we know if there was any agreement among people about such terms or, more importantly, about the colors in the mind conjured up by such terms." A lot of arguments on this talk page, including the above (which, ironically, talks about "sun-tanned" and "olive-skinned"), are based upon not actually reading what the source materials actually have to say, and what scholars have written, on this subject. I <i>strongly</i> suggest that editors <i>read the sources</i>.

<p>This is indeed a weird and deeply unclear sentence, whether or not Colfax and Sternberg say this, and whether they do so in as many words, or otherwise. Given the large semantic difference between "no person is any shade of brown", and "it is simplistic and misleading to describe any single person as 'brown', much less any population group" (or indeed, "the designation of 'brown people' does not necessarily correspond to actual brownness of their actual skin" (i.e. people with a predominant skin colour which in most other contexts would be described as "brown" are not necessarily so designated, and equally, vice versa)), is there no clearer way of putting this that reflects whatever-it-is the source saying? The undoubted fact that there is always going to be more in the source than in the summary thereof does not mean that such summaries should be mystifying easter eggs, which it's not possible to query without being told to go "read the source". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well it clearly cant be perma protected as that isnt how wikipedia works (especially with such a new and controversial article) and needs to be unprotected shortly.

<p>There's no central underlying concept here that has an encyclopedic meaning. As the article now says, "Historically, the appellation "brown people" has been applied by various people to a wide range of disparate, and disconnected, groups of people." As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a>, it should be made into a disambiguation page.</p>

According to the simplistic way in which you've chosen to view this article, each of those could easily fall under the same umbrella. Instead, I ask you to review the Historical concepts section that you've minimalized. This term was part of a five-color system of physical anthropology created during the Age of Enlightenment. There is far more to this article than is covered in those other articles and you are not applying <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a> correctly. Read the table to see how this article is more like the description of an octopus than the parts of speech and etymology of the word octopus. I completely disagree with your assessment. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 22:03, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's also relatively clear that the historical concept is strongly related to the modern concept still in use by the IBGE and others, belying your argument that these are entirely separate things. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My actions on other pages are immaterial to the discussion and I haven't substantively looked at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>. If <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White people</a> were used to describe not just racially privileged members of the European diaspora, but also the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bai.html" title="Bai">Bai</a>, non-Caucasian Russians, and anti-Communist partisans in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Civil_War_dc1c.html" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>, then I think we would have a case to disambiguate it. As it stands right now, just the first definition is in the article, which is a coherent concept, though I might well prefer White (racial status) or White (Eurocentric racial category) or even Whiteness (racialized social status), since the term's ontological status (is anyone "objectively" a "white person"; why does this fact change when I move them from Brazil to the United States to Finland?) is in serious question. But by Wikipedia's naming convention the more common, but formally applicable (and not insulting) naming should go with the concept. Here, each of the separate meanings, and I don't think you can disagree that they're separate since the article says as much, have their own perfectly valid names (though I also think we need to be quite upfront about the fact that "Australoid race" and "Malayan race" are concepts, not material realities).--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 23:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On the octopus analogy: if the octopus is the term <i>brown people</i> and the parts are different, we have a dictionary definition. If on the other hand, if the octopus is the <i>set of brown people</i>, then we aren't describing different parts, but different wholes.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 23:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree fully with the tag and while I recognise that the afd failed I think the tag hits it on the head by saying it is the subject matter itself that is the problem not the quality of the article, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 22:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The problem is that the concept of brown people fails the notability test that we apply to all articles. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white people</a> are notable concepts. Brown people, like <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_people.html" title="Red people">red people</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_people.html" title="Yellow people">yellow people</a>, is not notable enough to justify an article. The way the article is written doesnt contradicty our policies but an article can be well written and fail the notability test, and I believe that is the case here, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>IMO Google results for brown people come up with a bunch of articles which appear to insult allegedly brown people, and while this article doesnt do that in its content I fear that in its concept it feeds into a basically negative concept of human beings, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>For instance if you compare the editing traffic at black and white people with those here (the only other skin-colour based people article we have) there is much higher traffic, thus it fails "attracting notice"<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, and this is not my IMO but the reality of the world in which we live, where the very concept of brown people is marginal.

<p>I don't think that "the historical concept is strongly related to the modern concept still in use by the IBGE and others" for two reasons: the anthropological "races" were regionally defined and based on ancestry, and the Brazilian definition is based on skin phenotype and need not even be inherited.

<dd>It's not always what someone identifies themselves as. It is sometimes what others identify you as. Thus getting back to Lukas19's point of "X people are <i>brown people</i> if you ask these guys but not those guys and if you ask X people, it depends on if they came from Y heritage or Z heritage...". This article is not in need of a disambig nor is it unencyclopedic.

Nor do they really refer to "brown people" as a conceptual term, but to people considered by some to be brown. The latter simply isn't encyclopedic. If it were, then we would have to have a <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_people.html" title="Pink people">pink people</a> (per the Biko discussion on this page) that either defined a range of meanings or disambiguated to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white people</a>/whites in South Africa.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 18:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the problem is that black and white people are mainstream concepts and brown people is at best an obscure anthropoloigical concept but by having a wikipedia article here it appears to give the concept simil;ar weight in the world to that of black and white people. Personally I would feel happier then if there were also articles for red and yellow people, these are certainly equal concepts to that of brown people, by singling out brown people I am concerned that wikipedia is actually distorting reality (even though unintentionally) and giving validity to brown people as a racial concept, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
