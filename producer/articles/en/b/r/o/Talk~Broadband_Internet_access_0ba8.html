<p>We just got WildBlue satellite internet service a couple days ago. We're paying $45 a month for the service. Installation and equipment ($299), plus the first month's service, and other fees and taxes all came to $371 for us. Where we live in the country we can't really get anything else - we live too far from DSL, there's no cable service out here, we don't have line of site for high speed wireless. So far it works really good for us, even with latency.<br />

<p>Yes, I think it's VERY inaccurate to say that satellite broadband is "unsuitable for applications such as multiplayer Internet gaming". Plenty of turn-based Internet games allow you several seconds to perform an action during each turn. Some games (Yahoo Pool, for example) allow the player to take an UNLIMITED amount of time between actions. And even among more time-sensitive games, some of the games deal with latency issues better than others.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better to simply document the typical latency along with a caution that this latency may affect the playability of SOME Internet games. <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyheadKC_17f3.html" title="User:SleepyheadKC">SleepyheadKC</a> 20:44, February 3, 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have edited this section. Using personal experience and the information cited in the two replies before me. I think it is now a little more suitable. I have mentioned how it is still possible to play games online but it may be unsuitable for those requiring real-time user input. I have also cited certain exceptions to this rule. In particular, turn based games and real time strategy. I am not perfectly happy with my wording, but it at least serves to clarify and expand on gaming over satellite connections. It's not impossible, under certain circumstances it's totally unnoticeable but it often turns out to be less than ideal. Feedback on my changes would be appreciated. --Jetlaw 15:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me playing online games and downloading programmes and softwares constitute the same thing?

<p>It appears that <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> such as <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_2.html" title="Diablo 2">Diablo 2</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_Wars_01f9.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> slow down much less often than 56k with Wildblue connection of 1.5 Mbits. [Diablo 2]] is very playable over 56k so it's even better with Wild Blue. My theory is the node activity is turn based so node locations stats data aren't shared as frequent as a first person shooter. There is slow down in odd times in online first person shooters (because of the unconsistant 256 kbit upload speed). First Person shooters have to consistantly share node location, weapon, direction of fire pm;ome. The point is I find MMORPGs playable over Wildblue or KaBand satellite. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenegadeviking_dc0e.html" title="User:Renegadeviking">Renegadeviking</a> 07:17, December 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think fiber/Ethernet as a last mile technology is pretty important. You get 10 + 10 Mbit/s for 50 USD a month over here in Sweden.

<p>I've stuck in an analogy to a water pipe, where a modem is a skinny pipe, and broadband is a fat pipe. My understanding is that the <i>speed</i> of either is about the same (it's just electrons flying along a wire), and I think it's somewhat misleading that broadband in its various forms is referred to as "high-speed Internet", in the same way that it would be misleading to call a big drainage culvert a "high-speed water pipe". (If my technical understanding is wrong, someone please point it out.) -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 20:15, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure broadband does give a pretty decent latency improvement also over dial-up - so yes it is actually faster as well as wider. I'm not entirely sure why or how this is though, so I'm not rewriting the article. Anyone else? -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavedx_1252.html" title="User:Davedx">davedx</a> 19/7/04</p>
<ul>
<li>That is probably true, but (and again, I'm no expert either) that would only matter for the last stretch of connection between you and your ISP; from there on out, it's likely to be a high-bandwidth connection anyway, regardless of whether you have broadband or dialup. So the latency difference would only affect that small part of the route the data takes between you and the Internet. If I had a better understanding of this, I would love to make a nice illustration, carrying the water pipe analogy further: latency means longer pipes, regardless of their diameter. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 19:17, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But regardless of the actual specifics of which sections of the line have high latency, the point is that broadband _is_ faster as well as giving more bandwidth. That's why so many online gamers get it - not to do big downloads, but to get lower pings in games where reaction times are important.</li>
</ul>
<p>An illustration would be cool. I might look into it&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavedx_1252.html" title="User:Davedx">davedx</a> 20/7</p>

<p>This article seems to have suffered a growth spurt (maybe it hit puberty?) in the past few weeks. It could really do with some organizing, and sub-headings. I'm thinking something along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Overview", consisting of a broad (no pun intended) description of what broadband internet is, in terms most general to the layman. Articles should focus on the most widespread (though not necessarily most correct) usage of the term; we need to clearly define what "broadband internet access" means to most people: fast internet. The table of connection speeds should be moved to the top, near the overview.</li>
<li>"Technology" (or maybe just "Development"), covering the more technical details of, essentially, what "broadband internet access" means to telecommunications engineers. This is the "Well, technically, here's what broadband internet <i>really</i> is..." section.</li>
<li>"The global picture" (or something to that effect), giving an overview of broadband availability and usage in different regions of the globe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just my thoughts on it, anyway. I'll have a go at getting started; hopefully someone with better knowledge of the technical details can help tidy it up and smooth out the narrative flow. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 19:33, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should take care not to apply regional bias to this article. DSL rates and pricing vary a lot between countries: in Eastern Europe and the United States, performance is low and average and prices relatively high, while Scandinavian countries and France have much higher rates at lower prices. We should try to reflect this in the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 10:18, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, there seems to me an inconsistency between regional descriptions. Singapore is listed as having 99% penetration; but in the following section South Korea is listed at having highest penetration at 23%. I do not know enough to edit it correctly- but I do see a contradiction. DevanJedi 30 Jun 2005</p>

<p>At Technology section when you talk about "one of the great challenges of broadband..." this part you talk as if only at rural zones broadband access is more expensive than cities with high population density, but also we have the same problem in cities with low population density (at least in Argentina perhaps not in USA then you only talk about rural zones.</p>

<p>It is evident from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwidth.html" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a> that there is a perfectly standard technical meaning of "broadband" which just means "relatively high bitrate".

<p>Also, my understanding is that DSL is multiplexed on different channels (from <a href="../../../d/s/l/Dsl.html" title="Dsl">Dsl</a>), so wouldn't that count as broadband even in the narrow definition? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrf_1a4b.html" title="User:Strf">Strf</a> 03:14, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
