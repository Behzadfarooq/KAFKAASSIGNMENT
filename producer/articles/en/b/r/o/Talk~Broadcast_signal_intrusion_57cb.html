<p>I've replaced the headlines in the "Fictional Events" section with bulleted lists. I did this to clean up the article style, and to maintain NPOV. Making up headings like "Catch you later Bill &amp; Ted!" and "Zip or be zipped" just aren't very encyclopedic, and the list isn't really important enough for its own headings in this article.</p>
<p>If one day that list grows too big from the article (off the top of my head it's a fairly common plot device in fiction, especially scifi or comic-book type of stuff, for the antagonist or protagonist to magically take over every channel) then perhaps it'll merit expansion into a new article. That could be something to work toward with that section, as it's not really all that important to the main subject of this article, but it's still as interesting and Wikipedia-worthy as any number of similar lists of fictional things.</p>

<p>Google Video has this <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3975322056162184320&amp;q=The+Wyoming+Incident&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3975322056162184320&amp;q=The+Wyoming+Incident&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">clip</a> with the following text about it. Does anyone know anything more about it?</p>
<p>The Wyoming Incident (or The Wyoming Hijacking) is a lesser known case of television broadcast hijacking/hacking. A hacker managed to ... all&#160;Â» interrupt broadcasts from a local programming channel (believed to serve several smaller communities in the county of Niobrara) and aired his/her own video. The video contained numerous clips of disembodied, human heads showing various emotions and "poses". The camera position changed often (usually every ten-to-fifteen seconds) and the video was often interrupted by a "SPECIAL PRESENTATION" announcement. This clip is taken from one of these intervals.</p>
<p>The video is mostly locally well-known, and would probably not even be that popular if it were not for the effects it had on the few residents who watched it for an extended period of time. Complaints included vomiting, hallucinations, headaches, etc. While some believed it was paranormal, specialists have determined that the cause of these afflictions were frequencies played regularly throughout the broadcast. In this clip, the frequency being played is somewhere between 17 and 19 hz. This range of frequency, when played for long periods of time, causes the eyes to subtly vibrate, sometimes inducing visual hallucinations.</p>
<p>This video is significant in that is one of the most recent television hijackings. Such actions were rare even in the '80s (search for Chicago Max Headroom Incident) and are even more rare today. The hacker has not yet been caught, and all attempts to trace the video have proven futile. Â«</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Television speakers are not capable of reproducing frequencies anywhere near as low as 17-19hz. Very few if any subwoofers in high-end home theater setups are capable of reproducing such frequencies. The claim about such frequencies inducing hallucinations also sounds bogus. Is there any secondary source for these claims - or indeed anything about the incident?</p>
<p><br />
Please sign your posts. I've been unable to find anything to corroborate the "Wyoming Incident" or "Wyoming Hijack" on Google or otherwise. The only source for this information is the Google Video file linked to in the references section of this article. I'm inclined to believe that this is a hoax or at worst a viral campaign on behalf of a television show or film. If anyone can find additional resources to validate this, that would benefit the article and satisfy my curiosity. Until then, this should be removed from the article. 74.73.86.222 15:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've cleaned up the fictional events again. Let's focus on this article's subject, which is broadcast signal intrusion. Wikilinking the films in that section with a short description of how broadcast signal intrusion was used in them is enough. We don't need to take up space here with who starred in them, who directed them, which companies released them, which caterers did craft services, etc. That information is already available on the films' own articles where it belongs. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_T_Firefly_fabf.html" title="User:Rob T Firefly">Rob T Firefly</a> 05:00, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
