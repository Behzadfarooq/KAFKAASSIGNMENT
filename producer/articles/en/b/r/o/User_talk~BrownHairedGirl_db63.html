<p>Very interested in the page about my father, John Belcher, which I thought was fair. I was going to edit a small detail ie it was a cigarette case not a gold watch but that seems picky! I would also like to add a small section of my father's resignation speech to the House and maybe I will. The truth is that my father did nothing wrong at all but I agree that the tribunal did find some influence used in return for some hospitality and, therefore, I can't change that. He was a man of great courage and dignity which, in fact, Clem Attlee acknowledged in Parliament and this tribunal broke his heart. He never recovered his health, dying at the early age of 59, and my mother who had been put under enormous strain throughout the proceedings, suffered a series of nervous breakdowns for the rest of her life. A sad ending to what had been a dream for both of them ie a Labour government addressing the needs of all the people not the few.</p>
<p>I'm not a computer expert so don't really understand how all this works but I hope you'll see this. Perhaps you can imagine my surprise when my son drew my attention to the page?</p>

<dd>I can find no guidance either way on automatic notability of baronets, and I think that Vintagekits may have a point about their notability. However, this should be resolved by discussing the principle of notability of Baronets, rather than by dumping {{<a href="../../../n/n/_/Template%7ENN_e396.html" title="Template:NN">NN</a>}} tags on lots of articles and then edit warring to try to sustain them.</dd>
<dd>However, the sympathy I feel for Vintagekits is undermined by his similar addition of NN tags to Barons who clearly meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> through having a seat in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.

There are a number of editors who act in solidarity and whom MrDarcy has criticised for this and for POV attitudes, which at one stage moved to delete IRA articles in the face of evidence of notability, as well as moving to keep at least one article which had no evidence of notability. Such situations are bound to create frustration.

<p>On the previous dispute, I still think I would have made the same decision. Sadly this appears to be an example of the same sort of behaviour: raising the same issue in multiple places. The reason there was no need for an immediate block this time was that to-and-fro was not taking place on article pages.</p>
<p>However, the big question for me is this: your main area of editing work appears to be Northern Ireland. Is this recent bout of multiple-article-editing on baronets anything more than an attempt to provoke Kittybrewster?</p>
<p>I hope its not, and that my suspicion is unfounded, but ... I do suspect that this practice of pushing the same point of principle simultaneously over a batch of articles which Kittybrewster has edited is some sort of form of stalking designed to create arguments with KB without going onto her talk page. I hope it is not, but I also hope that you can see that this is what it looks like, so I'd be grateful if you could explain more about what's going on here. I don't want to be unfair, but I am struggling to find a benign explanation. Can you help me out? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 16:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really doubt you would have made the same decision again. There was absolutely no reason to treat me worse than Kitty especially as I at least attempted to discuss the issue and as I did not breach 3RR and Kitty did twice. You will never change your opinion of that and that is fine but for this I will always hold any decision you make with a degree of suspicion. Additionally I am going to prepare a separate report on the 3RR page with regards Kittys edits that night and I will see what has to be said over there about it.</dd>
<dd>I have been editing on pages regarding Baronets for months and Kitty or his cronies dont not own these pages, I have right to edit on these pages as much anyone else. My attention of KB et al's work was really drawn by their abuse of the AfD process to suit their POV by canvassing and vote stalking - this type of behaviour is bound to drawn editors attention to scrutinise their own work more closely.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 16:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh dear, that's rather the answer I feared&#160;:( If you feel that there is disruptive activity going on, such as canvassing or vote-stalking, then the appropriate response is to raise the problem through the proper channels, such as at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>.</dd>
<dd>You do indeed have the right to edit pages, but not to engage in disruptive editing. And you have now twice set about a disruptive approach of raising the same substantive issue across multiple articles, in what was a disruptive approach; that may not have been your intention, but it was the effect. I'm glad that the latest one appears to have made its way to a centralised discussion, and I hope you'll follow that approach in future. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 08:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you call opening a small number of <b>discussions</b> in the manner that I have been advised by another admin "disruptive editing" then it just goes further to confirming my suspicions of your bias towards me, I am really trying to keep assuming good faith but your approach to me seems heavily slanted for some reason - I am not sure why. Would you call the removal of a number of notability tags without improving any articles or attempting to discuss the issue "disruptive editing"? If Kitty had attempted to discuss the tag noone of this would have happened. His reason for not wanting to discuss them and his blanket removal was that he "feared he might forget about the issue" - a pretty weak excuse. Also I trust that you have seen Kitty's latest spate of canvassing last night, another editor reported in a he has been warned again for this round of canvassing.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 10:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Vintagekits, I am not biased against you: having read a lot of your contributions to date, I find myself in sympathy with quite a few of your arguments, and I think you have an important case to make about the notability of baronets. However, the way you have gone about making those arguments <i>has</i> been disruptive, and the problem with all those notability tags was that
<ul>
<li>the same issue was involved in each case, and there as no benefit in spreading the discussion over numerous articles; the dispute was about not really about whether those <i>individual</i> articles met notability criteria, but whether that <i>class</i> of article met notability criteria. Per <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Good_practice" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines#Good_practice</a>, "Centralized discussion: avoid posting the same thread in multiple forums". You could have achieved that in various ways, e.g. by tagging one sample article <i>and</i> explaining your reasoning on that article's talk page; by raising the issue at an appropriate category talk page; or by raising it on a user talk page.</li>
<li>Having splatted the tags across multiple articles, you then engaged in an edit war, and as you know that's unacceptable.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I have read through this several times, and I have reached a firm conclusion: that I want to have nothing whatsoever to do with that discussion. Sorry folks, but most of it just seems to me to consist of a load of people determined to find something to disagree about.</dd>
<dd>The one point in the whole thing that seemed to make sense to me was the proposal to have no flag in the infobox if people couldn't agree which one ... but there seems to be a number of people who see adverse political implications in even that option. While that option has a majority support, it seems well short of a consensus, so I have no idea what a solution could be. Maybe it needs formal mediation?</dd>
<dd>However, an edit war is not acceptable, regardless of other circumstances. Several editors of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_flags_640a.html" title="List of British flags">List of British flags</a> are in danger of crossing the line there. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 08:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want to thank you for your thoughtful consideration of the arguments in your detailed response, and for your open-mindedness in reconsidering the question since i) you had formerly voted otherwise, and ii) you saw faults in the way the review has been conducted. Re. that latter: you may be right: the circumstances under which canvassing-type activities are permissible are limited and somewhat grey, and I can certainly see that I stepped up to, if not over, the line. And "well they were doing it too!" is not, of course, a justification. I am relatively new here and this is the first time I have been involved in this sort of process -- most of my time has been spent quietly in my own little backwater -- and I have learnt much these last few days. The discussion has been at times disheartening, but an intervention like yours gives me strong hope that this really is a community within which I can work.

<dd>Thanks for your very nice reply: I hadn't expected something so friendly after I had been so blunt about the procedural problems! I'm delighted that you see those procedural issues as a learning curve; we all have to start learning somewhere, and my own first encounters with the procedures were not a comfortable process (to put it mildly!). Like you, my own substantive work is mostly in a fairly quiet backwater, but I had to learn how the procedures operate in order to be able to explain that area work hen it comes up for wider scrutiny. AfD and CfD can be difficult arenas; some discussions are easy and non-controversial, some are controversial but full of coherent arguments with people clearly listening and learning, and some have become outright bearpits :( The greatest difficulty arises in cases where people either have their own strongly-held views (which they find difficulty in setting aside), or where the issues get complicated, and the open nature of the discussions makes it hard to stop the discussion rambling across related points which would be best considered separately. In a meeting, the chair or facilitator would do that job, but these discussions lack that focus.<br />
I hope for the future, though, that you can bear in mind the procedural lessons from this issue ... and one of the really important ones is not to canvass selectively. I'm afraid that you did cross clearly that line, and that has had the unfortunate effect of prejudicing some editors against the substance of what you had to say. I hope that the closing admin discounts that : good luck! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 12:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm also here because I appreciated your thorough and open-minded comments in the debate. You were firm and fair; and you were able to thoughtfully reconsider your earlier assertions. Very rare in my experiences with admin at Wikipedia so far.

<p>Thank you for a thoughtful, and useful contribution to this deletion review. Any chance I can persuade you to visit deletion review more often and opine more often? It could use more thoughtful regulars. Please don't expect any barnstars for doing this, participation there is pretty much a thankless task, but I believe it is an important backup safety valve on our deletion procesees. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:12, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw your comment that you would suggest requiring notice. I made such a proposal on the CfD talk page recently (as a result of this case), though in a narrower form, suggesting that notice should be required before the deletion of a well-populated category only, and got responses that generally ranged from negative to hostile. In lieu of that, I'd just like to see a real culture of notification, the way there is on FAR/FARC.

<dd>Hello BrownHairedGirl, I hope you are doing well. I have read the discussion here, on Chidom's talk page, and at CfD. I believe you closed the first AfD in error. Chidom does not have a right to unilaterally withdraw the nomination <i>unless</i> it has garnered no other support besides that of the nominator. The nomination had received two other voices in support of renaming. The trend of the discussion was not yet clear. An early close to the nomination silended the voices of the other people who had already spoken on behalf of renaming, and who did not get a chance to consent to the early closure. Therefore, the CfD should be re-openned and allowed to run its course. Will you kindly re-open the discussion, please? I am happy to do it if you would prefer me to. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Johntex, sorry for not replying sooner, and thanks for the reminder.</dd>
<dd>As you will probably have seen, the renaming of that category became a real mess, and we ended up with no less than three CFDs in as many days, the final one with an unsatisfactorily low level of participation. I'm sure that Chidom acted with the best of intentions, but it would have better to have either chucked a revised proposal into the first nomination <i>or</i> taken the issue back to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay_porn_stars_b464.html" title="Category:Gay porn stars">Category:Gay porn stars</a> for further consideration. But we are where we are, and I hope we have all learnt a bit from it.</dd>
<dd>I made two admin decisions along the way, one of which I still feel was right, and the other of which I'm not so sure on.</dd>
<dd>The first decision, to speedy close the second CFD (<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_25_0ba5.html#Category:Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 25">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 25#Category:Gay porn stars</a>) as a duplicate, still seems to me to have been the right one. If the nominator requests that a CFD be closed, it remains open until closed and the second CFD should <i>not</i> have been created unless and until the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_23_20dd.html#Category:Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 23">first CFD</a> was closed.</dd>
<dd>Once I was clear about Chidom's intentions, I closed the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_23_20dd.html#Category:Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 23">first CFD</a>, for two reasons. The first is that there had already been a further CFD created, and some editors may have already assumed "whether correctly or not) that the first one was "officially over", so I felt that letting it run would have caused confusion. The other reason was that I <i>thought</i> that usual practice at CFD was to allow an editor to withdraw a nomination. I couldn't find any guidance on that point, and probably should have stopped and sought guidance, but I thought that an editor could withdraw. In real-life meetings contexts I have encountered two different approaches to this problem: one is that a motion remains the property of the proposer, and the other is that once tabled it becomes the property of the meeting. I thought that XfD followed the first approach, but I accept that I may have been wrong, and will seek advice before I act on such a request again. If I got it wrong, I'm sorry.</dd>
<dd>However, once a CFD discussion is closed, whether rightly or wrongly, I do think that it would always be inappropriate to reopen it. Too many editors will have passed over it and note it as "done", and I really do think that any outcome of a reopened CFD would be misleading, even if done very promptly, which I refused to reopen the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_March_25_0ba5.html#Category:Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 March 25">second CFD</a> even though it had only been closed for a few hours when Chidom requested that. The same considerations apply with much greater force when a CFD has been closed for 5 days, as this one had been when you made your request.</dd>
<dd>In conclusion, I certainly don't claim that I got all this right, but what's done is done, and at this point I don't think that <i>undoing</i> it is an option ... but <i>re-doing it</i> may be an option. I'm going to be offline for the next fortnight, so won't be available for any further discussion on this in that time, but if you want to have my actions reviewed elsewhere with a view to having them reassessed, that's something which you are quite entitled to do and which I would fully support. I think think this was a messy situation, and if someone else can think of a better way o resolving it, that'd be great! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 09:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BHG Do you really think <a href="../../../f/e/m/Category%7EFemale_members_of_the_Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_172d.html" title="Category:Female members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom">this cat</a> has sufficient "specific relation to the topic" as per <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECATGRS_99d1.html#Other_considerations" title="WP:CATGRS">WP:CATGRS#Other considerations</a>. Surely "Whenever possible, categories should not be gendered" takes precedence here. Its not clear what the category should contain? Is it current cabinet members? Or any female members of any UK cabinet? I really don't want to CFD it. Can you please reconsider and specify it in a clearer fashion.

<dd>I thought that it was clear that it contained women who are or have been members of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet of the United Kingdom</a>; sorry if it wasn't, so I have added that text to the category page. I have also specifically included "are or have been" for clarity; I thought that since it is normal practice on wikipedia not to separate current from former, that was implicit, but if it wasn't clear, I hope it now is.</dd>
<dd>I do strongly believe that it has sufficient relation to the topic. In the last hundred years, several hundred people have served in the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet of the United Kingdom</a>, but only )so far as I can see) 28 women. (I got the info from <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/UKhtmls/UKministers2005.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/UKhtmls/UKministers2005.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/UKhtmls/UKministers2005.htm</a> and by checking each list of ministries since the 1920s).</dd>

<dd><i>"A gender-specific category should only be implemented where gender has a specific relation to the topic. For example, separate categories for actors and actresses are not needed, but a female heads of government category is valid as a topic of special encyclopedic interest. That category, however, does not need to be balanced directly against a "Male heads of government" category, as historically the vast majority of political leaders have been male by default.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's clear that the vast majority of British cabinet ministers have been male (and indeed continue to be male), so this category seems to me to fit that policy very neatly. Personally, I was quite surprised when I had populated the category to find just how few women there had been in the British cabinet: only 28, ever. I guess that, as they say, "not many people know that" ... and I didn't know it until today. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 15:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried to address your concern about "verifiability". Perhaps Hanzo's insults and accusations have drowned out my attempt to address the concerns of the rest of you. Could you please look at the verifiability part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2007_March_27&amp;diff=119078543&amp;oldid=119024616" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2007_March_27&amp;diff=119078543&amp;oldid=119024616" rel="nofollow">my defense</a> of these categories?</p>
<p>Maybe you meant something other by verifiability than I thought you meant?</p>
<p>There are 400 plus articles about the Guantanamo captives. Are forty categories really an excessive number to classify 400 plus articles?</p>
<p>I have had one other category nominated for deletion, Category:Guantanamo witnesses. In that discussion <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">User:GRBerry</a> offered some advice to me. He said that one measure of whether a category held merit was whether the articles it contained could support an article that could stand on its own about their intersection. if the intersection of articles in a category could support an article about their nexus</p>
<p>Do you agree with GRBerry, that this is a reasonable test?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S. I'll look for your reply here, so the Q&amp;A remains in one spot. Cheers! <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 19:00, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm very sorry, but I will have little time over the next two weeks (I'll be offline for most of it), and I won't have a chance to give you the lengthy reply I would like. So I hope you'll forgive me for being brief:
<ol>
<li>GRBerry's test is a reasonable one, but it's not the only one. I mean no offence, and hope you'll take this in the good faith I intend, but your huge list of Guantanamo categories is probably the worst use of the category system I have seen: it just doesn't work at that level of detail.</li>
<li>The category system exists primarily to facilitate navigation between related articles, and it works best when an article is categorised only by a few primary attributes: if too many categories are added to an article, they become ahuge block of confusing links, and start to hinder navigation</li>
<li>Similarly, categories work best when they are not excessively subdivided. Splitting a categoryby ever possible attribute just creates lots of very similar and very small categories, which is the eect of your Guantanamo categories.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>You obviously know a lot about Guantanamo, and I would encourage you to take this information and write a few articles on the topics you have addressed in the categories. It's a very controversial area, so you will need to reference the articles <i>very</i> caefully to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and avoid original research. As articles, you work does stand a chance of surviving, but the category system is not the right tool for the job you are trying to do.</dd>

<p>BrownHairedGirl, please urgently read Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines. Assume good faith - Keep on topic- Be positive-Stay objective-Deal with facts-Bolded text,-No insults- ie why did you refer to the beating up of a Policemen in the second person as opposed to Wiki's beloved third person - hey one could even have used the first person -Don't misrepresent other people - even by association. There have been continued POV assumptions and more than one personal attack; AND the above has edited by comments AND continued biting of a newbie. Thankfully there is some sanity in the other Monarchy CfDs - I did not comment as I have no complaints. Aatomic1 22:21, 31 March 2007 (UTC</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aatomic1, I chose the example as a something clearly absurd: no offence was intended, and, there is no significance to the use of second person, and I'm sorry if it in any way came across as a personal attack (the only reason that I didn't follow my normal practice of using the first person is that for reasons irrelevant to this discussion, the current monarch is definitely aware of my existence).</dd>
<dd>Far from <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITEing</a> a newbie, I am (AFAIK) the only participant in this CFD to have left a message on your talk page, and I have also taken the trouble to listify this category for you so that the info will not be lost on deletion<a href="../../../a/a/t/User%7EAatomic1_List_of_people_executed_under_the_Windsors_0122.html" title="User:Aatomic1/List of people executed under the Windsors">1</a>.</dd>
<dd>You are new to these discussions, and I have tried to assume that you have acted in good faith, but unfortunately your contributions have failed to address the evidence repeatedly made by others that the monarch has no power to influence executions. Instead you have repeatedly posted the same long block of text, and instead of responding to the explanations provided by others editors, you have pasted more extracts without explaining their significance ... and both on your talk page and on <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category_talk%7EPeople_executed_under_the_Windsors_147f.html" title="Category talk:People executed under the Windsors">Category talk:People executed under the Windsors</a>, you have written "I have made no attempt to understand". I think that's the core of the problem: the unwritten British constitution is very complicated, and words frequently do not mean what they appear to mean. (For example, for <i>most purposes</i> "The Crown" means in practice "The Government").</dd>
<dd>Nick Cooper was indeed a little uncivil in his reply to you, but you had been highly provocative in your response to him. As he wrote, <b>"the monarch has no say in whether a person is executed or not"</b>.</dd>
<dd>That's the crux of the whole thing, and it has been repeatedly explained to you <i>why</i> <b>"the monarch has no say in whether a person is executed or not"</b>. The fact that you continually refuse to address that point, and say "I have made no attempt to understand" means that most of your comments are irrelevant to the discussion, and exasperating to other editors. If you are not trying to understand, then there is no point in participating in the discussion ... and if you persist in refusing to address the point, don't be surprised if some editors are less than perfecly polite in their replies. If you are not trying to understand, then please stay out of the discussion.</dd>
<dd>Last night, I removed what was then your latest contribution to the CFD because it added nothing substantive to the discussion, and appeared intentionally disruptive. Others have had to refactor your comments because you did not follow talk page guidelines, and overall you have been shown remarkable patience. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> does <i>not</i> require editors to continue to assume good faith iin the face of evidence to the contrary, and you are in danger of crossing the line.

<dd>Hello BrownHairedGirl, I hope you are doing well. I have read the discussion here, on Chidom's talk page, and at CfD. I believe you closed the first AfD in error. Chidom does not have a right to unilaterally withdraw the nomination <i>unless</i> it has garnered no other support besides that of the nominator. The nomination had received two other voices in support of renaming. The trend of the discussion was not yet clear. An early close to the nomination silended the voices of the other people who had already spoken on behalf of renaming, and who did not get a chance to consent to the early closure. Therefore, the CfD should be re-openned and allowed to run its course. Will you kindly re-open the discussion, please? I am happy to do it if you would prefer me to. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
