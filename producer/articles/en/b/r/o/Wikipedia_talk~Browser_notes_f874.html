<p>This page would be best on meta...for the different wikipedias are not encoded the same way. Some browsers work well on the en, but not at all on the meta for example.</p>
<p>Exemple&#160;: My best choice on the en.wiki is Opera. The quickest. However I cannot use it when a page is too long, since it is cutting it in parts. It is also the best choice when I jump on the fr.wiki. However, it is a disastrous choice for the meta, as it destroys all the special characters.</p>
<p>When the page is too long, I switch to Netscape. But must then change my settings, as it doesnot support the cologne settings (overlapping text and quick bar). However, Netscape is not a good choice either on the meta, where it tends to add weird spaces in the text.</p>
<p>If you stay on the same wiki all the time, life is *good*&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it were on meta, no one would ever see it. I wouldn't, to be sure. The idea is practical usefulness and I think the Wikipedia namespace is the right home for that. There could be something more elaborate and "meta" on meta, referenced from here, but I'd like this page to answer the question:

</dl>
<p>hum, ok. You're probably right each wiki needs one page on its own. But I'd like a page to answer these questions</p>
<ul>
<li>If I am 50% of my time on the fr:, 30% on the en:, 10% on the m: and 10: on the german, which browser should I use (or not use)&#160;?</li>
<li>when one wiki doesnot recognise me while I jump through magic links, is that me or my browser&#160;?</li>
<li>if I go to the japanese (or russian, or ...), just to add a magic link, is that safe for me to use Opera or would I damage the page&#160;?</li>
</ul>

<p>I use Internet Explorer 6.0. When I have been surfing the web and I want to keep the web pages I have seen, I can copy them from the IE-cache. However, of wikipedia articles only the graphic files are stored. The htm-files are not there. I can only save them one by one during surfing, not afterwards. What is the cause of that, and can I do something about that? - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_7b47.html" title="User:Patrick">Patrick</a> 03:41 Jan 10, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There were (some months ago) significant problems with old versions of pages getting 'stuck' in IE browser caches (eg edit a page, hit save, you're sent back to the page... and you see the previous version still!), so the software was changed to simply tell browsers not to cache. It would be better to be able to report the last-modified date of the <i>wiki page</i> in the HTTP headers and be able to interact appropriately with browsers' requests to fetch updates when the exist while allowing unchanged pages to be cached, but this hasn't been done yet. If you know how to do it right, help would be welcome, otherwise I have to stare at RFCs for a while and figure it out.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 04:30 Jan 10, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. No, I don't know how to do it. Out of curiosity, how are browsers told not to cache, is that in the html file?

<p>The tan background for talk pages displays as white on the latest versions of Opera, Safari, Netscape Navigator, OmniWeb, and Internet Explorer running under OS X 10.2.4, and have never shown up on any OS X version of any browser.

<p>I'm noticing different behaviour with graphic layouts between IE and Netscape; it first came up with a version (now fixed using table rather than div) of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curvature.html" title="Curvature">curvature</a>; see: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Curvature&amp;oldid=746795" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Curvature&amp;oldid=746795" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In IE it renders correctly (at least, as intended!) but in Netscape, it renders quite weirdly. I don't think this used to occur in Netscape (although I mostly use IE).</p>
<p>I also notice that currently, in Netscape 4.7:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Wikipedia logo slightly obscures the "M" in "Main Page" on article pages.</li>
<li>There is no horizontal rule bwteen the upper navigation section and the title of the article;</li>
<li>There is no vertical rule between the left hand navigation items and the article body.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these effects are seen in IE. Has something changed recently? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChas_zzz_brown_d8e1.html" title="User:Chas zzz brown">Chas zzz brown</a> 23:09 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A <i>lot</i> of things are broken in Netscape 4 (the exact set of broken things will vary from page to page, setting to setting, day of the week to phase of the moon) and I'm afraid there's little interest among the developers in supporting it. You are more than welcome to make specific suggestions for improvements to the HTML output that will make Netscape 4 render most things correctly without breaking the code in general. (By specific suggestions, I mean an actual example of working code.) My honest recommendation, though, is to upgrade to a more capable browser. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://netscape.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://netscape.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.opera.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opera.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.kde.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kde.org/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>

<dd>C'mon! (all that follows is good-natured. don't be angry.) I hate Microsoft like you hate Hitler. And I don't like AOL too much, either. Netscape 4.7 is fine. Calling it merely "obsolete" is like calling a mint-condition 1940 Maserati "obsolete". Even LYNX (my first browser, before Mosaic was written) is still a perfectly functional web browser. I often use it. Beats the crap of the modern gas hogs. 4.7 shows the logo funny? What a disaster. It looks funny. So what?

<p>I added an HTML comment to a page I was working on (for a semi-good reason) and it munged up the editing process in Konqueror - the existence of the comment caused it give up before finishing the textarea. I assume it doesn't affect (at least some) other browsers, since someone else went in and removed the comment and it was fine after that.

<dl>
<dd>This sounds like it's probably a bug in Konqueror.

<p>Help! Is there any browser out there that doesn't screw up something on wiki? IE does bizarre things to some pictures, won't go into pages over 32K (or rather chops the end off) and turns &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; captioned text into spidery unreadable stuff, Netscape won't recognise &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; at all, putting all text into the same size (which sort of f**ks up captions carefully laid out using the commands), safari is brilliant but times out after 60 seconds (which means that 4 times out of 5 lately on wiki it fails to enter a page, change a page, etc). I thought camino was fail-safe but no, now I find that it <i>too</i> won't accept the &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; command. It is as if the designers of these things all get a perverted pleasure in putting some little glitch just to annoy users. :-) Is there anything out there for a mac that doesn't chop pages, muck up captions, move around pictures or time out after a minute? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Fear√âIREANN</a> 02:22 7 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Opps, Brion, sorry I forgot to come back and tell you about the problem with Camino not recognising the &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small. command. Quite simply it <i>never ever</i> recognises it. For example <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Tiara_a10b.html" title="Papal Tiara">Papal Tiara</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>. Also the top of the Recent Changes page. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Fear√âIREANN</a> 02:00 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>(running a test here!)</p>
<p>The above for example, irrespective of whether the &lt;div&gt; commands are in or simply the middle line is used here, appears as large italics on Camino 0.7 but small italics on IE. (Good God.

<p>I've discovered a bit of the problem. Camino + Cologne Blue together don't show small!!! I was using Cologne Blue. :-( So I guess that leaves me with the problem of which do I chose - nice skin + IE (aaaaaagh!) or yuch skin + camino (aaaaagh!) Maybe I'll sleep on it.

<dl>
<dd>Reload the page and you should find the &lt;small&gt; tags operating as expected under Cologne Blue. Apparently for reasons unclear, using an absolute point size for the text (eg, font-size: 10pt) causes the smallish effect of the &lt;small&gt; tag to become very very slight in Camino (and hence unnoticable at 10pt). Putting an explicit <tt>small { font-size: 75%; }</tt> into the style sheet declaration makes it work more as expected:</dd>

<p>I am not a font expert, but isn't this a simple case of not having the appropriately-sized bitmap font? If Camino defines "small" to mean "80%-size", and your bitmapped font has, say, 16 pixel and 10 pixel sets, and your normal font is 16 pixels, 80% would come out to 12.8 pixels, which might just be rounded up to 16 pixels again (purely hypothetical, of course, but you see my point). Does the lack-of-small problem occur with <i>all</i> font sizes? What happens if you zoom in/out, or choose a different "default" font in your preferences? (if Camino has such capabilities - I haven't used it). -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 11:24 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bit map fonts? MacOS X does not understand your strange terminology, it's all magic vector truetype display PDF smoothy anti-aliased crud. ;) Defining 80% also works fine, while pumping the font zoom up to HUGE shows only the tiniest of visible changes without the explicit percentage definition. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 16:24 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly I am no Mac expert either ;-) I suppose my next question would be, has anyone actually measured the height of the "small" font in pixels? Could just be a quirk of human visual perception that 80% looks too similar to 100% for some fonts. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 23:56 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the trouble is the way that it handles the 'smaller' font size keyword, which is specified for the &lt;small&gt; tag in Mozilla's default style sheets. It's not a percentage value (which works fine if we force it, be it 75% or 80% or whatever), rather it ratchets down to the next-smaller value in a fixed list. Certain values are particularly bad: 10pt translates to something like 13.33 pixels, and so it picks the next-smaller size of... 13 pixels! If you zoom the text size way up in Camino, the 0.33 difference turns into a couple of whole pixels and is visible, but at normal size the font scaling rounds the 10pt text to 13px, the same as the "smaller" text. See bugs <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72164" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72164" rel="nofollow">72164</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201811" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201811" rel="nofollow">201811</a> in bugzilla. This may be fixed in more recent versions; but Camino hasn't updated (at least not in release versions) and I haven't tested the just-released Mozilla 1.4 (nor will I have a chance to for a while). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 01:41 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not think that articles should try to account for ephemeral font and browser issues, even of popular browsers. At most, the Wikipedia software could be tweaked to render such cases for buggy browsers, the underlying code staying the same (the tweaking could simply be removed once the browser improves). Many unicode entities used in <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_alphabet.html" title="Gothic alphabet">existing articles</a> are not rendered properly by any browser <b>yet</b>. But Wikipedia is here 'for ever', and unicode is here to stay too, so it is reasonable to expect them to render correctly in the near future. (in <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">firefox</a>, btw, the colon looks fine). Italic punctuation exists for whole italicized paragraphs. I don't think it's good practice to italicize punctuation after a single word in italics (but I am not Donald Knuth); Btw, is there any sort of punctuation-standards-enforcing wikipedia-bot/script? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dbachmann</a> 08:15, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Which part doesn't fit in? The part that says "doesn't work for Firefox."

<p>This is getting silly, but I'll explain why I did my second edit. "Safari" got replaced with "Mac OS X browsers" by someone else, so my second edit reverted that. UnicodeChecker and CocoAspell aren't Mac OS X browsers, they're Safari add-ons, which they were originally listed under as. Secondly, yes UnicodeChecker is a system service, but it isn't the system service's fault that it doesn't work with Mozilla apps: Mozilla &amp; Firefox currently haven't been coded to work with <i>* any*</i> Mac system service, so it wouldn't be descriptive or necessary to point out that one particular service doesn't work with Firefox, no matter how big Firefox is, because <i>none</i> of the system services work with it. Furthermore, I'll reiterate my original point: It doesn't make sense to point out that UnicodeChecker doesn't work with Firefox <i>when UnicodeChecker is specifically listed as a Safari solution.</i> Also, making your edit for the second time, Mzajac, without discussion in the talk page was trollish and obviously uncalled for. --<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.227.51.html" title="User:69.214.227.51">69.214.227.51</a> 16:18, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They're not Safari add-ons, they're system services that work with any OS X program, including web browsers, which use the standard system text fields. This may already include OmniWeb or Opera, for all I know. It dose work in a web browsing tab in NetNewsWire.</dd>
<dd>That they don't work with Firefox is significant, because the Wikipedia audience would favour that browser, and it's good to point that out before people go to the trouble of downloading and installing software.</dd>

<dd>So I slipped -- it would have been clearer if I said that UnicodeChecker was a solution for Firefox, as opposed to an add-on. Indeed, it's an independent application as opposed to a browser plug-in, for example, and it works with other browsers. Much of the items under 6.3.1 (as indexed in the TOC) "Built-in Tools" are also non-browser specific system-wide solutions (BTW "Tools" should've been lowercased). Strangely though 6.3.1 is a sub-sub-category of 6 "Browser add-ons &amp; proxies" when system services aren't plugins or proxies. Perhaps 6 could be renamed to "Browser plugins, proxies, and system-wide services" and a "proxies &amp; system-wide services" sub-section could list operating systems or desktop environments, followed by system services for each. Under the OS X section, there could be an asterisk saying that Firefox doesn't support system services as of now. For the Plug-ins section, on the other hand, it would make sense to list browsers as opposed to desktop environments.</dd>
<dd><i>"it's good to point that out before people go to the trouble of downloading and installing software"</i> It would be inconvenient for themselves if users did that, but when UnicodeChecker is listed specifically under Safari, they shouldn't expect it to work with Firefox. Also, if a user has ever used Firefox on OS X and are aware about system services, they should know that Firefox works with not a single system service in the Services menu, even about a dozen that comes included with the OS. There's nothing that system services can do since Firefox has not been coded to take advantage of it. I can see how some sort of warning for Firefox users could be added somehow, somewhere, eventually.</dd>
<dd>"Opera kiosk mode filtering" is listed under "Browser add-ons &amp; proxies." From what I can tell, it's neither, right? Ack, this article is a bit messy. I was also wondering if the undo feature in textareas and textfields are something that comes with the Windows OS because it seems like practically every tf/ta in every Windows app has this feature, while this isn't the case with OS X. If it is some sort of Windows thing, then it might also be listed under a hypothetical future "system services" section. --<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.227.51.html" title="User:69.214.227.51">69.214.227.51</a> 18:26, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm surprised this hasn't been noted here before (or it just me!?), but I've noticed that Firefox seems to ignore automatic separation between image and tables/text in Wikipedia articles. This causes some images to overlap text and tables. (For an example, see the Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_glaciation.html" title="Timeline of glaciation">Timeline of glaciation</a>. There is a difference between how that article shows up in Firefox and IE - look at the first image and table.) Yet, when I open Wikipedia articles in IE, images and tables/text are automatically separated as they should be. I haven't been able to find any troubleshooting references to this here in Wikipedia, unless I've missed something. While I do know that this overlap problem can be resolved by changing the size of images as they show in the articles, some may not want to go to the trouble or even know how to deal with this irksome problem. (I have left that first image size deliberately unedited in the example article mainly to illustrate this problem) Is Wikipedia working on this problem of Firefox ignoring automatic separation between image and tables/text? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthernFire_700c.html" title="User:NorthernFire">NorthernFire</a> 20:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

answer to that is, quite literally: it's not a bug, it's a feature. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html" rel="nofollow">CSS boxes</a> are allowed to overlap, which is good, because they're boxes, and so anything else would result in oddity. Consider the checkmark at the right: its box overlaps this paragraph's box. Fortunately, this paragraph is nice and flexible, so it can flow around the checkmark; tables aren't so flexible, so they can't. Start points of blocks are fixed by their position and attributes; you can't just shove around blocks with clear: none. IE does, and in this respect it does not comply with standards.

<p>If you take a look at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serie_A_5ded.html" title="Serie A">Serie A</a> there should be a table half way down detailing the results of the season so far. In IE, it is perfect, with the names along the top being shown vertically. But in Firefox, the names are being shown horizontally accross the page making the table far to wide when using firefox. Any fixes ? <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 22:21, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Opera 8.54 on Win98SE here. I'm getting a sporadic error editing large pages, usually data tables and such, where <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> gets replaced with <code>&amp;gt;sup&gt;</code>, or <code>colspan="2"</code> with <code>colspan=&amp;quot;2"</code> for example. Anybody else gets these glitches? <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 11:27, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anyone else having trouble with alt-e and alt-s not editting pages but instead going to the Firefox Edit menu with 2.0? I just noticed this tonight (I think this is the 1st time I've tried in 2.0). Could be something dumb I've done or could be 2.0 issue. -<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbarr_c295.html" title="User:Jcbarr">Jcbarr</a> 05:49, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firefox 2.0 has pre-empted ALT for the menus, and the default web page key bindings are now based on alt-shift instead. So alt-shift-s should work to save where alt-s used to. (Annoying!). <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojum_d2f7.html" title="User:Boojum">Boojum</a> 03:32, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed, extremely annoying. I found the way to undo this feature on <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2406523&amp;sid=b6c3fa96888e4f6a4dc330e00a82076a#2406523" class="external text" title="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2406523&amp;sid=b6c3fa96888e4f6a4dc330e00a82076a#2406523" rel="nofollow">this MozillaZine post</a>, which is to browse to <code>about:config</code> and set the following variables:</p>
<pre>
ui.key.chromeAccess = 5
ui.key.contentAccess = 4
</pre>
<p>It works for me, and I haven't yet seen any undesirable side effects. ‚Äì <b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpso2_4746.html" title="User talk:Ipso2">ipso</a></b> 23:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC) <a name="Suggestion_for_Blazer.2FPalm_crashes_handheld" id="Suggestion_for_Blazer.2FPalm_crashes_handheld"></a></p>

<p>Using Blazer 4.3 under PalmOS Garnet v. 5.4.9 on a Palm T|X, Wikipedia text is rendered unreadable, as indicated on the main page for this talk page. When following the suggestions on the main page (attempted under username togr-palm), my handheld now crashes when I try to load the wikipedia main page in Blazer.</p>
<p>I'll try to find exactly which part of the stylesheet is the problem, but thought I'd report the problem at once. togr-palm</p>
