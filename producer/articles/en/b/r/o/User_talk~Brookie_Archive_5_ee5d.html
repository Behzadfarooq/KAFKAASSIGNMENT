<dd>We don't do vanity pages - you created one which was duly deleted. I moved the data to your user page - where you can display it and where it will be safe.

<p>well will you at least undelete it, so it doesnt show me deleted on here, that way when someone makes one about me when i am famous, oh and i will be...and there will be proof, it wont be hard for them to make it for me.

<dd>Sorry - No. Notability is like an elephant - you know it when you see it - but not always easy to define! Even if the article was recreated the edit history still lists the deletion on a back page. When you are famous you should treat this as a badge of honour!

<p>Hi, my friend , Kharb_gaurav and I were workng on the article Kharb. I know he did a lousy job with it in the begining but he and I rewrote it and made it more factual and relevant so please undelete it. Atleast reply back to me. We had used the hangon feautre and then wrote the discussion page and then improved the article.

<p>Ok. Just to let you know what's going on. I started and have been working on a new page called "Jewish meditation". Jewish meditation is usually called by its Hebrew name: Hisbonenus or Hitbonenus depending on your pronounciation. I made pages for those Hebrew titles to link to my new page. Then I got your message and I learned how to redirect. I did so, and hitbonenus (w. the T's) seems to be working great. Hisbonenus (w. the Ss) however, takes you to a page that has the redirect link-but then you have to click on it. Do you know how to get it working automatically like Hitbonenus with the Ts? Help.</p>
<p>Update: Ok, now the redirect is working properly, I figured out the problem.</p>

<p>I agree with your move to the user page. Still a little vain, but I'll trim it down. Trying only to make cross reference for Beehive Standard Weekly publication. I think this last edit gets a little more to the point n'est pas?</p>
<p>I edited this one a few minutes ago, not realizing it was a re-creation of a deleted article. I have no idea of his local notability, but it does indeed looks like NN vanity to me. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrusl_ca8b.html" title="User:Grusl">Grusl</a> 08:09, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apparently my IP has been blocked from editing for vandalising "2005 sydney race riots" page and several other pages. Truthfully i have never even been to these pages before now, what do i do? Have i been hacked of some sort?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have checked and your user name is not blocked - so you might be fall out from some other vandal. Go to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and post a request for help there - as I don't know how to sort out this sort of related blocking.

<p>Hi. yeah, I'm trying to an assignment on cyclones. when I went to the page, I coticed how retarded the structure section of the cyclone page is. It may be because I am stupid and can't understand the smart way it is written, but I'm pretty sure that this isn't right:</p>
<p>The clouds of a cyclone is an extremely high-pressure area. Near the outer layer <b>of ducks of the cyclone the pressure quakking attack</b>, from high- to low-pressure regions, and the Coriolis force must be <b>in an approximate extra-terestrial sighting region</b> (or else the cyclone would collapse in on itself under the pressure monsters). The wind flow around a large cyclone is always <b>as big as a large-sized polar bear</b> in the central hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, <b>of coarse due to the bombing of nuclear-powered waste matter effect.</b></p>
<p>again, maybe it's just me. but I'm pretty sure that the size of polar bears have nothing to do with cyclones. thanks.</p>

<p>I'm still highly of the suspicion this should be an instance of db-bio, but then again, I am a little critical when it comes to judging content relevant or not, mostly because there is -so- much utter rubbish popping up on Wiki over the last few years.

<dd>Yep it leaves the page behind. I just noticed you're an admin to so you could have deleted it anyway. You're a much nicer person than me I just delete them. Too bad if they haven't saved it. You can give it a try. Create something like User:Brookie/Sandbag and then move it to User:Brookie/Sandbox. The "sandbag" page will be left as a redirct which you can delete as created in error.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I posted the 'Do an Amir' new article but it was rejected. The phrase is going across the internet like wildfire and I really think it is a valuable, if not yet fully established, cultural reference. Any chance of a reprieve?</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I was finishing to edit an article on the Perennialist School but before I finished it, the article was apparently blocked because of copyright issues. I don't really understand what happenned. I am of course the author of the text I was posting.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>Renaud Fabbri (renaudfabbri@religioperennis.org)</p>
<p>It is in fact a excerpt from my MA thesis proposal on Frithjof Schuon. I am presently a graduate student at Miami University in the Comparative Religion Department.</p>
<p>Hope it will clarify the question.</p>
<p>I have posted the article on my own website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.religioperennis.org/PSchool.html#Biography" class="external free" title="http://www.religioperennis.org/PSchool.html#Biography" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioperennis.org/PSchool.html#Biography</a></p>
<p>So it is not any more unpublished material I assume. In itself, it was just an introduction, my thesis proposal being on a very technical question. There was nothing new really in terms of arguments or information, most of the data coming from the bibliography I mentioned.</p>
<p>Let me know if it can work or what I have to do.</p>

<p>Hey Brookie. First off, I wanted to ask you to undelete the article. It's a repost, and all, but the original article was deleted improperly (IMHO) and w/o any rationale given, which is a double WP:BITE problem. Besides, don't we have WP-wide consensus that High Schools are notable? I was pretty sure schools were ineligible for CSD - I got some CSD's on <b>elementary schools</b> declined only yesterday.</p>
<p>In the alternative, if you refuse to undelete, please delete the talk <a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWest_Haven_High_School_d133.html" title="Talk:West Haven High School">Talk:West Haven High School</a>.

<p>I was wondering about my Stacy Silver, Julie Silver, and The Digital Kill entries. Isn't the point for someone to write an article and then have someone edit to make it better? Because there are many articles that previously did not establish notability such as "My Summer of Love" which was later edited to encompass the rules. I was wondering on that note, if you could unlock my previous article so I could edit them. The problem with Stacy Silver is that there is very little information on her so establishing notability could be difficult, nonetheless it is one step closer to wikipedia's goal of complete knowledge database.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The main issue here is notabilitiy - as far as I can see the Digital Kill lot just aren't notable and if there is not a lot on Ms Silver this is probably becasue she isn't notable. Wiki is not just trying to be a depository on everything and everyone - the base mark is that they are notable!

Maybe the instructions are still out of date - I'll have a look. Also, you need to nominate your J Cahn entry on the template talk page under the date of article creation. The general rule in updating is to use the older items first, working up to the newer ones. That way all articles get a fair shot at being selected.

<p>Hi Brookie,</p>
<p>A bit confused. It seems that you have deleted some of the post that I have made.</p>
<p>You seem to have deleted the post related to both the Production company Grillifilms, even though at Wikipedia there are a lot of them listed. See links:</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/r/a/Traktor.html" title="Traktor">traktor</a> <a href="../../../b/b/c/Bbc.html" title="Bbc">bbc</a> Film production companies</p>
<p>Furthermore you seem to have deleted a few directors, again not sure though the logic why... please check:</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_%C3%85kerlund_db15.html" title="Jonas Åkerlund">Jonas Åkerlund</a> Music video directors <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_directors.html" title="Film directors">Film directors</a></p>
<p>I have now (or will within soon) re-create the articles I wrote earlier, and I truly hope that it is not your private subjective view that decides which directors are to be listed and which are not.</p>

<p>--- Hi Brookie,</p>
<p>not sure if I agree with you. An example; did Lordi win Eurovision a few weeks ago? Did Pete Riski direct all their Music videos? Wasn't "Hard Rock Hallelujah" the second most watched video at youtube.com the week after the contest?</p>
<p>For me, this is notable.</p>

Being "born without a package" like Rob Salt would make that difficult, though. How he still manages to be the hottest stud in Wainwright is beyond me.

<p>Hi, I just wrote an article on Mason Neck on Arabic. I received a message saying that I need it to be translated into English. This article already is in English. Also, I am having putting in the code to have the article say (English: Mason Neck), because the english letters mess up the order of the Arabic script. Do you know how to remedy this.</p>
<p>Thanks, Joseph McCarter</p>

<dd>Well don't tell me - update the picture page - the picture doesn't look like a book cover to me - but rather a mock up of one - so you'd better cite the book publishers etc or it might still be attacked.

<p>Hi Brookie, I've had some contact with you before so i figured you'd be a good person to go to with my issue. There is a page that has been deleted five times, it's for the band . There is a user, I'm not sure if he's an administrator or not but he wants to delete it and protect it from re-creation because he doesn't the notability for it. I disagree wholeheartedly. The band is currently signed to Interscope Records and are recording their debut album through the Myspace Records imprint. If that isn't notable enough, that's kind of sad.</p>
<p>Thank you much. Adam Klatka</p>

<dd>Hi Adam - it has been deleted as you say 5 times - which kinda shows what the view is on the article; I have just had a look at the deleted article and there is nothing notable there and it reads more like an advert - if I had seen it I guess I would have done the same. Why not re-do the article in your user space - flesh it there and work on it and then go back the admin who deleted it and see if it then reaches standards. I have created you a sub page <a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyeamzerox_Hollywood_Undead_073e.html" title="User:Eyeamzerox/Hollywood Undead">User:Eyeamzerox/Hollywood Undead</a> to play with.
