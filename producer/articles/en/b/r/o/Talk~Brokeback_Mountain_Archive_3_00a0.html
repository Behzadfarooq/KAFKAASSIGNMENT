<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy in Alberta, Canada</span></h2>
<p>This film was shot in Alberta, which is by far the most conservative province in Canada. I know this film generated quite a bit of controversy in the areas where the movie was shot. While most residents of the rural locations were excited to have their home depicted in a major motion picture, controvery developed when word leaked out about the nature of the film. I don't have any specific sources for this information though. If anyone knows more about the controvery surrounding the actual filming of this movie, please add it to the article.</p>

<p>Regarding this passage in the "Plot" section:</p>
<p>&gt;Through it all, Ennis and Jack struggle with societal and family pressure, and their own fears that prevent them from fulfilling the love and physical attraction that captured them both during their first summer together.</p>
<p>Is the phrase "love and physical attraction" sufficient or does the word "lust" need to be substituted as per a user today? By all accounts, and as is certainly obvious to anyone viewing the movie, the two protagonists of the film are in love. Why is it necessary to replace "love and physical attraction" with "lust" except for reasons of a POV agenda that gay people can't fall in love? Comments requested. Thank you.</p>
<p>Note: the addition of "physical attraction" was my attempt to compromise, but User:Druidictus continued to revert and add the word "lust." <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:25, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps the phrase can be refined – "erotic and companionate love", or "consummate love"? <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">Love</a></i> entails numerous aspects: erotic love, platonic love, familial love, et al. <i><a href="../../../l/u/s/Lust.html" title="Lust">Lust</a></i> refers merely to the former and has numerous connotations (e.g., even one of the deadly sins, no?), and excludes (even debases) other types which are arguably at play in BBM.

<dd>That would absolutely be my first choice and I think it is the best descriptor. I was trying to find compromise with a user who kept adding in the word "lust." My druthers would be to revert back to simply "love." ("physical attraction" tends to be obvious and a given when it's already been stated that two people have fallen in love - unless we want to go to the plethora of articles on here about love stories and add in "physical attraction"?&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:58, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That might do and I generally agree, but is it <i>too</i> overarching? Like I said, a rephrase might be in order. As above, even "physical and emotional love" or similar might do? Also, perhaps replace "captured" with "captivated"?&#160;:) E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 22:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The objection, as I read it, was to stating that circumstances inhibited their love. Whatshisname was technically correct in that regard -- love is nominally intangible, can't be hindered, etc et al. It's probably obvious to anyone reading that the objection was just an effort to take the word "love" off a page about a fictional relationship between two gay men -- ie, agenda pushing by someone offended by love between two males.</dd>

<dd>I'd support inclusion of "love" as standalone if you can logically address User:Druidictus' objection -- perhaps by changing "prevent them from fulfilling the love and physical attraction" to "complicate the love <s>and physical attraction</s>". After all, I doubt anyone would argue against the assertion that you can *complicate* love, thus neutralizing the objection that gave rise to the insertion of "lust".</dd>

<dd>In case it wasn't obvious, I am in support of just "love" or at most "love and physical attraction." I think Moncrief's comparison to Romeo and Juliet was a salient point; do we insert this type of semantic disctinction between love and lust in every love story? "Falling in love" connotes the physical as well as the emotional for most adults. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 22:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I prefer just "love", no "physical attraction". "Lust" is generally derogatory. I don't think it's really necessary to break the characters' relationship down into various components. For example, the article for <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinevere.html" title="Guinevere">Guinevere</a> mentions her "love affair" with Lancelot, but doesn't say that it had both emotional and physical aspects to it. I also don't think it's particularly <i>relevant</i> to the movie or the article. If the movie was exactly the same, but these two characters never consummated their love physically, would it really be all that significant a change? <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 01:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should just be "love"-- lust has negative connotations in many contexts, and clearly in this one or there wouldn't be any dispute. "Physical attraction" is (though I understand the reasons it was offered) just a plain silly compromise that would open a question on all kinds of past and future articles. That this wouldn't even be a question were the film a depiction of a heterosexual relationship should make the POV agenda of "lust" clear. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisLott_78d7.html" title="User:ChrisLott">ChrisLott</a> 23:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also like Adrian Lamo's "complicate the love that..." or just a revert to the original "fulfilling the love...." The "physical attraction" add-on attempt to compromise is really weak, the more I think about it, and should be removed at some point relatively soon I think, as there seems to be no consensus to keep it and definitely no consensus at all that "lust" is needed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 10:40, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about something along these lines: <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> tells the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), two poor young men who meet and fall in love on a <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepherd.html" title="Shepherd">sheep herding</a> job on <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>'s (fictional) Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963. The film follows their lives over the next two decades and documents their complex relationship, which continues after both marry women and father children. Jack wants to try to create a life together, but Ennis, who is haunted by a childhood memory, fears being ostracized by his family or killed by members of the community if he and Jack were to live with each other. Often, they are only able to contact one another by sending postcards. Through it all, Ennis and Jack struggle with societal and family pressure, and their own fears that prevent them from fulfilling the emotion and feeling that captured them both, for their entire lifetimes, during their first summer together. 144.35.254.12 23:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that sounds clumsier, more awkward, and less precise to me. And please don't change it again until we've had a chance to agree that consensus has been reached. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 23:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Love". Just plain "Love". Love has a multitude of meanings which all fit in this context. "... Ennis and Jack struggle with societal and family pressure, and their own fears that prevent them from fulfilling the love that captured them both" is perfect BECAUSE it uses a vague term like love. One of the themes of the movie is what their love means. That is part of what I <i>love</i> about this movie, it makes the audience think about what love is. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 00:42, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't necessarily want to be the one to do it because I responded most vociferously to the initial addition of "lust," but I think it's time someone change it back; this is pretty clear consensus. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 02:19, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you have true consensus when you block the opposition out? The original sentence implied that the story characters were restricted in their love which wasn't true, they were only restricted in a sub group of the various meanings within love and that was the context that results in lust. This poor context still exists in the revised version.</dd>

<dd>To get back to the issue of love. I don't understand how you can say that the only physical manifestation of love is lust. They were restricted to showing their love for each other publicly. Love is more than just the feelings you hold inside. One reason this movie was so effective was that it showed how difficult it was for them to hold these feelings inside. Holding emotions inside is one of Ang Lee's trademarks and a big theme in Chinese culture. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 10:40, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I may throw in my two cents as well, I think saying anything other than "love" is silly, redundant, and (perhaps worst of all) plain old bad writing. The article for "Titanic" doesn't specify that Jack and Rose felt "physical attraction" for one another. There is no need to add this phrase as it can be taken as a given in a story about adults that "fall in love", and "lust" is just insulting in this context. <a href="../../../k/g/i/User%7EKGiles_9915.html" title="User:KGiles">KGiles</a> 06:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of awards is simply overwhelming — do we really have to list every single award that it was nominated for? In addition, I don't see the point of listing a nomination if it failed to succeed at winning the award, of course, unless it was a Golden Globe or an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> (have those nominations even become public yet?). Honestly, it needs to be sliced, and if no one decides to proceed to trimming it, I am going to have to do it myself. The thing about the list is that I've never even heard some of the award ceremonies listed let alone even realized that the film was nominated. Is one really going to want to know which films it lost to at a clip-ceremony held in Cameroon? I'm not so sure about this.

<dd>Did you even bother reading the old comments? I used to work on a cattle ranch, and the distinctive thing about cowboys is that they work with COWS. Annie Proulx herself said they were not cowboys, except in the general sense in which most people in the West are somewhat caught up in the cowboy myth. But these were low-level ranch hands working on a sheep herding ranch. They were closer to shepherds than cowboys.</dd>

<p>There are probably many hundreds thousands of awards this film could (and may) be nominated for and win, and a line has to be drawn as to whether an award is notable enough to be listed here. I award this movie the "Nohat Film Of The Year" award for 2005, but my award is not notable and does not deserve to be mentioned in the article. I hope that everyone agrees that some minimal standard of notability has to be applied. I propose that we systematically apply a criterion that if there is a Wikipedia article about the award, then it can be listed. If there is no Wikipedia article about the award, then it should not be listed. This criterion is good because it draws a clear line between what should and shouldn't be included, avoiding endless debates about whether some particular award is notable enough to be included. Implementation is simple: awards that are redlinks should be removed. It is fair because it applies an external standard of notability—the Wikipedia standard for retention of articles. It is also robust because it is not subject to manipulation—if someone creates articles for all the tiny, unimportant awards, they will probably be listed on AfD and deleted. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 07:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, another potential criterion, which I just thought up, which would limit the field of awards even more, but would ensure that important awards stayed present, would be to only include awards that someone who was involved with making the movie (director, cast, etc.) was present at the awarding of the award to receive. This would be harder to verify, but I think it is an excellent way to ensure that only truly important awards took up space in the article, creating better balance in the article. On a related topic, I think the article could use a more elaborated summary of the plot. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 07:21, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with your statement. It's not the purpose of an introduction to be overly detailed and to provide non-essential information that is included elsewhere in the article (including nearby in the infobox). The "See:" stuff is also highly distracting, in my opinion. Introductions should be streamlined and contain just the most important information. The fact that the movie was released on a specific date in three American cities (which is what happened on Dec. 9) is not important enough to make it into the lead. If you really want a link to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a> from the intro, it doesn't need a "See:" referent. You can imbed it in "2005" in the "2005 film" reference. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 00:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see this as a big deal. I did some previous edits to the lead paragraph to remove superfluous information that is covered elsewhere in the article. At that time, the lead paragraph had become four. The lead paragraph should cover the essential information of the film. Its limited release on a specific date is just not a very notable piece of information for the lead, and is already mentioned elsewhere. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 00:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has only been a few hours since I began editing this article, but I can already see that territory has been marked here. All right. You can edit the article without my interfering, although I will add information when the time is right or when something new is released to the press. Keep up the good work! I'll begin editing the other articles I have an interest in. I hope the peer review goes well and this article can become featured one day. —Eternal Equinox | <a href="../../../e/t/e/User_talk%7EEternal_Equinox_6bf0.html" title="User talk:Eternal Equinox">talk</a> 01:20, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Equinox, it's not about <i>marking territory</i>, it's about understanding that very active, high-profile articles have a history, often contentious, and over time reach an equilibrium. Those articles, including BBM, have regular editors who work to constantly improve the article and usually do so through well-justified edits, efforts to reach consensus, and often, cautious, incremental improvements.</dd>

<dd>Here, beyond the talk page debates over certain issues that rose to "controversial" status you'll find significant documentation in the edit history comments where, not infrequently, the change <b>of a single word</b> was accompanied by an edit summary of a dozen words justifying it. Changes like these demonstrate a pattern of editing where every word and every phrase is evaluated and considered in an effort to convey meaning precisely and without POV.</dd>

<dd>BBM editors are also on constant watch against vandalism and POV-pushing because the subject matter makes it a frequent target for both. To jump into such an article with major changes because "<i>its writing was not to my liking</i>" without adding prose that was obviously and dramatically better was inviting conflict (and a revert). That being said, I think I can speak for everyone in saying that thoughtful, well-considered editing is more than welcome. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#EF6521"><b>AU</b></font><font color="#000063" face="arial, helvetica"><b><i>Tiger</i></b></font></a> ʃ <font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../a/u/t/User_talk%7EAutiger_e4b5.html" title="User talk:Autiger">talk</a></sup></font>/<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Autiger_4136.html" title="Special:Contributions/Autiger">work</a></sub></font> 06:34, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
