<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Talk%7EBrown_hair_b7e7.html" title="Edit section: Brown or Blond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brown or Blond</span></h2>
<p>A friend of mine, who is an anthropologist, considers lighter shades of brown hair to be a blond variant. Also, many encyclopedias and dictionarys refer to "blond" as being anything light brown to pale yellow, while "brunette" is always defined as "dark brown or black". And interestingly, when counting how many blonds are in a certian region, usually light-brown(and sometimes medium brown) is counted as well. Just an interesting note.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, I've seen a light or pale yellowish brown considered blond by the dictionary. John Freida's Brilliant Brunette shampoo has a bottle for lighter shades of brown hair and a bottle for darker shades of brown hair and Pantene has some kind of brunette shampoo bottle that says something like for ligher shades of brown hair ( I don't remember the exact words). There's another Brunette shampoo, Suave I think that says something like for brown shades of hair. Some dictionaries say dark or brown hair/ or brown or black hair, which seems to me like brunette would apply to any or (at least) almost any shade of brown hair. Not all dictionaries say specifically dark brown hair/ or dark brown or black hair. I would think medium brown hair should be able to be considered brunette because some dictionaries define brunette as having dark or relatively dark hair and medium brown is a relatively dark shade of brown hair, which is relatively dark hair. There's seems to be quite a bit of controversy as to whether a light or lighter shade of brown hair is really brunette. I think there's quite a bit of evidence like what I said above to suggest that lighter shades of brown hair may really be brunette or that one can't totally dismiss the possibility that lighter shades of brown hair may be (technically) brunette because there's some evidence that seems to point towards lighter shades of brown hair being brunette.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can see what you're saying, but I just don't see it to be appropriate to label someone with light-brown hair as "brunette". When I think of brunette, I think of "dark". The french meaning of "brunette" literally implies "dark hair", and I don't get the impression of "dark" when I see a person with light-brown hair. I have a Swedish friend who is tall, fair-skinned and blue-eyed who had light blond hair that darkened to light-brown. I would never refer to him as "brunette", but I would consider "dirty" or "dark blond" to be more appropriate. Also when looking in my dictionary "blond" is described as being anything "light-brown to pale yellow" and sometimes just being "light in color". Now I do agree that medium brown hair can be brunette, and while there is evidence (such as the shampoo bottle) that "light-brown" hair can sometimes be brunette, there is also a great bit of evidence to suggest that it is not, but that it is more of a "blond" variant. It also depends on what one considers to be "light-brown".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I'm actually kinda ambivalent as to whether a light or lighter shade of brown hair is really brunette. I also tend to think of the word "dark" or "relatively dark" when I hear the word brunette. According to what I've read the word brunette comes from "brun" meaning brown. I've never actually seen a dictionary that considers light-brown hair to be blond, but I think there probably is a dictionary that considers light-brown hair blond, although I do have a unabridged dictionary that has the word "light brown" in part of the etymology of blond. You are right that blond is sometimes defined as "light in color" and light brown hair could possibly fit into that definition. I've only seen a light or pale yellowish brown defined as blond in the dictionary. The only way light brown hair could be considered dark or relatively dark hair is that it's darker than what is probably usually thought of as blond hair; yellowish or whitish colored hair. I don't think anyone or at least where I live would actually call a lighter shade of brown hair blond. Allwords. com's adjective definition of brunette says- Said Of Hair Colour: brown, usually dark brown. If brunette only applies to a dark shade of brown hair than why don't all dictionaries have the word "dark" in front of the word brown? How am I supposed to interpret one of Webster's definition of brunette: A person having brown or black hair and usu. a relatively dark complexion. I seem to fit into that definition because I have brown hair; a lighter shade of brown hair. It doesn't specifically say "dark brown" it just say's brown. The broadest definition one can find of a word is usually the most accurate/complete definition of a word. Having dark or brown hair; or having brown or black hair seems broader than the definition of having dark brown or black hair. Dictionaries usually reflect common usage of a word listing the thing or things a word is most associated with, even though there are other things that can be meant by a word, but aren't associated with as much. I want to know the complete definition of a word; all the possible meanings of a word, even the one's that aren't associated with the word as much, which I think is the most accurate definition of a word. I don't want to think that brunette just applies to dark-brown hair, when it applies to black hair as well. Though, brunette is more associated with dark-brown hair than black hair. Dark-brown is actually the color that brunette seems to be most associated with and I think the only color that is totally agreed upon as being brunette. I like to know the meanings of words well.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point I am trying to make is that, in anthropology, light shades of brown hair are usually considered "blond(e)". I've read many books on the subject and this seems to be accurate. "Brunet" or "Brunette" in anthropology is specifically refering to DARK shades of hair. The books give examples of "blond(e)" Europeans which cleary seem to have brown hair according to "American Fashion" standards. American fashion associates "blond(e)" with (usually bright) yellow hair color only, so it's not surprising that a dictionary might just say "brown hair" as the definition of "Brunette". But from an anthropological standpoint, light brown hair is a blond(e) variant, not a brunette one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay. I see your point of view. I don't really see light brown hair as being dark or relatively dark hair. I've noticed that some people consider light brown hair brunette and other's don't consider it brunette. Some people use the word brunette to simply refer to having brown hair. Do you know what the terms light brunette and dark brunette mean? I've seen them used on the internet.I've seen a few dictionaries define brunette as: A woman with brown hair. The word brunette comes from "brun" meaning brown and I think brunette can sometimes be translated into the word dark. I'm not sure where the word dark comes from in the etymology of brunette.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well you're probably right about the 'modern' usage of "brunette" being "brown hair" as is sometimes defined in the dictionary. "Light Brunette" probably means a lighter shade of brown while "dark brunette" means darker brown hair. Like I said the "American Fashion" definition of "blond" isn't as broad as the anthropological definition. With that in mind, "American fashion" just defines brunette as being anyone with brown hair. However when I entered "brun" in my language translator it translated to "dark". The point is, the true word "brunette" probably means "dark hair" considering most anthropologists would not consider a person with any sort of light hair, brown or otherwise, a "brunette" (or 'brunet' for men). When an anthropologist describes a brunet person, it usually refers to people of dark complexion, including dark skin, hair, and eyes. A "blond European" would be described as having "light complexion" and I think most people with Light Brown hair have light complexion. I mean, how many people do you know that were actually born with light brown hair? Most people I know with dark brown hair were born with it, but most people I know with light brown hair were very pale blond as children. Of course if a blond person, as defined in the dictionary, is a person with "light hair", then I think "light brown" fits within that range pretty well. =)</dd>

<dd>Ah, you're right there. She's a brunette who has darkened her hair to black. Brunette means dark-haired, and that often includes black, certainly in the original French, but a brown-haired picture would definitely be more representative. It's just that photos of people can be hard to find on Wikipedia, what with the copyright problems. Replace that photo if you can find a decent replacement. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"></a><font color="green">—&#160;Chameleon</font> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon">My page</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChameleon_f82a.html" title="User talk:Chameleon">My talk</a> 23:09, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<p>Does brunette apply to a light or lighter shade of brown hair? I think brunette may apply to any shade of brown(esp. dark-brown)hair, as well as black hair. I'm not sure. Brunette seems to be particularly associated with dark-brown or black hair, especially dark-brown hair. User:4.124.78.176</p>
<dl>
<dd>If we go back to the French word, <i>brun(e)</i> or <i>brunet(te)</i> refers to dark brown or black hair. Lighter, more chestnut-brown hair is <i>châtain</i>. So, if you use it especially for darker shades, you are faithful to the original word. I tried to illustrate the article with a girl with very dark hair. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"></a><font color="green">—&#160;Chameleon</font> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon">Main</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChameleon_f82a.html" title="User talk:Chameleon">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_Images_uploaded_0e64.html" title="User:Chameleon/Images uploaded">Images</a> 17:24, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks! I don't really consider light brown hair brunette, but some dictionary definitions of brunet/brunette say brown or black or dark or brown hair. I don't really see how light brown hair can be considered dark or relatively dark,unless if it's compared to a blonde's hair. I have a light shade of brown hair, but I've been called a brunette. The American Heritage Dictionary for example defines a brunette as: A girl or woman with dark or brown hair. So, I'm kinda confused.</dd>

<p>Allwords.com defines a brunette as: A woman or girl with brown or dark hair and as an adjective: Said of Hair Colour: brown,usually dark brown. So, maybe brunette defined as having dark-brown or black hair, esp. dark-brown hair is just common usage,but it can also apply to simply brown or light brown hair, but isn't very commonly used.

<p>Does anybody else here besides me think that brunette may apply to lighter shades of brown hair, but isn't as associated with brunette as dark-brown and black hair, especially dark-brown? Any opinions on this matter? Anybody here?</p>
<p>No, I don't think that "brunette" applies to lighter shades of brown hair. I would never call a woman "brunette" in that case. As to myself, I am a German beyond the age of 40, and my hair has darkened from childhood/adolescence blond/dark blond colour to some shade of light (or middle?) brown, while at the same time (or even before the darkening) getting grey hair more and more (well, I know, grey hair does not exist, so let's say white hair mixed with darker shades of hair). Being blue-eyed and having a light skin (and also specific characteristics of my face (shape, proportions?) more common in Northern Europe) I would never consider being called "brunette" to be appropriate for people like myself.</p>
<p>Thanks alot!!!! This question has been up for a pretty long time and finally somebody has replied to it. I'm still confused. I consider my hair to be a light or lighter shade of brown, I don't think it's even a medium brown and my boyfriend call me a brunette all the time. There are dictionary definitions of brunette that say having brown or black hair/or dark or brown hair. The adjective definition of brunette on allwords.com says- Said of Hair Colour: brown, usually dark brown. I seem to fit into that definition and the other ones I mentioned above. If I'm a brunette I would only technically be a brunette, I wouldn't fit into the common usage of brunette, I might be what some call a light brunette. I've seen shampoo for brunettes that has a bottle for darker shades of brown hair and a bottle for lighter shades of brown hair. I don't know what to think. I'm pretty sure that medium brown hair could be considered brunette, because it's a relatively dark shade of brown hair and some defintions of brunette say having dark or relatively dark hair.</p>
<p>If you are lighter than a "medium brunette," then you are probably a "dirty blonde."</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, just because a person with light brown hair is not considered a "brunette" does not suddenly make them "blonde" (or dirty blonde).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I'd have to disagree. Anthropogically it seems light-brown hair is considered a blond variant. At least, that's what I think.</dd>

<p>I don't understand why we can't put a picture of an dark brown Eurasian female. The brown haired female was longer than the other picture. We need a new picture. A brunette cleary says any female with dark brown hair...so what is exactly wrong with the Eurasian female...she has dark brown hair...she's the perfect example of an brunette...

<p>I think there should be a list of famous people or celebrities who are or have temporarily been or played as brunettes, but it should probably only include women who have really dark hair (dark-brown or black hair), since it isn't agreed upon as to whether women with light or lighter shades of brown hair really are brunettes.</p>
<p><br />
Yeah add women like Sarah Silverman,Catherine Zeta Jones,Neve Campbell,Annabella Sciorra,Jennifer Love Hewitt,Fran Drescher,Lacey Chabert,Marisa Tomei,etc as examples of famous Brunettes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, since this article is about brown hair in both sexes, the list would have to be of famous brunettes <i>and</i> famous brown-haired men. Secondly, such a list would rapidly grow out of control due to the enormous numbers of famous brown-haired people. I think the article is better off without such a list. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 07:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ya that is just you, she has dark brown hair I would say that brunette is anyone who has any shade of brown hair. Black haired peole I would Blacettes or Blacnds or Blacheads or something. Wouldn't "Noirette" be more appropriate? Considereing "blanc" means "white"? Or are you not using French?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why can't people with black hair be called brunette instead of just black haired or dark haired. If you can remember, the term Blackhead is a PIMPLE or BACTERIA in the FACE or SKIN! How insulting! I wouldn't want to be called that! I think the world would be better off , if we used the term "Brunette" for Black haired people AND dark brown/light brown haired people! Or:</p>
<p>Black hair=Brunette<br />
Dark brown/Brown/Light Brown haired=Brownhead! or Darky! At least they're not so insulting or offensive like what you just said! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.235.200.57_3523.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.235.200.57">69.235.200.57</a> (talk) 19:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
