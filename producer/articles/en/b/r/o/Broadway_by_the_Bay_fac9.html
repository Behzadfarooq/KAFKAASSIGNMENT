<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_by_the_Bay_fac9.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Historically, Broadway By the Bay is an outgrowth of a San Mateo Recreation Department program that originated in the 1950s as "La Honda Music Camp." Each summer, that program employed the talents of young musicians, singers, and actors to produce a musical (primarily <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_%26_Sullivan_7bd9.html" title="Gilbert &amp; Sullivan">Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</a> operettas), which was staged at the camp site in Jones Gulch near <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Honda%2C_California_b505.html" title="La Honda, California">La Honda, California</a>. The program grew to become the "San Mateo Community Theatre" with summer productions of three Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operettas from 1963 to 1965 at Hillsdale High School.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_by_the_Bay_fac9.html" title="Edit section: First productions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First productions</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Hunt and Lynch were the directors for the first two summer productions at <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsdale_High_School_4e85.html" title="Hillsdale High School">Hillsdale High School</a>, both operettas by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_%26_Sullivan_7bd9.html" title="Gilbert &amp; Sullivan">Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</a>. Dr. Hunt had directed a number of the operettas when he taught at <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capuchino_High_School_3009.html" title="Capuchino High School">Capuchino High School</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Bruno%2C_California_feb4.html" title="San Bruno, California">San Bruno</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> from 1950 to 1960. He had also been on the staff of the La Honda Music Camp, which was known for its summer musical productions, and his success with the camp encouraged the City of San Mateo to establish a non-profit community musical theater. Lynch had acted in local productions of the operettas. Both Hunt and Lynch were considered leading experts of the popular operettas.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first production was <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patience.html" title="Patience">Patience</a></i>, which Gilbert &amp; Sullivan subtitled "Bunthorne's Bride," with three performances in August 1963 in the little theatre at Hillsdale High School and an additional performance at La Honda Music Camp in Jones Gulch, near <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Honda%2C_California_b505.html" title="La Honda, California">La Honda</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Cruz_Mountains_8331.html" title="Santa Cruz Mountains">Santa Cruz Mountains</a>. The cast utilized local high school and college students and included a future international opera singer, soprano <a href="../../../l/u/a/Luana_De_Vol_b7d9.html" title="Luana De Vol">Luana De Vol</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The operetta was premiered in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in 1881 as a satire on the aesthetic and transcendental movements led by <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. Dr. Hunt directed a small orchestra that included musicians from throughout <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Mateo_County_192b.html" title="San Mateo County">San Mateo County</a>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1964, Hunt and Lynch collaborated on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mikado_2379.html" title="The Mikado">The Mikado</a></i>, with six performances at Hillsdale High School and an additional performance at La Honda Music Camp. This was clearly a more ambitious production. The operetta had been premiered in London, at the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savoy_Theatre_ccdd.html" title="Savoy Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> in 1885. Although <i>The Mikado</i> has a Japanese setting, it actually satirizes British customs and politics; much of the political satire seemed quite appropriate during the controversial 1964 political campaigns between <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Goldwater_8b15.html" title="Barry Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>.</p>
<p>Citing increasing responsibilities at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merritt_College_5068.html" title="Merritt College">Merritt College</a> in <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, where he taught from 1963 until his retirement, Dr. Hunt did not return for the summer 1965 production. Instead, Anthony "Duke" Campagne, the band director at Hillsdale High School, worked with Robert Lynch on a production of <i><a href="../../../h/2E/m/H.M.S._Pinafore_ec03.html" title="H.M.S. Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></i>. There were four performances at Hillsdale and one at La Honda Music Camp.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_by_the_Bay_fac9.html" title="Edit section: After Gilbert &amp; Sullivan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</span></h3>
<p>After three Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operettas, the San Mateo Community Theatre moved in a different direction. Although Anthony Campagne returned, he was joined by a staff that included <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_L._Ton_1ed0.html" title="Kenneth L. Ton">Kenneth L. Ton</a>, the drama director at <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capuchino_High_School_3009.html" title="Capuchino High School">Capuchino High School</a>, and Ben Denton, the choral director at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragon_High_School_e150.html" title="Aragon High School">Aragon High School</a>. For the first time, the SMCT presented a classic Broadway musical: <i><a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma%21.html" title="Oklahoma!">Oklahoma!</a></i> by <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein_c5e5.html" title="Rodgers and Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a>. Ton had a great influence on the production, which heavily used Capuchino graduates, including <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_De_Vol_a522.html" title="Gordon De Vol">Gordon De Vol</a> and Joyce Thomas. Once again, the cast and orchestra were drawn from high school and college students throughout <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Mateo_County_192b.html" title="San Mateo County">San Mateo County</a>. Another first was moving the performances to the little theater at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_San_Mateo_108d.html" title="College of San Mateo">College of San Mateo</a>. Overall, the production was a great success and encouraged SMCT to produce more musicals.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr. Hunt returned as a director for the 1967 production of <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Side_Story_72da.html" title="West Side Story">West Side Story</a></i> by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Bernstein_093b.html" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Sondheim_2c11.html" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>. The performances were moved to the auditorium at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Mateo_High_School_4889.html" title="San Mateo High School">San Mateo High School</a>, later known as the San Mateo Performing Arts Center. This has been the home of the San Mateo Community Theatre, now known as Broadway by the Bay, ever since. There were serious cast problems in this production that marred the overall impression with those who attended. Nevertheless, staff changes soon resulted in better directions for future productions, which often relied on professional and semi-professional talent, as well as non-professional singers and dancers. Broadway by the Bay, as it is now known, has achieved consistently high, near professional standards for many years.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The San Mateo Community Theatre became an official non-profit organization in 1978. In 1983, the Board of Directors expanded the focus of the company and changed the name to "Peninsula Civic Light Opera." In 1999, a decision was made to gradually change the name to "Broadway by the Bay," to more accurately reflect the fact that the group stages Broadway-type musicals as opposed to operatic productions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_by_the_Bay_fac9.html" title="Edit section: Broadway by the Bay Today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Broadway by the Bay Today</span></h2>
<p>Broadway by the Bay continues to grow with nearly 6,000 season subscribers and over 3,000 single show ticket sales per production. The company made a major contribution to the national theatre scene by co-producing the full scale world premiere of <i>The Prince and The Pauper</i> in August 1993. This musical is currently being reworked for a future Broadway production.</p>
<p>Broadway By the Bay is a not-for-profit corporation for the public benefit which provides full scale musical theatre productions of professional quality at family prices. The company continues to grow in professionalism, attendance and stature.</p>
<p>The three or four show season opens with the first production in May, the second in late July and early August, the third in September, and the fourth in October. Most productions are appropriate family entertainment. Each show normally has nine performances at the San Mateo Performing Arts Center (SAMPAC), which seats 1,600 people.</p>
<p>The actors, some musicians, some technical staff, box office workers, ushers and office staff are all volunteers, as is the 21-member Board of Directors. Over 40,000 volunteer hours are contributed each year. In addition to the tremendous contributions of time, the productions are supported by a budget of over $500,000. Regular staff includes the Executive Director, Artistic Director, Development Director and Office/Box Office Manager. Production directors are contracted for each show. A year-round office is maintained at 851 Burlway Road, Suite 300, Burlingame, California.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
