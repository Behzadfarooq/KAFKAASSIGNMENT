<p>Sorry for acting too hastily; the edit looked so much like a type of vandalism that I've come across often that I simply assumed that that was what it was, and reacted accordingly. I should have taken into account the fact that you have a User account (which is a strong contra-indication) and then checked your other edits.

<p>Hi, good work on fixing all those ambiguous links. However, I just wanted to mention that in <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumnavigation.html" title="Circumnavigation">circumnavigation</a>, I changed the Halifax link to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, since the voyage was in 1942 and it was the then city — not the present municipal region — that they went to.

<dd>Yeah, you have a good point; it's a bit of a weird situation. But I've been linking to the city article from a variety of articles when that was the situation at the time; I don't want to indicate that someone's birthplace was the municipality when it was the city. The problem is that the Halifax name has been used for two things that really seem pretty different, and I can't see a neat way to deal with that. — <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohantheghost_a1e6.html" title="User:Johantheghost">Johan&#160;the&#160;Ghost</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohantheghost_a875.html" title="User talk:Johantheghost"><sub>seance</sub></a> 16:23, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please allow me time to complete these articles before you go removing what might appear "unused materials." Thanks. Thanks, also, for your contributions to these articles (like the info from Texas). I am working on this material constantly. It takes time. Please give that time!

<li>So far as I am aware, I have not removed any substantive unused material, so I presume that you referring to the unused section headings that I removed from <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodie_W._White_1d8b.html" title="Woodie W. White">Woodie W. White</a>? Why not just create the headings when you are ready to add content beneath them? As a compromise, I have just commented them out for now -- hope that's OK, but it is unkind to a reader to present them with a contents box offering links to sections which are entirely blank, or to force them to scroll down past a series of widely-spaced empty headings in case there is something substantive at the bottom. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 00:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. When categorizing pages, please do not include both a subcategory and its parent category.

<dd>Hello again. Thanks for the response. I was a bit confused about why I wasn't familiar with the guideline you cited, until I realized that another user had added it to the page a couple weeks ago. I don't think I agree with it, as it seems to imply that users should follow the main guideline, except when they don't feel like it. In any case, if you take a look at the other subcategories of <a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_in_the_United_States_af07.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures in the United States">Category:Buildings and structures in the United States</a> that are categorized by state, from <a href="../../../h/o/t/Category%7EHotels_in_the_United_States_36f0.html" title="Category:Hotels in the United States">hotels</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Category%7EAstronomical_observatories_in_the_United_States_7bc7.html" title="Category:Astronomical observatories in the United States">observatories</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShopping_malls_in_the_United_States_ab1f.html" title="Category:Shopping malls in the United States">malls</a>, you'll find that they do not keep the articles in the parent category when a state subcategory exists. The reason I only recategorized a few of the articles is because I ran out of time. I'll go back and get the rest later, if I have time and nobody beats me to them. - <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurekaLott_6975.html" title="User:EurekaLott">EurekaLott</a> 00:54, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please don't keep removing: [Category:Bishops of the United Methodist Church]] from U.M. Bishops' pages. Yes, they are properly categorized in their predecessor denominations (M.E., M.E., south, etc.). But each are ALSO properly categorized as U.M. Bishops. That is their original categories. See the suggestions about categories from wikipedia! They say pages CAN be properly categorized in categories AND subcategories when appropriate. This is appropriate! They are NOT superfluous!! Thanks!! <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 13:08, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please take some time to read "Reasons for duplication" in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_Categories_and_subcategories_2168.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization/Categories and subcategories">Wikipedia:Categorization/Categories and subcategories</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There was <i>massive</i> duplication of categories of most those bishops. Many of the bishops were classfied as: Bishop of the ME Church, Bishop of the UMChurch, Methodist Bishop, Methodist Clergy, and then Christian ministers as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since these categories all have a hierarchical relationship, that makes for four unnecessary categories in each case. Every Methodist bishop is by definition a Christian minister, so there is no gain in adding them to that category as well. The top category labels them accurately, the rest is overkill.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. It is not overkill to recognize the fact that historically before they were Bishops each was an ordained minister, Christian minister, etc. Each of these various categories contain different connotations and provide additional information about each of these historical (or present) figures. Moreover, as persons use this encyclopedia, such multi-categorizations will prove helpful in discovering more and more persons illustrative of the categorization. For example, if one seeks information or examples of Christian ministers, this would open up a much broaded spectrum of persons to view (rather than only those who were Christian ministers only, not anything else). Plus isn't the idea of wikipedia to be able to go from one related topic to another easily? Again, this multi-categorization enables that. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 16:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have just spent several hours removing this duplication, which makes the categorisation much more usable (and that's the main point of it), and will watch future edits for any reappearance -- it's really just overkill to dump everything into every possible category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am tremendously impressed by your devotion and your promptness at editing the articles I submit! Again, you seem almost as passionate about them as I am!! It seems a matter of mere moments sometimes after I have finished writing that you visit and make additions, subtractions, edits, and sometimes even add content (which I especially appreciate -- thanks!) <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 16:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The one outstanding question which you seem to be raising is whether ME bishops should also be classified in the parent category of UM, and I disagree with your interpretation there, which is why I have reverted the dual classifications you have reintroduced, and suggest we discuss it further before proceeding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I replied here once already, I thought (can't find it). Let's see if I can reconstruct my thoughts. The PRIMARY categorization for ALL of the Bishops (ME, MES, EUB, etc.) is Bishops of the United Methodist Church. This is so for several reasons. Number one, because none of the other denominations exist any longer. 2., because all of the ARE UM Bishops (not were, but ARE). Since the denominations that elected them are now absorbed into the U.M. Church, they ARE U.M. bishops. Please try to understand this from the perspective of someone who is a U.M. Ask any church historian well educated in U.M. history and polity. I created the SUBcategories primarily to make it easier for folks to see where each of these Bishops also fit in history. But they ARE all U.M. Bishops, as well as M.E., EUB, or what have you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 19th century bishops, for example, were not bishops of the UM church: they were bishops of the ME or ME(S) church. Similarly, those elected as bishop between 1939 and 1968 were not UM bishops, they were bishops of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Methodist_Church_be27.html" title="The Methodist Church">The Methodist Church</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>yes they ARE! The ME church no longer exists. But from the perspective of the communion of the Saints, they ARE Bishops of the U.M.C. -- just like Kings/Queens of England are and always will be such, as well as Kings/Queens of the U.K. and/or other expansions of their realm.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be historically inaccurate not to classify them in the denomination in which they were elected bishop, so I have been through the entire list, twice, to check that they are all corrctly categorised. With the exception of about two where I was unsure, I have completed that task.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>yes, of course. But it would be historically inaccurate not to classify them in the U.M.C., as well! Just look at our Book of Discipline! If the U.M.Church is the authority on all things U.M., they/we classify them as U.M. Bishops, who came to the U.M. Church through said predecessor denomination.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The next question is whether all those bishops from the predecessor denominations should be dual-categorised as UM. As a historian, I find that very suspect: many of them were not UM bishops, they were bishops in predecessor denominations, and it is historically innacurate to assign them the label of a denomination which came into existence only after their death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Take, for example, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah_Hedding_e86a.html" title="Elijah Hedding">Elijah Hedding</a>, who died 87 years before the 1939 merger, and 118 years before the creation of he UM church. I understand that the UM church claims his work as part of its heritage, and that's entirely the UM's business (it's not for anyone outside that church to say whaether that's right or wrong); but for the purpose of classification in an NPOV encyclopedia, it's highly misleading to label people as something they could not have been.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where I think that dual classification <i>might</i> make sense is for those bishops who were elected in predecessor denominations, but who served as UM bishops after 1968. At a rough estimate, I think that about 100 of the 567 total might fall into that overlap category. Would that be acceptable to you as a compromise?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Otherwise, apart from the theoretical objections, there is a practical problem if all bishops of predecessor denominations are added in directly to the UM category. The list of bishops to date shows a count of 567, which will only rise (there appears, on average, to be five or ten new bishops each year). The category of UM bishops, if anywhere near complete, will start to become over-large and unwieldy as more bishops are added. It will also be leave the reader with no way of distinguishing from the category which bishops are UM bishops (rather than from a precedessor denom).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope that makes sense! But let's discuss further rather than risk an edit war. -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 14:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point, but I'm not quite persuaded. That's 13,000 for Tom Ellis the actor out of 150,000 hits on a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Tom+Ellis%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Tom+Ellis%22" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Tom Ellis"</a>, so there are a lot of other "Tom Ellis"-named ppl out there. Some of whom are likely to start getting Wikipedia entries, two of whom who are already referenced, and the list looks likely to grow. I understand the general principle of linking to the most widely-sought instance, but this is such a common name that a direct link is likely to cause confusion as more links are added which intend to point to another Tom Ellis. So I'd suggest leaving it at the disambig for now. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 13:24, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not trying to intrude on your personal life or change your views or anything but I was reading your comments on this Talk Page and noticed that you were an agnostic. I also read your comments on <i>Articles for deletion/Ned Dougherty</i> and your sarcasm toward Jesus and the Virgin Mother. I'll have you know that I am a former atheist/agnostic, but only months ago I found that there is surmounting evidence of an afterlife or at least consciousness beyond physical death. I would simply like to share this evidence with you because I personally know its much more comforting to be a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theist.html" title="Theist">theist</a> than an agnostic. Please see this site&#160;: <a href="http://www.near-death.com/evidence.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.near-death.com/evidence.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and tell me what you think, I'd appreciate either an endorsement or rebuttal of the site's claims, since you appear to be a very intelligent person to me.

<dd>Glad to hear it works for you, but I don't really want to discuss it.

<p>I have moved this disambig page back to John Wood. Please read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Disambiguation_Malplaced_disambiguation_pages_c6f3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation/Malplaced disambiguation pages">Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation/Malplaced disambiguation pages</a> for the reasoning behind this. I am about to change John Wood (English actor) and others, which do not need a disambig template (hatnote), since most readers get there via a direct link from another article, and most readers who want any or all John Woods will just type John Wood in the search box and hit the "Go" button, and will then see the disambig page. Leave me a message if you have any other questions, and happy editing! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_the_speller_fea2.html" title="User:Chris the speller">Chris the speller</a> 19:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. I'm sorry, but I disagree about all this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The page you suggest does't really provide any reasoning, it just says that it can be done, which is true, but rather misses the point about <i>why</i>. I think it's a bad move.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When there are so many variants of a given name popping up, many readers will get there via Google or other search engines: most internet users do not (as you assume) start by looking only on Wikipedia (if they did, Wiki would have outpaced Google). So there is a reasonable chance that someone looking for John Wood will end up at one of the "wrong" John Woods. (Think about what would happen if you've seen John Wood in a film and Google for <i>John Wood actor</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, providing a clear link to the other JWs at the top of the article gives the reader a quick way of seeing that there are others, and getting there fast. For the reader who has found what they want, the dablink is no hassle; for those who haven't, the dablink is a lifeline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By removing the dablink, you leave the found-the-wrong-page reader marooned: to try again, they have to stop clicking on links, and start searching in the search box. What's the gain in making the reader's life difficult in that way?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the advantages of having the dab pages explicitly labelled as such is to make it clear exactly what you are goung to -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wood_ccb2.html" title="John Wood">John Wood</a> suggests a person, but <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wood_%28disambiguation%29_176a.html" title="John Wood (disambiguation)">John Wood (disambiguation)</a> is clearly some sort of meta-data, even if you don't know what disambiguation means.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I have reverted your edits, restoring the hatnotes on the pages where you had removed them. If you think that the hatnotes could be shorter, I'd be happy to see them edited down (some of themn repeat what's in the text), but please don't remove them entirely). Even if <i>you</i> don't need them, they are useful!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's not a matter of you disagreeing with me, or me disagreeing with you, but of following or not following the guidelines. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Generic_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Generic topic</a> specifies that "In most cases, the generic term or phrase should be the title of the actual disambiguation page". Also, "the "(disambiguation)" page will redirect to the generic topic page." After reviewing the situation, I concur with putting the hatnotes back in the individual articles, especially in the case of the <i>John Wood actor</i> search, since a reader could find the English actor when they wanted the Australian actor. As far as shorter hatnotes, no, not needed, I am a big fan of the otheruses4 template and its good friend, the redirect5 template. I think I went too far taking out the hatnotes this time, sorry for the trouble, but moving "John Wood (disambiguation)" to "John Wood" was perfectly correct and needed. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_the_speller_fea2.html" title="User:Chris the speller">Chris the speller</a> 01:34, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear BrownHairedGirl</p>
<p>You recently edited 'Disability Discrimination Act 1995' to put it in the category 'rights of the disabled'. Disability campaigners prefer not to use the term 'the disabled' - compare 'the gays', 'the blacks', the Jews'. Could you please revert to 'Rights of disabled people'? (I have spent some time trying to change the name of the category without success) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.178.105.50 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.178.105.50_c06b.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.178.105.50">contribs</a>) 20:55, 29 April 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I can't reply on your talk page, because you are not logged in and therrefore don't have a talk page, so I have to reply here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first thing is that I entirely agree with you about the inappropriateness of the termoinology "the disabled": I have spent a large part of the last decade campaiging against the use of that sort of language, so you don't need to persuade me of how bad it is!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the problem is that the other category names used simply are not categories in Wikipedia, at least not at present. Just editing the article <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995_e418.html" title="Disability Discrimination Act 1995">Disability Discrimination Act 1995</a> to put in an entry for Category:Rights of disabled people will only have the effect of uncategorising the article, because that category does not exist, and no other articles are categorised in that way. That's why I changed it back to the category which <i>does</i> exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What needs to be done is to have the Category:Rights of the disabled renamed, which cannot be done unilaterally by an ordinary user. Instead, there is a discussion procedure to go through, which is set out at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#How_to_use_this_page" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion#How_to_use_this_page</a>: if the proposal is successful, an admin will rename the category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm busy on other things, so I'm not going to propose the renaming myself: but if you register, get a user account anmd learn the procedure, you could make the proposal yourself. If you do so, please let me know and I'd be happy to lend my support! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 22:50, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. You were saying in your RFA that the above article is nowhere near Featured Status. I wondered if you knew about the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOD_ad34.html" title="WP:GOOD">Good Articles</a> scheme? A shorter article like this can aim for that badge instead. I think it would need only a few improvements, some more references, and it would have to stay stable for a while. Look into it if you don't know about it already. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind comments on my <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html#Cathcart_Wason" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">my talk page</a> about the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathcart_Wason_3e6d.html" title="Cathcart Wason">Cathcart Wason</a> article. I was aware of the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOD_ad34.html" title="WP:GOOD">Good Articles</a> scheme, but thought that this article was well below the required standard (no illustrations apart from the map, not many references). Do you really think it's worth nominating?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, thanks for taking the time to vote in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_BrownHairedGirl_6bd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/BrownHairedGirl">my RFA</a>. I have learnt a lot from everyone's comments, particularly those who voted to oppose. That may sound perverse, but it has been a very informative process so far, and even though my nomination now looks unlikely to suceeed, the feedback has been useful enough to make me reckon I did the right thing in taking the plunge (after a lot of hesitation) and nominating myself. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 09:49, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you shouldn't nominate it yet, but you should aim for it . With regards to your RFA, I apologise for the neutral/leaning to oppose but I'm sure you can appreciate the reasons&#160;:) If you really want to move from writing articles to the <i>thankless task</i> of being an admin (I am one, and it's not all roses although no way would I voluntarily surrender my 'mop' and 'badge'!), then it's best to demonstrate a need for the tools first and to show your "face" around project space. Take part in lots of AFD discussions, do some "recent changes" patrolling, maybe even show up at the admins noticeboard occasionally. Of course, you shouldn't do these things t<i>to get adminship</i>, you should be doing these things because you want to, and eventually you'll find yourself needing the extra tools.</dd>

<dd>In the meantime, if you need any assistance from an admin, such as moving a page over a redirect, just give me a shout. You might want to consider withdrawing your application and trying again later, or you might want to let it run and learn from the feedback - up to you!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:55, 8 May 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<dd>Thanks for the suggestions! As to the vote on RFA, no need to apologise at all — I do indeed appreciate the reasons,. I am inclined to thnk that I should indeed withdraw my application, but I'm learning so much from the applicatoin that I'm also tempted to let in run and keep on learning, but I'm not sure whether it's rude to do that if I intend to withdraw. What do you think?</dd>

<dd>I'll return to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathcart_Wason_3e6d.html" title="Cathcart Wason">Cathcart Wason</a> article and stick an expand tag on it in the hope that'll encourage someone else to add a bit more to it.

<dd>I'd advise against putting an expand tag on it. It's way past that level. My suggestion would be to post a request at the New Zealand Wikipedians noticeboard (I presume there is one).

<dd>It <i>is</i> close now, so you may well squeeze through. The question, though, is are you ready? From what I've seen, you're a great editor and a nice person, but the answer would have to be "not yet". The issues you said you want to work on don't need admin tools - rolling back vandalism can be done manually or with Popups, and taking part in AFD etc is open to all. It's only closing an AFD as 'delete' that requires you to be an admin, and frankly you don't yet have enough experience taking part in AFD debates to be thinking about closing them. I'm not meaning to tell you what to do - and if you <i>do</i> get promoted please feel free to call on me if you need any assistance - but I hope that's provided some food for thought. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:44, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks again for your comments. I think I'll let the RFA run (and I've added a box on <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">my user page</a> asking people to vote as they see fit.</dd>
<dd>I take your point about popups, which I installed a week ago, though they seem to make my browser a little unstable (I've gone back to using Opera this week as an experiment). One of the reasons I wanted to other ask for admin powers was for the job of deleting redirects to allow a nameswap between an article and a redirect, and I can't see any way of doing that without admin powers (I should have mentioned this). In the meantime, may I ask you to help me with a batch of them? (I'll post details on your <a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKingboyk_c744.html" title="User talk:Kingboyk">your talk</a>). --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 11:29, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes you can ask me, but please make sure you tell me which page is to be moved as I prefer to do the move myself than to just delete the redirect and leave a red link. Also, no more than 5 please - if you have more you'll have to ask another admin to do the rest&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I see you have alrered the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_constituencies_b2f3.html" title="List of Irish constituencies">List of Irish constituencies</a> to refer to some (Dáil Éireann constituency) articles rather than (constituency) ones. I had originally begun to do different articles for constituencies in different institutions. Some people objected strongly to this, as they felt that there should be a single constituency article for each constituency name. The <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_University_%28constituency%29_f8d2.html" title="Dublin University (constituency)">Dublin University (constituency)</a> article is probably the best example of the comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>I am conscious that the project for standardised UK constituency articles already cuts across a comprehensive approach to Irish constituencies - see <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmagh_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_52df.html" title="Talk:Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)">Talk:Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)</a> for my attempted compromise.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware the only (Dáil Éireann constituency) articles are the ones I set up before I received objections. Current Irish Republic constituency articles, which were created before I became involved with this area, use (constituency).</p>
<p>I propose to set up (constituency) articles and merge the corresponding UK Parliament and Dáil Éireann articles in to them. I was working my way through the list broadly in alphabetical order, but if this is causing confusion it may be desirable that I merge all the existing UK Parliament constituency articles (at least for pre-1922 constituencies) and Dáil Éireann constituency articles into single constituency articles as quickly as possible and delay inserting additional material as I have been doing with the County Antrim areas.</p>
<p>If you have views on this topic, I would be delighted to hear them, as I really do not want to undertake such a large project and have to redesign it frequently when it proves I have gone in a different direction than most people want. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_J_5e89.html" title="User:Gary J">Gary J</a> 03:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I came across your name on the Categories for Deletion discussion page. And, as I do with most Users I’m not familiar with (which is about 99% so far) I went to your User Page. I was most caught by your Userbox mentioning rotary telephones, and wanted to share some more nostalgia with you:</p>
<p>I remember when…</p>
<ul>
<li>It took five minutes for the TV to warm up.</li>
<li>When a quarter was a decent allowance.</li>
<li>Nobody owned a purebred dog.</li>
<li>You’d reach into a muddy gutter for a penny.</li>
<li>No one ever asked where the car keys were because they were always in the car, in the ignition, and the doors were never locked.</li>
<li>Lying on you back in the grass with your friends and saying things like, “That cloud looks like a…”</li>
<li>And playing baseball with no adults to help with the rules of the game.</li>
<li>Stuff from the store came without safety caps and hermetic seals because no one had yet tried to poison a perfect stranger.</li>
<li>Decisions were made by going “eeny-meeny-miney-moe”.</li>
<li>Catching the fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening.</li>
<li>The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was “cooties”.</li>
<li>It wasn’t odd to have two or three “best friends”.</li>
<li>Having a weapon in school meant being caught with a slingshot.</li>
<li>A foot of snow was a dream come true.</li>
<li>Saturday morning cartoons weren’t 30-minute commercials for action figures.</li>
<li>“Olly-olly-oxen-free” made perfect sense.</li>
<li>The worst embarrassment was being picked last for a team.</li>
<li>War was a card game.</li>
<li>Baseball cards in the spokes transformed any bike into a motorcycle.</li>
<li>Taking drugs meant orange-flavored chewable aspirin.</li>
<li>Water balloons were the ultimate weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be healthy,</p>

<p>Hi BrownHairedGirl, I'm not sure this is appropriate, but since I'm wondering about how to get more info on a work by John Hill, and you happen to be the last person to edit the corresponding Wiki-article, maybe you might help. The work I'm interested in is "The sleep of plants". It is mentioned in the German version of Hill's article, but not in the English and french ones. So my first question is why you haven't mentioned it. The second question is, if John Hill is indeed the author of that memoir, how could I get at least a glimpse into its contents&#160;?

<p>While the downside isn't much, dab pointers on pages like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Thomas_%28linebacker%29_9474.html" title="Robert Thomas (linebacker)">Robert Thomas (linebacker)</a> are not likely to be necessary. Its difficult to get to that page without it being the page you want (you either clinked a link on a related page or went through the dab page already!). Especially when, as in this case, the dab page doesn't have the (disambiguation) part in the title. Not a big deal, but. . . <a href="../../../j/w/y/User%7EJwy_3c30.html" title="User:Jwy">John (Jwy)</a> 00:44, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi John, I don't think I can agree with the "unlikely to be necessary" bit. This a discussion which seems to pop up periodically, and I always find myself thinking that maybe some people take too wiki-centric a view of how Wikipedia is used.</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that many users will not start on wikipedia, they'll start with a search engine such as Google; and chances are these days that a wikipedia entry will appear at the top of the list. They may find in the article title a clue about which particular person the page in question describes, or they may not. If the page is entitled "John Q. Smith", that probably won't tell them whether it's the right John Smith, and a term such as "linebacker" may be more helpful to some, but not to others such as me who couldn't tell a linebacker from a backpacker, and only know from reading the very clear introductory sentence that it's about some sort of football.</dd>
<dd>The problem is that the introductory sentence may not be one that Google displays in the excerpt, so it may not be available when deciding whether to view the page — and the dab page will rarely get to the top of google.</dd>
<dd>So the way I see it is that far from it being difficult, it's actually quite easy for a user can to end up on the wrong page when the article name is even a bit ambiguous. And once they get there, they may not even know that there ought to be a dab page.</dd>
<dd>The {{otherpeople}} hatlink takes little enough screenspace and mental bandwidth for the reader that it's no impediment to a user who doesn't need it — but it will be very useful to anyone who does.</dd>
<dd>The page in question is one of those that least needs the hatlink, but it may be useful to some and interesting to others, which is why I added it to that Robert Thomas as well as to the others. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 03:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>You cannot just go around removing cats willy-nilly just cos you don't like them: that is widely considered to be vandalism.</p>
<p>That constituency-specific cat was created for a very good reason: Orkney and Shetland is a special (perhaps unique) constituency in the UK, and that cat is a vital component of its parent cats.</p>
<p>You have absolutely no right to unilaterally destroy a perfectly valid cat. Please desist or I will alert an Admin. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 07:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You raise a good point: as a compromise, I will restore to the articles in question the category "Members of the United Kingdom Parliament from Scottish Constituencies", while leaving in place the sub-category which you have created.</dd>
<dd>However, your point about destroying a valid category is surprising. You have set about a single-handed mission to sub-divide ad-infinitum the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_MPs_7362.html" title="Category:British MPs">Category:British MPs</a>, without making any contribution to the discussion on that category's talk pages. I myself made a proposal back in March for a reorganisation of that category (without reaching any consensus), but you have made no contribution to that or any subsequent discussion on the issue. Instead, you have set unilaterally out to sub-divide the members of the UK Parliament, into up to three layers of sub-categories.</dd>
<dd>Please desist from these changes, and accept the reinstatement of the catch-all categories unless and until you find a consensus for change.</dd>

<p>There is a world of difference between emptying a lowest-level cat of all its members, and subdividing a super-category. By dividing a cat you are not "destroying" it, you are enhancing it, because the various subcats now belong to other useful category hierarchies, <i>and</i> are still in the main cat. Empting a lowest-level cat is most certainly "destroying" it.</p>
<p>Your addition of supercategories to articles that are already in a subcat is plain daft, and is contrary to all good practice here at Wikipedia (imagine if that was followed to its logical conclusion: <a href="../../../f/u/n/Category%7EFundamental_f8e7.html" title="Category:Fundamental">Category:Fundamental</a> would contain every single category, subcategory and article in existence - over 1.2 million). I am not going to systematically traipse round tidying up the mess you are making, cos life is too short, but if I had enough time I would. However, any supercats that I do notice in my travels will be immediately removed. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 08:17, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By dividing a category and removing an article from the parent category, you may dilute its usefulness. As you would be aware if you had participated in the discussion on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_MPs_7362.html" title="Category:British MPs">Category:British MPs</a>, there is considerable support for retaining a category which includes on one level all those who are members of the UK parliament, and I can see no support for your unilateral process of sub-division, let alone a consensus for it.</dd>
<dd>I am aware of the discussions elsewhere about whether the UK is a country or nation or both or neither (and my own views on that are irrelevant here), but at no point have I seen any suggestion that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not one parliament.</dd>
<dd>In my view, this question would not arise <i>if</i> wikipedia had a function to list "all articles in this category and its subcategories": if it did, I would have no hesitation in supporting your sub-categorisation. Sadly, there is no such facility, so the only way of retaining the "list all" feature is by retaining the classification in the parent category.</dd>
<dd>Note that keeping articles in parent categories is <b>not</b> ruled out in the guidelines: <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUBCAT_c8af.html" title="WP:SUBCAT">WP:SUBCAT</a> sets out some of the situations where this is appropriate, noting that "The basic principle is that the duplication makes it easier, and not harder, for users to find article". If you disagree that duplication makes it easier to find an MP, come and argue your case, but don't just unilaterally subdivide.</dd>
<dd>I would urge you to promptly start discussing these changes on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs</a>, and to seek a consensus for your actions. If you don't, then I will continue to restore the vandalised parent categories, and will seek admin involvement if you persist in reverting.</dd>
<dd>I am not going to discuss this issue further here. This discussion belongs in category talkspace, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category_talk%7EBritish_MPs_6387.html" title="Category talk:British MPs">Category talk:British MPs</a> seems most appropriate since that is the category which is being subdivided.</dd>
