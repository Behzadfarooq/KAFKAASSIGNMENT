<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brass.html" title="Brass">brass</a> article seems to imply that, while <i>some</i> brasses are called "bronze", this is incorrect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some types of brass are called bronzes, despite their high zinc content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, this article indicates that "bronze" is a general term for copper alloys, and therefore includes brass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>brass, a subset of the bronze alloys in which zinc is the principal additive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not qualified to judge which of these is correct, but they seem to contradict each other.</p>

<dd>Bronze is stronger than simple iron, but weaker than carburized iron. In the ancient period, therefore, bronze was stronger but more expensive than iron. As ironworking techniques improved, iron took over bronze, being both cheaper and stronger. Also, unless I'm mistaken, bronze has a lower melting point than iron and is therefore easier to cast, but harder to forge due to its greater hardness. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 20:47, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This does not sound right to me - to which <i>era</i> is the article refering? I guess that there <i>might</i> have been a period in the late bronze age when small amounts of iron were being used and this iron may been weak due to impurities etc. I would like see some cites for this. Bronze has a much lower melting point than iron and it was quite impossible for the ancients to cast iron. Bronze is far more maleable that iron and bronze artifacts sometimes have beaten details that could never have been achieved in iron.

<dd>Bronze is often used for bearings, but I don't think that has anything to do with cannons. Early cannons did not fire tight-fitting balls which were, in any case, often made of stone. If the above is true, why arn't modern guns which do have tigh-fitting ammunition, made of bronze? My understanding is that early cannons were made of bronze because of the adaptation of bell casting techniques were the only practical method available.</dd>

<p><a href="http://www.claytoncramer.com/Iron2.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.claytoncramer.com/Iron2.pdf" rel="nofollow">This</a> says that "Iron is <i>not</i> superior to bronze for tools. Wrought iron, the form first encountered by Near Eastern smelters, is roughly equivalent in hardness to annealed 10% tin bronze, and inferior to <i>all</i> cold-worked tin bronzes. It is only when carbon dissolves into the iron (carburization) and the artisan quenches the resulting steel that ferrous metals have a definite hardness advantage over bronze." No mention of when carburization was discovered, though, do you know? Partial carburization was certainly possible during early-mid Roman times, but I don't know at what point iron surpassed bronze in price or strength. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 02:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, when you take into account that the period where 90% of the tools were iron was in the 10th century BC, I think we can safely say that bronze was surpassed by iron in terms of cost at that point, and hardness equality would follow. This is long before even the beginnings of a Roman Senate, so I seriously doubt that Roman officers (Centurions or whathaveyou) were equipped with bronze weapons when the Romans did have access to steel, and used it in their swords. It is also my opinion (and only that) that (HC) steel is a superior sword material because once properly tempered it has good edge retention but is still nice and springy.</p>
<p>As far as cold-working bronze vs iron goes, I can safely assume that would create alot of stresses in the metal (it does so for iron or steel, anyway), making it very hard, yes, but very brittle too. That is not the sort of thing you want in a tool like a scratchplough or a nail. Instead, toughness is much preferred. Alej</p>

<p>This article does not contain the usual composition of bronze, which a quick google:define turns up as 60% copper to 40% tin. I'll pop this up.</p>
<p>80.2.26.219 20:29, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That sounds like far too much tin. Anything around 10% tin would be considered a high-tin bronze. 62.239.24.22 13:16, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
That composition would be Speculum which was used for coin making in Roman times (in Gaul and Britain anyway) --Nomiro 11:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>40% is way too high. The (approx.) 23% tin of the bronze used in Indonesian gamelan and the similar tin content of bell metal are the highest tin contents in regular use, apart from speculum metal. In engineering applications, 18% tin is around the upper limit for a high-tin bronze. 40% tin is therefore not 'typical'. There is really too much variation among bronzes for any 'usual composition' or 'typical' figure to be given. And brasses and bronzes are two separate families of copper alloys.

<p>I am quite sure that the patina of bronze is formed by oxidation, so the statement "While bronze forms a patina, it does not oxidize" is incorrect. Will someone else confirm this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and will determine the color of the patina. Exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulpher compounds (such has "liver of sulpher") tend to brown. Patination is deliberately accellerated by heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, reds and various blacks, sometimes with the surface sheen enhanced by waxing for artwork displayed indoors. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 18:44, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"Common bronze alloys often have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a mould"</i></p>
<p>I don't think this is true. Has anyone a source? As far as I know, liquid to solid shrinkage of about 5% occurs with copper and most of it's alloys. This can be offset by regulating the oxygen content which will allow microscopic bubbles to form, which will offset some of the shrinkage. But I don't think you can get it to expand....</p>
