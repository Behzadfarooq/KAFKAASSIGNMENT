<p>You can file a request for Third Opinion at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">Wikipedia:Third opinion</a> and you can use this page to discuss any and all changes together with a volunteer who wishes to intervene.</p>
<p>And changes does not mean pasting in whole documents or making long essays. I suggest a paragraph by paragraph approach with comments limited to a few sentences without personal attacks and other irrelevant talk. Just stick to the facts and say what you think should be changed or added paragraph by paragraph and work for a consensus that way. At least that's my opinion of the matter.</p>

<dd>Thank you for the suggestion and I will do so as soon as I can. I have a conference in DC over the weekend but I will work on the suggestion. Thank you also for letting me know how to sign on the website I didn't realize what you guys were doing. I'll use it now as a test.

<dd>Finally we are starting to make some progress. I think that we should do small steps and see how far we can come with small suggestions per paragraph.</dd>
<dd>In case there is a difference of opinion there needs to be a mediator. I am willing to do that, but if you don't think that I am reliable then we need to find somebody else. We can use the Third Opinion or alternatively the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates</a> to find somebody who is willing to it.</dd>
<dd>As far as Wikipedia goes, it is a huge bureaucracy already with a Request for Comments system and a Mediation system which can be tried if this fails, but that's a lot more formal already and too early.</dd>

<p>This is an excerpted CC of Becos' good suggestion to me on my Talk page, and my response on his page, in which I ask for a consensus. Now this is Wiki is all about!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was just wondering if you wanted to start dicussing more about the Tech page. I feel it is wrong to suggest what has happened with McCaskill as Tech in the 21st Century. I want to make that section called McCaskill as Principal and then the next secion be about the Mack library, the computerization of Tech, and Randy Asher becoming principal under the section title of Tech in the 21st Century. Nothing will be deleted, just that the information will be rearranged to not only show what destructive behavior McCaskill had, but at the same time what the school has to offer and that it is moving on. Tell me what you think. I also want to add sections on academics and sports, considering the fact Tech was a powerhouse under Cirillo (aka Mr. Tech) in football during the 60s and 70s. <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">Becos</a> 21:36, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would be glad — <i>if it's the consensus of others here</i> — to move that principal's unique era to its own section and out of the chronological section in which it now resides. I'll post your suggestion and my response on the Tech Discussion page. Also, and I know this is because you're new to Wikipedia, please remember to sign your posts (using a dash and four tildes), so as to properly ID oneself and save others from having to look up the poster on the History page.</dd>

<dd>Tenebrae, I feel that the refernce section is becoming too lengthy, shouldn't all of those articles correspond to the facts they detail in the article under the footnote section. I think they should be footnote rather than references. Shouldn't references be for further reading, while footnotes denote original sources for things stated in the article.<a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">Becos</a> 21:57, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't we all work together on the article first, and worry about the length of the References later? I actually have never heard of trimming References on Wikipedia — often the problem is just the opposite. I afraid I don't see any reason not to have a substantial list that confirms what the article says so that there's no ambiguity, especially since controversy is concerned. And there are some articles on Wikipedia with lengthier Reference sections, so overall I'm not sure why this is problematic. It's good you bring this up for consensus, though. — <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 22:43, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I know what I was trying to aim for now. I think we should bunch the articles under footnote section and then have sites such as Brooklyn Tech, Alumni Association, Bthsnews.org, under a section called External Links. <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">Becos</a> 22:54, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I think the consensus opinion has been to start small. Eviscerating the article is not starting small. (I say "eviserating" only because it's a fun word. Perhaps "taking the article apart" would be more strictly accurate phrase.) <b>Please go to the Wikipedia Policy Page</b> at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>. I'm afraid I would have reasonable doubt that The Brooklyn Tech Alumni Assn., BTHSNews.com, etc., would get the hundred or more hits that Wikipedia generally considers indicative of a topic's encyclopedic value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, does a site have to have more than 100 hits in order to be considered an external link?<a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">Becos</a> 06:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Below copies from Tenebrae discussion page; note left on Becos page to continue discussion here.</i></dd>
<dd>The truth of the matter is that I extremely envy the neatness of the Stuyvesant and Bronx Science articles. If there was some way to make the reference and footnote section cleaner like separate between news articles and regular websites. I just feel the lengthy titles to the references makes the section look cluttered.<a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">Becos</a> 04:19, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure it looks cluttered (I did go just in, in consideration of your point, to delete a redundant link and group like links together) and I think given the controversial section in particular that all these references are needed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, it's important not to personalize these things. A rivalry with Stuyvesant and Bronx Science is great while one is a Brooklyn Tech student, but, y'know, that was then and this is now. I don't think I'm saying anything untoward by acknowledging that you're a justifiably proud alumnus. I do wonder how you're privy to discussions about what to do with the Foundry, but regardless: It's important to be as objective as possible and not worry about what Stuyvesant and Bronx Science Wiki pages are doing.</dd>

<p>Third-largest or second-largest auditorium? Until we can get a citation, perhaps in a footnote, I think it might be practical to say simply "one of the largest".

<p>Acting on <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBecos_83dd.html" title="User:Becos">User:Becos</a>' suggestion, I've moved the section on the controversial principal to its own section. I'm not sure "controversy" is the right word for the subhead, but "scandal" seems too strong. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Also, note that "Tech in the 21st century" could probably use a little more text; on the other hand, the century's still young. — <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 13:23, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I've moved information on the actual building and facilities out of "History" and into its own section, I'm wondering if it might not be best to have the first section after the Introduction be "Academics," as I believe one of the other specialized high schools does?</p>

<p>Tenebrae has commented out this paragraph believing it pointless. I believe it does have historical value and emphasizes the technical orientation of the school. Younger users may not know how rare computers were in the 1970s, when PCs didn't exist. High schools with minicomputers (which could fill a small room) were nonexistent. The only educational institutions with computers at the time were major and technical colleges and universities. As it was, the obsolete and unused machinery, which cost anywhere from several hundred thousand to over a million dollars new, did take up over 100 square feet in one of the labs for years before it was finally discarded. 24.92.241.215 23:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>In the mid-1970s, an obsolete <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minicomputer.html" title="Minicomputer">minicomputer</a> was donated to Tech. A record of the manufacturer and model is unknown, but it is believed to have been an <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_1620_7a8f.html" title="IBM 1620">IBM 1620</a>. The computer and its peripherals were never reassembled into a operational system, due in part to the complexity of such early computers.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe it is saying that at an undetermined date, an obsolete computer, brand and model unknown, was given to the school, and was never assembled or used.</dd>

<dd>Most of this article, like most of Wikipedia, is uncited, including the assertion that Dr. Colston had an apartment in the tower. No faculty or staff member in recent decades has been able to explain what the tower was ever used for, yet this among other statements is unchallenged. Any of several hundred students or several teachers who had to work around the large pieces of the system scattered in the lab space under plastic for several years could attest to its presence in the school at the time. I could have easily made it seem more interesting and impressive and less vague by authoritatively stating its make and model and omitting that it was never reassembled, leaving people to assume the school had a working IBM 1620 in the 1970s, but that would have been a series of lies. As it was presented, it functioned as a stub to allow further clarification should anyone with more detailed information decide to come forth. Deleted or commented out, it would not stimulate memories or discussion. 24.92.241.215 03:22, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a Reference section at the end of the article that lists where information has come from. If you believe a particulat thing, such as the tower-apartment, is inaccurate and not supported by the Reference sources, then you put the "citation request" template next to the item. Just type: {{fact}}.</dd>
<dd>You say that if you'd wanted to, you could have been misleading, and we should be grateful that you weren't. I'm not sure that's the best stance to take when contributing to an encyclopedia. I'm also not sure how further clarification would have helped: By your own statement, it was just a pile of junk under plastic. It was never assembled, you say. And eventually, you say, thrown out.</dd>
<dd>In any event, no amount of witnesses change one of the very central tenets of Wikipedia: <i>no original research</i>. Even if this information were of encyclopedic value, it would have to have come from a <i>cited, verifiable</i> source. If somethign was significant, someone, somewhere, would have written about it.</dd>

<dd>The computer was hardly junk. It could probably have been made functional had anyone in the school had the proper expertise, which would have made it almost certainly unique among high schools at the time. It wouldn't have been state of the art, but other schools didn't even have minicomputers of any type. I don't think you'd really want me to challenge all the uncited information. Virtually every sentence of this article (aside from the heavily reported McCaskill story) is uncited. I'd be littering such requests all through the article since none of the reference sources mention such claims as the mass suspension, the dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, the dress code problem, the drowning in the pool, even the physical features of the building. I don't doubt some or all of them are true, but citations just aren't readily available, instead relying on student, staff and alumni knowledge, so you may be reduced to emptying out everything in the article before the 1990s in the interests of verifiability. Even if such things had been written up in old student newspapers, it would be difficult for anyone to verify such citations since the school and its library are off-limits to all non-student visitors, including alumni, and the staff would be highly unlikely to have the time or inclination to do research for outsiders. But never mind. If you're so dead-set against this, I'll let it lie. 24.92.241.215 10:40, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you have any doubt, there's a <i><b>responsibility</b></i> to speak up, if you care about the subject. An encyclopedia doesn't have room for rumors, or hazy memories, etc. If there are things in here you doubt are true, then, seriously, it's not littering if you put citation requests where needed in the article. I am not kidding or being flippant — you would be doing a significant and important service to this article. Wikipedia has been in the news over false supposed facts finding their way into it.

<p>About that microcomputer -</p>
<p>Interesting discussion! I hope I'm not too late to contribute.</p>
<p>I can confirm (from personal memory): 1) That the computer <b>DID</b> go into operation, probably in the Fall of '73. 2) That Melvin Klein, then the Chairman of the Math Department, taught a course in Fortran 2 programming. (One assignment was to write a program to determine whether an arbitrary input integer as a palindrome).</p>
<p>I can certainly understand that incredulity of the current generation, but the availability of a computer at Tech in those days was, indeed, a big event and Tech might have been almost unique among public high schools to have access to such equipment. I'll leave it up to you to determine whether this is wiki-worthy.</p>

<p>The Washington Post footnote in the intro paragraph corresponds with Footnote 6, and in fact, under "Edit This Page", a 6 is typed in the appropriate place.
