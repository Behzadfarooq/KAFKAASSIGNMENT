<p>Brooke Davis is shown to be a rich, popular and promiscuous head cheerleader at Tree Hill High. She first appears in Episode 1.02, as <a href="../../../p/e/y/Peyton_Sawyer_bdfe.html" title="Peyton Sawyer">Peyton Sawyer</a>'s (<a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilarie_Burton_95c0.html" title="Hilarie Burton">Hilarie Burton</a>) best friend.

<p>She takes a liking to <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucas_Scott_823b.html" title="Lucas Scott">Lucas Scott</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Michael_Murray_5e90.html" title="Chad Michael Murray">Chad Michael Murray</a>), and starts hitting on him in her usual way. Lucas takes it in his stride, and does not feel that Brooke wants to be in a relationship with him. One night, after Peyton is drugged at a party, Brooke calls Lucas for help. And while caring for a drugged-out Peyton, Lucas sees a whole new side of Brooke; he realizes that she may seem all fun, but she can be caring too. That night, Lucas and Brooke form a bond and eventually start dating. But halfway into the new relationship, Lucas realizes that his feelings for Peyton are too strong to be ignored, and vice versa and the two start a secret affair. However, Brooke soon finds out, much to her anger and heartbreak. Furious and betrayed, Brooke ends her relationships with both of them, Peyton feeling guilty about betraying her best friend breaks up with Lucas, however this does nothing to soothe Brooke who feels that she was totally and utterly betrayed by Peyton. Towards the end of the season, with Lucas also hurting Peyton's feelings by hooking with Nicki who turned out to be <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Jagielski_0417.html" title="Jake Jagielski">Jake Jagielski</a>'s ex and Jenny's mother, Brooke decided to try and make things better with Peyton.

<p>In the beginning of the 2nd Season Brooke suffers a radical change as her family suffers a financial problem. They get to keep the house but most of the possesions inside of it, they have to sell. This affects Brooke because she was known as the rich girl, and the party girl but now she might not be able to be either. Sparks fly between Brooke and Felix Taggaro (Tree Hill's new student), and after some initial flirtation, the two initially start having a "friends with Benefits" relationship, which is a relationship purely based on sex. But Felix eventually wants to take things further, and even though she fears he could break her heart, she agrees to start dating. Later, Mouth tells Brooke that he is in love with her too, but she thinks of him as a 'little brother' and continues to date Felix. A drunk and disappointed Mouth smashes Brooke's windshield. Thinking that Felix did it, Brooke breaks up with him briefly. Lucas, meanwhile, also wants to be her boyfriend, but when he goes to tell this to her, he sees Brooke and Felix together: Felix has convinced her that his feelings are true.</p>
<p>Brooke then decides to run for Student Body President, against students who are much more studious, hard working and experienced than her. Brooke doesn't back down even in the face of dirty politics by one Erica Marsh (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Bailess_27b6.html" title="Katherine Bailess">Katherine Bailess</a>), and wins the post of Student Body President after Mouth delivers a touching recommendation speech to a packed auditorium for her. She quickly befriends Mouth once again, as well as Erica, who she feels sorry for, as Erica it turns out doesn't have any friends. Then, Brooke finds out that her parents are moving to California as her father has got a new job. Brooke is shocked when she finds out the surprise Lucas has in store for her: Karen has convinced Brooke's parents to let her stay with her, in Lucas' room, till December, since Lucas is living with Dan. Not only that, but Lucas has already arranged all her stuff in his room. Brooke also finds out that it was Felix who spray-painted the word 'DYKE' on Peyton's locker and finally sees him for what he is, She immediately breaks up with him. He is also kicked out of Tree Hill High as a result of his actions and his family send him to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_school.html" title="Military school">military school</a>.

But despite Rachel's attempts, Lucas turns her down and says that he still loves Brooke. Brooke, however, thinking that she may have lost her opportunity to be with Lucas, gets drunk and sleeps with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Keller_c18d.html" title="Chris Keller">Chris Keller</a>, worse still, Lucas walks in on them.

<p>Rachel then pretends to need Haley's tutoring so that they can steal the answers to a Calculus test for Brooke who is failing it but they get caught and pretend to have joined the Clean Teens as an alibi. There she meets Chase Adams, a virtuous and attractive Clean Teen, who had also been betrayed by his lover and best friend and they tip-toe back in the world of loving. During a class assignment, Brooke reveals to Chase that she cheated on the Calculus test and that she thinks she isn't pretty enough or talented enough for him. He tells her that she is good enough, and all she needs to do is to stop lying and be herself. They kiss and begin a new relationship together. The next week Chase and Brooke attend an event at Nathan's house. Sadly, it is on this occasion that Brooke's promiscuity comes to light once again. A tape entitled "Nathan Scores" was to show game footage but instead cuts to Brooke and Nathan having drunken sex. After the tape is turned off, Brooke quickly starts to apologize to Peyton, but is quickly cut off of as Peyton punches her in the face causing her to have a black eye on prom. Because of the tape, alot of people are mad at Brooke. First is of course Haley. She wished Brooke had told her about the tape earlier. Next is Peyton. She is mad that Brooke completley cut her out of her life for being honest about her feelings when she felt brooke was never honest with her. She tells Brooke how much it hurt her when Brooke made fun of her moms death. Peyton told Brooke that she was dead to her. In the end, Peyton takes a black light marker and writes whore on Brookes dress. Brooke interprets that as Peyton still caring about her.</p>
