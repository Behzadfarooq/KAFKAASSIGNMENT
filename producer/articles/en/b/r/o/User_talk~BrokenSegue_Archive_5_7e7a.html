<dd>I am not the last one to edit the article. In any case I have made a suggestion on talk page , gave it few days and only after that started to make changes.

<p>Hi, thanks for working on the response to the <i>Nature</i> reviews. Two comments:</p>
<p>First, it is inconsiderate to mark all of your edits as "minor". Please reserve this tag for things like spelling corrections.</p>
<p>Second, please don't blindly apply whatever change the referee suggests, or delete the offending material—check it against some reputable source. Referees make mistakes, for one thing. More importantly, however, you may be curing the symptoms but not the disease...there could be deeper problems in the section that you are only cosmetically fixing. Sorry if this is not what you are doing, but that's the impression I get from the sequence of very minimalistic changes you are making.</p>

<dd>Yes I did, thanks for noticing that, BrokenSegue. I initially read the comment from Nature's reviewer to mean that the reference to Robert Broom was irrelevant, and should be removed, here they meant we should expand on it.

The gaffé was inadvertant; the "edit page" function only gave me a blank page to work on; I thought it strange, but being new, I did not realize the implications. Do you know what I should do in future if that happens? Very, very, much obliged. Is there some easy way to create a "second" page (the function also seemed to think the current page was too long)? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormxxx_241f.html" title="User:Normxxx">normxxx</a></p>

<dd>Thanks again! I noted the first revert, but I thought that might be by a special VP editor and perhaps was because I <i>also had forgotten to add my signature!</i> (I <i>really</i> am new!) <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormxxx_241f.html" title="User:Normxxx">normxxx</a></dd>

<p>These are not entirely complete, but I would appreciate any feedback and/or comments you might have. I confess to just plunging in without much reading of style guides, etc. In some ways, there is way too much information. Is there a "simple" document on creating articles? In any case, your help would be appreciated.</p>

<dd>I am away until after the New Year, so I will not be able to work on your suggestions. I wanted to make a quick comment. My belief is that photos produced before 1979 (I think that's the date) must have a copyright statement to be copyrighted. After 1979 that is not required. When I get back I'll research this, but have you heard of this? The photo I used is from a 1960 album cover.</dd>

<dd>I have a document put out by the Cornell Copyright Information Center. It states that works published between 1923 through 1977 without a copyright notice are in the public domain.

<p>I'm just pointing out that Fir0002 has promised to upload the second image over the first if it gets promoted (which it looks like it will), so it <i>will</i> be in an article.

<p>"Yet there I was, spending my holiday time trying to fix it. And every time I tried, one of Wikipedia's editors promptly changed the item back.</p>
<p>This editor's screen name was "Broken Segue." Wikipedia thrives on the work of such anonymous editors. They spend huge amounts of their personal time correcting "vandalism" that is done to various entries in the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>This time, the problem was that my material was too original.</p>
<p>Though Wikipedia's own logs would show my computer tried to help John, "Broken" had no proof that I am me.</p>
<p>All would be well, "Broken" said, if I simply wrote my story and posted it on the web. Somehow, that would make it all true, and quotable in Wikipedia."</p>

<p>You have been very helpful to me regarding wiki issues. I have noticed that there tends to be redundancy because, often, two or more articles are related. This leads to "duplication" of information. In particular, please see <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">Tennis</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis_scoring.html" title="Tennis scoring">Tennis scoring</a>. One article deals only with scoring, while the first article has a section on scoring. Scoring is scoring, so both the scoring article and the scoring section should be identical. They are not, however, since different people have contributed to the writing. I got involved because of a discussion of the poorly written information on tie-breaks. Finally, my question is: How should articles that contain, basically, the same information remain consistent? Is this where templates might be used where the information is written once and "inserted" into each article?</p>

Normally in an introduction, the foreword is listed in lowercase roman numerals, such as ix, which would actually be page 9. This makes sense also because stylistically when citing a page, one cites the numerical number (in this case 6) not the written number (six). If the user really meant six there, he'd have put "6" instead, so I believe it really did mean to be "ix".

With all the controversy about Senators' offices editing wikipedia entries about their Senators, I'm wondering if this was put up by some publicist or publisher who doesn't know (or care) about wikifying or wiki style.

<p>Hi BrokenSegue. I wanted to bring my comments about the userbox redirects to your attention and get your feedback. I may be missing a point of policy here. I also wanted to let you know that I'm not interested in creating a big broo-ha-ha over this; I'd just like to get it right. My current opinion is that the userbox redirects aren't harming anything, and they are convenient for users.

<p>How funny, you explained your reasons only after I began to the "ruckus about nothing". You find the comparasion with Inquisition insulting? First, look at my userpage (see the "political incorect userbox"?), then give me a good comparision (instead the inquistion) with the curent unofficial and sneaky "userboxes deletion policy", that gained in strength conviently after the redirects were deleted, then undeleted (because of userprotest) and now proposed to be deleted definitably. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 22:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyway, I presented my case to Jimbo Wales, and I really hope that "somewhere", "someone" finnaly decides about the userboxes for good. "Delete them all" or "delete all the political ones" or "let them all be free". I can live with all the three options, what I don´t agree with that the "controversial ones" are being deleted, and the "<a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correct</a> ones" are being allowed. The blatant fact are they are also political statements and only deleting some of them is censorship. I will return tomorrow and therefore I am unable to answer to any reply.

I have to apolagize to you. I confused you with <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> (read his page, please) who simply deleted the redirects userbox/userboxes without any warning, bybassing all the usual channels and putting a delete/protection unilaterally. As some users began to protest it returned to normal. As I saw your legitemate proposal I thought: "Oh no, he is trying it again." and I simply saw red. You were caught in the cross-fire of this damned Userboxes controversy.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I am NOT a radical defender of the political/religious userboxes. This is a encyclopidea (or a good atempt of one) and I honestly wish there was a official policy which openly said: "No political and religious userboxes of any kind". Somebody simply deleted my completly apolitical ASoIaF userboxes (which are about books, and nothing else) without any warning (I am the creator for Chris´sake) or explenation. What I totally disagree is that some Administrators/Users are turning a PROPOSED policy into a "burning campaign" without even waiting for any kind of official policy. I don´t believe that self-rightous Administrators /Users should become rogue Vigilante/Cops. This movement gained a lot of elan at the same time <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> deleted thes redirects. They should wait for the end of the debate. This "burning movement" is creating the same divison it claims to want to prevent.</p>
<p>Having said this, I still don´t agree with the deletion of the redirects. There are lawfull exceptions in the rule yourself think applies in these cases, namely number 3 and number 5.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry and I hope you can excuse me. I would be much obliged for a reply (please don´t ignore this honest attempt). <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 18:58, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I am in a bit of dispute with another administrator. I was having a discussion on the talk page of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_be07.html" title="Talk:Intelligent design">Talk:Intelligent design</a>. I also filed an RFC for the topic too. In the midst of the discussion, an administrator moved the entire thing to a subpage, then, on the main page, made ad hominem attacks against the argument. He should not be allowed to do what he has done. As a final "F-you" on the subpage with the RFC, there was a section for "Outside views" for "Non-regulars." He then signed it. He has 7x as many edits to that article than the person who edits it second most.

<p>Hi there. I wanted to let you know I've done some serious hacking on both of these pages, as I see there is an anon user or two setting up both pages to basically be advertisements for <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Alert_989e.html" title="Life Alert">Life Alert</a>.</p>
<p>Having seen the U.S. commercials with my own eyes, I know that the company that advertised the product in 1990 was called LifeCall, and I haven't been able to find any evidence that the LifeCall of 1990 is the Life Alert of 2006. If there is demonstratable proof of that, some of the assertions made there might make more sense - but I've been looking to no avail for such a connection. Unless one can be found...well, the two companies have different names, and the first one let its trademark expire, correct?</p>
<p>I hope you'll find the edits to these two pages to your liking; I'll keep an eye on them for a while. Please feel free to comment on the talk page there or my user page, and/or restore edits you may feel were inappropriate. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 22:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please, the paragraph that keeps being removed FROM THE INTRODUCTION in capital punishment should stay removed. (We are still debating the insertion of the topic in the body of the article.) Almost everyone on the talk page agrees, except one very vocal dissenter. It makes it very difficult when people keep reverting it back. I know it's generally true that removing a paragraph is vandalism, and I'm sure you had the best intentions by reverting (thinking it was possible vandalism), but it's a matter of one person who keeps re-inserting the same paragraph and us having to go and keep deleting it, so it's really an interesting scenario.

<p>I noticed that you are part of the Wikipedian FIRSTers category. There's another category for FIRST members, and I think it would be easier to put these categories together.

<p>Hello. I think renaming makes a lot of sense, and I'd like to revisit the possibility -- as long as it hasn't been ruled out. Is there a reason why your <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_picture_candidates_Archive4_67a5.html#Page_rename" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured picture candidates/Archive4">renaming proposal</a> never actually happened? Was the idea rejected somewhere, or did discussion on the matter just die out? Thanks. -- <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> • <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">talk</a> 23:21, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the quick response. I think focusing the criteria on "encyclopedic value" and "Wikipedia's best work" would allow fairly painless expansion into other media types. Most of the criteria revolve around either those two points or technical details (resolution, license, etc.). I see what you mean about the amount of renaming/moving work involved -- there would be a significant amount of it. But, considering the debate over diagrams/maps is recurrent, and considering other media types (with <a href="../../../f/s/c/WP%7EFSC_de61.html" title="WP:FSC">WP:FSC</a> apparently defunct) are neglected entirely, I think it would be worthwhile. Anyway, I'd like to pursue this issue, so, as you suggest, I think I will bring it up on the VIllage Pump when I have some time the beginning of next week. -- <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> • <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">talk</a> 00:53, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BrokenSegue,</p>
<p>My user name is Primetime. I had to create this account to edit here because I'm blocked, though. Recently, an administrator has been going through all of the articles I created or expanded significantly and has been deleting them because they think that they're all copyright violations. I noticed from the Meta inclusionist page that you're an inclusionist also, so I thought you might be able to help. I've been creating articles since November of 2004. They discovered that I had copied a few of the articles from some books, but now, they're assuming everything I've ever added to Wikipedia has been a copyright violation. They even deleted articles that I wrote with spelling errors and ones that I have saved as reports for school. They also deleted an article about my family, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_%28surname%29.html" title="Maxwell (surname)">Maxwell (surname)</a>.</p>
<p>If you could help me, I would be greatly in your debt.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Primetime</p>

<dd>Just a comment regarding Primetime: don't believe anything he says. Full stop.</dd>

<dd>Most of the guy's major contributions -- probably ALL of the them -- have been plagiarism, and his response to being caught has been to lie, lie, lie, and lie some more.

This attempt at admin shopping is only the latest ploy.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This guy has wasted everyone's time (ask <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">User:Michael Snow</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a>, and the admins at Wikitionary), and he has not only exhausted every last shred of good faith, he's taken out a second mortgage on future uses. We've given him the opportunity to come clean, and his responses have been obfuscation, legalisms, and some outright lies: my personal tolerance for this nonsense is limited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And chat with Jimbo, while you're at it: Primetime's comments indicate he's communicated with Jimbo, and I suspect he's gotten a similiar (albeit more politely phrased) message from him. It's not worth the effort, in my opinion, to salvage even what might possibly could be his actual work: he's made direct lies before regarding his plagiarism, and I don't see the value of believing a word he says -- including "and" and "the" -- now. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So I've gathered. I take everything with a grain of salt. I can't refuse someone's appeal, however, and I'll look over the articles he mentioned. I doubt I'll find anything. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><i>B</i>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><i>S</i>egue</a> 04:40, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. I don't want sound like I'm over-reacting, but his track record of various ploys had me worried that his admin-shopping and line of patter might find an admin who didn't look carefully enough at the background, so I figured I should put as much info as I could up front. Yeah, it's overkill, and yeah, the banning by Jimbo is a huge and obvious red flag for any admin taking him seriously, but still, an ounce of prevention and all that... --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:52, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.
