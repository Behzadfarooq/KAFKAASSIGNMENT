<p><i><b>bro'Town</b></i> is <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>'s first <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult.html" title="Adult">adult</a>-targeted <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a>. It is set amongst New Zealand's growing <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Island_1cd5.html" title="Pacific Island">Pacific Islander</a> community. <i>bro'Town</i> is regarded by its viewers as New Zealand's answer to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> (though its visual crassness is reminiscent of other animated series, and the central cast of five young boys invites comparison with <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>) and is based on the performance of the local four-man group <i>The Naked Samoans</i>.</p>
<p>Vale, Valea, Jeff da Māori, Sione and Mack live in the suburb of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morningside%2C_New_Zealand_2890.html" title="Morningside, New Zealand">Morningside</a> (catchphrase: "<i>Morningside 4 Life!</i>"), and attend the local college, St Sylvester’s, where their principal is a <a href="../../../f/a/27/Fa%27afafine.html" title="Fa'afafine">Fa’afafine</a> and the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">P.E.</a> teacher is the legendary ex-<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Black_3f87.html" title="All Black">All Black</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jones_%28rugby_player%29_a65e.html" title="Michael Jones (rugby player)">Michael Jones</a>.</p>
<p>Produced by New Zealand company Firehorse Films and funded by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_On_Air_2418.html" title="New Zealand On Air">New Zealand On Air</a>, <i>bro'Town</i> was made using three animation studios – two in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and one in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> – and involved over 100 staff.</p>
<p>Each episode took up to six months to make and consists of 16,000 drawings, making it a huge undertaking for all involved. Despite the carefully planned nature of animation, the Samoans' performance style often gives the dialogue an improvisational, spontaneous feel. When successful this effect is fresh and funny but at times it renders the dialogue indistinct, with characters stepping on each other's lines.</p>
<p>The show satirises the boys’ culture, with vivid dialogue in the local <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_English_3b82.html" title="New Zealand English">vernacular</a>, expressing what is like to grow up as a minority culture in <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland.html" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>, the largest Polynesian city in the world. Although the setting is contemporary and the satire topical, the humour often reflects a nostalgia for the 1980s period of the Naked Samoans' own boyhood. The series is also scattered with references to New Zealand literature, particularly the novels and short stories of <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witi_Ihimaera_0aaa.html" title="Witi Ihimaera">Witi Ihimaera</a>.</p>
<p>The series have strong <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a> references, with most episodes starting with events between <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> and other historical figures, which leads to the theme of the episode and the subsequent events between the boys.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_Pepelo_e81c.html" title="Vale Pepelo">Vale Pepelo</a></b> (<a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Kightley_0a43.html" title="Oscar Kightley">Oscar Kightley</a>) (Vale loosely translates to Dumb) - brother of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valea_Pepelo_1625.html" title="Valea Pepelo">Valea Pepelo</a> and has a strong social conscience. Contrary to his given name, Vale is considered the intelligent one of the group, frequently seen carrying a literary classic.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../v/a/l/Valea_Pepelo_1625.html" title="Valea Pepelo">Valea Pepelo</a></b> (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimpal_Lelisi_6984.html" title="Shimpal Lelisi">Shimpal Lelisi</a>) (Valea loosely translates to Dumber) - brother of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_Pepelo_e81c.html" title="Vale Pepelo">Vale Pepelo</a>, is more interested in girls than his brother Vale. Whenever he sees an attractive one, he does a rendition of the 'schwing!' gesture (peow peow!) Valea's name is an apt description.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../s/i/o/Sione_Tapili_f81e.html" title="Sione Tapili">Sione Tapili</a></b> (Mario Gaoa) - Vale and Valea’s best mate and fancies himself as a bit of a ladies' man, while he constantly looks for ways to impress the girl of his dreams, sixth former <b>Mila Jizovich</b>.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_da_M%C4%81ori_73c5.html" title="Jeff da Māori">Jeff da Māori</a></b> (David Fane) - Jeff Da Māori lives with his mum and eight dads in a car shell outside the house. He was brought up in the country by his Aunt Queenie (a caricature of Māori leader <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Whina_Cooper_29eb.html" title="Dame Whina Cooper">Dame Whina Cooper</a>) but then moved to the city ‘for better TV reception and "because the thieving colonialists stole our land’". You can never see Jeff without his trusty guitar. He is often portrayed with a horribly runny nose. More than the other boys, Jeff's character is assembled from clichés drawn mostly from Witi Ihimaera stories and <a href="../../../o/n/c/Once_Were_Warriors_1b38.html" title="Once Were Warriors">Once Were Warriors</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McCorkenstein-Taifule_b573.html" title="Rodney McCorkenstein-Taifule">Rodney McCorkenstein-Taifule</a></b> aka <b>Mack</b> (David Fane) - Mack rounds out the group, a heavyset boy who has definite gay tendencies and a knack for talking his way out of things, but he does stand behind his word eventually. Mack is considered a tough guy by the group, raised in the streets. He actually lives in a high class mansion with a loving mum and dad.</p>
<p><a name="Other_residents_of_Morningside" id="Other_residents_of_Morningside"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bro%27Town_bc87.html" title="Edit section: Other residents of Morningside">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other residents of Morningside</span></h2>
<p><b>Pepelo Pepelo</b> (David Fane) - Vale &amp; Valea's dad is a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit.html" title="Benefit">benefit</a> bludging, occasional fork-lift driver with a love of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> (aka "The Town Drunk"). Pepelo's wife died when the boys were young and they were entrusted to his care. However, his method of child rearing was ignoring them to fend for themselves. He's known to discriminate against other ethnic minorities in Morningside. Pepelo is very similar to the father character in <i>Milburn Place</i>, another comedy production involving Naked Samoans.</p>
<p><b>Wong</b> (David Fane) - A Chinese student from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. He quickly became buds with the Boys after an initiation rite which involved insulting Rakeesh. He once helped the Boys by joining in the St. Sylvester's Rugby team in <i>Get Rucked</i> and bet a million dollars on Honky the Wonderhorse. Wong has a twin brother named White, who exists only to facilitate a pun about being unable to tell White from Wong.</p>
<p><b>Fong</b> (Mario Gaoa) - Fong appears to be a big menacing Chinese guy who lives in an apartment. In reality, he's a smart <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a> student who seems to be incompetent in a fight.</p>
<p><b>Constable "Bobby" Bababiba</b> (Mario Gaoa) - A cold and seemingly-emotionless <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">policeman</a> who has been involved with many of the Boys' mishaps as much as he restores Morningside Order. His name may be a reference to the 'bee-baa' sounds made by children impersonating the old style of New Zealand police sirens, one of the many 'childhood <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostalgia.html" title="Nostalgia">nostalgia</a>' touches of bro'Town.</p>
<p><b>Rakeesh Maadkraklikka</b> (Mario Gaoa) - A disgruntled South Asian (Indian) dairy store owner. He is eager to shoot and zap any potential troublemaker in his store. Pepelo owes a massive debt to Rakeesh's store due to his indulgence and improper spending. Is married to the beautiful Satisha.</p>
<p><b>Satisha Maadkraklikka</b> - Rakeesh's spouse. She isn't as brash as her husband, but Satisha is just as tough. Twice, so far, Satisha helped The Boys with their problems and issues.</p>
<p><b>Reverend Minister Mccat</b> (Real name unknown) (Vela Manusaute) - Stereotypical minister who heads a Samoan flock in Morningside. He frequently preaches about the local issues in very vivid and exaggerated ways (as was featured in <i>Sione-rella</i> and <i>Touched by a Teacher</i>). He is also quick to drive his flock on mindless angry mob sprees. As a sideline for his church he also sells 'authentic' holy items at high prices (like holy water and sheep-shaped caps). There seems to be an intimate relationship between him and Agnes (or it may be that they're husband and wife, who knows?). Agnes' youngest child has an uncanny resemblance to the minister, including his hairdo - for that matter, so do most of the very young children of his congregation. He is very similar to the Minister character in the recurring sketch <i>Milburn Place</i>, part of the <i>Skitz</i> comedy series in which several Naked Samoans were involved.</p>
<p><a name="Tapili_family" id="Tapili_family"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bro%27Town_bc87.html" title="Edit section: Tapili family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Tapili family</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Agnes Tapili</b> (David Fane) - Sione's mother and the Pepelos' neighbour. Deeply religious and physically aggressive, especially to Sione (she refuses to show this side of her in public, though). Despite this, she seems to have intimate relations with the local minister. A caricature of the overbearing Polynesian mother who won't hesitate to humiliate her children.</p>
<p><b>Sina Tapili</b> - (Teuila Blakely) - Sione's big sister and Mila's friend. Sina does not think kindly of her brother and The Boys. Attends St Cardinal's College for girls, known to the boys of neighbouring St. Sylvester's as 'Car(di)nal Knowledge.'</p>
<p><b>Motorcycle Boy</b> (Real name - Timothy Tapili) - Agnes' eldest son. A delinquent who is a regular in the local delinquent centre (which Agnes euphemistically calls a "boarding school") and jail. His real name was revealed in the episode "Go and ask Agnes".</p>
<p><b>Samson</b> - Agnes' youngest son. He is also the secret son of the minister</p>
<p><a name="School_folk_and_students" id="School_folk_and_students"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bro%27Town_bc87.html" title="Edit section: School folk and students">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>School folk and students</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Brother Ken</b> - St. Sylvester's <a href="../../../f/a/%E2%80%99/Fa%E2%80%99afafine.html" title="Fa’afafine">Fa’afafine</a> principal. Is a personal friend of many famous New Zealanders, including <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Lawless_32e1.html" title="Lucy Lawless">Lucy Lawless</a> and Prime Minister <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Clark_9b2a.html" title="Helen Clark">Helen Clark</a>. Brother Ken is a caring principal and once helped a then-young Mack (a nickname created by Brother Ken) to become friends with The Boys.</p>
<p><b>Rex Ruka</b> - Rex is a typical sort of '<a href="../../../j/o/c/Jock.html" title="Jock">jock</a>' or alpha male in St. Sylvester's. He is regularly seen mocking the boys due to their supposed inferiority with Joost by his side. Rex is Sione's rival for Mila's hand.</p>
<p><b>Joost Van der Van Van</b> - A <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a> immigrant whose father Hansje manages the local zoo. As is expected, he acts as Rex's partner/toady, providing appreciation for his many putdowns (often saying "Hilarious!"). However, it was revealed in "A Chicken Roll At My Table" that Joost's racism was an act and he only did it because he was discouraged by his grandfather from making friends with coloured people. His name is a nonsense parody of Dutch surnames and means 'of the of.' Although unknown, it has been suggested that his name may have been derived from <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springbok.html" title="Springbok">Springbok</a> player <a href="../../../j/o/o/Joost_van_der_Westhuizen_3efd.html" title="Joost van der Westhuizen">Joost van der Westhuizen</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mila Jizovich</b> - A student of St. Cardinal's, best friends with Sina Tapili and the girl of Sione's dreams. She is best known for helping Lucy Lawless with the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">birth control</a> presentation in "Sionerella". Her name appears to be a combination of tribute to the actress <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milla_Jovovich_1830.html" title="Milla Jovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> and a somewhat unsavoury joke.</p>
<p><b>Abo (Abocrombie Smith the Third)</b> - An <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_Australian_9d7c.html" title="Aboriginal Australian">Aboriginal Australian</a> who studies in St. Sylvester's. His nickname is either derived from his ethnicity or his real name, Abercrombie. Abo is known to celebrate every occasion with a (often very long) traditional song or dance he rides an emu. Though Abo has made political comments regarding Indigenous <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_title.html" title="Native title">native title</a>, the satirical point of this character is unclear as very few Aboriginal Australians live in New Zealand; he is more surreal than satirical.</p>
<p><b>Ms. Lynn Grey</b> - A teacher who manages The Boys' class at St. Sylvester's. She seems to have an affection for the Māori Man (as is shown in "A Māori at my Table"). A parody of well-meaning liberal Anglo-Saxon ( white ) - she will carefully use Māori vocabulary but immediately follow it with a slightly patronising English explanation. Her name is a reference to the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn.</p>
<p><a name="Figures_in_Heaven" id="Figures_in_Heaven"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bro%27Town_bc87.html" title="Edit section: Figures in Heaven">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Figures in Heaven</b></span></h3>
<p><b>God</b> (Mario Gaoa) - As himself. As the creator of the universe, God can choose to be anything he wants. Thus he is portrayed as a well-built Pacific Islander in a <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lavalava.html" title="Lavalava">lavalava</a>. He appears mellow and easy-going, rather than strict and wrathful. God starts each episode in Heaven as if it were a fairytale, usually telling it to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> and historical figures like <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hone_Heke_0cc6.html" title="Hone Heke">Hone Heke</a>, or the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>.</p>
<p><b>Jesus</b> (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimpal_Lelisi_6984.html" title="Shimpal Lelisi">Shimpal Lelisi</a>) - The Lord's only son. Unlike the past serious and solemn renditions of the Christian divinity, Bro'Town portrays him as young and naive (despite his past mortal life more than 2000 years ago). He generally seems like a somewhat wimpish teenager, who often needs to be gently taught a lesson by his Father.</p>
<p>Other famous residents of Heaven include <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghengis_Khan_005c.html" title="Ghengis Khan">Ghengis Khan</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Rutherford_48e8.html" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Nepia_a118.html" title="George Nepia">George Nepia</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Michel_Basquiat_17ad.html" title="Jean-Michel Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Marley_60be.html" title="Bob Marley">Bob Marley</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Diana_4f2c.html" title="Princess Diana">Princess Diana</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally long-lost relatives such as Pepelo's wife (Vale &amp; Valea's mother), or Aunt Queenie are featured, appearing in dreams to communicate with the living.</p>
<p>There are also two female angels <b>Angelina</b> and <b>Angelita</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The Weakest Link</b> - The boys of <i>bro'Town</i> are infamous for giving St. Sylvester's a bad name every year on an "It's Academic"-style quiz show, but after being hit by a bus and getting a concussion on the head gives Valea the knowledge of the universe, the boys ace this year's competition. Thinly disguised appearances by <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland_Grammar_School_8068.html" title="Auckland Grammar School">Auckland Grammar School</a> as "F.A.G.S", Diocesan School and Saint Cuthberts College combined as "Saint Cutherscans", Howick College as "Howick Beijing College" and The Northern Club.</li>

<li><b>The Wong One</b> - Wong, a Chinese student, moves to Morningside and quickly makes friends with the Boys.

<li><b>A Māori At My Table</b> - The five boys go on a school visit to Jeff's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marae.html" title="Marae">marae</a>, where the mantle of RaNgātira is unexpectedly thrust upon him when his Auntie dies of diabetes. Cousin <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Curtis_361d.html" title="Cliff Curtis">Cliff Curtis</a> appears and persuades the Whānauto sell the land to Japanese investors and Jeff has to make a decision. References to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whale_Rider_553c.html" title="The Whale Rider">The Whale Rider</a></i> are common.</li>
<li><b>Go Home, Stay Home</b> - When Pepelo takes a long time to come home from a night out, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Department_of_Child%2C_Youth_and_Family_Services_cb65.html" title="New Zealand Department of Child, Youth and Family Services">CYFS</a> takes Vale and Valea away to loving homes.
