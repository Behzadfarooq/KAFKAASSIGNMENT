<p>you moved my article ' Cristian Vogel ' - I have resubmitted an edited version of my biography - there are at least 10 articles referring to my name on the WikiPedia, I have been an active composer on the electronic music scene for over 11 years, so I consider that I should be included in the Wikipedia ( many of the people I have produced, as well as band members from my own bands have articles&#160;! ) - I hope the edited version fits the bill better, I have removed links and references to current projects etc.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p><br />
I see my resubmitted article has disappeared again , so here it is - please submit it , if you think its acceptable</p>
<p>Cristian Vogel is a composer and music producer, known&#160;for his experimental DJ and Live performances, studio composition and production. Born in Chile 1972 but growing up in the UK, he now lives and works in Barcelona.&#160;</p>
<p>He studied 20th Century Music at Sussex University, under the tutor-ship of the British composers, Johnathan Harvey and Martin Butler. Over more than a decade he has recorded a number of albums and released on eminent experimental techno labels such as Tresor Berlin, Novamute and Mille Plateaux. He has toured consistently since 1992 as DJ and live performer, both as a solo artist and with the group 'Super_Collider'. As composer for dance, he has scored four pieces for Gilles Jobin, the renound Swiss choreographer. As remixer and producer, he has been invited to reinterpret songs by groups such as Radiohead, Maximo Park and Oval and has has been album producer for Chicks On Speed amongst others.</p>

<p>It wasn't a silly page. Please do not refer to real events as silly, as that is silly within itself. Would you say the article on TPing is silly? Would you delete the article on TPing? would you delete the article on egging? No, and they exist. Magging is similar to those events. Simply because it has not spread to where you reside, does not mean it doesnt happen. Should you delete the article on farsi because you don't speak farsi? of course not.

<p>Hi Brookie, I am a new user on Wikipedia. I figured out how to make a page because I had some info. about The Lord of the Rings thet I wanted to share withe the world. SnaX said I wasn't making the page right but I didn't get what he meant. So far, I haven't been able to get ahold of him. Could you explain the whole process to me on my talk page? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Go USNA (<a href="../../../g/o/_/User_talk%7EGo_USNA_d998.html" title="User talk:Go USNA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Go_USNA_f147.html" title="Special:Contributions/Go USNA">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I was upon wikipedia and I happened to come across a page where many users were talking about me in a negative way. I am unaware if Wikipedia has any bitching policies but I may have to 'IAR' myself and contact an administrator to sort this little mishap out. You seem to point out that I have threatened Wikipedia. I don't believe I have, I have merely predicted the outcome of Wikipedia if I were not to become an admin. Anyway I must ask the question we are all dying to know, what is Wikipedia? Is it the definition, the meaning of our existence, the very thing, which controls our lives? Is this what I am threatening? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaindansplashback_dbcc.html" title="User:Captaindansplashback">Captaindansplashback</a> 10:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can either nominate it straight as a candidate for featured picture or nominate it initially for peer review - which will give you feedback and an indication if it is likely to make the grade. I would try peer review as a first step. You will need to sort out the license issue first - or it'll be a non-starter.

<p>Hi, I am a new user to Wikipedia, but I have been observing certain pages prior to the registration of my username. On one of your edits to Alpha Kappa Alpha, you deleted the contact information to the sorority. However, you unintentionally removed the AKA pin. I decided to re-insert the pin because I personally felt that the pin is a historical artifact. I hope that this didn't violate any policy on Wikipedia, and I hope you have a great day. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal96_8494.html" title="User:Real96">Real96</a> 23:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I put an image up on the Richard Dannatt article and put it on as crown copyright but some American bloke is telling me it fails the fair use test as it is a living person.

There was nothing undocumented in it, as I have spoken through email with Greg Dorsett, owner of Rock Stars' Guitars, who knew John Birch personally, I have spoken with John Carling, owner of John Birch guitars as well as personal friend to John Birch himself, as well as many others who have allowed me to use their images. I don't know what else I could have referenced in the article. It was deleted with no warning to me, unlike the image deletions. I was planning to re-upload all the images with appropriate copyright tags. I have the rights to use every one of them, as I have received authority to do so from John Carling and the owner of the Glitter guitar. I was not backing up the content of the article onto my hard drive because I believed that I would be notified of any copyright infringement and/or nonsense and would be given time to back the article up. I have already requested an undelete, but if you can shed any light on why this article was deleted, I would appreciate it. I put a lot time and hard work into the research of this article, so I don't want to see it go away. Please email me at paulk@stadden.com.</p>

<dd>It read like a bad advert and had been tagged as such by another user. The article needed a lot of work before it would pass muster as an article. If it can be re-written and the mess of the photograps sorted out then fine - but it needs a lot of work. If you want I can post you the data on a sub page for you to work on to improve it.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a></dd>

<p>Dear Brookie - hello and Happy New Year. I'm still taking my City of London Guides course and enjoying it greatly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as you are MUCH quicker than me, can I please ask you a favour? I have been editing <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens_dd60.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> - there's still lots of work to do. But some changes need to be made.</p>
<p>1. Please can you change the article title to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Garden_3377.html" title="Buckingham Palace Garden">Buckingham Palace Garden</a> . The singular form is correct.</p>
<p>2. Could you then do a redirect from <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens_dd60.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Garden_3377.html" title="Buckingham Palace Garden">Buckingham Palace Garden</a>.</p>
<p>3. Could you add to the disambiguation page for "Garden" the new article title <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Garden_3377.html" title="Buckingham Palace Garden">Buckingham Palace Garden</a>, pointing out that it is known as "the Garden". Would you also please add the Royal Opera House (I'm not sure if there is a Wikipedia article on this, but as you know, it is also universally known as "the Garden").</p>
<p>I have cross-referred to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens_dd60.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> in a number of other articles but once you let me know these changes have been made I will chase up the cross-referrals. Basically, the cross-referrals are in: <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyrood_House_603a.html" title="Holyrood House">Holyrood House</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Team_bfdc.html" title="Time Team">Time Team</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_at_the_Palace_66ca.html" title="Party at the Palace">Party at the Palace</a> , <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prom_at_the_Palace_274e.html" title="Prom at the Palace">Prom at the Palace</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Party_at_the_Palace_b3c0.html" title="Children's Party at the Palace">Children's Party at the Palace</a> , and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Jubilee_e1a2.html" title="Golden Jubilee">Golden Jubilee</a>. ALL should be corrected to reflect the correct SINGULAR form, but I can see to this.</p>
<p>Many thanks as usual. Please let me know on MY talk page when you have accomplished steps 1, 2, 3 above. Best wishes. <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 01:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that I botched my attempt at archiving,(<a href="../../../l/u/d/Luddite.html" title="Luddite">luddite</a>), but there will be others. Thanks for the wonderful bit of sculpture. Yes, it is mostly what I write about. I found your monument in a footnote in Margaret Whinney's, <i>Sculpture in Britian: 1530-1830</i> and assume that since you did not have the sculptor wikilinked, that there is no article on him. I'll see if I have enough for at least a stub. I finaally got a fire going, so am feeling better, thank-you. Oh yes, it's not sculpture but I got my picture in here recently - check out <a href="../../../k/l/d/KLDK_3160.html" title="KLDK">KLDK</a> - I'm the drummer with the Pathetics.

<p>Dear Brookie - please visit <a href="../../../f/l/y/Talk%7EFlypast_37ea.html" title="Talk:Flypast">Talk:Flypast</a>. A user has placed the page on Military history project as needing revision because of "too much UK focus," with the withering second sentence "It might interest people to know that the UK isn't the only place where flypasts happen." My reply, which I posted on <a href="../../../f/l/y/Talk%7EFlypast_37ea.html" title="Talk:Flypast">Talk:Flypast</a> and on their talk page, is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>I worked very hard in getting an international perspective and any defending you can do will be appreciated.</p>
<p>I understand if people feel the article can be improved and anyone can have a go, but I feel that the second sentence was not only uncalled-for, but also not reflective of the spirit or writing of the article.</p>
<p>Thanks for looking. -- <a href="../../../f/c/l/User%7EFClef_44fa.html" title="User:FClef">FClef</a> <a href="../../../f/c/l/User_talk%7EFClef_aa80.html" title="User talk:FClef">(talk)</a> 23:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appreciate encouragement. I misunderstood about this project and wish to exonerate RJASE1, to whom I will write separately. Sorry I had the wrong end of the stick, having not noticed the comment sig. Can you authorise me - or indeed can YOU - erase the the comment and discussion up to today's date from the article talk page under the circumstances? I will of course leave the Military History project banner. Please advise at my Talk. Cheers to you - you help make Wikipedia a nicer place for folk like me.</dd>

<p>It did not occur to me that the name in the image credit might be your own. Looking at your other uploads I see that that is obviously the case, and that you are related to a notable person, which is clearly something to be proud of. Perhaps you could add "(User:Brookie)" or "(myself)" next to your name so that others don't make the same mistake. Given that the subject of the photo is deceased, I can see how I may have upset you.

<p>Dear Brookie</p>
<p>It appears that <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> really likes this article and has proposed it as a good article. He also raised it to Class B on the assessment scale of the Military History Project and <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooper5920_0b5b.html" title="User:Looper5920">Looper5920</a> has undone this and replaced the article at the Start Class. Looper also feels the article has too much UK focus and advances that as a material argument against it. Please read my arguments to Looper at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Looper5920#Flypast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Looper5920#Flypast" rel="nofollow">Looper's talk page</a> and would you, as an admin, please take any action necessary to remind Looper of Wikipedia standards, or to respond to him/her in any way you see fit? (After my experience with Big Royal Dig I'm not feeling hopeful at all about this - I can see another merciless edit on the horizon.)</p>
<p>Would you kindly also look at the messages I sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RJASE1#Flypast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RJASE1#Flypast" rel="nofollow">RJASE1's talk page</a> regarding this article.</p>

<p>Hi Brookie&#160;! After much 'defense' on Serampore College (rather Senate of Serampore College), I had turned to Gurubrahma for help. Then, you sprung out of nowhere. Much delighted for the same. Around the same time I had also started a new article on Senate of Serampore College - but that got deleted after a week or so. Kindly help revive it. Further, long ago, I had also started articles on some of the affiliated colleges under the Senate of Serampore College. The Hermes had intruded there and also mentioned about 'unaccreditation' which again needs to be guarded against.</p>
<p>Under <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serampore_College_44f8.html" title="Serampore College">Serampore College</a>, I wish to add list of Principals and matters relevant to the College alone. Once you revive Senate of Serampore College (was earlier started as The Senate of Serampore College, I wish to add a list of the Masters and the Registrars including affiliated colleges under it.<a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGrbpradeep_c4cc.html" title="User:Grbpradeep">Pradeep</a> 17:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there - actually what you had created was The Senate of Serampore College (University) - what I suggest is that you work out the article as fully as you can on a sub page and then we'll look at re-introducing it. I'll post a note to the Admin who deleted it to warn him.

<p>Hi. I wonder if you can point me in the right direction. It appears you have deleted a contibution I made about Liam Kearns on 2 occasions. Each time I made the contrbutuion I tried to improve the article. Liam Kearns is a very well known person in Ireland as manager of the <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laois_GAA_17d0.html" title="Laois GAA">Laois GAA</a> football team. I would appeal to you to reinstate my article or tell me how to do this. Regards, Heshs Umpire</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point is establishing notability - by reference to the guidelines; I deleted it as a repost as another Admin had already deleted it - it generally frowned upon to re-instate deleted articles without good reason. I suggest that you set up a sub page on your user page, and work on the re-draft there and then have another go. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie :) - a will o' the wisp !</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrookie_e61c.html" title="User talk:Brookie"><sup>(Whisper...)</sup></a> 12:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brookie, thanks for the answer. Is there any way you could retrieve the text of the article for me? Even, stick it up on my discussion page? I don't pretend to be very tech minded but I've made a lot of contributuons in the last year (a lot of them less significant that <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Kearns_8b2f.html" title="Liam Kearns">Liam Kearns</a> so I hope you can oblige Regards,</p>

<p>I got a warning about deleting selections from a page I created today. The creation of the page was an iterative process, which is why things have been added and deleted as I go.</p>
<p>A question I have is how do I reference the information? The page periodically says that no references have been made for the information, but I don't understand where I even place the reference if the information is on a band and I'm IN the band, so it's first hand knowledge.</p>

<dd>Well for that I thank you. I was just quoting from the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> page that says if the edits in question are simple and obvious vandalism then that qualifies as an exception to the 3RR. I presume the reverting applied to that of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_failing_1d6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing</a>, which was also reverted by many other users and the culprit was later blocked (via my warnings on his talk page and then reporting it to admins). I apologise for breaking the 3RR if you do not agree with me and I hope you will appreciate I was acting in the best intentions.

<dd>'scuse me for offering an outside view here, but I'd say that was a very clear example of simple and obvious vandalism. The person being reverted was removing the entire essay and replacing it with text starting <i>This was whinge from a controlfreak who couldn't control Wikipedia.</i>. I can't honestly see how that could not be considered vandalism.

<p>There is a difference between "simple" and "other" vandalism - the exception to the 3R rule applies to "such as graffiti or page blanking (this only applies to the most simple and obvious vandalism)" - that isn't what we had here - it was "other" vandalism and so the exception doesn't apply.

<dd>Hi Tony - I have started to go over it - but a couple of intitial thoughts:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The grammar could do with some tightening up and there is a risk that the article is not portraying a NPOV - with blanket assertions of bad Portuguese behaviour etc - which might well be true - but at the moment looks unbalanced.

<p>Clearly you're far more well-informed than I on the topic. I hate to ask work from you in addition to the marvelous job you've done, but I wonder if you could add citation references to the document now that it's expanded? I know that's always the toughest thing later--when no one can remember what source established what fact--and while it's fresh it would be lovely if you could "cite up" the article a bit. Honestly, I think it's comprehensive and well-written enough for at least GA if not FA status. Bravo to you for some fine writing, and clearly for your work in the community as well, since I see you are an admin. Thanks very much for the note--it's always nice to see how a stubbish article you've generated becomes something much better in the hands of others. :-) Best regards, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 01:07, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
