<p>How could you say the chip is make in New York when it clearly states on the chip itself when you open up your nintendo wii that the chip is made in canada, not in japan, not in the usa, not in china, but in <b>CANADA</b>. I think we should stop being bias towards america being the best country made by god and give credit where its do for this chips orgin. IT SAYS IT RIGHT ON THE CHIP!!! Otherwise its like saying the first NES was fully designed, produced and implicated in the USA, except Japan just recieved delivery years before.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Curious though, that it contradicts the press release linked in the article, which says they are being fabricated in East Fishkill, New York. I'm not saying you are wrong, and I have to admit I haven't opened up my Wii to check.--203.6.205.22 03:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>here are some other links to support East Fishkill as the source: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10793" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10793" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.playfeed.com/playfeed/article/ibm-announces-shipment-of-wii-processors-09072130/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.playfeed.com/playfeed/article/ibm-announces-shipment-of-wii-processors-09072130/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I just did a google for "broadway wii processor fabrication", I didn't see Canada mentioned anywhere. --203.6.205.22 03:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The chip is fabricated in East Fishkill, New York, but IBM has a packaging plant in Bromont, Quebec, Canada where it's packaged. Ie, put in a substrate with conectors to the motherboard, closed and labled. I feel for the Canadians that want to feel important, but really.. this isn't that big a feat, packaging a microprocessor. Not if you compare it to designing and manufacturing the actual silicon. The text on the packaging is there for ID and tracing individual chips, not celebrating nationalities. -- <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenriok_bf05.html" title="User:Henriok">Henriok</a> 10:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reverted the text, because it was plain wrong the way it was written. IBM's only 300mm fab is in Fishkill. The chip appears to be packaged in Canada. I see Bromont mentioned in a couple of places, but I can't confirm that. --<a href="../../../p/l/i/User%7EPlicease_505c.html" title="User:Plicease">plicease</a> 20:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone have a solid reference to the Broadway operating at 729 MHz? I've never seen this from a trustworthy source. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.217.44.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.217.44.35_f824.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.217.44.35">contribs</a>) 13:10, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The source of the 729MHz figure would appear to have been from a posting on 4chan where it was seemingly invented as a method to make fun of Nintendo's new console for not even being as fast as the original xbox, which was 733MHz. The validity of this figure is therefore highly questionable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This number seems to be related to the frequent 'Gamecube 1.5' postings seen on many forums. As 1.5*485~729.64.6.0.220 06:02, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This number comes from IGN, who says it's the figure in the most recent official Nintendo documentation sent to developers, who they claim to have sourced the specs from. It's right there in the references.</dd>

<dd>Lets see the nintendo developer documentation on the numbers then instead of the information from an Anonymous Developer that IGN sited. Till Nintendo says something official on this its too easy to hoax or simply invent numbers. 64.6.0.220 19:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It most certainly is. However, as I said, the figure originated from IGN, not as "4chan", or other suspect forums. That was the point I was correcting. IGN is a reputable source, if they said they received the information from an actual developer, then they most likely did. 208.152.231.254 19:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However it came from IGN today, that number has been kicking around now for months, and the only sources for it have been very questionable, and it has been most often repeated by internet trolls. If IGN has a new source of information I'd like to hear it. However till Nintendo or IBM say anything I don't think we can list an actual value. Even if the number comes from a developer there is no guarantee that they have access to the final production hardware or system, and the system development kits often differ greatly from the machines that actually are released to the public especially prior to its release. 64.6.0.220 05:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh I don't know... those numbers look pretty accurate to me... look at the October 2006 EGM pg 26, which they are interviewing the dev's of Brothers in Arms. They ask him if the Wii is just a souped up GC? The answer&#160;: Yes. He also says it barely manages to out do current gen Xbox specs. 70.143.70.24 07:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, why are you asking me? I was correcting 64.6.0.220's assertion that the first references to the 729MHz figure came from unfounded, dubious, X-Box fanbois. As I said, it didn't, it came from IGN, which I've described as a reputable source, something I stand by. I'm really unsure how you can read into that that I'm saying IGN is wrong because it's old. How do you get that out of what I wrote? I'm saying the exact opposite. 64.6.0.220 is the one saying it's wrong because it's not old enough, but he thinks it was just published, rather than published in March.</dd>
<dd>He thinks it's wrong because he thinks it copied various predictions from forums. He's made no references to such forum posts to back this up, and it strikes me as likely his conclusion is based upon reading those forums before seeing the information reported in the media, not realising the media's reportage predates those forum posts.</dd>
<dd>Realistically, the probability, as I see it, is that IGN is [i]probably[/i] correct. IBM and Nintendo aren't saying anything, but specific developers known to named writers at named technology groups are saying that's what the official documentation from Nintendo says. Either those developers are hoaxing the journalists (unlikely, what would be their incentive? To ensure their games never get good reviews again?), Nintendo is hoaxing the developers (unlikely, what would be their incentive? To ensure the first games for the Wii suck because they underutilize the CPU and have mysterious compatibility problems that a G5 replacing a G3 would necessarily result in?), or the facts are more or less correct.</dd>
<dd>Further to that, there's just plain no reason to disbelieve it. The Wii is designed to be sold cheap and make a profit. The other consoles may have significantly more powerful CPUs, but they're being sold for up to 2.3x the price, and even at that price are loss making. The Wii is also designed to use very little power while staying on 24/7. It's not on standby when it's doing that either, it's connected to the network. The Wii is intended for use with an SDTV, and it uses SD resolutions. The requirement is low power consumption. There's no call for significantly higher CPU power.</dd>
<dd>Until IBM or Nintendo say something, I'm not in favour of biasing the main article one way or another. But the argument the 729MHz figure has been debunked because it appeared in forums apparently manufactured by some anti-Nintendo faction is clearly false. It has an origin. One reputable online magazine, quoting sources that have no reason to lie, appears to have staked its reputation upon this being true. The main reason to wait until Nintendo and IBM says otherwise is simply that Nintendo might have changed the design since then. 208.152.231.254 14:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Possibly, however there are also a number of rumors that indicate that it includes VMX (altivec) which would seemingly by apple's definition make it a G4, and at least one rumor I've heard says that its the IBM equivalent to a sempron processor, basically a G5 without the 64bit, we really know nothing about this chip at all. Even if it is 729Mhz that doesn't tell us much without knowing what the chip is. Two quick questions, does Nintendo have this information under a NDA? If so, we probably shouldn't trust anything at all till they do say something, or the NDA expires. If not it shoudln't be too hard for someone with the proper credentials to obtain the information simply by calling nintendo up and asking. 64.6.0.220 04:08, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It could be that they decided to lower it, or it could just be that 729mhz doesn't mean it won't be 2-3x more powerful. Maybe they added some fancy instructions, a wider bus, more on chip memory(cache), or whatever. Oh and if you are referring to the quote in EGM about the Wii being a GC 1.5, well thats just an expression or a figure of speech, im sure he didn't mean it literally. Anyways.... anybody see the Nov2006 EGM? There was an interview with the Factor5 president. They said their jaw dropped when they heard of the path the Wii was taking, and decided to go with the PS3 instead because it had enough power for what they wanted to do. He also claimed the Wii as a "GC 1.5".</dd>

<dd>729.14 is written right on the processor. Look at the picture to the right of the article. That corresponds to 729.14MHz. It's very common for processors to have writing of that kind to denote the speed. Although the speed is known, that does not mean much nowadays when processors greatly vary in capabilities, co-processors, word width, and many other aspects. For all we know, this PowerPC-based processor could be the equivalent of the Pentium III 1.5GHz. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeekrecon_6dc0.html" title="User:Geekrecon">Geekrecon</a> 18:02, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jon "Hannibal" Stokes has retracted his belief it'll be a 64-bit processor. Given this was the only referenced claim that pointed towards 64-bit in the article, I've removed that speculation. If someone wants to put it back, I think something authorative should be cited at the same time to back that claim up as, at this point, it's an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary proof. Kind of a shame, I'd have liked it to be a 64 bit system, but, well, if it does the job... <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiggleslash_255a.html" title="User:Squiggleslash">Squiggleslash</a> 21:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that was a very rash thing to do that should have been given way more thought and discussion before it was done.

<dd>A console processor will always be custom. Quite different requirements compared to desktop. In addition to this it usually is produced in larger quantities over a longer time.

<p>I'm going to revert The Captain Return's changes, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. This is the article that discusses the current known information about the Broadway CPU. Information that is inappropriate for the main Wii article is appropriate here, it is not legitimate to use an argument about what should appear there as relevent to what should appear here.</p>
<p>2. The sub-paragraph removed was entirely factual and sourced. No less than three sources appeared to back up the statement that most reports are reporting a CPU of spec described. TCR has removed factual information that would have been of interest to anyone researching the Broadway CPU.</p>
<p>3. At this stage, it is dubious to even tip-toe around the notion that the CPU description is, indeed, fact. The only reason for keeping the words "Very few confirmed details have surfaced on this processor" center around the fact that the confirmed details we do have are third party (programmers known to IGN quoted Nintendo documentation) and were, at one point, subject to change. The Wii will be released in less than two weeks. The probability that the specs have changed is virtually non-existant.</p>
<p>As such, I will be reverting the change. I also think it's time to remove the words "Very few confirmed details have surfaced on this processor", but I will leave them in for a few days so that that issue can be discussed further. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiggleslash_255a.html" title="User:Squiggleslash">Squiggleslash</a> 13:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now, now, there's absolutely no reason to get frustated over the whole ordeal. <b>:&gt;</b> Lets try this once again.</dd>
<dd><i>No, it is factual, and it is not speculation. If you are going to remove text from an article, you should at least try to understand the text first. The article states that current reports point at an enhanced Gekko. That is a fact. The reports do state that. Nor can you proxy your argument by claiming that</i> the published reports are speculation. The IGN certainly isn't, unless you're accusing them of lying about their sources, in which case you need to back that up.</dd>
<dd>No one knows who IGN got this from, and Nintendo hasn't said a word themselves. So what if it's a published article? There were published articles about aliens existing. Published means <a href="../../../p/u/b/Published.html" title="Published">published</a>, it doesn't mean it's <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. I'm not accusing IGN of lying, I'm just saying that it isn't stable evidence of it being true, and shouldn't be put into the article.</dd>
<dd><i>No, you mischaracterized it. You claimed it was speculation, despite being a fair characterisation of published reports, despite not claiming the claims were anything other than reports, and despite the fact that no less than three reports were linked to it.</i></dd>
<dd>Since the information isn't reputable, it can pretty much be summed up as speculation. Judging by your logic, any site that says they got information from some developer is true. Why don't we put up the specs saying that theres going to be a 8-core 3.2GHz G5 in there? The websites said so. Why don't we say that the console's is going to stay as "Revolution". Some site said so.</dd>

<dd>Woah, woah. I'm not saying the whole article is speculation. I'm just saying that tiny bit just isn't backed well enough. Now you're <i>mischaracterizing</i> what I said, Squig. All the rest of the article has been backed by the words of real companies, not these unnamed "close sources to Nintendo". And now you're critising us <i>all</i> because we're <i>all</i> being overly careful for not going out and screaming at the top of mountains that everything IGN says is true?</dd>

<dd><i>Nintendo has told us they are not interested in releasing the console specs. This would imply they would not like ANYONE doing this.

<p>according to the document broadway could be anything from 400mhz to 900mhz and only way to be sure would be checking the processor part number. anyone ready to sacrifice a Wii for knowledge? Not me.. I'm betting on speed of 900mhz, because that's what the processor can pump out. I see no reason (other than heat) to leave processor overclocked.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You mean underclocked? Anyways I think 733 seems like a good number. I don't expect Nintendo to use the full CPU power, seeing as how Wii is so small. I don't think it would have adequate cooling. Anyways.... anyone got a Wii that they want to crack open? Maybe someone could ask PlanetBoredom what's written on the chips of the Wii they smashed.

<dd>I could see the numerals 72914 - not 729MHz? Is this really proof?

<dd>It could be 729.14 MHz.

Looking at this picture of the Gekko, <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/documents/2620/gekko.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.3dnews.ru/documents/2620/gekko.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, it clearly states 486, and 486 * 1.5 = 729. Exactly. And.. Even better than that, this figure appear on _exactly_ the same place as the "729" on the Broadway. No it's not proof, but aren't we grasping after straws here? What are the odds that the supposedly false or incorrect report states 729 MHz, and then that exact figure end up on the packaging of the product, but that those two figures have no connection? And that that figure is located at exactly the same place as the corresponding figure on the preceeding product does. But that this, again, have nothing to do with one another? What are the odds?</dd>
<dd>And.. for what i's worth. The 729 MHz figure might be a finely tuned 750CL to ensure optimal operating in the Wii, considering bus bandwidth, GPU specs, distances between components and so forth. And guess what? I think that IBM and Nintendo have done this kind of tweaking. The ratio between 485 and 729 is too close to 2:3 to be a coincidence too. Convinced now? -- <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenriok_bf05.html" title="User:Henriok">Henriok</a>
<dl>
<dd>It's not 729.14 MHz. That's not how IBM's part numbering conventions work. But the 729 does indicate the clock speed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 20:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
