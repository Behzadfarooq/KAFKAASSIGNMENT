<p>Article probably still needs to be cleaned up a good bit, but it's much better than it was. It mainly had material regarding his injuries. Also it contained statements like this -- "Having expended his redshirt season sitting out previous injuries, it appeared as though Croyle's career might have been finished, but the NCAA decided to grant him an extra year of eligibility because of his injuries." -- No! Not true! This sentence makes three different assertions, each of which is untrue.</p>

<p>"Shula received a lot of criticism for leaving his star QB in the game with a large lead, being accused of <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_up_the_score.html" title="Running up the score">running up the score</a>" -- While Shula did receive some criticism from college football pundits who always need something to talk about, most experts (including current and former coaches) agree that the criticism was misplaced. Croyle was injured on the first drive of the second half. No coach pulls their QB that early, even with a 31-0 lead. Additionally, Shula exlained that Croyle needed to more game time to work with his young freshman receivers. Also, the criticism wasn't for 'running up the score' it was having the starting QB in the game, thus making him more susceptible to injury.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This whole subject has no business being in this article. The only fact that needs to be stated is that Croyle hurt himself. This is not an appropriate location for opinions or criticisms of Mike Shula. 24.22.9.195 00:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It kind of is, however. The first time that many Americans outside the South heard of Croyle was when he was injured and the national media hounded Shula for running up the score. It was Croyle's main claim to fame until the 2005 season, when he finally came into his own. It's relevant because it shows how he became known to most people. I'll put it back shortly unless you can come up with a better reason, but I'll leave it out for now, alright? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Yeager_818e.html" title="User:Matt Yeager"><b><font color="#DF0001">Matt Yeager</font></b></a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random"><b><font size="3" color="#B46611">♫</font></b></a> <font color="#00AA88">(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_Yeager_99d2.html" title="User talk:Matt Yeager"><font color="#00AA88">Talk?</font></a>)</font> 05:13, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never heard of the controvery and I follow Alabama football very closely (albeit it from far away). The bottom line is it is a matter of opinion, a very minor event and doesn't belong in an encylopedia article. It's about as silly as listing everyone's opinion of his play in every game. 24.22.9.195 00:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Matt - It obviously is a matter of opinion, because so many people disagree with you. I also follow Alabama football closely, and I am familiar with some of the criticism Shula received from a small minority of football pundits. I am also familiar with the majority of football pundits that turned around and told those panty-waist jock sniffers to shut up because they didn't know what they were talking about. Your personal opinion of the incident is irrelevant to the article.</dd>

<dd>So, <i>my</i> thinking it matters is irrelevant, but <i>your</i> "close following of Alabama football" means that the claims of several "pansy-waist jock sniffers" are irrelevant? Do you see how your argument isn't very convincing? I don't want to be rude or scare you--just trying to explain why I'm unconvinced.

<dd>Matt - What you're not understanding is the game of football. Rarely, rarely, rarely do coaches pull their starters at halftime if the team has a big lead. It has nothing to do with wanting to score more points or to prove a point. It has to do with keeping up the momentum into the second half and then turning it over to the second and third stringer. Every single team does it. I see from your profile that you are a WSU fan. I guarantee you that WSU has done this before. As a matter of fact, in the 2005 Nevada game, WSU was ahead by 27 points at halftime, yet starter Alex Brink returned after halftime to start the second half. It wasn't until midway through the 3rd quarter until WSU pulled Brink from the game. A second example - WSU v. Grambling in 2005. WSU continued to keep Alex Brink in the game into the 4th quarter with a 27 point lead. Third example - WSU v. Idaho 2004. Starter Josh Swogger returns in 3rd quarter with a 28 point lead. Fourth example - WSU v. Oregon in 2003. WSU has a 45-16 point lead going into 4th quarter, yet starter Matt Kegel continues to play. 68.221.193.76 02:49, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sports media is not always informed. I would say, the better thing to do, is to go look at the box scores of various football games to see what the trend is among college football coaches with regard to keeping starters in past halftime in games with blowout scores. If you do this, you will see that your belief/theory holds no water. See the WSU examples above 68.221.193.76</dd>

<dd>This may not satisfy you, but it's the truth: <u>just because it's commonplace doesn't mean it isn't running up the score</u>. USC was <i>notorious</i> on the West Coast for doing so, by the by. Washington State did it a few times, too, and if Brink had gotten himself injured against Grambling, I absolutely guarantee that coach Doba would have gotten <i>killed</i> in the local media because of it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Yeager_818e.html" title="User:Matt Yeager"><b><font color="#DF0001">Matt Yeager</font></b></a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random"><b><font size="3" color="#B46611">♫</font></b></a> <font color="#00AA88">(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_Yeager_99d2.html" title="User talk:Matt Yeager"><font color="#00AA88">Talk?</font></a>)</font> 05:41, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These are just <i>some</i> examples. I could put dozens more in here. It's not just 'commonplace' meaning there are a few examples out there. It's what every team does. Even in blow out games, every single football team plays their starters after half time. Go look at the box scores for any football team. The reason why coaches do it has nothing to do with running up the score. This has been explained to you over and over by more people than just me. Your definition of 'running up the score' seems to differ from what everyone else sees as running up the score. 68.221.193.76 12:26, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
