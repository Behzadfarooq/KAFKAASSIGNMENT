<p>It is unnecessary to refer to my changes as a "rant". It is equally as unnecessary to dismiss the facts that I posted with the instructions that I should "get over" the misinformation that has been posted. That being said, if SLC were not properly in Bronxville, then its address would not be "1 Mead Way, Bronxville NY 10708." If Sarah Lawrence were officially in Yonkers, and if it wished to change its address for public relations purposes, then it would have opened a POBox in Bronxville. This was the case, for example, with Warren Wilson College in Swannanoa, NC, which opened a POBox in Asheville, NC as its official address for PR reasons. SLC, on the other hand, is officially and has always been in Bronxville. A call to the school's archivist will confirm this. This has nothing to do with my opinion on the subject. It is simply fact. I personally do not care what address the school may have, but I feel obligated to correct misinformation; it is the nature of this website.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the original content of the article is correct. Sarah Lawrence College is located in the city of Yonkers and the Bronxville Postal District. It's not at all uncommon for an address to be in a Postal District that doesn't share its name. The determining factor is what city a school pays taxes in, and Sarah Lawrence pays taxes in Yonkers. If you'd like to test this theory, call 911 from campus and see whether it's the Bronxville or Yonkers police department that shows up.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 16:48, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, does anyone have a source confirming that Sarah Lawrence influenced that USPS to put it in the Bronxville Postal District for the purpose of PR? It's fine to note that the college is in the Postal District, but without a source I don't think we should speculate as to how that came about. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 21:16, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nobody is claiming that the college influenced the USPS in any way. Being in the 10708 section of Yonkers means one can choose to address one's mail as either Yonkers or Bronxville. However, it is disingenuous to claim to be in Bronxville when one is within the city boundaries of Yonkers. --Nelson Ricardo 21:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My only problem with the former wording is that it speculated as to the motives of the college. I share the opinion that the choice of address is a PR move, but without a source it's nothing more than an opinion, and therefore not NPOV. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 22:25, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sarah Lawrence is most certainly <b>not</b> in Bronxville, and the first paragraph of the article should be revised to reflect that simple fact. (We're now in the position of having both the Bronxville and Yonkers Wikipedia articles making the claim that <b>they</b> are the home of Sarah Lawrence College, which is absurd.)</p>
<p>Although people who get involved in this issue seldom resort to facts, I'm going to do just that. First, take a look at the campus map from the Sarah Lawrence website, which I found at <a href="http://www.slc.edu/data/386/link/1299/SLC_CampusMapWeb.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.slc.edu/data/386/link/1299/SLC_CampusMapWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.slc.edu/data/386/link/1299/SLC_CampusMapWeb.pdf</a>. Then, take a look at the map viewer on the website of the Westchester County Geographic Information Systems (Yonkers and Bronxville are both in Westchester County) at <a href="http://giswww.westchestergov.com/westchester/emap/viewer.htm" class="external free" title="http://giswww.westchestergov.com/westchester/emap/viewer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://giswww.westchestergov.com/westchester/emap/viewer.htm</a> and navigate to the area under discussion. (To save time, you can look at <a href="http://www.WebFeats.com/SarahLawrence-Yonkers.gif" class="external free" title="http://www.WebFeats.com/SarahLawrence-Yonkers.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.WebFeats.com/SarahLawrence-Yonkers.gif</a>, where I've copied the relevant area of the map.) Even a cursory comparison of the maps reveals that the entire campus is within the city limits of Yonkers (the area in gray), and that not one square inch of the campus crosses the Bronx River into Bronxville (one of the areas in white).</p>
<p>It's obvious to me that the article should be corrected, but I won't do that until I hear what others have to say. HMishkoff 21:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone revised a recent change I made that clarified the location of Sarah Lawrence College. While I'm not crazy about the edit (and don't understand why it was made), I let it stand -- but I did restore the reference that was removed with the edit. I've learned that this is a strangely contentious issue, and I had hoped to avoid an edit war by providing a reference to the official Bronxville website, which unequivocally states that SLC is in Yonkers. If someone still has a problem with the reference, I'm hoping that we can discuss it before you remove it again. Thanks! HMishkoff 20:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone removed my reference again, and I don't understand why, so I restored it again. I hate to keep restoring something that someone else keeps deleting, but I'll continue to do it until I get some kind of explanation. I just can't imagine why anyone would object to the inclusion of a reference, but I'm looking forward to hearing the explanation. HMishkoff 05:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not I, if that's the implication. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHilighter555_e41d.html" title="User:Hilighter555">Hilighter555</a> 01:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There was no such implication on my part. HMishkoff 06:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've restored the reference again, Trxr4kds removed it yesterday, saying that it was "redundant." In a sense, of course, all references are redundant, in that they discuss and/or restate the point being referenced. But without references, contentious points are unsourced – and since this is a surprisingly contentious issue, it has a strong need for a reference. HMishkoff 13:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
