<p><i>Brookside</i> became well known for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines and was most popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> it began raising more controversial, and perhaps sensationalist issues under the guidance of new producers such as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal_Young_ec8c.html" title="Mal Young">Mal Young</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Marquess_e9bf.html" title="Paul Marquess">Paul Marquess</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookside.html" title="Edit section: The Beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Beginning</span></h2>
<p><i>Brookside</i>, based in a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cul-de-sac.html" title="Cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a> in Liverpool, first appeared on November 2nd 1982 with the launch of the fourth British terrestrial channel, Channel 4. It differed from other serials because it was filmed in real, brand-new houses, in a real street, in an attempt by the producers to add to the show's realism. In early 1982, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mersey_Television_19ff.html" title="Mersey Television">Mersey Television</a>, with Phil Redmond firmly at the helm, bought 13 houses altogether, 6 of which would be seen on-screen as sets, and the remaining 7 properties would house Administration, Post Production and Canteen facilities for the cast and crew. It was planned that were the show to be a commercial failure, these constructed houses could be sold on to partly recoup any losses. Production began in the Summer of 1982. The first episodes of <i>Brookside</i> weren't well received and featured many obvious technical problems, such as poor sound quality, where actors voices would echo around the small rooms of the box houses used as sets. Poor scripts were criticised by the audience as many derided <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swear_words.html" title="Swear words">swear words</a> were commonplace, an hour before the watershed, and questionable acting from a cast of relative unknowns all served to make <i>Brookside</i> seem very amateurish and certainly not good enough to be the flagship soap on Britain's newest TV channel.</p>
<p>The first episodes concentrated on the development of the anchor Grant family, with Sheila (<a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Johnston_10e9.html" title="Sue Johnston">Sue Johnston</a>) and Bobby (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Tomlinson_ae20.html" title="Ricky Tomlinson">Ricky Tomlinson</a>) having moved up the social ladder to a big, four-bedroomed house on the '<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-class.html" title="Middle-class">middle-class</a>' Brookside Close from a run-down <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_estate.html" title="Council estate">council estate</a>. They were the first family to have moved onto the Close at Number 5, as initially, only 3 of the six new-builds were occupied by characters. Episode 1 saw the Collins' arrival, and they were conversely on their way <i>down</i> the social ladder, downsizing from their lavish home on the upmarket <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wirral.html" title="Wirral">Wirral</a>, to the small, box-sized Number 8 Brookside Close. Other characters included Heather (<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Burton_63c7.html" title="Amanda Burton">Amanda Burton</a> in her TV debut) and Roger Huntingdon (Rob Spendlove), two young professionals residing at semi-detached Number 9, and next door at Number 10, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_class.html" title="Low class">low class</a> Gavin (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Webb_0d18.html" title="Daniel Webb">Daniel Webb</a>) and Petra Taylor (Alexandra Pigg) soon moved in, selling stolen cookers from the front lawn, naturally infuriating the neighbours.</p>
<p>Viewing figures bouyed around 1 million as the Production team and writers started to iron out <i>Brookside</i>s teething troubles. Soundproof panels were placed on the ceilings of the houses to contain sound and eliminate echoing, and the scriptwriters toned down the language. Out went the turgid, humourless and contentious feel the soap initially had, and in came new, interesting characters such as Harry (Bill Dean) and Edna (Betty Alberge) Cross, who finally bought Number 7 in November, and in April, comedy figure Alan Partridge (<a href="../../../d/i/c/Dicken_Ashworth_58de.html" title="Dicken Ashworth">Dicken Ashworth</a>) moved into the Bungalow, Number 6, and these new characters helped bring humour and balance to the existing cast during 1983.</p>
<p>Further cast changes during 1983 saw the arrival of the Jackson family. Both Gavin and Petra Taylor departed <i>Brookside</i> early in the year, with Gavin becoming the first casualty of the soap, dying from a brain haemorrhage, and Petra committed suicide a few months later, after a mysterious disappearance from the Close. Petra's sister, Marie Jackson (Anna Keaveney), her husband George (Cliff Howells) and their twin boys (Gary and 'little' George) moved into Number 10, and became central to <i>Brookside's</i> highest profile storyline yet, when George was wrongly convicted of a warehouse robbery. In an unprecedented move, the plotline was leaked to the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid_press.html" title="Tabloid press">tabloid press</a>, and as Marie Jackson began the <i>Free George Jackson</i> campaign on-screen, the press followed, creating levels of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_hype.html" title="Media hype">media hype</a> never seen before in the UK, especially towards a British <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> (although the US soap <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a></i> had seen solid British tabloid support during the 'Who Shot <a href="../../../j/r/_/JR_fc13.html" title="JR">JR</a>' plot of 1980). Viewing figures rose as the hype continued; a record called <i>Free George Jackson</i> by Blazing Saddles was released (and flopped), merchandise was produced, including T Shirts and Posters! However, even though the storyline ultimately had a low-key conclusion (Cliff Howells who played George resigned and George Jackson stayed inside!), the plot largely helped <i>Brookside</i> on the pathway to success, particularly when the Corkhills arrived to replace the departed Jackson family in September 1985. This type of soap opera hype would much later be copied by <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i> with the 'Free <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deirdre_Barlow_4f5f.html" title="Deirdre Barlow">Deirdre Rachid</a>' campaign of 1998, and later, in <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i> with the 'Who Shot <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Mitchell_2084.html" title="Phil Mitchell">Phil Mitchell</a>?' plot of 2001.</p>

<p>With the obvious popularity of the Grant family, many storylines were geared around <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Grant_9bb5.html" title="Bobby Grant">Bobby</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_Grant_55e6.html" title="Sheila Grant">Sheila</a>'s turbulent marriage for most of the 1980s. Bobby's short-temper and frequent visits to Union picket lines opposite Sheila's staunch catholic faith and family values all served to be compelling viewing for many viewers, as did the antics of their popular older children <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Grant_45ed.html" title="Barry Grant">Barry</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Usher_fbbb.html" title="Paul Usher">Paul Usher</a>), <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Grant_edf8.html" title="Karen Grant">Karen</a> (Shelagh O'Hara), and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Grant_7bf8.html" title="Damon Grant">Damon</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_O%27Brien_965a.html" title="Simon O'Brien">Simon O'Brien</a>). They were joined by Clare later in the mid-1980s in a thoughtful storyline where Sheila and Bobby dealt with parenthood later on in life.</p>
<p>1985 was a pivotal year for <i>Brookside</i> with the arrival of its longest-running and most well-known family, the Corkhills. The first generation of Corkhills to descend on the Close were <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Corkhill_089c.html" title="Billy Corkhill">Billy</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McArdle_65bd.html" title="John McArdle">John McArdle</a>) and <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doreen_Corkhill_174c.html" title="Doreen Corkhill">Doreen</a> (Kate Fitzgerald) who moved into Number 10 with their children <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Corkhill_5263.html" title="Rod Corkhill">Rod</a> (Jason Hope) and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Corkhill_66e4.html" title="Tracy Corkhill">Tracy</a> (Justine Kerrigan) along with a multitude of marital problems and debt. A favourite scene with fans occurred in 1987. Doreen and Billy's crumbling marriage reached breaking point after Doreen admitted to Billy she had been sexually propositioned in return to pay off the family's spiralling debts. With fierce and tremendous rage, Billy jumped into his brown <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triumph_Acclaim_9036.html" title="Triumph Acclaim">Triumph Acclaim</a> and aggressively sped over all his neighbours' gardens! Not only did this satisfy Billy's utter marital frustrations, but it also served as <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> to the rest of the residents of the Close who had driven over <i>his</i> garden to avoid a huge hole that had appeared in the middle of the Brookside Close access road!</p>
<p>Mid 1985 <i>Brookside</i> achieved its biggest viewing figures of the eighties with the infamous 'Number 7 Siege'. This was a heavy handed but powerful plot that intended to highlight the possible dangers of <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Care_in_the_Community_879e.html" title="Care in the Community">Care in the Community</a></i>, a controversial parliamentary scheme introduced in the early 1980s where <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentally_ill.html" title="Mentally ill">mentally ill</a> people, previously hospitalised in bleak, isolated Victorian <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylums.html" title="Asylums">asylums</a>, were now treated at home, allowing the closure of these notoriously depressing institutions. The extreme and hard-hitting storyline was watched by 7.5 million people, an incredible achievement for Britain's newest TV channel, still only in its third year. Number 7 Brookside Close was home to three young nurses; Pat Hancock (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Easter_8c5b.html" title="David Easter">David Easter</a>), Sandra Maghie (Sheila Greer) and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Moses_9360.html" title="Kate Moses">Kate Moses</a> (Sharon Rossita), who rented the property from Harry Cross. Through their nursing, they encountered the seemingly harmless and gentle giant John Clarke (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Pugh_279c.html" title="Robert Pugh">Robert Pugh</a>), whose elderly Mother eventually died (of natural causes) in Hospital, under their care. Gradually, John's instability grew into insanity and he was unable to cope with the death of his Mum with absolutely devastating consequences. He forced his way into Number 7, armed with a sawn-off shot gun and ready to avenge his Mother's death. He violently held the three nurses hostage for several days in a claustrophic and gripping 3 episode run with Brookside Close dramatically sealed off and surrounded by armed police! The siege culminated in a terrifying shoot-out resulting in the shocking death of Kate followed by John's subsequent suicide. Although some critics howled at the unlikely plot-premise (former <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i> critic Hilary Kingsley described it as 'ludicrous' in her book <i>Soap Box</i>), these were well produced and powerfully acted sequences, creating genuine and uncomfortable tension with a level of drama arguably never previously seen before in a British soap opera. The storyline put <i>Brookside</i> in a predominant position and made other soaps, such as <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i> and the revamped <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossroads.html" title="Crossroads">Crossroads</a></i> take notice, and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, previously <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snobbish.html" title="Snobbish">snobbish</a> about the soap opera <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a>, finally realised they needed a popular soap and launched equally hard-hitting <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i> the very same year. <i>Brookside</i> was now seen as a quality soap opera, a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> hit within the core of its target demographic, earning it the reputation as being "The Rolls Royce of Soaps" among devoted fans.</p>
<p>1986 was another hugely memorable year for the soap, featuring the horrifying attack of Sheila Grant in some of <i>Brookside's</i> most harrowing and deeply disturbing scenes. The storyline was praised for its marked restraint, and stunned viewers and critics alike. <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Johnston_10e9.html" title="Sue Johnston">Sue Johnston</a>'s powerful portrayal of the heartbreaking scenes showing Sheila coming to terms with her shocking rape ordeal were unbearably realisitic and earned it the second most popular <i>Brookside</i> storyline ever, as featured in the documentary <i>Brookside: 100 of the Best</i> (See below). This year also saw the introduction of the soap's longest-running character <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Corkhill_2aa4.html" title="Jimmy Corkhill">Jimmy Corkhill</a>, played by <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Sullivan_a4e4.html" title="Dean Sullivan">Dean Sullivan</a>. Initially a bit-part player, Jimmy was the brother of Billy, and his early appearances usually saw the character in many money-making schemes, a true <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scally.html" title="Scally">scally</a>, along with characters such as Barry Grant, and also the hugely popular <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Sullivan_1256.html" title="Terry Sullivan">Terry Sullivan</a> (Brian Reagan) and Thomas 'Sinbad' Sweeney <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Starke_96a3.html" title="Michael Starke">Michael Starke</a>. Barry, Terry and Sinbad would all go on to have extremely powerful storylines of their own in the future episodes of <i>Brookside</i>.</p>
<p>The second ground-breaking storyline in 1986 was the death of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Black_1942.html" title="Nicholas Black">Nicholas Black</a> (Alan Rothwell). Having divorced her first husband Roger in 1983, Heather reverted back to her maiden name, Haversham, becoming a strong and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sassy.html" title="Sassy">sassy</a> independent career woman once again. However, these characteristics changed when Heather met businessman Nicholas Black. After a whirlwind romance, Heather and Nick hurriedly married, but little did she know he was a secret heroin addict. On her return from work one day, she found him dead in the Living Room of Number 9 having suffered a fatal overdose. As a result, Heather left Brookside Close for good (in reality, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Burton_63c7.html" title="Amanda Burton">Amanda Burton</a> quit because she strongly disagreed with the plot). The storyline was intentionally shocking, becoming the first British soap opera to candidly tackle the issue of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> addiction and, notably, <i>Brookside</i> would return to the destructive effects of <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_abuse.html" title="Drug abuse">drug abuse</a> frequently throughout its 21 year run, particularly with the Jimmy Corkhill character, through to the concluding episodes nearly 20 years later.</p>

<p>The late 80's saw the gradual disintegration of the popular and central Grant family. Damon was fatally stabbed whilst on the run with his girlfriend Debbie (<a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_Kearney_7cae.html" title="Gillian Kearney">Gillian Kearney</a>) in 1987 (and contained in a <i>Brookside</i> 'Soap Bubble', see below), Karen left for London to study in early 1988 and never returned, and she was followed by the departure of Bobby in April after he discovered he wasn't eldest son Barry's biological father. As the marriage painfully crumbled, Sheila and little Clare moved into the spare room at Billy Corkhill's (Number 10) and 4-bedroomed Number 5 was sold to the Roger's family in 1989. The Roger's were a similarly large family who'd moved into Number 7 in 1987, renting it from Harry Cross. However, when Number 5 went up for auction, Truck driver Frank (Peter Christian) and <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_wing.html" title="Left wing">left wing</a> Chrissie (Eithne Browne) decided they wanted to buy their own home, so bought the former Grant house on their way up the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_ladder.html" title="Property ladder">property ladder</a>, a very <i><a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_wing.html" title="Right wing">right wing</a></i> approach to home ownership in the eighties.</p>
<p>The Collins' had also had a relatively eventful time on the Close. Nearing retirement, Paul (Jim Wiggins) suffered humiliation at his redundancy and subsequent unemployment, resulting in the family having to move to Brookside Close. Meanwhile, in another British soap opera first, a ground-breaking storyline saw their son Gordon (Nigel Crowley/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Burgess_9f09.html" title="Mark Burgess">Mark Burgess</a>) <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">coming out</a> as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>, while daughter Lucy (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katrin_Cartlidge_b692.html" title="Katrin Cartlidge">Katrin Cartlidge</a>/Maggie Saunders) embarked on a controversial affair with a married man. Mother and family <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriarch.html" title="Matriarch">matriarch</a> Annabelle (Doreen Sloane), had to rescue her elderly and abused mother, Mona, from a corrupt care-home and this was followed by her illicit affair with Magistrate, Brian Lawrence. By 1990, however, the entire family had to be written out of <i>Brookside</i> following Doreen Sloane's sad and untimely death from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> in early 1990.</p>
<p>The Corkhill's marriage had also ended in divorce and Doreen left the family in late 1987. With Rod becoming a Police Officer and Tracey a Hairdresser, the family regularly saw Uncle Jimmy popping in to create a spare room at Number 10 by knocking a door way through to the garage! This room was eventually occupied by Sheila and Clare Grant, and it marked the beginning of Sheila and Billy's slow dance to love and marriage - another hugely popular storyline with viewers.</p>
<p>During 1987, <i>Brookside</i> saw the arrival of 1980's archetypes '<a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppies.html" title="Yuppies">yuppies</a>' Jonathan Gordon-Davies (Stephen Pinner) and Laura Wright (Jane Cunliffe) into Number 9. A popular union was tragically cut short when Laura was electrocuted by a faulty light switch, sending her tumbling down the stairs. She was <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comatose.html" title="Comatose">comatose</a> for 3 months, dying in January 1988. The recently vacated Number 7 saw Chinese immigrants the Choi's move in for a short period, providing storylines for the increasingly popular window-cleaner Sinbad, who embarked on a shortlived attraction to Caroline Choi (Sarah Lamm). The soap was now averaging around 4 to 5 million viewers as the 1980s drew to a close but it was at this point that the tide was beginning to turn. Off-screen, Mersey Television had bought a defunct Technical College in the district of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childwall.html" title="Childwall">Childwall</a>, around 15 minutes away from the set of Brookside Close and on-screen, part of this new premises became a row of shops called <i>Brookside Parade</i>. The introduction of a shop, bar, chip-shop and other businesses saw <i>Brookside's</i> main focus shift from the Close, to this new set, and many storylines went with it. To launch the <i>Parade</i> in 1991, coinciding with the soaps 1000th episode, the writers developed the storyline of Terry Sullivan's wife Sue (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Miles_d0fb.html" title="Annie Miles">Annie Miles</a>) and baby Danny being pushed to their deaths off scaffolding. This again gave the soap extremely high viewing figures. When Barry Grant was revealed as Sue's murderer, his character became somewhat oppressive and sinister, but he was no-less popular with the ever growing audience.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the plots of <i>Brookside</i> became increasingly sensationalised. Most of the original cast had left, with Billy and Sheila, the entire Collins family, the Choi's and Harry Cross all departing by the end of 1990. In came the Dixon family, the Farnham's and the Johnson's. Also, the Barry Grant character (Barry Usher) became centrally involved in many dark and dramatic plots. Mick Johnson (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Emerick_0c3b.html" title="Louis Emerick">Louis Emerick</a>) had been a lodger with Harry Cross in 1989, but by early 1990, he'd been joined by his wife Josie (Suzanne Packer) and children Leo and Gemma. Max and Patricia Farnham (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Pinder_ee81.html" title="Steven Pinder">Steven Pinder</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabrielle_Glaister_3778.html" title="Gabrielle Glaister">Gabrielle Glaister</a>) moved into Number 7 in April 1990 and became the soap's new yuppie couple. Ron and DD Dixon (<a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Earl_cdcd.html" title="Vince Earl">Vince Earl</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irene_Marot_4b72.html" title="Irene Marot">Irene Marot</a>) drove onto Brookside Close during October in the 'Moby', a huge mobile shop, to move into Number 8, and it wasn't long before the family were rowing with their new neighbours over the junk on their front lawn!</p>
<p>Following the departure of Billy Corkhill, his children, Rod and Tracey, were both gradually written out of the soap and Billy's brother, Jimmy (Dean Sullivan), became a regular and central player in <i>Brookside</i>. He was joined by his estranged wife Jackie, popular actress <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Jenkins_bb1b.html" title="Sue Jenkins">Sue Jenkins</a>, well known for her role as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Todd_4165.html" title="Gloria Todd">Gloria Todd</a> in <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i>, and his elder children 'little' Jimmy (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Christopher_a839.html" title="George Christopher">George Christopher</a>) and Lindsay (<a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Sweeney_7baf.html" title="Claire Sweeney">Claire Sweeney</a>) were initially seen as recurring characters. However, the formally loveable Jimmy soon descended into intense and harrowing drug abuse, his addiction memorably climaxing in a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>-induced car crash which shockingly killed off long-running character Frank Rogers (Peter Christian) in 1993, and teenager Tony Dixon (Mark Lennock) eventually died of his injuries from the crash in February 1994.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 1993, the establishment of <i>Brookside Parade</i> occurred; Ron Dixon opened a convenience store, Barry Grant launched a bar and nightclub establishment, and eventually the entire <i>Parade</i> was occupied by businesses owned by residents of Brookside Close. Flats above the shops also provided new homes to various characters, such as Mick Johnson, famously held at gun-point in his flat by obsessed stalker Jenny Swift (Kate Beckett). <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mersey_Television_19ff.html" title="Mersey Television">Mersey Television</a> made full use of their former Technical College buildings in Childwall and introduced Head Mistress Barbara Harrison (<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Morant_280a.html" title="Angela Morant">Angela Morant</a>), who moved into Number 9 Brookside Close with recently retired husband John (Geoffrey Leesley). Many scenes saw Barbara at <i>Brookside Comprehensive</i> (in reality derelict Childwall Technical College buildings) in charge of pupils such as teenagers Jacqui (Alexandra Fletcher) and Mike Dixon (Paul Byatt) from Number 8, and Katie Rogers (Diane Burke) from Number 5. The Harrison's storylines, including John's <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoplifting.html" title="Shoplifting">shoplifting</a>, and later, son Peter (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Beck_f266.html" title="Robert Beck">Robert Beck</a>) who became involved in a lengthy <a href="../../../d/a/t/Date-rape.html" title="Date-rape">date-rape</a> plot with Rod Corkhill's wife Diana, weren't particularly popular with viewers, so they were replaced by the Banks family who arrived with much baggage of their own in early 1994.</p>
<p><i>Brookside's</i> most infamous plot happened in 1993 with the storyline of wife beater and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">child abuser</a> <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Jordache_4e68.html" title="Trevor Jordache">Trevor Jordache</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Murray_705d.html" title="Bryan Murray">Bryan Murray</a>). Late in the year, his wife, Mandy (Sandra Maitland) and daughters Beth (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Friel_c136.html" title="Anna Friel">Anna Friel</a>) and Rachel (<a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Chapman_1d58.html" title="Tiffany Chapman">Tiffany Chapman</a>) moved into Number 10. The house had been vacated by the remaining (Billy) Corkhill clan, and unbeknown to anyone, had been sold off to become a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safe_house.html" title="Safe house">safe house</a> for abused families. As the viewer got to know the new characters, some disturbing facts emerged. Beth and her young sister Rachel had been sexually abused by their Dad, and before long, the vile and disturbingly realistic Trevor had found them in Brookside Close and bullied his way back into the family home. As the abuse and torture got worst, Mandy and Beth stabbed him in the Kitchen of Number 10 and, with the help of Sinbad, buried him underneath their <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patio.html" title="Patio">patio</a>, where his body remained for well over a year. The finding of his remains in January 1995 gave <i>Brookside</i> its highest ever viewing figures of 9 million - and earned it the Number One most popular storyline in the <i>Brookside: 100 of the Best</i> documentary to celebrate the soap's 21st Anniversary. (The Top Ten is shown below). The Jordache family, particularly the character Beth (Anna Friel), were at the peak of <i>Brookside's</i> popularity, especially when Beth shared British Television's first pre-<a href="../../../w/a/t/Watershed.html" title="Watershed">watershed</a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> kiss with the Farnham's <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanny.html" title="Nanny">Nanny</a> Margaret Clemence (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicola_Stephenson_b254.html" title="Nicola Stephenson">Nicola Stephenson</a>) in December 1993. Unfortunately, things were to go rapidly downhill from here as <i>Brookside</i> boldly attempted to hold on to its largely <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> audience with years of sensational and often badly handled storylines, an unrealistic sense of realism and a range of unlikeable, tired and unpopular characters, proved as ratings began to rapidly slide.</p>

<p>Following the success of the 'body under the patio' plot, the writers of the show continued to deal with controversial subjects that other British soaps did not. A religious cult headed by Simon Howe (Simon Hartney) blew up Number 5 in a suicide pact during 1994, and a mysterious killer virus saw the lame death of two guest characters in 1995. But it was the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incestuous.html" title="Incestuous">incestuous</a> relationship between brother and sister, Nat (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sandford_e494.html" title="John Sandford">John Sandford</a>) and Georgia Simpson (<a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Grace_5675.html" title="Helen Grace">Helen Grace</a>) in 1996 that drew the most criticism, plus the over use of characters such as Lindsay Corkhill in many similarly contentious plots all served to make viewers gradually switch off. The character of Lindsay was played by <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Sweeney_7baf.html" title="Claire Sweeney">Claire Sweeney</a>, and due to the popularity of the actress at the time, there were many storylines for her <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter-ego.html" title="Alter-ego">alter-ego</a>. These included being stalked by her ex husband Gary (Andrew Fillis), an on-off relationship with bad-boy Barry Grant (<a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Usher_fbbb.html" title="Paul Usher">Paul Usher</a>), a very short marriage to Peter Phelan (<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Kane_2872.html" title="Samuel Kane">Samuel Kane</a>), a stint being terrorised by gang-land boss Callum Finnegan (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kelly_31dd.html" title="John Kelly">John Kelly</a>) and then 'our Linds' became a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>, falling for a new character, cunning Shelly Bowers (<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Wescourt_78ba.html" title="Alexandra Wescourt">Alexandra Wescourt</a>). Many of these plots were met with limited success, however, and viewers were even more unimpressed with a 'lesbian love triangle' involving Shelly, Lindsay and Lindsay's <i>Mother</i> Jackie (<a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Jenkins_bb1b.html" title="Sue Jenkins">Sue Jenkins</a>), an extremely unlikely plot-premise that required a <i>huge</i> suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>A new family at Number 8, the Musgroves, introduced in 1998 were met with further criticism, lot least due to the strange range of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accents.html" title="Accents">accents</a> spoken by the sprawling and unpopular brewd, whilst the Shadwicks, who had moved into Number 6, were perhaps a more a more successful cast addition. Greg (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Moraghan_75b7.html" title="Mark Moraghan">Mark Moraghan</a>) and Margi Shadwick (Bernadette Foley) and their family marked an attempt to return <i>Brookside</i> 'back-to-basics' with storylines again revolving around families and their dynamics within the close-knit community. The introduction of these families heralded perhaps one of <i>Brookside'</i>s most long-running story arcs, the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Date_rape.html" title="Date rape">date rape</a> of Nikki Shadwick (<a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanne_Collins_4d21.html" title="Suzanne Collins">Suzanne Collins</a>) at a party held at Number 5. For an entire year, Nikki accused neighbour Luke Musgrove (Jason Kavannah) of the attack, however, following a lengthy courtcase, he was proven not guilty. In an unpopular plot-twist and after consistently denying the allegations, Luke eventually confessed to Nikki that he had in fact raped her, and the entire Musgrove family seemingly fled Liverpool during January 2000 overnight in shame. But, in another British soap opera first, the character of teenage <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> smoker <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Musgrove_d1a8.html" title="Matt Musgrove">Matt Musgrove</a>, played by Kristian Ealey, immediately transferred to <i>Brookside's</i> sister-soap <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></i> where the character stayed until 2004.</p>
<p>Despite the attempts at a more grounded approach to the long-running soap opera again, <i>Brookside</i> had ultimately become synonymous with plots involving guns and explosions, with no fewer than 6 catastrophic fires and explosions taking place during the soaps final 5 years. A gas-cooker destroyed much of the <i>Brookside Parade</i> and a bomb detonated in the <i>Millennium Club</i> killed both Jason and Greg Shadwick. Separate fires at Number 6 and Number 8 almost killed several cast members, and the roads were no safer, as a memorable car crash in which Susannah (Karen Drury) and Max Farnham's (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Pinder_ee81.html" title="Steven Pinder">Steven Pinder</a>) children both perished, all served to make <i>Brookside</i> the most dangerous place on Television. <i><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a></i> TV listings Editor, Alison Graham, remarked in 1998: "Brookside loves a good disaster" as well as renaming Claire Sweeney's character's name to; Lindsay "Get Your Gun" Corkhill! This was shortly before the soap was dropped from Graham's <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satirical.html" title="Satirical">satirical</a> page reviewing weekly soap opera plots, with <i>Brookside's</i> column handed over to <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_2_14a4.html" title="BBC Radio 2">BBC Radio 2</a> rural-soap <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archers_9d85.html" title="The Archers">The Archers</a></i> which was now indeed getting a higher audience on Radio than <i>Brookside</i> was achieving on prime-time Television.</p>
<p>The long-running character Max Farnham was written out of the soap in 1998 after <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Pinder_ee81.html" title="Steven Pinder">Steven Pinder</a> decided to leave <i>Brookside</i> after almost nine years as the philandering romeo. The characters' exit was extremely unpopular and involved a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retconned.html" title="Retconned">retconned</a> storyline where Max had supposedly had a 10 year-long affair with a woman never mentioned before in the script. Max abruptly departed, viewers weren't convinced, and Susannah returned to her maiden name, Morrisey, going on to have affairs with Greg Shadwick (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Moraghan_75b7.html" title="Mark Moraghan">Mark Moraghan</a>) and Mick Johnson (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Emerick_0c3b.html" title="Louis Emerick">Louis Emerick</a>). The Dixon family fell apart when Ron (<a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Earl_cdcd.html" title="Vince Earl">Vince Earl</a>) and Jackie Corkhill (<a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Jenkins_bb1b.html" title="Sue Jenkins">Sue Jenkins</a>) <i>almost</i> had an affair, but the fate of the doomed marriage was sealed when Ron <i>did</i> have an affair with much-younger Bev McLoughlin (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_White_46f9.html" title="Sarah White">Sarah White</a>). Ron then remarried his old flame Anthea Brindley (Barbara Hatwell), the mother of his long-lost (and quickly forgotten) Jacqui look-a-like daughter in 1999, but the marriage quickly ended in divorce when Anthea wouldn't lie in court after Ron shot-dead Clint Moffat (Greg Petaras) in the Kitchen of Number 8 - arguably an act of 'self defence' which got him 6 months in prison. Viewer favourite Bev (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_White_46f9.html" title="Sarah White">Sarah White</a>) had a one-night stand with Ron's elder son Mike (Paul Byatt), resulting in the birth of baby Josh. Years of animosity followed, but after Mike's marriage to Rachel Dixon (<a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Chapman_1d58.html" title="Tiffany Chapman">Tiffany Chapman</a>), Ron reconciled with Bev and began to see Josh as one of his own.</p>
<p>In 2000, a new family were introduced, the Murray's, who were the creation of the soaps penultimate Producer, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Marquess_e9bf.html" title="Paul Marquess">Paul Marquess</a>. They became an important part of further rejuvenation of <i>Brookside</i> and featured singer <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Nolan_edd9.html" title="Bernie Nolan">Bernie Nolan</a> as Diane in her first acting role, and Neil Caple as Marty. The Murray's <i>did</i> spark new viewer interest in <i>Brookside</i> and the family became central to plots, such as Diane's lengthy <a href="../../../i/v/f/IVF_bd31.html" title="IVF">IVF</a> treatment, daughter Adele's (Katy Lamont) under-age preganacy and abortion, and perhaps most memorable of all, young Anthony's (<a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Quinn_cfbc.html" title="Raymond Quinn">Raymond Quinn</a>) shocking bullying storyline, where he accidentally killed his nemesis Imelda Clough. The Liverpool '<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scally.html" title="Scally">scally</a>' aspect of the soap was still evident at this time with eldest son Steve Murray (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Fletcher_9e02.html" title="Stephen Fletcher">Stephen Fletcher</a>) teaming up with Tim 'Tinhead' O'Leary (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Olivier_0c2c.html" title="Philip Olivier">Philip Olivier</a>), who had married Emily Shadwick (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Ellison_a94e.html" title="Jennifer Ellison">Jennifer Ellison</a>), Ellison's character having been completely re-written during this time from a shy, frumpy schoolgirl to a confident, sexy young vixen, becoming popular with viewers. Tim and Emily lived with the increasingly isolated Jimmy at Number 10, providing storylines for the character following the exit of daughter Lindsay and his wife Jackie. But the departure of the soaps original scally, the hugely popular 'Sinbad' (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Starke_96a3.html" title="Michael Starke">Michael Starke</a>) in an on-screen <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">child abuse</a> scandal, wasn't well received, with the formally upbeat and jolly character departing Brookside Close under a cloud.</p>
<p>Also exiting, the notoriously accident prone Susannah Morrisey, took a fatal tumble down the stairs of Number 7 in a 2000 'Whodunnit' plotline with jilted former-lover Mick Johnson (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Emerick_0c3b.html" title="Louis Emerick">Louis Emerick</a>), vengeful Emily Shadwick (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Ellison_a94e.html" title="Jennifer Ellison">Jennifer Ellison</a>) and returned ex-husband Max Farnham all in the frame when it was eventually discovered Susannah may have been pushed to her death. Max was unveiled as the culprit, although as shown in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashback.html" title="Flashback">flashback</a>, Susannah had actually tripped over a toy as she argued with Max at the top of the stairs. All charges were dropped, leaving Max free to marry previous next-door neighbour, Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher), who became his third wife in 2001. They continued to live in Number 7, before swapping houses with Ron Dixon (<a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Earl_cdcd.html" title="Vince Earl">Vince Earl</a>) next door at Number 8.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookside.html" title="Edit section: The End">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The End</span></h2>
<p>By 2002, the show had become a less important part of Channel 4's programming, and ratings dropped to below 1.5 million. The addition of the unpopular Gordon/Smith family early in the year did nothing to halt the ratings decline. Often, <i>Brookside</i> would be shunted around the schedule to make place for other shows, or broadcast late at night. Consequently, it was announced that <i>Brookside</i> would no longer be aired during its weeknight prime-time slots but would continue in its traditional Saturday evening omnibus edition. Sadly, this news coincided with the 20th Anniversary of <i>Brookside</i>, and it was something of a blow considering the programme was celebrating its Birthday on-screen with a new look (a post-production film-effect was added), a new title sequence, updated theme tune and a spectacular, multi-episode story arc that began with drug-laden armed robbers speeding onto the Close, hotly pursued by Police. They end up cornered in the cul-de-sac and took many residents hostage in their homes in highly dramatic scenes which led to a number of complaints from viewers. The scenes of three teenagers being violently terrorised, Steve Murray getting shot and dumped outside the front door of No 9, Nikki Shadwick almost being raped for a second time, Emily O'Leary falling to her death from an upstairs window, blatant drug abuse, offensive, strong language and a realistic portrayal of a deranged, drug addicted bank robber called 'Psycho' Gibson by Greg Milburn, all garnered complaints. Many scenes were considered unsuitable for pre-watershed viewing and, in particular, during the Saturday evening omnibus, broadcast from 4.30pm.<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/complaints_reports/programme_complaints/show_complaint.asp-prog_complaint_id=589.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/complaints_reports/programme_complaints/show_complaint.asp-prog_complaint_id=589.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The siege culminated the following week in a dramatic stunt involving a police helicopter being gunned down by Psycho Gibson and crashing onto the <i>Brookside Parade</i> car park, killing Diane Murray (<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Nolan_edd9.html" title="Bernie Nolan">Bernie Nolan</a>). It was the most spectacular scene in the history of <i>Brookside</i>, but it would also end up being its last... Following these well executed, costly but ultimately futile sequences, the soap transferred to the 'graveyard' Saturday afternoon slot 4.30pm, and the programme was once again retooled to fit the new 90 minute slot. Storylines now revolved around only a handful of characters, often in just one location, giving the programme a slow and claustrophic pace. This approach to episodes was heavily criticised by fans.</p>
<p>Due to contractual obligations, Channel 4 was committed to <i>Brookside</i> until November 2003, its 21st Anniversary. During the final 12 months, there was an eerie, deserted feel to the previously high-octane soap. Characters slowly drifted away, often with little or no explanation, <i>Brookside Parade</i> was virtually forgotten, many experimental storylines fell flat and only die-hard fans were still watching. A fitting final storyline, introduced 8 weeks before the last episode, saw the eponymous Brookside Close being emptied before demolition for the construction of a waste incinerator. Channel 4 then moved <i>Brookside</i> to what would become its final timeslot, on Tuesdays in a 90 minute format, usually at 11pm. Taking full advantage of the late-night slot, the foul language frequented in early episodes was back; '<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>' was now scripted regularly, as was unmotivated violence and drug abuse could now be seen in abundance, but this did nothing to improve ratings, having now fallen well below 700,000. During the final 6 weeks, a rawness and energy previously captured in the early years made a surprising return with a new character, the despised drug-dealer Jack Michaelson (Paul Duckworth), who moved into Number 8, becoming the focus of the end of <i>Brookside</i> as all the remaining residents found themselves affected by his destructive presence.</p>
<p>In the extended final episode, screened from 10.30pm and divided into three distinctive parts, <i>Brookside</i> shocked the audience one last time with the remaining residents of Brookside Close taking a stance against Michaelson, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynch.html" title="Lynch">lynching</a> him from Number 8's bedroom window. Then, Phil Redmond, clearly gutted by the cancellation of <i>Brookside</i>, had his final say in a rebellious scripted rant about how â€˜TV and societyâ€™s not like it wasâ€™, fittingly voiced by <i>Brooksideâ€™s</i> longest-running character, Jimmy Corkhill, who was also the last resident of Brookside Close to leave their house. As a last act of defiance he broke into the houses and left all the taps running and then painted <i>Game Over</i> on the boarded-up windows of several houses and drew an extra <i>D</i> on the <i>Brookside Close</i> sign, to spell <i>Brookside Closed</i> at the end of the episode.

<p>When it was announced that the show would be finishing as a continuing series, on <i>Brookside's</i> Official Website, there was suggestion by Phil Redmond that <i>Brookside</i> would continue with a succession of DVD releases. In fact, as early as 1988, Hilary Kingsley interviewed Redmond for her book, <i>Soap Box</i>, and even then, Redmond suggested that if <i>Brookside</i> were to end on Channel 4, he would attempt to continue the show off-screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Redmond has even suggested the end of <i>Brookside</i> in that way - fittingly inspired and unusual. "Perhaps we will watch a character leave and follow him or her. <i>Brookside</i> will continue with its daily life, but not on-screen anymore," he mused." (Page 49)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first DVD after the final episode featured the climax to a long running storyline involving <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_O%27Leary_e6de.html" title="Tim O'Leary">Tim "Tinhead" O'Leary</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Murray_%28Brookside%29_7ba4.html" title="Steve Murray (Brookside)">Steve Murray</a> finally getting revenge on Psycho Gibson in an 85 minute feature called <i>Unfinished Business</i>. Psycho killed Tim's wife Emily during the November 2002 siege, and Steve's step-Mother, Diane (Bernie Nolan), died in the subsequent helicopter crash on <i>Brookside Parade</i>. The DVD was released in November 2003, and there was meant to be a follow-up release involving a storyline with <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Grant_45ed.html" title="Barry Grant">Barry Grant</a> tracking down his brother Damon's killers, another story arc that began during <i>Brookside</i>s final episode on Channel 4. A trailer for the DVD called <i>Settlin' Up</i> was filmed and included on the <i>Unfinished Business</i> DVD, along with a promo for an Anniversary documentary called <i>Brookside: 100 of the Best</i>. However, with the sale of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mersey_Television_19ff.html" title="Mersey Television">Mersey Television</a> in 2005, and the sale of Brookside Close the same year <a href="http://www.merrymedia.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=193&amp;Itemid=63" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merrymedia.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=193&amp;Itemid=63" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, it is highly unlikely that any further DVDs will be released, and whilst recognising the existence of the documentary, Channel 4 say they have no plans to screen it in the future.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookside.html" title="Edit section: Brookside Close">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brookside Close</span></h2>
<p>The houses used as locations for the show are still in existence. When <i>Brookside</i> was removed from prime-time Channel 4, Mersey TV immediately started using some of the houses on Brookside Close in its other soaps <i>Hollyoaks</i> and <i>Grange Hill</i>. In <i>Hollyoaks</i>, the Dean family moved into what was Number 7, and the Burton-Taylor family moved into what was Number 8 Brookside Close. On-screen, the two identical houses had their exteriors cladded in a mock-Tudor wood effect, net curtains covered the windows, and there were rarely exterior long-shots, but eagle-eyed viewers frequently spotted familiar sights and props that gave the game away. It is also well known that the Cunningham's house in <i>Hollyoaks</i> was situated on Brookside Close, but the house was never used as a set in <i>Brookside</i>. In children's soap <i>Grange Hill</i>, Number 5's interior was used as the home to the character Carl Fenton although curiously, the exterior was a carefully chosen house that matched the inside situated elsewhere. The public bar in <i>Brookside</i> which resided on <i>Brookside Parade</i> is now used as the Student Union bar in <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></i> and the opposite side of the <i>Parade</i> can now be seen in <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grange_Hill_%28TV_series%29_3ea7.html" title="Grange Hill (TV series)">Grange Hill</a></i> as the School entrance.</p>
<p>Brookside Close was eventually sold off in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to a developer who then stripped, gutted and effectively rebuilt the entire interior of each of the 13 houses before making them available for sale to the public in January 2007. Of the houses on Brookside Close (that were used as sets), Numbers 7 and 8 were the cheapest at Â£199,000, while the famous Number 10 was For Sale at Â£295,000 according to the Off Plan Investments particulars, who are selling the houses. As of March 2007, the Houses remain empty and unsold.</p>

Similar to Number 7, part of the dividing wall between the Kitchen and Living Room was removed, bringing more natural light into the set. The house also had a new, stylish fitted Kitchen and was lavishly decorated to suit the Farnham's more up-market tastes. This house was also used as a set in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a>, even when</i> Brookside <i>was still in Production, and there was little attempt to disguise the distinctive yellow decor, Kitchen and new floor-plan.

</ul>
<p>In the book, <i>Phil Redmond's 20 Years of Brookside</i>, there is detailed information about the rest of the houses in Brookside Close and what they were used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The large house to the right of Number 5, seen regularly in early <i>Brookside</i> title-sequences (before the shrubs grew and disguised it!), was actually the Mersey Television canteen! The particulars detailing the sale of the property (no longer Online) showed a large, PVC Conservatory at the back of the house. Very similar to Number 5, this house has 4 bedrooms and a built-in Garage and would have been Number 4 Brookside Close had it been used in on-screen storylines.</li>
<li>The three terraced properties (with the upper exteriors rendered pastel blue) were used as Post Production and Wardrobe. The ground floor interior walls dividing the three houses were removed, creating a large open space. These houses were numbered 1 to 3 Brookside Close on-screen. The Production Gallery was situated on the first floor of Number 1, over-looking the access road into the set of the Close. The houses have now been restored to the original design.</li>
<li>To the left of Number 10 is a cluster of three semi-detached properties that were easy to see during earlier episodes. These houses were initially used as the Mersey Television Administration block, although one property later became the set for the Cunningham family in <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></i> for several years. This house had a Conservatory added to its left side which was curiously identical to the one built at the back of Number 9 Brookside Close!</li>
<li>Altogether, Mersey Television owned 13 houses and several 1 bedroomed apartments in the area of West Derby, in reality simply called "Brookside". The actual set of the Close is situated at the end of "Brookside", and would be numbered 41 to 53, with the real Number 53 being Number 1 Brookside Close on-screen.</li>
<li>These houses on Brookside Close were only ever mentioned <i>twice</i> by characters in <i>Brookside</i> during the entire 21 years it was in production! In 1995, during a plot where the Close was <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarantined.html" title="Quarantined">quarantined</a> because of a mysterious virus, Jimmy Corkill mentioned a resident at 'Number 11' being particularly ill. In the final episodes during 2003, it was noted by Jimmy and the Murray's that the 'residents' of 1-4 had sold up to the incinerator firm "Cinerco" as they watched the four houses being boarded up, heralding the beginning of the end of Brookside Close.</li>
