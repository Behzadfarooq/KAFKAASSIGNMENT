<h2><span class="mw-headline">New NASCAR driver infobox</span></h2>
<p>I like the new infobox you've created; it's nice to have one template we can use for all three major series. I do have a few questions, though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Should we add stats for Busch and Truck to every single Cup driver, even if they only ran a few races in Busch or Truck? I point you to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Martin_%28NASCAR%29_f114.html" title="Mark Martin (NASCAR)">Mark Martin</a> article, where since he is well-established in Busch and (supposedly) moving to Truck, I've put all three. The infobox is absolutely huge, and I don't think that we should put every single stat in there.</dd>
<dd>2. Would it be possible to add IROC stats for NASCAR drivers to this box, or is that something we should save for an (as-yet undeveloped) IROC infobox?</dd>
<dd>3. How are we going to do the templates for drivers like <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Pablo_Montoya_4f33.html" title="Juan Pablo Montoya">Juan Pablo Montoya</a>, who are well-established in F1 (or another series) and are moving to Cup? Should we just add the Cup template before/after the F1 template, or should we create some sort of combination template in conjunction with WikiProject Formula One and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_IROC_5a1a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject IROC">WikiProject IROC</a>?</dd>
<dd>4. Should we add stats for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Tire_Series_16d0.html" title="Canadian Tire Series">Canadian Tire Series</a> to this infobox?</dd>
<dd>5. Dumb question: Is there an easier way to do a numbered list than the way I'm doing this? &#160;:p</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, kudos for creating the new infobox! -- <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiegoTehMexican_cad6.html" title="User:DiegoTehMexican">DiegoTehMexican</a> 03:35, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First off, thanks. Appreciate the comments, and good questions, all of them. In response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I think we should add stats for all three. It has been determinied that even one start in any Premeire series is notable, and once a driver retires, the X races in Y years line should speak for itself.</li>
<li>I was thinking about the same thing myself, but hadn't decided how to format said stats. (Top ten means nothing, as well as first/last race doesn't mean as much...) Probably a better place to bring it up is in the IROC WP, but my opinion: Yes.</li>
<li>That's an even better, albeit rarer question. I'm sure there are more, but I can only think on the one major crossover between NASCAR and F1, and only a few more IROC &lt;-&gt; F1 drivers. I think those should be handled on a case by case basis, with a decent discussion as to which series stats comes first. (I would not want to start anything even remotely saying "my racing series is better than yours" or the like.)</li>
<li>Is the Canadian Tire Series on the same professional level as NEXTEL Cup? If so, then we should probably consider it. If not, then probably not.</li>
<li>See the source code for my reply.&#160;:)</li>

<p>I suppose I should've said something about this before I started making changes - the Previous Year variable needs to be different for each series - many drivers don't run in the same series year after year, and it would makes the previous position variable incorrect. -- <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiegoTehMexican_cad6.html" title="User:DiegoTehMexican">DiegoTehMexican</a> 15:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, good point. I was thinking that only if the driver competed in the previous year should it be used, thereby removing the need for multiple variables. However, in the interest of open mindedness, and to not messup the currently used versions, I have made a quick fix. The way it is now (02:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)) setup, prev_SERIES_year will be seperate years if explicitly called. If not, it will default to the "Previous_Year" value. (If both not present, but one of the prev_SERIES_pos is, then we're in trouble.) -<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowpokeiv_b6b5.html" title="User:Slowpokeiv">slowpokeiv</a> 02:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently, there is no official policy regarding the blanking of talk pages. While removing warnings is generally discouraged, it's not strictly forbidden. In this case, the user was just removing some advice that he clearly had read.

<dd>Don't worry, <i>lots</i> of people have that idea. And consensus hasn't been reached--some users think that you should never blank the talk page, some think that a certain period of time should pass first, some people think that users should be able to do whatever the heck they want with it. So you're not alone! Typically, I think that it's okay as long as a person isn't removing warnings to get away with vandalism or replacing warnings with personal attacks and the like.

<p>I don't see why my edits to "Port Chester" were considered vandalism- I was only trying to improve the article by adding a little information about the town's economy. I was not saying anything bad about anyone, all the information was relevant. Nothing was offensive or inappropriate. Why was it deleted and a vandalism warning issued? If you read the page for my IP address, you will see that this IP address is used for all the computers at my school- the other articles that were vandalized were not done by me. Our school is currently addressing the problem and hopefully the vandals will be stopped.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speedy deletions</span></h2>
<p>Diego, I see you are a prolific new page patroller -- good job! However, I would ask you to slow down a bit. Some of your speedy-deletion tagging seems to be a little imprecise. A few examples from today: <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interrupted_gene.html" title="Interrupted gene">Interrupted gene</a> -- valid article, no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Nagel_c40d.html" title="Stuart Nagel">Stuart Nagel</a> - may be not notable enough for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but should not be speedied; use AFD. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Shreveport_f186.html" title="Politics of Shreveport">Politics of Shreveport</a> - valid article (possible merge candidate though). <a href="../../../a/r/e/Aref_ensemble.html" title="Aref ensemble">Aref ensemble</a> - may be notable (I've bumped this to AFD). Some of the articles you tagged I redirected in lieu of deletion. Also, in many of these cases you tagged an article with "no context" or other before the author had a chance to complete the article (most newbies tend to compose articles piecemeal, without using the Preview button). One concrete suggestion I have is to patrol the <i>bottom</i> of the New Pages list, rather than the top, to allow some time to finish editing. Just reviewing your contributions I see <i>many</i> contributions with the edit summary "tag for speedy deletion", indicating that these articles were <i>not</i> speedy deleted despite your tag. There are probably many articles properly tagged&amp;deleted that aren't easily seen in your Contributions, but I wonder how many valid articles were improperly deleted! <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-10 21:11Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>Thanks for the revert on my talk page; that was a quick one.<br />
About the comment you left on my page earlier - I was getting overzealous with the speedy deletion tags. However, I think that today was the exception rather than the rule; there seemed to be a higher percentage of iffy articles than normal. I've gotten used to over half of the new pages being nonsense pages, as was the case recently. I need to get out of that mindset. — <b><a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrotherFlounder_8c94.html" title="User:BrotherFlounder"><font color="#000080">Brother</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrotherFlounder_908a.html" title="User talk:BrotherFlounder"><font color="#DAA520">Flounder</font></a></b> <small>(aka DiegoTehMexican)</small> 04:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
