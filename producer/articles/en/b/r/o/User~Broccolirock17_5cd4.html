                             Strive to die
                            By: Brock Perles

<pre>
                              Introduction
</pre>
<p>Serial Killer. The words that describe all of the beforehand occurrences that lead to the unpredictable outcome, of death. That’s how it all starts, and that’s how it finishes…</p>
<p>Riverside was a generally peaceful place. It was in a secure, wooded area, not too far from any mall or store that you’d desire to go to. It had many, good, career opportunities and along with that, a phenomenal education system. They had a public school and a private academy. The more wealthy students attended the private school though, which was called Riverside Academy. Yet, most children didn’t want to be stereotyped as preps, so a lot of them would just go to the public school. As an added bonus, the public school was actually in the town, but the academy was about an hours drive, beyond the town limit, in the woods. It was still a better school though, just because it was farther away, doesn’t make it’s reputation sink any lower. Many of the attending teenagers, actually enjoyed wearing the dark blue and black plaid uniform, with the schools logo on the face of it. Others wanted to wear normal clothing, because they hated the uniform, but that’s their own opinion. Many of the dorm rooms were full of rambunctious, fun-loving, and talented older teenagers, who studied hard for tests and quizzes. Also almost everyone took an hour of studying time at the end of the day, to reminisce about it and what they learned. There unfortunately, were many feuds, and somewhat a lot of fighting. The teachers were nice though, so that made life on campus much more enjoyable…</p>
<p>“Help me!” a girl screamed, “someone help… me!” This girl was named Melissa Carper. She was a young woman, eighteen years old, and she was screaming, crying, and begging for help. It was nearing nighttime, and she was running for her life, on the campus grounds. Someone, beforehand, had smacked her with a stick, causing her to go unconscious, but now had set her free, as a cruel twist of fate, she thought. She screamed as a flashlight whipped around her, the small beam moving back and forth, with every little movement of her captor. Melissa knew that no one, not even any faculty members stayed over the weekend, so she was dead out of luck. As she turned a corner of the school, she found herself face to face with the woods, maybe her only chance at survival. As she sprinted into them, she saw the beam go in front of her, and the hustle of her pursuer behind her. She whipped her gorgeous long, brown hair out of her eyes, trying to gain speed, but instead getting hit in the face with a tree branch and falling into a small pit, just larger than herself. As Melissa scampered to her feet, she realized she might be able to hide, so she knelt back down and whipped leaves all around her, covering her up. Her captor, stopped running, and flashed the flashlight around, but did not see anyone. The person walked forward stepping on a stick and breaking it, signaling to Melissa that he was right next to her. As he took a step in her direction, he stepped directly on her hand, and she silently yelped. As the person looked around, they took the long javelin they were holding and shoved it directly under them, firmly planting it into Melissa skull. She screamed, because there was nothing else she could’ve done and her captor began continuously stabbing at her, until she looked like insides turned out…</p>
<p>As the weekend came to an end, students rushed back into the academy with good cheer. Everyone was excited to see their friends, but not for any upcoming tests. Of course there was another reason. The reason only applied to seven of the hundreds of students there though. It was the game they had invented. Their own fake survival game, called, “Strive to live.” When it was exactly 12:00 at night, they would all sneak into the main lobby, draw the cards, and then the game began. The cards, of course had a significant value. Yellow cards, meant that you were a victim. The red cards however, meant that you were one, of the two serial killers, looking for victims. The two killers would count to fifty, sneak around afterwards, and mark the victims they had found. They did this with the two red markers that were left in the auditorium. The reason only seven people were able to play, was that inside the auditorium, only seven doors had been built on. When they were all in the right place, they would exit their door and roam anywhere on school grounds, but the two serial killers, would remain behind, after opening their door, and count. After that process, they would try and trick their friends by lying, stalking, and eventually chasing them so that they could use any forceful way to somehow mark them. Once marked, they were to return to the auditorium, a loser. If any one of the victims, stayed “alive” until 2:00, they would win all of the money people had betted. If the two killers won, they’d split the money equally. The seven students that’d play the game, were obviously unique. Tom Powell, was definitely unique. He had many talents, along with his artistic abilities, and also had a knack for having a bit too much pride. He had thick, brown, messy hair and sparkling blue eyes. He was good at trickery and used that to his advantage. He also was extremely nice and fully trustworthy, when he wasn’t playing the game… Another one of these unique people, was Chelsea Hoffman. She had sharp wit, and a knack for her overpowering intelligence. She wasn’t nerdy in the least of ways. She was like Tom, extremely popular, nice, yet she was a terrible liar. Every time she lied, she usually laughed, making it slightly obviously that she was a liar. She had radiant blue eyes, along with silky strands of orange hair. Her worst quality, was her inexcusable ability to gossip so much, her friends often got mad at her. She also tried to tell the truth whenever she could. Of course, she also had her secrets… Next, would have to be, Brock Wester. He was an intelligent, knowledgeable young man, with blonde hair and blue eyes. His hair was really brown, he had dyed it earlier in his life. He had a talent for writing stories, and he aspired to be a famous author. His writings were sometimes creepy, scary, and just plain awkward, but he gained his friends support almost instantly. He wasn’t that great of a liar, but he was fairly good at accusing. He often accused other people of things he’d done, then they’d get into trouble, and when he came out clean, people resented him. He had many friends though. The thing his friends didn’t like about him, was that he was an academic overachiever, and he usually ignored them, for studies. Maybe there was a good reason for this, behavior... A good friend to them all was, Troy Brady. He had blondish, brownish hair, with pink highlights. He was very nice, but sometimes, hated everyone around him. Let’s just say he was 50% mean and 50% nice. His main talents included driving well and always respecting his beautiful girlfriend, Melissa. He loved her and she loved him. Although the one thing about Troy, that seemed to be a mystery to everyone, was why he secluded himself for hours at a time in his room. Maybe he his secrets were to horrifying to tell… Madison Predock was an interesting girl. She always made sure before classes that her outfit was all black and that her nails were painted black, as well. She was extremely intelligent, and her friends never judged her, or even made fun of her once for being a Goth. In addition to her friends being nice to her, she had gorgeous jet black hair, and dark brown eyes, which everyone loved. She was almost the perfect girl, leaving out her crabby and emotional attitude and horrid personality. She thought nobody could understand her, but there might be one person that could… Another one of their interesting, and uniquely acting friends was, Brittany Hans. This girl, had curly, brownish red hair, and glasses. She often was the most immature one of the group, and the most party-going. She liked to have fun though, especially when she was a serial killer in the game. One of her many talents was her ability to deceive. She was good at intentionally tricking or misleading anybody to do her bidding. She also was the one to mention to the group when the game nights should be, so that they all could see if they were free. Is it possible to be the most immature, yet the most well organized? Finally, the last of the group was the most beautiful. Ellie Evian, was a charming, lovey-dovey girl. She enjoyed making out in public with anyone, and her reputation wasn’t the greatest for dating. She was once dating three guys at once, and she lost most people’s trust, within that day. She had silky brown hair, with hazel eyes, and was extremely smart, but didn’t like showing it. Her biggest problem was a trust issue. But nobody knew the truth about her… Seven kids, all in their senior year at Riverside Academy, having a fun time, yet staying safe. Unfortunately, it had started with eight kids. With Melissa dead, and nobody aware of it, horrors were lurking behind every corner…</p>
<p>Part I</p>
<p>As the bell rang on Monday morning, signaling the starting of classes, Chelsea rushed down the hallway, looking for her friends. Today they were going to skip and go to Toms dorm room, to plan out the game that was later that night. As she rounded a corner, she slammed directly into a student and was forcefully knocked to the ground, along with her books. She scampered to her feet and looked at the person she had hit. It was Lacey Strausser, a popular, more snobbish girl, with thick, long, blonde hair. She scolded Chelsea and got to her feet. “Listen, next time, watch where you’re going, okay?” she barked. “I’m sorry,” Chelsea muttered under her breath, in a sarcastic tone. Lacey stormed away and rolled her eyes. As Chelsea gathered up her books, she hustled down two more hallways, until finally, she found Brock and Tom, talking with an upset Troy. He looked like he was in a state of depression. Tom looked over at her, smiled, and then walked up to her anxiously. “My dorm room, hurry, everyone’s already there,” Tom said seriously, “Troy’s upset that Melissa never showed today, that’s it.” Chelsea looked at Brock as he and Troy walked behind them, as the second bell rang. “This is for the game right,” Brock asked, “I really didn’t want to skip-” “Well then go back to class already,” Tom interrupted rudely. Chelsea nudged him viscously and he looked down at her. “Why are you being so…” she said thinking for a moment, “mean?” “He’s into his classes more than he is, us,” Tom said to her impatiently. Chelsea looked back at Brock, who quickly looked away. She could tell when Brock was upset with something and today was one of those days. He just seemed so blatantly angry. “Are you okay,” Chelsea asked, as she approached him and Troy went ahead to talk to Tom. Brock looked at Chelsea for a second, pausing before he spoke. “I’m just peachy,” he muttered, “and can you tell me why Tom has to always be like that. Honestly, he only hates me!” “Tom doesn’t hate you, he only gets mad, because you always care more about your classes than you do-” Chelsea explained until being interrupted. “Him! He’s extremely conceited!” Brock yelled out loud, making Troy and Tom, stop dead in their tracks. A moment of silence came upon them all, as Tom turned around angrily facing Brock. “You think I’m conceited?” he asked with a fury in his eyes. “No…no…Tom, no… I don’t,” Brock stuttered as he backed away slowly. Tom lunged forward and seized his shirt collar, viscously. He had a firm grip now. “Tom, stop it!” Chelsea yelled at him. Tom smiled. “Yeah, that’s what I thought,“ he said to Brock in a whisper. With that, he let go of him and stormed ahead of them all. “Let’s hurry up now.” As Tom moved at a quicker pace, the second bell rang, just as they reached his dorm room, and entered.</p>
<p>Noisy, was one way to describe the room. Of course, tidy, clean, and fresh, were more descriptions for it. Chelsea looked around at everyone, smiles bubbling to her lips. She smiled at all of her friends, and it looked like, two others had skipped class to join the game. One of them was, Brianne Burkland, an artistic, and fun-loving person. Brie, as they called her, had long, flowing, blondish brown hair, and blue dazzling spectacles for eyes. She had been dating Tom, for about a year, until they broke up and became friends. They still fought a lot, but a friendship isn’t always perfect. The other person was Andy Williams, a sporty guy, who played football and ran for track. Also he enjoyed flirting with his girlfriend, Lacey. Him and her were both equal on the snobbish scale. They usually all got along though. Brock sat next to Brittany and Brie. He quickly began to talk away, as Tom sat next to Chelsea and Madison. There were nine people in the room right now. Chelsea, Tom, Brock, Brittany, Brie, Andy, Madison, Troy, and Ellie. They all talked for a near thirty minutes, until Madison began the meeting. “Okay everyone, that’s enough chit-chat,” Madison yelled over them, “you all know why we’re here, I’m assuming…” “Yep. You assumed right,” Tom said out loud. Brie kissed him on the lips and he kissed her back. Brock looked away quickly and then over at Madison. “Okay, enough with the PDA,” Madison replied, “ you all already know how to play the game, right?” Everyone shook their heads quickly, and stared at Madison. “I was thinking of a few ways we could…adjust the game, to make it more interesting.” As Madison smiled, she explained that there should be a set up, or a costume for the killers, to make it more interesting. “No way.” Brock clearly stated out loud, “ I like that you don’t know if one of your friends is it or not, they could be lying to you, that’s what I like about this game.” “Fine, anyone have any other ideas,” Madison said in a tone of annoyance, obviously because she was rejected, rather speedily. “How about, we can only stay in one spot,” Ellie said confidently. “So that they can get us right away, good idea, moron.” Brittany replied, “I think we should all get to roam the school grounds, anywhere… we please.” “I second that,” Brock added on, “instead of only using the school building, it’d be much scarier if we got to sneak outside.” “Scary isn’t good for me,” Chelsea said shyly, “ but if you want to do it that way, I’m in. Also, I thought if we could, maybe use something, more thrilling than a sharpie marker, to mark the victims, that’d be fun.” “You need to make your victims feel like victims, make them go unconscious, rough them up a bit,” Tom muttered selfishly, while kissing Brie yet again. “What if the serial killers are both guys?” Chelsea asked, “you would actually knock me down, and brutally harass me until I went unconscious, maybe suffered from a coma, and died?” Tom shook his head, yes, and an uproar of laughter filled the dorm room. Chelsea looked over at Brock and smiled. “How about, we use a weapon to do that,” Ellie asked, “ a stick or something?” “I really don’t enjoy being pummeled by large sticks,” Brittany laughed, as did Ellie, “maybe we could use something less intense…” Madison started to think really hard, until finally she blurted out an idea everyone hopefully would agree on. “How about we let the serial killers decide, “she said, “I mean, they could probably come up with something good enough to use…” “I don’t know,” Tom said, “if I’m a serial killer, I would use a knife, to make it seem scary, but I wouldn’t want to cut any of you…” He looked over at Brock and smiled. “Well I thought it was a good idea, maybe we could all sign some injury paper or something, saying that we don’t care?” Troy asked. “Well okay, here, I’ll get some paper,” Brie said pulling a clear sheet of lined paper from her pink, knapsack. She quickly wrote a document saying that you can only play if you agree that you don’t care if you get hurt. She signed and passed it around, until everyone had signed it and it was finally official. “Well, that only took two periods, should we go back to class?” Ellie asked. “What are we going to tell them, we all got sick, but now we all miraculously feel better?” Brock asked them all, as Tom stood up stretching, and replied. “What, we all slept in… remember…” Tom said with a smile, as he grabbed his books and walked slowly out of the room, everyone following him out the exit…</p>
<p>About a half a mile away from the school, was an old, rotted, wooden cabin. Inside this old, hidden cabin, was many barrels of innards, blood, guts, and body parts. The person who owned this cabin, had been slaughtered, for a murderer’s pleasure. Their body parts had been shoved in with all of the rest. Spare eyeballs, hearts, and livers were in filthy jars, with bloodstains on them. It was a horrific sight indeed. Aside from the objects inside the cabin, a human was slouched over, on a rotted, broken chair, tied up and screaming. She had been tied up two days ago, without food or water, and she was getting so skinny, her ribs began to show. The door swung open, and broke off it’s hinges, causing her to scream. The girl scampered around, trying to escape, but was impaled with a javelin, right in the throat. Her body movements stopped, as she finally ceased twitching, and her killer began tearing her apart…</p>
<p>Brock hurried along in the hallway, trying to get to his next class period, before the bell rang for the second time. As he turned a corner, he spotted Chelsea entering his AP Chemistry class, so he hurried along even faster. As he got to the room, he realized Chelsea was the only one in there. “Hey, uh… where is everyone,” Brock asked her quickly. “Thank god you showed up,” she blurted out, “there’s an assembly about safety crap, and we are so busted.” Brock looked up at the clock, which read 10:13. “Why are we busted?” Brock asked. “Everyone was supposed to go, even if you were sick…” Chelsea said approaching him, “let’s go now, we can hide until it’s over… at 11:00.” Chelsea seized his hand and pulled him through the door, out into the open. As they advanced down a hallway, a teacher darted out, and they jumped behind a statue, that symbolized the school and it’s glory. The teacher, Mr. Barnes, quickly went past them, and they jumped out again, this time, Chelsea dropped one of her homework papers. The gym teacher was now coming so they needed to hide behind the statue yet again. Chelsea watched as the gym teacher strolled on down, looked at the paper, bent over, picked it up, and crumbled it. He began in the opposite direction. “That was my math homework, I need that!” she yelled at Brock, “come on, let’s follow him, wherever he goes, that took me all freaking night to do!” Brock and Chelsea followed the teacher, until he dropped it in a waste basket inside the auditorium, where the assembly took place. “What lame ass teacher, would take it all the way to the auditorium,” Brock asked out of anger. As they got a good look around, they saw nobody coming, so they darted towards the doors. “Apparently, him.” Chelsea quickly replied as she snuck inside quickly. A police officer was speaking very loudly, as Chelsea stuck her hand in the trash can, and pulled out the paper. She wrinkled her face in disgust. “Let’s get-” but she was interrupted quickly by the officer. He stared up at them both for a moment before yelling to them, in a rasp voice. “You two, in the way back,” he yelled, as everyone turned and stared at them both, “come up on stage for a moment...” As Chelsea flushed, Brock stared at all of the eyes that were on him right now. He could see all of his friends in the way back now, laughing to themselves, for Brock and Chelsea’s stupidity. They managed to get up on stage just as the officer began to talk again, in his low raspy voice. “Chelsea…I don’t like this…” Brock whispered to her silently. “These two students, probably decided to skip the assembly, for fun, a show of hands, do you think they’d survive in the woods for a day?” he grumbled. About ten people, counting their friends raised their hands, for the fun of it. The officer struck Brock in the stomach and knocked him off stage onto the floor. “You see, he would’ve been prepared for that, if he’d been here, but he wasn’t because he didn’t come.” “How can he do that, that’s abuse!” Chelsea roared as Brock got up slowly. “The same way, I can do this,” the officer yelled grabbing her hair and kneeing her stomach violently, then throwing her off the stage into Brock. She screamed as she crashed into him, and they both tumbled to the floor. “That’s enough Sergeant Riley,” the principal, Mrs.Elleta said as she got up from her seat. She was aged with knowledge and experience. “I’m just teaching these misbehavers a lesson, ma’am,” the Sergeant explained, rather ignorantly. She gave him a stern look. “Not like that, you’re not,“ she said angrily, “all students are excused to their third period classes’ end , while I have a chat with, Mr. Riley…” Everyone jumped out of their seats eagerly and scurried off, an uproar of chatter.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was boring and extremely dull. The daylight had vanished and brought darkness all around. As Brock looked over at the clock in his dorm room, he noticed it was time for the game, 12:00. He walked over to the door and slowly opened it, eager to play the game. He was full of enthusiasm for this, it was finally here. As he stepped out into the darkness of the hallway, he saw a flashlight whip around on the stairwell. He paused, noticing that it was Tom. “You coming Brock?” he yelled silently, if that made any sense whatsoever. Brock nodded and ran over to him, dashing past posters on the walls and statues on the floors. Tom shone the flashlight directly at his face, causing Brock to stop. “Do you mind?” Brock asked, putting up his arm to block the light. “Not really, we need to hurry up,” Tom barked as he slipped away into the darkness of the stairwell. “What was with you and Brie today, at the meeting,” Brock asked out of the blue, “why were you kissing her so much, I thought you guys were over?” “Things happen okay,” Tom muttered, obviously self-consciously. As they hurried down the stairs, Tom made a turn into a new hallway at the bottom. Brock and him were traveling for about five minutes before they reached the auditorium doors, noticing Chelsea standing outside of them and waiting. “Brock, Tom,” she stuttered, “finally you show up.” Tom smiled as he opened the door and entered, leaving Brock alone with Chelsea, in the dark. “Uh… what’s up?” Brock asked nervously, while blushing. Chelsea leaned forward and pecked his cheek, causing a chill, a good chill, to be sent straight down his spine. She smiled wildly and opened the door for him. “Thanks…” he stuttered, “for everything…” Brock slowly started forward. “It was my pleasure,” she announced as they both crept into the auditorium, to find it lit with flashlights and with noises from people talking to making out. “The love couple finally join us…” Madison announced with a broad smile. “Okay, can we start now, I’m getting sleepy already,” Brittany said while yawning, as Chelsea and Brock finally to their seats. “At least we don’t have to go over any rules, just pull a card everyone,” Madison announced as people started quickly shoving their hands into a dark black container. One by one, the slips of paper disappeared, until they were all gone. “This is going to rock!” Brie said with a perky smile. “Is that because you’re a serial killer?” Brittany asked awkwardly. “Shut it Brittany,” Brie yelled at her. “Let’s not start accusing yet, everyone to your doors, pronto,” Madison yelled. As everyone continued to their doors, they noticed they were two doors short. “Hey, Andy and Brie, there should be a couple doors to the stage, go out that way,” Tom explained to them as they nodded their heads and vanished around the big, black curtain. Finally it was beginning and nobody knew what they were yet. “On your marks, get set…go!” Madison yelled signaling the beginning of Strive to Survive, the game. As everyone exited, they opened their sheet of paper. “Victim… damn,” Brittany said after reading her slip of paper. “At least I’m innocent,” Madison commented to herself, for she was a victim as well. Chelsea read hers in disappointment as well. Troy was a victim too. “Serial…killer…” Tom said with a smile, “I like.” He pulled out the knife in his pocket and watched it shimmer in the moonlight. He turned around and walked back in, to see who the other killer was. He saw a door start to open, right as he went in. “You’re a killer too,” Ellie said with a hint of passion, “a good guy, turned bad…” “Shit!” Brock muttered, “a stinking victim…” The victims were, Brock, Chelsea, Troy, Brittany, Brie, Madison, and Andy. The two killers as you know, were Tom and Ellie. Hopefully nobody would get to injured… It had been about twelve minutes already and Troy had made a hasty retreat away from everyone. He ran through a hallway and into his study hall class. As he panted he sat down, tired and beat. Tom and Ellie decided to split up, trying to deceive first, using Tom’s budding love for Brie as a strong point. He quickly found her, smiling as she sighed with relief. “You’re not a killer are you?” she asked smiling. “You tell me?” he said pulling his knife from his pocket, and pointing it at her. “Holy shit, get away from me now!” she yelled as he lunged forward and stabbed her arm, blood spilling to the ground. She howled in pain. “What the hell was the for!” He showed her no mercy, as he grabbed her hair and tossed her back against a wall, watching her pass out slowly on the floor, at his feet. “Game over… sweetie,” Tom said lively, as she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Brock had found Brittany already and they just located Chelsea. She looked at them, smiling at Brock and walked over to them both, leisurely. “I’m not a killer…” she sighed, “I bet you Madison is one though… she could’ve planned to be a killer in the first place.” Brittany stared at Chelsea intently. “Or you could be a killer, I mean… we never know,” Brittany replied accusingly. “Trust me, if I were a killer, I wouldn’t have openly walked near you guys like am I now, I have strategy when I’m one, and I don’t just approach,” Chelsea explained, quickly on the defensive side. Brock gave her a big, bold smile, as she neared him. “I believe you,” he said willingly, as Brittany sighed. “Whatever, you can join us Chelsea,” she said hastily, “but keep a lookout for anyone else, okay, tonight is one of those nights when defeat isn’t taken lightly for me.” As Chelsea gave her a quick, unjust smile, a blur flashed behind them, with a crowbar at hand. Ellie walked out from the shadows, with a seemingly suspicious look on her face. As she looked from one to another, her eyes stopped on Chelsea. “I guess I blew my cover,” she said non-sympathetically, “oh well, tonight I don’t have to be so quiet.” She ran forward, darting quickly around Brittany and Brock. She pulled back the crowbar wildly, and jumped at Chelsea, who ducked. The crowbar hit the wall, chipping off a piece of it, as Chelsea dived to the floor. Ellie turned and swung downward, narrowly missing her yet again. Brock watched as Chelsea jumped to her feet and sprinted at him. “Go! That way, now!” she yelled spiritedly, “hurry!” Ellie was angry now, as she launched another wild swing of her weapon and hit a statue, instead of Brock. “What happened to her,” Brock yelled to Brittany and Chelsea as they took off down an opposite hallway. Ellie chased after them, catching up to Brittany’s side, and taking another swing. This time she hit, and she hit hard. Brittany felt the pain explode on her stomach and hip, so she crumbled to the ground in panic. Brock watched as Chelsea came to a halt and he grabbed her arm, forcefully dragging her forward. “Just go!” Brittany yelled finally, as the crowbar met full force with the back of her head. She fell over, face first, and didn’t get back up. Ellie watched as Chelsea and Brock vanished around a corner, leaving her alone. Tears began to pour from both Chelsea and Brock’s eyes. Brock knew Brittany would need medical attention, but if he went back, he would need it also. Chelsea felt like she couldn’t go on anymore, for what had just happened. It made Ellie, the lovely, cute girl, seem immensely inhuman. “I hope… Brittany’s okay…” Chelsea said stuttering and sniffling. “Me…too,” Brock added on, in the same way. Footsteps began loudly echoing down the hall, and a panicked scream came from someone up ahead. Brock recognized it as Madison, as did Chelsea. “Who’s there!” Madison yelled in shock and panic, “who’s there!” “It’s us…” Brock said depressed as tears still fell from his eyes. Madison found them and stared at them innocently, with sweat and tears in her eyes too. “I just found… Brie,” she said, producing a sympathetic tear, “she was knocked out, blood everywhere, extremely sickening.” Chelsea began to cry more. “Who knocked… her out…” she said quietly. An image of Brie shot into her mind’s eye, and then one of Brittany, being beaten. “I don’t know… honestly…” she replied, “ but my honest guess… would be Troy. He seems like the most unseen and hidden, but at the same time, he could be stalking one of us… waiting for… an opportunity… to strike.” “He won’t find us,” Brock said comfortingly, “he won’t…” “How do you know?” Chelsea asked in a tone of uncertainty, “are you truly positive and mean everything to the fullest extent?” “I’m not 100% sure, but it’s a guess I’ll risk,” Brock said slowly, “now we need to find and warn, Tom and Andy.” “That won’t be necessary,” Tom replied devilishly from a corner of the hall, “I already know who the other killer is…” A bloody knife gleamed in his hand, causing Chelsea to turn away. Brock stared in awe. Madison was outraged. “I trusted you, we all did,” she roared, “we blamed Troy… and it was you… you piece of shit!” Tom laughed quickly, while glancing at them. “I don’t care, I’m in this to win, it’s a game,” he laughed, “you can get mad at me, you’re the one that made the injury list, so it’s not all my fault.” Brock watched as Chelsea turned around instinctively. Ellie was now behind them. “Tom, we have them surrounded, once we beat them, all we need to do is find Troy,” she said with a smile. Brock gasped at her. “What about Andy?” he asked her, as he looked around. “Let’s just say, He looks better without blood all over-” Ellie said but Brock had already punched her in her face viscously. She screamed as Chelsea kicked her shin, and Tom lunged forward seizing Madison arm. Ellie crashed to the floor, just as Madison got a knife in her back. A sharp, ear shattering scream protruded from her mouth, just as she was knocked out. Tom looked down at her, kicking her once. “You pig!” Chelsea roared, as Ellie slowly got to her feet. Ellie pulled back her crowbar, but Brock kicked her back against the wall, causing her to crash to the floor. Tom glared at him. “Why do you always do things to piss me off!” he yelled towering above Brock. Chelsea was screaming and crying, as Tom punched Brock in the face, and slashed his stomach. Brock got one last look at his girlfriend, before Tom planted his knee in Brock’s face. Brock crumbled to the ground, passing out, and leaving Chelsea alone in the hall. “Please…” she begged, “just…stop…” He spit on Brock’s limp body, outraging Chelsea into a frenzy. She punched his stomach, but it didn’t even phase him, so she took off, hoping to be able to make it to the nurse. As she rounded a corner, she fell because she tripped on a javelin, and she crashed onto her face, causing her last seconds of the game to be misery and agony…</p>
<p>Because the serious amount of trouble Tom and them would’ve been in. He decided to announce Troy the winner, only if he could help get all of their friends to the nurses office. They pretended someone attacked them, using the javelin as evidence of the crime. Not much damage was done, maybe to their self-esteem, but they would get over it. All of them managed to get into the nurse’s office safely, and the custodian cleaned up the blood that they’d lost. You would think that all of the victims, except Troy, would’ve been extremely pissed off, but none of them were. They all agreed that they had a lot of fun, but it was intense, and maybe they should tone it down a bit, the next time they played. As an added bonus, they got off for a day, because of their wounds. Everyone, except for Brock, Chelsea, and Troy, had already left the nurse’s office, to go back to their dorm rooms. Brock and Chelsea just wanted to play it safe, that’s the only reason for them not getting up and walking away. Troy on the other hand, had met the nurses part-time assistant, Lexus Cole. Lexus was a blunt, yet sophisticated young woman, who lacked efficiency skills in school, but could easily make up for that in bed. She also made sure she was clean and sanitary, keeping her love life separate from her school and work life. She always liked to see people get what they deserved. She also could use her looks to charm any guy she wanted. Her stunning dark brown eyes, with her succulent, extravagant, brown hair, made it possible for her to snatch up anyone. Oddly, she was after Troy. Is she in love, or just playing him? “Lexus, is it?” He asked sweetly, trying to get her attention. “Yes, you’re Troy right?” she replied, looking directly at him and setting her clipboard of patients aside. Troy nodded, as his face went red. “I was… wondering if… you and me…could possibly ever…” he stuttered, as she giggled at him. He thought of her as charming and when she smiled he felt heavenly. “Go out?” she finished, packed with enthusiasm. Troy flushed again, as Brock watched him from a chair in the corner. Chelsea was watching too, gossiping every little detail to Brock, even though he was seeing it for himself. “Sure, I think you’re very attractive.” Troy felt like passing out with joy. But a thought burned into his head, Melissa. She had disappeared though, nobody even knew where she was, why should Troy waste hours and hours thinking about her? “Chelsea, I’m going to get to lunch, okay?” Brock told her. “I’m coming too, I haven’t eaten in hours,” she replied, as her stomach rumbled. Brock and Chelsea slipped out of the office and hurried to the lunch line, before the bell rang and tons of kids rushed down to the cafeteria. “Sit by me, okay?” he asked her boldly. “Sure,” she said in reply, “I was going to anyway.” Chelsea looked at the menu and saw that today was a macaroni and cheese day. She happily grabbed a plate and let the lunch ladies pile on the food. After Brock and Chelsea had just sat down, the bell rang, signaling lunchtime to start. As Brock blatantly stared at the cafeteria doors, he saw many people enter. Which included some kids from his classes, a few teachers, Madison, Tom, Andy, Ellie, Brie, and Brittany. Brittany was actually the first one to sit next to them and they welcomed her to the tale. It didn’t matter though, because everyone was sitting there in a matter of seconds anyway. “I hope none of you are pissed at me too much,” Tom said to try and spark conversation, “I really didn’t mean to hurt you guys that much.” “Do you have any idea how much it hurts to have a knife impaled into your stinking arm?” Brie asked angrily, “a freaking lot, that’s for sure.” “What was with you and that crowbar Ellie,” Brittany asked out of anger, “You hit me a million times with it…” Tom and Ellie both looked away ashamed, as Brock took a good look at everyone sitting at the table. “Who was using that javelin?” Brock asked, “the one you guys turned in?” “I don’t know, that’s why we turned it in,” replied Tom. “It has to be someone’s…” Brock said, “where’s it now?” “Oh, uh…in the… science lab I’m pretty sure,” Tom told him, “with Mrs. Kreis.” Brock stared at Tom and then looked down at his food, thinking for a moment…</p>
<p>Mrs. Kreis was a fun teacher, and was good at any science problem you could think of. She assigned projects that were entertaining and she never liked when a student didn’t complete them. As she sat at her computer, typing, her door blew shut from the raging winds outside her open windows. She looked up for a second, seeing only the javelin pierce her face, killing her almost too quickly. Blood splattered onto her desk area, as she crashed onto the floor and the person who had done it to her, hauled her to the window, where he or she, dropped her out, into the garden of overrun weeds, were nobody would ever find her. In a rush, the killer seized a handful of paper towels and began cleaning up the evidence…</p>
<p>“I was just wondering…” Brock said to Tom, “thanks either way.” As All of the seven students finished up their lunches, they all advanced up a the stairs and to her room, where they found a container that was black, on her desk. The front read, “How far does your game really go” which made Chelsea quiver. Tom opened the lid and found slips of paper inside. He pulled one up, reading it out loud, as he opened it. “Nine, okay… that was interesting,” he said to them, pocketing his slip and letting Madison shove her hand the container next. She smiled as she read hers. “I got number one!” she said happily, “who else is going to draw one?” “I guess it won’t hurt…” Brock said with a smile, pulling out the number seven and laughing. Chelsea thought for a moment, then she drew one. She received the number eight, taking away the only really high numbers from the container. “Me next,” Andy said emptily, as he pulled one out, “darn, I got a three…” Ellie shoved her hand into the container and pulled out the number four. After her, Brie got a six, while Brittany received a five. The last number was Troy’s… a two. No one there, knew the purpose of the numbers, so it was all fun and games for them. They would have never came to the conclusion that they were drawing the order they were to die in, nor the consequences that came with their stupidity. For them, it was just the first day, of many horrible experiences that they were to endure…</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>About two days had passed since they first played the revised game. Nothing had happened to any of them, yet. Aside from there mid-term break, which had started this morning, for them. Tom decided to take half of their friends in his shiny, new, black mustang and Troy got to take the other half, in his bright red, Jaguar. Tom had picked Chelsea, Ellie, Andy, and oddly Brock to accompany him in his car. Troy had been so kind as to take Brittany, Brie, and Madison along with him, to the lake house they’d rented for two days. He had left Lexus, because she said she was going to see her family, but Troy couldn’t get Melissa out of his head anyway. As Tom hastily drove down a back road, he came to a quick halt, for someone was standing in the middle of it. It was a girl, with blonde hair, although you really couldn’t tell. She was drenched in what seemed like a downpour of blood. Her eyes were a dark blue color, but right now they were burning red. She looked like a zombie. “Holy hell!” Tom yelled, “who’s she?” Brock and Chelsea looked at her as she pulled a gun up, from her pocket. She leveled it out with Tom’s car and pulled the trigger. The bullet smashed through the windshield, narrowly missing Ellie, who was in the front seat. Everyone screamed, while Tom stepped on the gas pedal, and took a sharp turn around the girl. She turned to face them, as tears fell from her eyes. “You’re all going to die! Stop!” she screamed as she fired another shot at the car. This time, it smashed the side window. Chelsea screamed as the car jerked forward and sped on down the road. Brock felt nervous now. As he looked back at her, the girl pointed the gun at herself and shot, nearly blowing off her head. Her body slumped onto the ground, a bloody mess. Everybody was in panic. “Oh…my…god,” Ellie kept saying to herself, her eyes full of tears. “It’s alright guys, everyone’s okay, that’s good…” Tom said trying to hold in his craziness. He looked back at the girl and saw a man, dragging her into the woods. Tom told the others, but the man and girl had already disappeared around the bend. “I’m fine…I didn’t really want to see a scary guy anyway,” Chelsea said trying to keep her smile up. It lasted about three seconds and fell off her face. As Tom kept on driving his car down the road, he looked to his left and saw someone running as fast as they could. It was Troy. This didn’t make ay sense though, wasn’t Troy driving? “Let me in the god damn car!” he screamed as they watched Brie emerge from the bushes behind him, followed by Brittany. “Let us in, Tom!” Brie screamed to him, as a knife flew by her head and hit a tree. She screamed, as she looked back, to see Madison on the ground. Tears fell from her eyes, streaming down her red cheeks. “Go, go!” Brittany screamed to Brie, as they managed to make it to the car. Tom watched Troy pull open the door, forcefully trying to knock him out of the car. “What are you doing!” Tom yelled punching him in the face. Troy backed up, turned around, and watched a knife fly by him, popping the tire. “Never mind… by Tom,” Troy said with a smile, as he took off up the other side of the wooded hill. Ellie pushed open her door and took off, followed by Chelsea, Brittany, and Brie. Brock got out, but waited for Tom. “Are you coming?” he questioned Tom, as the man emerged from the woods. A long, sleek, sharp javelin at hand. The man was rugged and had a mess of hair. He was wearing a bloody brown shirt, that had been torn several times. His face was nasty and a yellowish color. He seemed extremely angry at them. “Holy hell, go!” Tom muttered as he got out of Ellie’s side and took off with Brock. The man simply walked after them, thinking he knew where to find them…</p>
<p>“ What the hell happened to your car Troy?” Brock asked him, as Chelsea looked around the woods. The woods, were made up of trees and dirt. It seemed a little gross though, with all of the bugs and stuff. “That guy threw that javelin at my tire,” Troy explained, “then he ran at us, so I just abandoned the car.” “No… no…” Brie cried out in tears. “What’s wrong?” Andy asked trying to calm her down. “Javelin…” she continued, “remember, you turned that in… he was probably watching us then… he probably killed Mrs. Kreis to get it… and Melissa too…” Troy felt like he was sinking now. He wanted to see Melissa’s smiling face again. As he took a step forward, he stepped directly on a bear trap. Which clamped his foot and caused him to scream wildly, as he was lifted high into the air. “No! Ouch…” Troy began to scream and scream, as blood fell from his leg. Troy was crying, as he tried to move, to escape… but nothing happened. “Cut the rope!” Brock yelled. He then realized it was held up by chains so he quickly abandoned that idea. A tearing sound was heard above and Troy fell to the ground, blood still falling from his amputated foot. He howled in pain, blood leaking from his fatal wound. “Let’s go…” Tom said quietly, “there’s no saving him now, we should get out of here before that guy finds us.” As Tom walked up ahead, Troy kept screaming and screaming, until Ellie only remained by his side. “There… there, it’s alright Troy,” she said trying to comfort him as she cried. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a paper. It was the one he had drawn from the science lab. He gave it to her and she looked at it. “Two?” Then it all fit, perfectly into place… If Melissa had disappeared on Friday, she was probably killed by the guy then. Mrs. Kreis had his javelin, he needed it badly… to kill them all with it. Then Madison got a knife in her back and fell over, dead. She had been number one, Troy was number two… So that meant it was the order they were in to die… The javelin streaked through the air and penetrated Troy’s neck. Ellie screamed as she scampered to her feet and ran, taking on last good look at Troy’s dead body. She kept running and running, but couldn’t locate her friends. “Guys! Guys!” Ellie began screaming. They replied by screaming, “over here!” So quickly she ran through all of the tree’s and made it to her friends, who were sitting next to the side of an enormous cliff. “Troy’s dead…” “We knew he would die from the amount of blood loss anyway…” Tom said to her. She looked at them all. They looked beat, sweaty, and tired from all of the moving around. Finally she saw the sun, which was already falling in the sky. “Troy died from that guy, with the javelin…” Ellie said to them, “ Don’t you get it! Madison was number one, she died first. Troy was number two, he died second! Who the fuck is number three…” Andy slowly raised his hand. “That doesn’t mean anything…” he said questioning her theory, “he probably would’ve killed you back there, if you didn’t run!” “I’m thinking, he made this order, put it in Mrs. Kreis’ room, knowing we’d find that box, and draw from it,” Ellie explained. Brock and Chelsea watched the two bicker and tried to remember their own numbers. Brock had been a seven and Chelsea had been an eight, which made their so called chances of living, a bit high. “Tom you got nine right?” Brock asked him quietly. “Yeah, why?” he asked him, “you got a seven?” Brock looked around at everyone slowly. Everyone was sitting in the same spot for twenty minutes. It felt like someone was anxiously watching them all. “I say we try and get back to the school,” Brock told them, “they have weapons, right?” “Yeah, and gates to keep kids like us out, from making trouble over break,” Brittany said to him, “ let’s go the other way, away from school.” “You have no logic!” Brock yelled, “ let’s go deeper into the woods?!” “Well your school theory was a piece of crap, so I wouldn’t be talking if I were you!” she yelled back at him. Brock got up and began walking away from them, in the direction of the school, so did Chelsea. “Sorry guys, I respect his judgment,” she said with a half-smile. Tom stood up and followed them. “I’m going with you guys,” he said to them, “if Ellie’s right, we’re the safest, until they all die.” Chelsea gave him an angry look. “Don’t say that, they aren’t going to die!” she yelled quietly at him. “ I’m going with Tom,” Brie told Brittany and Ellie, “not that your logicality isn’t bad or anything…” She got up slowly and turned around, looking at the spot they’d vanished into the woods. She started to run after them, joining them in a second. They hadn’t made it too far. Ellie nervously looked at Brittany, then at Andy. “I’m going with them…” she muttered, “sorry,,,” As she left and joined the other group, Brittany got up, as did Andy and they followed Brock as well…</p>
<p>About an hour later, it was beginning to get dark. Brock felt a cold rush of wind blow past him. He looked back at everyone that had trusted him and felt horrible. He didn’t know which way was right, because he was lost. Luckily, he found a road, the road they had drove on. Tom’s car had been hit or something though, because it was smashed up and off of the road and into the weeds. “My car…” he pouted, “god dammit… I didn’t even have insurance…” All of them were filthy and tired. They wished they could just be there already. It was so boring and scary outside in the dark. As they neared the car, Brock looked through the side window that wasn’t broken. He saw Madison, bloody and cut up. Her face had a surprised look on it. That must have been from when the knife was thrown into her back. Brock turned around and told everyone to go on down the road. “Nothing… to see…” he muttered under his breath. Chelsea put her arm around his shoulder as a gesture of sympathy. “It’s okay… just be thankful it wasn’t one of us,” she whispered. “But it was one of us,” he yelled as everyone looked back at him, “we can’t say that Madison wasn’t one of us. She died because we played that stupid game.” “It’s not the game’s fault,” Brittany yelled out of turn. “Yes it is!” Brock roared, “that javelin you guys turned in, was his. He probably was watching us. If we would have stayed in our rooms, this wouldn’t of happened…” “Ok…fine, blame the game,” Brittany replied weakly, “it still doesn’t matter, we can’t stop him now…” “Well we can try, right?” Ellie questioned, “we can fight for our lives!” “More like…” Tom said, “fight for our death’s…” Everyone went silent including Tom as a car sped by. Then they got loud, screaming for it to stop and when it did… they realized they should’ve done that. A javelin poked out of the window and all of the girls screamed. The boys had already taken off down the road. “Stop! Wait for us!” Ellie screamed as the car started after them. It drove past all of the girls though and drove past Tom and Brock. A hand then reached out of the window, grabbed Andy by the back of his shirt and hair, and began dragging him along as he screamed for mercy. The group fled into the woods. “It’s going in order!” Ellie screamed, “I told you! I told you!” Tears ran down her face for the millionth time as she screamed on and on. The rest of the group was in panic as well. Chelsea had nearly fallen asleep once already. She was scared that if she did fall asleep, then she’d be killed. Brock felt like being a follower for a little. He thought he’d messed up enough for one night. As the misery of yet another death swept over the group, Tom decided to step up and be the leader. “Listen guys,” he told them, “if we’re going to survive, well try to survive, there are going to be a few changes. First off, we need to stay in a group, nobody leaves without a partner too. Because we only have six people left, each of you get into a group of two.” Chelsea grabbed Brock’s hand as Tom walked over to Brie and Brittany looked at Ellie. They had decided the groups already and all liked them. “Okay… now what… oh great leader,” Brittany said sarcastically. “Everyone… say your numbers,” he commanded them, “I’m a nine.” “I’m seven,” Brock said loudly, “Chelsea’s an eight.” “Well, I’m a six,” Brie explained, looking up at Tom. Ellie wouldn’t tell. “I’m a five,” Brittany said blankly, “Ellie’s a four…” Ellie quickly slapped her across the face angrily. She looked at Brittany with every intention of ripping her apart. “You little bitch,” she said through gritted teeth, “I thought I could trust you, but no. Little Miss Bigmouth had to say it, the prick.” Brittany felt her cheek. “You’re just upset because you’re next!” Brie yelled at her. Ellie turned on her. “Oh shut your mouth…” she said impatiently, “you have Tom to protect you.” “I’m not in this!” he yelled at her. “Said the self-centered asshole, who doesn’t give a fuck about anyone but himself,’ Ellie wildly said out loud. Tom looked at her angrily. “One more word and the killer won’t need to kill you, you’ll be dead already,” he yelled at her, “What’s wrong now asshole, that’s what I thought…” “Tom you’re a fucking loser!” Ellie screamed at him as he lunged at her and punched her in the face. Brock tried to hold him back but Tom punched him as well. When Chelsea went to help him get up, Tom accidentally kicked her onto the ground. He immediately stopped assaulting Ellie and turned around. “I’m.. sorry… to both of you,” he said in sympathy, “Ellie just kind of… pissed me off.” Chelsea and Brock got up off the ground and looked down at Ellie, who was bleeding severely on her face. Her nose was pouring out blood by the second. “Yeah… no problem Tom,” Brock said as he hugged Chelsea. “What about me?” Ellie yelled, “my face is kind of bleeding!” Tom looked down at her and laughed. She gave him a menacing look. “I’m not giving you an apology nor am I helping you up,” he laughed. “Oh… it’s all just fun and games I guess…” Ellie yelled at him, “until somebody… gets… hurt…” She looked into her pocket at the gun she had found. She thought, “Tom, I’m going to blow your head right off that scrawny body of yours” and then looked up at all of her friends, trying to come up with a new strategy. Taking out Brock, Brittany, Chelsea, and Brie would be a cinch, but if she took out Tom, everything would fall apart, almost too quickly…</p>
<p>About thirty minutes later, Tom had led them accurately in the right direction. They soon saw the outside lighting of the school through the many trees. Brock and Chelsea rushed forward not realizing what they were about to do. First Brock crashed to the ground over roots, then Chelsea fell into a small pit, a little larger than herself. There she found Melissa’s arm. She knew it was Melissa’s because the band that she always wore, read Troy and it was on the arm. She screamed as she scampered to her feet, wiping guts off of her clothing. Brock ran to her. “What’s wrong?” he asked her. He then saw the guts and looked away. “Let’s just get to the school,” Chelsea said as Tom and the others caught up to them. Ellie looked in the pit and began to cry. “I can’t take it anymore!” she screamed as she whipped out the gun, “so much death in one night… I’m sorry guys…” She pointed the gun at Tom who backed away. “More death is going to help!?” Brittany screamed. “Listen Ellie, don’t shoot,” he said to her in fear, “please, I’m sorry…” She looked upset with herself as she pulled the trigger. The bullet hit the top of his shoulder, because she was quivering so much. He screamed and fell to the ground. As she turned around, she saw the man running at them. “Holy shit!” Ellie screamed frantically pointing the gun in the man’s direction. Ellie quickly took three shots, missing each time. The man glared at her, pulling back his arm and releasing his murder weapon. The javelin sped at Ellie who ducked down in a hurry. As the javelin flew backwards into the ground, the man vanished behind the trees.</p>
