<p>While describing one of the fights, the article says "Broly also beat the guts out of both Gohan and Videl". I haven't actually watched any of the animes including Broly, but I can't imagine him literally "beating the guts out" of other characters. If not, does someone want to reword this to sound more professional?</p>

<p>Broly did Have his tail in bio broly the movie but HE lost it again Im not sure how though.</p>
<p>Why dosen't Broly have a tail???? It's purple. Duh.</p>
<p>So when there was a full moon Broly could have went SSJ4.</p>
<p>I doubthe could get control of the golden oozaru form however, he seems to have little sanity even in his most powerful super saiyan form.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>He could have been insane, but that doesn't mean he wasn't in control of his actions. He seemed very sane in Movie 8, tortured by his memory of Goku and desiring revenge if anything. If he was insane, he could have just blown up New Vegeta or Earth in any of the movies, like Kid Buu did while looking for Goku and Vegeta. Wouldn't have made for a very interesting movie, but he could have. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.152.155.125 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.152.155.125_9257.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.152.155.125">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>I still don't get why every mention of LSSJ says the Brolli doesn't lose speed. He didn't do anything remotely fast in any of the movies. He would literally stand still, take attacks head on, and laugh. I think he *did* lose speed, but was so powerful that it didn't matter. Also, does anyone have a link to a scan of the Daizenshuu page that lists the form? Someone said elsewhere that it's labeled "Densetsu no Supa Saiya-jin," but if you listen in the movie Vegeta says that phrase repeatedly (as do other characters), and it wasn't a description of his transformation but of the character himself. As in "He's the legendary Super Saiya-jin."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actualy he dodged every kick and fist that ssj goku, ssj gohan, ssj trunks, and piccolo all threw at him at the same time in a scene in movie 8. Not only that but you can clearly see broly out running gohan and goku as they try to get away from him. Broly chases them down and takes gohan out. If broly did lose speed like ussj trunks did against cell, no way in hell would he have done all the things he did in the movies... - <a href="../../../3/b/u/User%7E3bulletproof16.html" title="User:3bulletproof16">3bulletproof16</a> 02:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah but you're forgetting one thing. Brolli &gt; USSJ2 Trunks. SSJ Goku/Trunks/Gohan/Piccolo &lt; Perfect Cell. So Brolli's pwnage of those characters can't be stacked against Trunks' failure against Cell. The debate would have to be Brolli vs Cell. My point was that Brolli fought like a bigger, slower character in general. And to be fair, Trunks was shown to be slow not in the animation, but by Cell simply moving faster after a certain point. In the fight itself Trunks rush battled Cell and moved faster than anything Brolli appeared to do in movie 8. You can't judge DBZ characters based on what the animation of a fight shows. That's just like how it's supposed to be impressive when a character blows up a mountain throught Z, yet in Dragonball Piccolo could level cities (at a much lower level of power).</dd>

<p>In dbz movie 8, Paragaus talks about how Broly was extremly powerful even as a child, i'm thinking that mabey at or around the same time that he put that mind-control thing on Broly's head, he might have cut off his tail to lessen his power even more, lest Broly overpower the device and kill every one around him, and then kept cutting it off whenever it grew back, and one more thing, when Broly comes back in movie 10, Gohan says while fighting Broly "hes just as much of a challenge as before" this always bothered me as, when a saiyan recovers from a near-death experience (such as Broly surviving the destruction of a planet) their power is supposed to greatly incerease, in some cases even so much as to double in strength, but Broly's power didn't seem to be any different from the 8th movie, also when in lssj form in dbz movie 10 his hair IS still green, I don't see why people keep saying that it isn't.</p>
<p>I saw Broly in super sayin 4 on the internet once.</p>
<p>I think that the main reason you see his hair green is that his Ki attacks are green. I think his hair gets the green tint when he is firing ki, due to the green light. It is yellow sometimes, probably when he doesn't fire off ki. Buster Sword 20:37, 24 July 2006 (UTC) Buster Sword</p>

<dd>I can tell you that Broly never reached "SSJ4" (which isn't even canon in the DBZ universe; it was created by the people behind GT). At most, I'd say he's SSJ2. --<a href="../../../x/e/o/User%7EXeon25_8c8f.html" title="User:Xeon25">Xeon25</a> 13:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
LSS is independent and different from SS2 it's unique to him. Take this for example he fights as LSS vs Gohan after he had already surpased SS1 on DBZ movie 10 and still easily overpowered him meaning that the trasformation it's even stronger than it previously was assumed also LSS power keeps going up as the fight evolves something that's unique , he also lacks the lighting bolt effect that SS2 posseses he has a green aura ball around him also, it seems odd that a saiyan that can keep his power increasing eternally without any real effort would be stuck on SS2, also Broly did destroy a whole galaxy single handed and did it either really fast or in a single blow (DBZ movie 8 begining), no SS2 would be able to do that. I think that LSS is the original idea for a SS4, and it's probably the strongest SS transformation on DBZ since it was created after the series was over and it was to be of legendary strength, so they made him even stronger than SS3, but Broly was not created by Toriyama so only the creator knows for sure, and Broly himself it's probably not part of the cannon line as many other movie characters.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">User:Dark Dragon Flame</a> 6:42 16 December 2006</p>

<dd>A cannon showdown?? Well who is to say that a SSJ2 or SSJ3 can't destroy a galaxy with his or her powers? It was never push to that because all the SSJ2 Saiyans are heroes and would not do such a horrible thing not even Vegeta as he was more of a anti hero at the time. Now I said this in the archieves of SSJ article that LSSJ is some what equal to a SSJ2. That has been proven by Gohan during the Cell Games with the Cell Jrs who's powers were just as powerful if not stronger that a Asended SSJ or Ultra SSJ. He destroyed them with no effort. As in the movies Broly had to put a little effort in beating the snot out of Goku and the fellas. And Goku's powers with the shared saiyans and namekian powers were somewhere in the power level of a SSJ2 or SSJ3 when he defeated Broly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not disagreeing about Broly's powers. It's just that if he had be a canon character in the series he would have be the strongest saiyan but he was only created because of a mistake that Akira Toriyama made with the Super Saiyan legend that Toei felt they wanted to fix but could only do it in a movie since the manga was already close to being done with no room for Broly. Remember before the legend was reverted to what it says now. It said that there is only one Super Saiyan at a time when a SSJ is born every 1000 years. But with the introduction of Trunk(Mirai) and Vegeta becoming a SSJ then the other sayian youths transformations it destroyed that legend and a new one was made to what it says today. So to fix it that the new Legend was made with Broly being the saiyan born with the legendary powers. However with it being a movie it did not help to much. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 08:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brolly with the Green Hair form may simply be his False Super Saiyan form. Seeing as how he has essentially been a Super Saiyan since birth he may have far greater control over each form shifting into the forms as he sees power required with the exception of any time he encounters Kakkarot where he just automatically loses control and goes straight to max. This is demonstrated in the second Brolly movie where he doesn't go into Legendary mode until after Gohan goes SS1. As for Brolly's near death experience power up, he really couldn't have gotten any stronger. As Gohan has proven seven years of inactivity can take a toll on one's power level. That said while Gohan simply didn't train, Brolly was in a coma for seven years. And he still got stronger. Or an alternate theory perhaps because of the mutant gene that lets him get stronger during battle cancels the gene that increases strength after the battle. On Brolly's tail- If your son was a Legendary Super Saiyan would you want him looking at a full moon? Rayfire 20:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's been stated that he was in fact SSJ, and the wierd aura is due to the control device on his head. This shattered when he further transformed, and his hair shone at it's normal color thereafter. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 22:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Was he a False Super Saiyan when his hair was purple (I mean when he attacked Goku in movie 8)? <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Ematsu_675e.html" title="User:Ryu Ematsu">Ryu Ematsu</a></p>
<p>The device on his head was surpressing his energy so he couldn't become a full Super Saiyan, and even though he was supposed to be 'controlled' he was still 'out of control.' I think this would classify as Giji Super Saiyan (False Super Saiyan, they're basically the same thing). And his hair probably wasn't purple, it was just the effect of the lighting. 70.152.155.125 23:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brolly was fast and strong. He didn't really train as he was naturally freakishly strong. A person who doesn't ever need to dodge doesn't worry about things like speed. However it is a very good point that he could run down whoever he wanted. He probably couldn't have caught a Super Saiyan 2 Gohan or a Super Saiyan 3 Goku but he has proven that he is the fastest Super Saiyan 1 at any stage. But he was really too big to perform any high speed intricate maneuvers. That said his battles have proven him to very agile in Super Saiyan 1 and Legendary modes. Pretty much Broly does what Broly wants to do.</p>
<p>As for his power level in comparison to other DBZ villains, the very nature of Broly would mean that even if he was weaker than Cell or Buu, unless they killed him instantly at the start of the fight (not likely even in Kid Buu's case) then before the battle was over Broly would have grown to become the more powerful. Rayfire 20:58, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Broly might be faster than we thought, this is what we know he was able to dodge attacks from Gohan, Goku, Piccolo and USS Trunks while all of them attacked him at the same time on one scene on Movie 8, he also had to be really fast to reach a ship and input Earth's cordinates on about two seconds that remained from when Goku punched him to when the planet exploded (comet collided), as to why he never used such speed during battle it may had something to do with arrogance of the stronger. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">User:Dark Dragon Flame</a> 5:00 16, December 2006</p>

<dd>Um no, if he was Oozaru, he would have needed to see a full moon, and he would have had a pronounced snout and ape-like posture. He grew to that size because he had become one with the ooze. Remember, they cover him in it and you see him melt. For w/e reasons, the writer of the movie decided it'd be cool if he came for one last scare, so he had enough fight in him to use his power to mold that gunk into his image. Note how easily he was dropped. It was just a Broly-shaped mass of gunk. Bio-Oozaru Broly or whatever would have taken more than a blast from Goten and Trunks to go down for the count. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 22:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Behind the legend is simply a header to bring it into format continuity with the main character articles of Dragon Ball Z. Its not an in-depth psyche evaluation, its just his history section.

<dd>For one thing, the Appearance section is completely unnecessary as it already states most of the information there clearer in the Forms section, not to mention most of it is poorly written. The edits made to the Power Level section have poor grammar. The History headings are unnecessary since Broly's life isn't that complex as it was easily summarized in just two movies. As for the mention of Broly returning in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2 is just plane irrelevant.-<a href="../../../3/b/u/User%7E3bulletproof16.html" title="User:3bulletproof16">3bulletproof16</a> 00:39, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed the paragraph about his strength. Although knowing his exact power may be useful for the reader, that paragraph<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Broly&amp;diff=62984597&amp;oldid=62984234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Broly&amp;diff=62984597&amp;oldid=62984234" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup> adds nothing. To understand this better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no universal consensus on how powerful Broly is in comparison to other Dragon Ball villains.<sup>lacks reference</sup> A wide range of estimates have emerged<sup>where?</sup> indicating him to be anywhere from as powerful as <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ac6e.html" title="Cell (Dragon Ball)">Perfect Cell</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majin_Buu_56d7.html" title="Majin Buu">Kid Buu</a> to being the strongest character<sup>peacock term</sup> in the series. Considering how he overshadows his opponents with ease in his natural strength, it is likely that he is far beyond any villain in terms of raw power.<sup>original research</sup> Yet no one can know<sup>why the paragraph has been written then?</sup> for sure and no one can really compare Broly to every villain from the beginning to the end of series, since he only fought against characters from the Cell Games and the start of the Buu Saga.<sup>contradicts the first part</sup> His unclassified, yet insane power makes it difficult to assess<sup>repeating the same</sup> as it was never revealed to have any known limits (because Broly was never opposed to the strongest characters in the series).<sup>then how can measure power?</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Broly's exact power level is unknown, and hard to guess because it grows during battle over time. Broly only fought against characters from the Cell and Buu sagas, but, judging by how easily he dominated them, his power is undoubtedly above <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ac6e.html" title="Cell (Dragon Ball)">Perfect Cell</a>'s.

<dd>No, you are again making conclusions. Wikipedia editors can't make conclusions, they can just reference what others (reliable sources) have already stated. The <i>, but, judging by how easily he dominated them, his power is undoubtedly above Perfect Cell's.</i> is speculation. You are speculating that his power is higher than the other characters, but you can't cite a reliable source (Akira Toriyama, Shonen Jump, a CNN, eWeek or BBC article, etc) where this is stated.

<p>Oh come on, who the hell said that Broly is as strong as Kid Buu, come on people. He was strong but not that strong. He was defeated by Goku while he was in his Super Saiyan form in the first movie however Goku had to fight Kid Buu in his Super Saiyan 2 and Super Saiyan 3 forms. Also in the second and third movies, Broly was destroyed by ss2 Gohan, ssGoten, ssKid Trunks and ssGoku all by either killing him with a triple kamehameha and blasting him with ki blasts. Even if all these characters fought Kid Buu together, they will all lose unless Goku transformed into a Super Saiyan 3 or Super Saiyan 4. I guess somebody exgeratted alot.I think Broly was as strong as Super Perfect Cell to maybe Majin Buu but not as strong as Kid Buu.64.107.164.10 18:30, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would have to say that Broly was stronger than Kid Buu, take this for example Kid Buu went on a rampage destroying planets to do so he used giant Ki balls and took him an eternity to destoy some planets, now Broly destroyed a whole Galaxy in two seconds at the begining of DBZ movie 8. Goku had the focused power of four warriors and he could only make him a big cut, then Broly losed control of his power, so he technically didn't defeat him. The only reason for his death is that they had to kill him or the movie would have a very sad ending, also the kamehameha only pushed him into the sun, where his heart exploded. This from one of the biggest Kid Buu fans that exist- There is no real way to figure out his true power so there is no way to build this section without speculation.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">User:Dark Dragon Flame</a>5:15 16 December, 2006</p>

<dd>Well you may seem right but still you are wrong. For one Broly was defeated plan and simple. Two this galaxy destroying thing? Well figure this. It was a movie. That was only 1hour and about 20 mintues. To tell and show Broly destroying that galaxy's planets one at a time would take up the movie space so it had to be shown the way it was. Three, When Goku DEFEATED Broly(and he was defeated) he was using the powers of 3 other saiyans, not super saiyans as they were at base level and Piccolo. They were all nearly out off energy at that. Goku, who powers were not at full max either combined his with does powers. His level then was at les at a level as a SSJ2, SSJ3 or at less the same level as Broly's powers. Next movie 10. It was SUPER SAIYAN Gohan that battled Broly not SSJ2 (did Gohan show any signs of a SSJ2? NO!!)and it as SSJ Gohan, SSJ Goten with a little of Base Trunks's help that help push Broly into the sun and that killed Broly. It is unknown except to Krillin if it was Goku for real or just his spirit to guide his sons to victory. Remember the Dragonballs of Earth have much more limited power then Namek's. If a dead person is not revived in one years after there death then they remain dead. It has been seven years since Goku's death. So either way Broly who was the strongest saiyan at those times, but with combined powers of Saiyans all three times Broly was defeated shows he was not as powerful as people want him to be. Not even the combined powers of a SSJ3, A SSJ2 and a Buu could not defeat Kid Buu. Only ALL the energy from the people of earth killed Kid Buu and that almost didn't work. Now what if a Genki Dama or Spirit Bomb with much power was used on Broly??? Could he survive that??<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 18:32, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nobody knows that. the thing is that even if he wasn't then he would have been why? not because of his original power, it's more of the fact that he could multiply his power by many times with little effort thus if he was to fight aganist Buu he would be stronger than him by the end of the night, that is his true power not his strenght but his abilities, maybe he was a stronger but what made Buu so dangerous was that he could regenerate if you let a little of him, that why he was so hard to beat if he was mortal he would have died when he was first blown, but Buu came back time after time, he wasn't really superior in power when compared to SS3 but he had unlimited power and was virtually inmortal, that's why he gave so much trouble to Goku as a SS3 not because of his power level, He was more lethal. I doubt he was more powerful than Broly but more Dangerous that is the reason that if him and Broly were to fight he would win, not because of strength. Anyway there is not a real point conparing a non-cannon character aganist a cannon one so why don't we put this to rest here-<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">User:Dark Dragon Flame</a> 17 December 2006</p>
<p>Well first off it was you who was comparing powers of canon and non canon characters. You brought it up comparing Kid Buu to Broly. Now to let you know Broly's powers and abilities where really something never seen until the Buu saga. However he fought only 2 Full Powered SSJs and 2 Assended SSJ and a Super Namek in movie 8 and only 3 SSJ and a Human in movie 10. Yes he said his power was growing but he was defeated by weaken powers of 4 SSJ combined with a Super Namek and the combine blast of 2 SSJ(I don't believe Goku was really there, only his spirit). Broly never fought a SSJ2 or higher Super Saiayn levels. But getting beat by combined powers of weaker fighters shows he is weaker than what many think. But you are right about speculation it is not right to try and put it in the article. However you can not come compare and give off a opinions thinking someone will not reply back to it. I feel that Broly is weaker than what many feel his is. I still say he is stronger than any saiyan up to the USSJ power up but beyond that he is at a even level of strength, power and abilities of a SSJ2 at max power but if he was able to let his powers grow as you said then only a SSJ3 or 4 would probably be the only power levels that could defeat him. Oh ya I know this has nothing to do with this article but it was mentioned by you so i will reply to it. This is on the Kid Buu regeneration thing. Mr Buu(Fat Buu) can do the same thing but got is butt handed to him by Kid Buu. If it was like how you said then Mr Buu would have been able to handle Kid Buu with more ease but the regeneration thing seems to have its limits to based on powers too. So Kid Buu's powers were well up there to just regenerate with no ill effects that was show in Mr Buu. Also Broly could destroy a galaxies but Buu not only could destroy galaxies but could break the dimensional plane with his powers alone. That's power guy. To my other fella people I know that didn't have nothing to do with this article but I just had to reply to it. I apologize to you guys and gals. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 07:55, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not a forum, I don't care enought as to fight over it, I will stop replying now, this argument is dead-<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">User:Dark Dragon Flame</a> 18 December 2006</p>
<p>first in the movues brolly never tries and is only beten when chaught by surprise.</p>
<p>second buu's regeneration cant relly win him the fight just prolong him untill his oponent weares out, (because buu dosent) but his is not a statagy you want to imploy against brolly because he dosent get worn out he just get stronger the longer you take to beat him.</p>
<p>third this is arguable but gohan in movie 10 was after the sapreme kie powerup which would make him around ssj3(before he terns ssj), brolly was beting that with out Lssj. so how strong was gohan ssj, and in turn how strong did Lssj brolly have to be to still dominate? (shadowsok@aol)</p>
<p>yes it is not a forum but no one was arguing with you or fighting you Dark Dragon Flame. Just you put something on here and I replied to it so you need to calm you butt down. If you can't take someone giving you a opinion or fact that reverts what you wrote, then you do not need to be here. I did not write a forum piece or I did not intend to. Also you jumped in on something that was finished 5 months ago. The article was fix and been that way for a good while. This edit summary was done and over with but since you want to put you two cents in then I reply to it. I replied to you statement. And thats that. Now Broly again despite being surprised he got bet by weaker fighters plain and simple. But I agree on the Buu statement Shadowsok made. But I will let you know that in Movie 10 was made during the World tourament part of the Buu saga not the Z-sword or Fusion patt, so Buu did not get revived in time for that movie so Gohan was just Gohan with his ability to go up to SSJ2 not his Latent powers. So again Broly got beat by weaker warriors. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 09:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>but, it still remains the only reson he was beat was by surprise and he never tries in the movies. besides even tho he got beten by lower level worriers they were extemly powerfull moves and in the siris we se allot of moves like this (moves that are way out o the cerecters power class) (shadowsok)</p>
<p>NEW FLASH!!! Nearly every main villian in the series from Demon King Piccolo in DragonBall to Cell in Z through to Omega Shenron in GT were beat by some sort of surprise done by either Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan, or a combination of two or more. So using this surprise statement does not do anything for Broly if nearly every major enemy In all 3 series and movies were beat by some sort or surprise attack, move, quick power up, or ability. Also no one really knows if Broly can get tired of not? He was NEVER push to that extent of overexecerting his power, or to get push to his limits. In the movies many other villians fought and never seem to get tired. Bojack, Cooler, Jamemba, Slug, They all did not seem to tier at all either. That there my friend is speculation. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 03:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>all thou that is true he is the only villian to be so completly dominating without ever trying there is no moment exept the end were they even get an advantage on him. (shadowsok@aol.com)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will give you that. Broly is the only villian to totally dominate and control a battle all the way to the VERY end where until the heroes found a way to beat him. That is something that did happen. I completely agree on that but it still does not change the fact he got defeated those two times (only opinion wise i would not consider Bio Broly in this matter as he was a messed up clone that only seem to have half the power real Broly had.) Broly was a powerful player, and I consider him the stronger saiyan at the levels he has, the base, SSJ and LSSJ(Broly's version of the ASSJ or USSJ but more of a transformation then a power up). His strength is incredible. But beyond that I feel he would get beat or put a great one on one fight with a MAX powered SSJ2 or higher. With that the facts still remains as i said before.<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 08:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>he did not get killed by there moves he got beat by the enviroment he moves pushed him intwo and only because we was overconfident and did not even try to use all his power(the sun) if you go to the powerlevel page and callculate the punch that knoked goku out it was a little hiher than 400 million (a ssj2 is 145 million) (shadowsok)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, off I did not say he was killed by anyone, I said he was beat. Second, he was beat by Goku in the first of Broly's movies, not by any enviromental threat. Third, it was a combination of the sun's heat and the Son's Kamehamehas that killed him not just the sun in movie 10. Four, What Power Level page are you talking about? Not the Power Level (Dragon Ball Z) page. The highest and only SSJ power level recorded is Super Saiyan Goku at 150,000,000 (from the Daizenshū). No other SSJ level or SSJ Saiyan is recorded. Since there are no offical recordings of power level after the Frieza saga, the calulation you mention is only a <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Research_bdeb.html" title="Original Research">Original Research</a> statement. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 06:35, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>nothing relly beat him exept the sun and that move(gokus punch: wich i am basing on the cobined powerlevels off the people involved). Another thing it is not considered original research if it comes from wikipedia itself ( as far as wikipedia is coserned everything on it is rilliable factual information), and you are rongly assoming gohans move even pirced the sun which has no proff in the siris, not to mention in real life would be impossible even at the powerlevels any Z cerecter is at they would not even get close to doing that, (with all do respect , and not tring to be offensive) do have any idea how powerfull a sun is. (shadowsok)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where in Wikipedia says Goku's power level was 400 million when he beat Broly? What calculation of who's powers did you do when there power levels at the point and time of the movie was not recorded or mentioned. Also all their powers as Super Saiyans had grow too? Where in Wikipedia says a SSJ2's power level is around 145 million when it says a normal SSJ power level is 150 million as stated in Wikipedia? The only SSJ level and SSJ person recorded on the Power Level (Dragon Ball Z) was Goku in his first transformed SSJ state and the last power level recorded period was Mirai Trunk(base form) when Mecha Frieza and King Cold's henchman measured Trunks at 5 as Trunks suppressed his base power. Again where does it state any of what you said? So yes your statement was a <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Research_bdeb.html" title="Original Research">Original Research</a>.</dd>
<dd>Also I am not wrongly saying the Sons's Kamehameha blast pierce the sun. If you look at the movie closely you see it. It pushed Broly straight through the sun. So yes it did. The sun is powerful but so was Broly, a being that could destroy galaxies made up of suns, stars and planets. Power level well above just 10,000 can destroy a planet as seen by Vegeta who was at 18,000 in the beginning of the Saiyan (Vegeta) saga in the series. So a power level well above 100 million can likely pierce the sun, could it not? I know you not taking anything personally. It's cool. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 06:58, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>at the time i wrote it it wasent original research because the power level page did contain up to cell saga so i combined there power levels to see how strong the punch would be</p>
<p>there is no profe it pirced the sun you ara gussing but thats what most info on animas are any way educated gusses (in real life which i relize dbz isint it would never have been able to pirce the sun (shadowsok)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you watch the movie or you just guessing yourself. You need to watch the movie 10 and you WILL see that the Kamehameha blast does indeed pierce the sun and push Broly's body through the sun. You also need to stop using real life within a COMPLETELY fictional story. Fictionial work is Fiction. In real life do people fly using chi? Do people anywhere has the ability to fire energy blast from parts of the bodies. Do real people have the ability to transform themself into another form on conmmand? Does the real world technology have the ability to put a house, car or plane into a capsule no bigger than a thumb or cell phone?? Does the world have animals walking and talking like humans? Does real life have dinosaurs living in world with no signs of extinction? NO!!!!!! to all of that so again stop using real life scenarios in the fiction world of Dragonball where ANYTHING is possible. And again you go back and pop in the dvd or vhs of movie 10 and watch the killing of broly again. I have the movie right here looking at it.</dd>

<p>i have all ready stated that i know dbz dous not take place within the phisics of the real world i have the movie it shows the blast geting up to the sun but has no profe that it went in since it dosent show if the blast went in or not we have to asume that it dident. any wa the point is that the blast had no bering on his death the sun killed him.

<dd>OK then so stop with the real life statments.</dd>
<dd>As for this sun thing let me give you a prime example of what I mean. Movie 6 Cooler got pushed into the same sun as Broly. Now he got pushed and was stuck between the sun's surface and his own Death Ball blast being push by SSJ Goku's kamehameha blast. There he was stuck and remaining in the sun until he was his body was destroyed. Now if the Kamehameha Blast of the Sons in Broly's movie did not pierce the sun then Broly would have been just like Cooler. stuck in one place til he burned up or exploded. But he or rather his remains got push through the sun. That my friend seems like piercing or pushing something through to me. Also he got blasted by two or three(depending if Goku was real, his spirit or an illusion as the narrators in both languages stated) SSJs more powerful the SSJ Goku was about 10 years earlier.</dd>
<dd>Here is something. Simple Physics, If something is push into a thick mass it would that a stronger amount of force to push something through it. right? Take thick mub and a rock. You toss the rock into the thick mub it gets stuck in one place right? But if you throw it harder it will go farther into the mub or straight through and hit the bottom with a stronger throw. So same applies here. Same as throwing a rock at a tree trunk, it bounces off or if thrown hard it gets stuck but shoot a gun or rifle at it, the bullet round goes farther in or goes straight through the trunk. again same applies to the sun a very think mass of extreme heated plasma.</dd>

<p>the fact that the cerecters can provide an aura around themselfs thows off the physics broly at the time had a circular aura protecting him. i dont think the suns heat killed or even touched him he looks like he was killed by microwave radiation wich would explain why he died by his heart exploding. coller bing part off a far less huminoid species could have been unifected by the radation and have made it tru for that reson.(shadowsok) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.214.67.241 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.214.67.241_c0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.214.67.241">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>You could be right. By Broly overexcerting himself from protecting himself from the sun and the Kamehameha that could have been the cause of his exploding death. That I can agree on. But the color of his blood though is from his own LSSJ form powers. Remember in both movie 8 and 10 as in his base form (normal) and is SSJ form his blood was red but both time when he bleed in his LSSJ form it has been green. Remember when Goku punch Broly before he apparently blow up (we know he survived that) his blood was green as when he blow up in the sun same color. Don't ask me why Toei did that but that apparently is the reason for the color of his blood as a LSSJ.</dd>

<p>i belive his blood looking green had to do with the reflection of his soroindigs( fist gokus punch then his own aura), not his lssj form( shadow)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Man will you please spell better. We really don't know what you mean to say sometimes. Anyway it was his power that reflected the color of his blood. Not some surounding. It was his blood that was green not the suroundings. Nothing around Broly at the time of his defeats showed any green refection. So sorry man. His blood was that color though to his LSSJ powers. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 06:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>when he went into the sun he surrounded himself with a green aura as tou can see when he got hit with the blast. and whan goku hit him with the punch it was a green.( shadowsok ) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.214.86.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.214.86.90_9609.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.214.86.90">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Whatever you say. Green surrounding? Sun radiation? Do you really think Toei or Toriyama who wrote the story for the screenplay really was thinking that stuff when they created the movies. Stop thinking scientifically and think animator. Do you really think they put any type of radiation science into these movies? Green blood? Green surroundings? radiation? Man this is futile to talk about this anymore. You will belive what you will as will I. So this discussion must end now.</dd>

<dd>the hole point off this discussion was to prove that brolly is allot stronger than we think there are events in the movies that make it quite clear that he is more than ssj2 if not up to ssj3.(shadow) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.38.150.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.38.150.240_8629.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.38.150.240">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Ya it was but where did the discussion go to? His blood, radiation. Stuff like that. Nothing to do with how strong he is. I still to this day and from then on says that Broly's LSSJ from is more on an equal level to a SSJ2 and not stronger. Also there is NO WAY Broly is stronger than a SSJ3 or even Gohan's latent powers (hidden powers released). You want to basically go off two major events about Broly's powers and that is him destroying a galaxy in movie 8 and his statement he was getting stonger. Beyond that nothing else shows he is stronger than that. Nothing much has shown me he was stronger than a SSJ2 or higher. If anything SSJ2 Gohan during the Cell games has shown me it was stronger than Broly's LSSJ.</dd>
<dd>To this day despite how he was beat or killed, even his clone, was beat by Saiyans in there SSJ1 form with help from normal form Saiyans (normal Vegeta, Teen Gohan, Mirai Trunks, and a weak Piccolo, movie 8. little Trunks's help, Movie 10. and Krillin's help against the clone in movie 11). All weaker SSJ forms. No other form has been shown to get beat by a weaker form or weaker power level, right???? So give me a real example of the LSSJ powers and we will see how it holds up to SSJ2. ok?</dd>

<p>all the points in the articles have been to prove instinces for his power if you dont remeber them then go up and review them. the clone was not brolly and was distorted when finished. there is now way do definitley prove what his true power level was or wasesnt and it was probably made that way on perpose. since it is an anime the only way to prove something like that would be to ask the makers. i just fell that brolly could have been and is most likely is more powerfull than ssj2.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have read the article and I have read what people been writing. However finally it is out. No one can prove that he is stronger than SSJ2 or higher. Only Toei or Mr Toriyama can. Been saying that for years. All I do when someone wants to try and prove it, I revert it with what Gohan did in the Cell games. I also agree with you that Broly could have been the strongest Saiyan alive if they continued to work with him and not kill him. Shot if they had worked him into the actual anime he could have been the strongest villain on the show period. But like I said people are entitled to there opinions and mine is Broly is not stronger than a SSJ2. Only on or near that level of power <b>at that time his powers are shown in the movies</b>. However my other opinion is that Broly could have been the strongest Saiyan and villian if continued to be worked on and not killed.</dd>

<p>"on or near that level of power <b>at that time his powers are shown in the movies</b>" thats my point he was that strong without ever trying.(so imagine if he tried) (shadow)</p>
<p>Ya your are right but in still Broly's powers are only on a scale that is near a SSJ2 but not above it. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 13:21, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ya agreed <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_P_7959.html" title="User:Heat P">Heat P</a> 06:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>do we agree that there is no evidence that during any off the fitting sequences he put any effort into the fight (shadow) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.3.253.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.3.253.75_9707.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.3.253.75">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Only two times has he put effort in a fight and that was in both the first and second of Broly's movie. Both were at the end. When he had those last moment before he was defeat he put quite a bit of effort into the punch towards Goku knowing he had to end it then and now and right before and during the Kamehameha blast hit him and push him into the sun. Other than that you are right he put no effort what so ever into his fights. So other than does to times no he has never show any effort in his fights. So ya i agree.</dd>

<dd>Right Assumptions can't be used to edit a article with makes it a Original Statement but it can be used in someones opinion in a talk page. Also we try not to make it a forum either but to explain some things you have to talk or write like one but we don't or at less I don't try to make it a forum.</dd>
<dd>But back to the talk at hand, again surprised or not has any other SSJ form been beaten by a weak form or power?? Can you answer that??</dd>
<dd>Also Gohan during the Cell Games as a SSJ2 did not use any effort to Beat the Cell Jr., or Cell before Cell became Super Perfect Cell and mind you All 7 (8 that the number of Cell Jr. killed in the anime)Cell Jr. and Cell are just as powerful and/or if not more powerful than Goku and the Gang during that movie because that the same level that they were at in the Cell Games.</dd>
<dd>So no it is not to assume that Broly's power is as strong as a SSJ3 because of the same thing you just said applys to Gohan, Goku, Vegeta, even Pikan when he beat both Cell, Frieza and King Cold in the After Life. So again Broly's power is only on or near the level of a Super Saiyan 2 not above it, not pass it. Think about it 2FPSSJ, 2 ASSJ, and a SN. Despite Broly not putting much effort into he fight he put more into his fights than Gohan when he destroyed CJ and then he beat and nearly kicked Cell before SPC. Also Broly never was able to kill anyone at SSJ power level even though he had enough power to do so. It never happened as for SSJ2 and above has.</dd>
<dd>I can tell you like Broly alot but just because he is really strong in the movies doesn't mean he is stronger than any SSJ level from SSJ2 and above. But like I said I agree he is strong and if worked on more he would have been the strongest Saiyan if he hit other levels but as of the level he is at now during the movies he is not stronger than a SSJ2 or higher.</dd>

<p>he never ever relly powers up or triaes so for all we know he was allredy above ssj4 second you dont even have to be close to powerfull enoph to be caught by surprise by somone (for example when master roshi got shot by that blond girl thats snezes whats her name).as far as gohan he beat them all sepratly besides cell would have been beat eraly on in perfect mode if he didint have the ability to regenerat which the cell jr.s were not able to do.i am just saying with the two ansers given before your current one we can essely assume he is above ssj2 (we dont know how far above) (shadow)</p>
<dl>
<dd>YOU MUST BE CRAZY TRYING TO SAY HIS POWER IS POSSIBLY ANYWHERE NEAR A SSJ4. What are you think? He has shown no again no power to say he is anywhere near those power level not even SSJ3. On this surpised thing, how many villians have had a surprising defeat at the hands of the Z-Fighters? Nearly everyone one of them right. So get off that surprise win thing.
<dl>
<dd>Also we may not know his power level but it is no way on the level of a SSJ3 or SSJ4. You still did not answer my question either. Has any other SSJ power ever been beat by a lower power or even a combination or lower powers?? Let me answer my own question for you. NO... That right there shows Broly at those times are weaker than any power level of a SSJ3 or higher.
<dl>
<dd>I have seen the movies countless times. I have watch and rewind and watch the fights over and over. Still to this day at his current levels shown his powers again at the time of the movies are only at the level of a max SSJ2. No more, no less because his is dead now so he will never get stronger than he was. So the LSSJ as of now is not the strongest power level out there that you are anyone want it to be.
<dl>
<dd>Also one other thing I like you to think about, unlike the other Saiyan Broly seems to get weaker after being healed, but also it was seven years since using his power so not using his power in that much time like Gohan many him weaker. Why? That I don't know but you seen the movies and you know what I mean. Think about he was way stronger in movie 8 were he handed 4 SSJ and SN, then movie 10 he seperately handed a little stronger Gohan after training again and two young inexperiance SSJ and had to put a little more effort in trying to defeating them then he did in movie 8, then I know it was a clone but it was still Broly's DNA and that Broly was way weaker then this real self. So look at this. I say this after so thought that it is possible that movie 8 Broly was maybe stronger than a SSJ2 but more likely on that level than above it. That I will say with you but the other two movies he was a lot weaker than he was in Movie 8. So those two movie yes even the clone was no where near the SSJ2 level.</dd>

<p>fist of all the clone is not brolly he has nowear near the same stregth and dous not have the well of power or the continues power ups, so stop using him as an example.</p>
<p>second i did not say brolly was stronger than ssj3 i only stated that we dont know and he could be, we do not no the extent of brollys power during any of the movies because of his lack of effort.</p>
<p>for some reson brolly toys with his victoms not trying to kill them, but just proving he can essaly kill them at any time.</p>
<p>no vilin not even cell or buu or any one ever comes close to even dominating an ssj1 with such intensity and littol personal effert, that is what i am basing my opinion that during the movies he is some ware inbituin ssj2 and ssj3 (but i could be rong he could be lower or even higher we cant be certin) (shadow)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"he never ever relly powers up or triaes so for all we know he was allredy above ssj4" Did you not write that? So by your own statement you said he was above a SSJ3 by say SSJ4.</dd>
<dd>Now what I meant by that despite being a clone it is saiyan DNA right? Saiyan DNA shows if a Saiyan is near death and healed or already dead and brought back to life they get stronger. Similiar concept as Cell when he blow up and came back stronger but for some odd reason Broly's saiyan DNA gets weaker. So if you think about it the clone should have been stronger than at less Broly during movie 10 because the DNA was reformed thus being healed. But just like movie 10 Broly got weaker. So no I will not stop using the clone as a example because clone or not it is Broly. thank you.</dd>
<dd>Now SP Cell and Buu have toyed with and total dominated SSJs. Watch the show, and guess what both toyed with SSJ Vegeta and Buu total domanated a SSJ2 Vegeta. Buu fought Goku as a SSJ2 and SSJ3 not a SSJ. When Cell fought Goku he was just Perfect Cell not SP Cell. Fat Buu totally dominated Gotenks TWICE. Normal Gotenks and SSJ Gotenks. A being that was suppose to be stronger than a SSJ at his normal base form. This same Buu dominated SSJ Gohan before Majin Vegeta showed up. Nice try.</dd>
<dd>You using your opinion now but I am basing my theroy on the facts at hand. Lack of effort means nothing. Facts are and I will say this til i die. He got beat by weaker beings plain and simple. Agrue if you want but it does not change that fact no matter who you put it.</dd>
<dd>You may say no one knows the extent of his powers but they can be measured by what he has done and what others have done. But I will still agree with that he is the strongest saiyan of his level at those times before his actual death. and if continued to be worked on...lets say Goku and the gang my have a lot of trouble on their hands but of course Goku like he did before would have found a way to beat him. Thats what Goku and the Gang is really good at while getting there lil butts whipped founding a way..LOL</dd>

<p>pay attention i said for "all we know" that dous not mean i think it, unlike any other cerecter there is nothing to suggest that brolly even has limits to his power.</p>
<p>second, brolly gets his power not from training but from the fact that he is a sayin god, so if you clone him you end up with nothing more than a mier knok off that dosent have the same well off power.becases it wasent his dna that made him powerfull its the fact that his sippirit was that off a sayin god.

<p><br />
well if you see movie 8 you will notice something that made it make sense to me, goku allowed himself to be pummeled after he realized he could not fight hand to hand, so he waited until he had all the energy from everyone, not to focus it to kill him but, and if you have a copy of the movie check it out. just as broly punches for the final time, goku receives vegeta's energy. he extends his hand and then you see it, lime green light is emitted from Goku's palm, just as broly hits bouth their arms is covered in lime green ki, now thats broly's ki. and what happens then? goku instantly powers up, now note, broly's hair is yellow now and goku's is now the same as broly's... lime green. again note he did not power up before after broly hit him. then broly, amazed asks himself&#160;:"here is he getting all this energy?" cause broly knew that goku's friends did not have enough energy, goku leeched energy from Broly... thats why he became strong enough to faze him and get away. since broly continues to grow stronger by producing an massive amount of energy he would probably not feel the leech. since Goku never said "oh thank you for sharing your energy it was without a doubt the reason i bested him" this is a just as valid explanation. also in movie 10 gohan was a ss2, cause he was weaker than his younger self, so why would he fight broly in a weaker form and do better in it? like dadura, he was stated to be as or stronger then spc, gohan must have been a ss2 against him, yet he did not show lightning, so no lighting does not mean no ss2. his fair and face was ss2 as where his feet's. also when broly fought against the family trio, gohan, goten and goku (goku was there because broly saw him. cell did not see goku so he was there, also a wish was made cause the dragonballs scattered afterwards, no wish was made to have goku help gohan against cell goku i believe was a ss2, the reason being that his sons life was at stake, he would be dumb to use a form he knew he was weaker than broly to fight him. even so, broly overpowered them, 2 ss2's and a ss1. it was not until trunks attack collided with a reinforcing shot from broly that it went wrong, an explosion was seen on his attack, broly tried to shoot more blasts to repair, yet the damage was done, the attack weakened the trio managed to break his weakened attack. broly tried to stop them with a new attack, but they failed to connect with the beams head. so he tried to put up a shield, but he didn't have enough time. the force blew him out towards the sun in speeds greater than the speed of light. yet the beam did not hurt him, like cooler was not hurt by his attack. broly died as he was plunged through the sun.</p>
<p>just think that the leeching part might be worth adding, unless someone can explain why its even present in the movie and does not mean just what i wrote.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok I am getting kind of tired explaining his stuff. Also you are trying to turn this into a opinion forum.</dd>
<dd>1st do not try and use common sense to explain something that as no official record of existing. Take Goku and Broly's fight. Has a official record of Goku "leeching" the remaining powers to beat Broly come out? No. the lighting could be and most like was to show two strong similiar powers colliding not Goku leeching. I look at the movie many time and I will say what you wrote does seem plausible but something YOU should remember if you really watch and listen to the movie, watch it in the Japanese dialodge. After Broly is beat and Goku is about to teleport his friends and himself to safety his says and I will state it "DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE OUR POWER!" That there should let you know something too. So until a real source and not your opinion came to light it will remain that it was the combined powers of the 4 SSJs and SN that beat Broly.</dd>
<dd>2nd. This matter has and is being discussed on the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Talk%7EBroly%7E_Second_Coming_afd5.html" title="Talk:Broly: Second Coming">Talk: Broly: Second Coming</a> about Gohan and this SSJ2 theroy. Again dispite how Gohan looks and you can not go by the face or "FEETS" (with is the dummiest excuse I ever seen use on distingishing the two forms) of a saiyan in either SSJ form because there are really no really physical changes except hair and aura. And if you remember when a saiyan becomes a SSJ2 after they transform the electric aura is present. It is during the battle the lightning disappears. However I will not deny that it is possible the he was SSJ2 in the movie. Possible but strongly unlikely and you can't again use common sense to explain a plot in a movie you did not help to create, like the part about Gohan and Goku where SSJ2 because there family was in trouble. Just because they have the ability does not mean they will use it all the time. Now I said that it was possible that Gohan did go SSJ2 but Goku did not WHAT SO EVER go SSJ2. First off the movie came out before Goku even used it in the series and in the series it is a official fact that this was the first time Goku bacame a SSJ2 not in Movie 10. Also the blast battle they ALL were SSJ. Since you state look at the hair and face. Gohan and Goku's hair was their SSJ hair not their SSJ2 Hair style. Condradiction number one on you part</dd>
<dd>3rd This is a canon and official fact and if you don't believe me, read the manga, look close at the anime. Gohan does not fight Dabura as a SSJ2. In the Buu saga Gohan becomes a SSJ2 only one time and that is when Kibito demanded him to transfrom into a SSJ and Gohan stated and transformed into a Super Saiyan that surpasses the limits of a Super Saiyan, in turn the original description or a SSJ2. Other than that Gohan does not become a SSJ2 anymore. Not when Videl was getting her A-- beat and he was about to save her in the tournament, not fighting Dabura, not fight Buu the first, not when he pulled out the Z-Sword, not when he trained with the Z-Sword, not one time after that. So you can keep your opinion on the but the facts are the facts.</dd>
<dd>4th you just answered you own question or rather condicted yourself again (number two) on your own statement and in you statement, "goku was there because broly saw him. cell did not see goku so he was there, <b>also a wish was made cause the dragonballs scattered afterwards, no wish was made to have goku help gohan against cell</b>" Now how crazy you sound. One thing in the Cell Games, Goku was only shown to show us he was with his son but you seem to forget Goku was with Kaiosama (King Kai) in on Snake Way during the battle and was using Kaiosama to talk to his son. He did not appear on earth until seven years later. That is why Cell or Gohan on anyone watching the battle did not see Goku. If you really watch Dragon Ball and not bits and pieces, how many times have ghost and spirits been used in Dragon Ball history and are seen on earth and are seen by living people? In every series from the original to GT serie and movies. Also have you forgotten a MAJOR fact about the Dragon Ball? The Dragon Ball can only wish a person back to life once. As stated many times in the series during Kami's term and during Dende, thats why they go to Namek and New Namek or use the Namek Dragon Balls. Two: if the Dragon Balls could wish a person back a second time they have a year to be wished back or they can not come back to life with a wish at all. Goku has been dead for seven years now. Only through other means like someone alive giving their life for someone else as seen when Dai Rou Kaioshinsama gave his life and gave it to Goku. But a image or a spirit maybe able to be seen for a moment and also Goku did not have the infamous Halo on his head. So I do not despute or agrue that fact that Goku was there but was he really there to actually help defeat Broly or there as a spirit to guide his sons to victory. That is the real question. The only people that truly know that is Toei studios. possible Funimation and the movie narrator. Not us, not our opinions.</dd>

<dd>I know it was not you Shadow. I wasn't talking to you about that. I also wanna revert something with something else in its place. I said that Goku told Braoly after being beat when he was about to teleport out that not to underestimate our power. But I was somewhat wrong. That was from an old wannabe translation VHS I got years ago. BUT what he really said was OUR POWER WINS!!! Still showing you that Goku did not leech power from Broly. So don't go using common sense to explain your theory and opinions when the ending was meant to be the way the movie ended. With Goku and his friends powers that beat Broly. And that is from the original japanese translation.</dd>
<dd>However this is to you shadow. I went over and over that movie, Movie 8. My old tapes of fan made translations and I looked at the movie in Funimation dub and the Funimation translation of japanese, and NO where in any of the movie dialodge does it say anything about Broly being a Saiyan God. NOWHERE in the movie.</dd>

<p>i remeber i herd it someware the point is i didint make it up (shadow)</p>
<p>Vegeta said it (in the uncut funimation dub and as far as I know its accurate) but he said it to Paragus out of mostly fear, I believe his exact qoute, and I may be wrong, was "We can't defeat him, he is a god..." Now this was Vegeta's fear talking and in no way makes Broly the actual sayain God and unless told to us by Toei or whatever it is only Vegeta's opinion, he is mortal too. Also this is not a forum and no body is saying Broly is not strong but he was killed off, could his powers have been greater than anyone elses? of course, but the fact is he died, end of story.

<p>As I viewed Broly many times in his movies, I realize that his Super Saiyan Form at max is the same form that Trunks achieved during his fight with Cell before the Cell Games got started. As for how he performed in the mode, he was a tad bit more faster and way stronger than Goku and the others due to his unusual power. Anyways, more to the point, I was thinking maybe someone should add in a small hint of information letting the readers know what actual form Broly had achieve rather than calling it Legendary Super Saiyan Form. (But that is of course up to them.)</p>
<p>from calm, base mode to controlled Super Saiyan mode to Super Saiyan 1 mode and to Legendary Super Saiyan Muscle mode. This is how I see it, but it is up to those writing about him to add this.

<p>At birth, Goku was born with a power level of 2, while Broly was born with the astonishing level of 10,000.</p>

<p>Now, where is this referenced? Anime? Which episode? Manga? Which volume? Daizenshuu? What is that? I continue reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an unusually high level of strength, especially for a newly born Saiyan infant, considering that Raditz, who was an average low level adult Saiyan warrior, had a power level of 1,200 in his first appearance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First appearance? When? I could continue this way for every paragraph if necessary. Remember, this article needs to be useful for casual users, not only for fans. Even some fans may question from where the information comes. There is not even a standard "References" section, at least listing the anime episodes, OAVs, and manga volumes that have been used as references.

<p>Since most of the Dragon Ball character pages have their original Japanese names, I was wondering if this page should list his name as Broli instead of Broly to fit in with the rest of the pages.

<dd>Dragon Ball characters are listed by their official English name(which is the manga name if they appeared in the manga).

<dd>That's not the case. If it were, the Vegetto page would be titled "Vegerot" and the Majin Buu page would be titled "djinn Boo". Just because FUNimation and/or Viz spell it a certain way hardly makes it official. Since the names are intended to be puns, the spelling closest to it should be the "official" one. In this case it would be either Broli or Brolli. Also the characters name when romanized from Katakana translates as "Burori", so at the very least it should use the "i" instead of the "y".<a href="../../../g/i/_/User%7EGI_Judd_968a.html" title="User:GI Judd">GI Judd</a> 18:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bumping. When I take action I'm told to discuss. When I discuss I get two comments and then it goes uncommented on. So, should Broly be used, or Broli? Broli's name is a pun on Broccoli. FUNimation went with the spelling Broly, even though Broccoli doesn't have a y in it. The Japanese romanji is Burori, which, when one takes the name pun into concideration, should translate to Broli, and is the name used in the subtitles for the Japanese version provided on the FUNimation DVDs. So what should we use, and don't bring up that "Most results from google" bullshit, thats what redirects are for. What diffrent does it make if someone types in Broly and goes to a page called Broli with a picture of the character they know as Broli on it? It'll be obvious to them that this page just uses a diffrent spelling. <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuthehedgehog_00ac.html" title="User:Takuthehedgehog">Takuthehedgehog</a> 06:00, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, the section really is pointless. He never really named any of his attacks. He just charged up a tiny little green energy ball and threw it. However the video games are the only thing we have for reference, since it is the only thing out there that names his attacks and can at least be considered official.

<p>Broly is not an important character, he's probably a quatrary character. Lots of secondary and tertiary characters have already nonsensically been merged, so there's no logical reason that this even lesser character who appears in 2 movies as an organic form and 1 movie as an inorganic construct to have his own page. This character is probably one of the least important in the dbz universe, especially based on appearance, air time, and amount of importance to the overall storyline. A filler character altogether, he holds no grounds to have his own page when way more important characters have already been merged. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 149.68.164.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_149.68.164.76_02c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/149.68.164.76">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>I personally like Broly...but I agree that he isn't as important and it makes sense to merge him since more important characters have already been merged. - 69.86.243.244</p>
