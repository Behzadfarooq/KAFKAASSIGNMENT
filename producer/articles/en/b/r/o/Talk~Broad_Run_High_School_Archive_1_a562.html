<h2><span class="mw-headline">Broadlands High School Zone</span></h2>
<p>From what I know, Broadlands was part of Broad Run's attendance area until 2000 when Stone Bridge opened, and students who lived in Broadlands went to Stone Bridge until 2005 when Briar Woods opened. As far as I know, no one from Broadlands went to Broad Run after Stone Bridge opened and the class of 2002 graduated from BRHS (as some students stayed rather than went to SB).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">School Rival</span></h2>
<p>Interesting issue: who is Broad Run's rival now. It used to be Stone Bridge when it first opened, and SBHS is still listed in the Infobox as a rival and the Rivalries section focuses exclusively on SBHS. However, this year Broad Run barely competes with Stone Bridge in any sport. I question whether this info is still applicable. Of course that raises the question of just who is BRHS's rival.&#160;??????</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Answer to BRHS' Rival</span></h3>
<p>Broad Run's rival is still Stone Bridge despite their move to AAA, and Stone Bridge will remain there until at least 2009, but probably indefinitely since they are doing really well in the Northern Region. BR and SB don't play each other in football which may be the reason why many think the rivalry is gone. The reason why SB won't play BR or any AA school is because of the power points system the VHSL uses, not because of BR's "not so great" program. This points system gives more points to wins over AAA schools than AA's, etc. This is how Park View got to the playoffs last year though their record was worse than Heritage's as the Patriots played Valley and Herndon, while Heritage played single A schools out in West Virginia like the rest of the Loudoun AA schools who are either too scared to play AAA schools nearby, or AAA schools who don't want to lose power points by playing Loudoun schools. My guess is both. Valley still plays County and PV as non district opponents, Stone Bridge could too, but the Vikings are playing them at their risk; if their district record isn't like last year's they may be snubbed. Given SB's reputation in football, they will not play any AA's which basically alienates them from all the Loudoun schools now except Valley, but this will ultimately help them get a better seed in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Anyway, in almost every other sport that I know of, BR and SB will play each other at least once; it was that way last year so they still are rivals, and will always be so. Before SB opened, BR's primary rival was Park View, especially when there were only four Loudoun County high schools. This rivalry is starting to come back because Dominion and Potomac Falls are very close to each other on the north side of Route 7 (PV is south); and also Stone Bridge is AAA too.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposing an updated &amp; new format for summary box</span></h2>
<p>I've put together a new format for the LCPS summary box that can be placed at the end of each LCPS school article. It's also been updated to include all current schools. Comments and suggestions are welcome. See the example below — <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimDunning_047e.html" title="User:JimDunning">Jim Dunning</a> 16:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's get a higher rating for this article!</span></h2>
<p><b>I think we have an excellent article here and it would be great if we could get some recognition for it.</b> The Broad Run HS article is part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Virginia_983e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Virginia</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Schools</a>, and currently has a <b>Start-Class</b> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Virginia_Assessment_0c2d.html#Quality_scale" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia/Assessment">rating</a> for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Virginia_983e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Virginia</a>. In reviewing the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Virginia_Assessment_0c2d.html#Quality_scale" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia/Assessment">rating scale</a> requirements it appears the only significant area we lack in to advance to a <b>B-Class</b> rating is a sufficent number of citations.</p>
<p>I propose we review all "facts" in the article and identify as many source citations as we can (and re-evaluate questionable info in the process). Not only will this improve the article's readability, support raising the article quality rating, <i>but will set a good example to school students with regard to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> issues</i>. This will also facilitate updating data that changes changes regularly.</p>
<p>Also, to be consistent with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Infobox_templates" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">WikiProject-Schools Infobox requirements</a>, we should consider replacing the current Infobox with one of the standard project templates. I don't know who created the existing one since we have only an IP address (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.239.45.20_339f.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.239.45.20">Special:Contributions/128.239.45.20</a>), but it is certainly attractive. However, because it is all done in <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">html mark-up</a> it is difficult for the average contributor to maintain; a template would mitigate this issue. Here are some candidates for the replacement —</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_School_7d1a.html" title="Template:Infobox School">Template:Infobox School</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_HighSchool_b49b.html" title="Template:Infobox HighSchool">Template:Infobox HighSchool</a></li>

<p>Maybe 128.239.45.20 obtained a UserName after February 2006 and is still a regular contributor. If so, she/he should weigh in on this.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimDunning_047e.html" title="User:JimDunning">Jim Dunning</a> 18:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">128.239 guy</span></h3>
<p>That guy was me. As with the school box templates, I don't mind them for the most part, but they seem to be a bit limiting sometimes, but the font for the templates is a bit larger so it's fine I assume. We might as well put them up for all 10 Loudoun County high schools if we want them that way.</p>
<p>As with the LCPS template box, that looks sweet. The only concerns are aesthetic, which are the LCPS gif on the top right which doesn't look balanced. The other one is the wordiness of the box. For example, "Hutchison Farm Elementary School - South Riding" in my opinion is too wordy, when "Hutchison Farm" should suffice. If a school is named after someone, like John Tolbert ES or Simpson MS, a link that says "Tolbert" or "Simpson" should be good enough. Informal nicknames for schools should not be used, such as "Pot Falls" for Potomac Falls; "Valley" or "County" is common in Loudoun County, but people not familiar with the verbiage would better know them as Loudoun Valley and Loudoun County respectively. <a href="../../../2/0/1/User%7E20176.html" title="User:20176">20176</a> 01:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, 20176, thanks for all your hard (and excellent) work on things Loudoun County! I thought it might be you since the "128.239 guy" disappeared when 20176 began. Thanks for the feedback. Are you using MSIE? I should've looked at the summary box through IE (I use Firefox) when I finished the coding, but forgot. In Firefox the logos are balanced, but there is an issue with IE. I'll work on that over the next few days.</dd>

<dd>I see your point on the wordiness of the school names, but I see some value in displaying the community location in the box. Take a look above at the ESs section and see if it improved.

<dd>I use both, but now I see that Firefox showed the logos balanced out. As with the wording of schools, I changed it again to the following.
<ul>
<li>Normally a school on the box would be named for example "Seldens Landing (Leesburg)." The school name is given, and its town is in parentheses.</li>
<li>If a school is named after a person, with the exception of one LCPS school, the school is referred to the person's last name, like Simpson MS and Tolbert ES are worded. The exception is Frances Hazel Reid ES of Leesburg which is referred by most in central Loudoun by its full name rather than "Reid." This may change soon because the school is pretty new right now.</li>
<li>If a school's name is the same as the town it is in, the town's name is not included, because I thought it would be redundant. Examples include Sterling ES, Sterling MS, Waterford ES, etc.</li>
<li>With the exception of South Riding, schools' towns are typically referred to its designated city name according to the USPS in their <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp|zip" class="external text" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp|zip" rel="nofollow">+4 website</a>. For example, River Bend MS and Potomac Falls are adjacent to each other and could be in "Potomac Falls, VA," but the USPS says they are in Sterling though "Potomac Falls" is "acceptable". Same goes for schools in Brambleton and Broadlands, which are located in Ashburn, and Lansdowne schools which are located in Leesburg. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_20176_5080.html" title="Special:Contributions/20176">20176</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/1/User_talk%7E20176.html" title="User talk:20176">talk</a>) 05:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>It looks great and I like the naming guidelines (thanks). I reformatted a little to give the list some whitespace breathing room. I'm trying to think of anything we're missing? I'll work on the cell-size issue vis-a-vis IE over the next day or two and then go ahead and put it on the school pages. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimDunning_047e.html" title="User:JimDunning">Jim Dunning</a> 05:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What reason do you have for using the USPS guide for the town naming? I would think it makes more sense to follow what LCPS identifies it as residing in. For example, Potomac Falls is located in "Sterling", but its site states is address as being in "Potomac Falls, VA". It would make more sense to me that as long as the name is acceptable for USPS, follow the name the school uses. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny06man_5565.html" title="User:Johnny06man">Johnny06man</a> 04:27, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, when I reverted I thought I had included a note that mentioned the entry needed to be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. Apparently I didn't; my bad. I'm sorry. I have to admit I initially thought the entry was vandalism, but I did try to find verification online, and even asked a couple students in BR at the time if they knew of the event and I came up with naught. If you can provide some sort of cite for it we can put it back in.</dd>
<dd>In hindsight I probably should have brought it up on the Talk page, but I'm concerned that there are too many non-cited facts in this article as it is. If you can find a citation for it, that would be great. Sorry again -- I didn't intend to offend.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BRHS Revamp</span></h2>
<p>This article has been renovated: new sections and subsections have been added (Students, Campus, Publications, etc.), existing ones have been expanded and/or revised (Curriculum and some Extracurricular activities), and citations have been located for existing and new info. Additionally, some of the topics were reordered to be consistent with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">WikiProject Schools</a>.</p>
<p>The edit was done in two stages to facilitate review and further revision.</p>
<p>The first revision stage covers only the changes to existing topics and addition of new sections without reordering the topics. This was done to make it easier to review content changes without worrying about where it got moved to. A noticeable change is the replacement of the original Infobox created by <a href="../../../2/0/1/User%7E20176.html" title="User:20176">20176</a> with one of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Infobox_templates" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">standard templates</a> suggested by the Project. Although I think 20176's work is better looking and certainly covered all the "info" bases, a standard template is easier to maintain by contributors not as familiar with html mark-up as 20176 is.</p>
<p>The second stage was the reordering (and addition) of topics to match the suggested format at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Structure" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">WikiProject Schools - Structure</a> —</p>

<p>There is an area of content concern: after putting together the overview section on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Run_High_School_1e8c.html#Curriculum" title="Broad Run High School">Curriculum</a> and reviewing the suggestions at the Project page, I think it's overdone. On the other hand, this information could be of interest to some readers, especially those from outside the US. Since all LCPS schools have similar curricula, an alternative might be to move it to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loudoun_County_Public_Schools_39fa.html" title="Loudoun County Public Schools">Loudoun County Public Schools</a>, using it as starter yeast for a section on district curriculum (of course then changing it to cover all county schools).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Band section revamp</span></h2>
<p>I tightened up the copy for the Band section. In the process I decided to remove the Nederynen murder part (although Eric was a band member, this story is not encyclopedic and relevant to the band only). We could argue that it could be included somewhere in the article since the tragedy affected the whole school, but then we are faced with the question of whether or not to include other tragedies affecting BRHS as a whole (car accidents, shootings, suicides, even the DC Sniper). But then we would have to show how these events affect BR differently or more uniquely than other high schools.</p>
<p>Also, the Jeffrey Kelley incident has been made more concise. At first blush it could be grouped with the other incidents described above and removed completely, but the relatively high turnover of band directors is relevant to the article. I did remove, however, the first-hand information that can't be verified independently (remember: <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> is not the same as truth; I'm not questioning the verisimilitude of the information). I'm not questioning the contributor's information. We had some discussion on this earlier this year, but since then I've had opportunity to become more familiar with Wikipedia's style and guidelines. Thus, I think the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">"original research"</a> needs removal.</p>

<dd>Some LCPS news releases might have stories on players signing letters of intent to play for these schools. I can't remember how far back the archive goes on the main web site, but that would be a good place to check. I can think of one player in particular (Jenny Clohan). She plays softball at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Madison_University_7f44.html" title="James Madison University">James Madison University</a>, which competes in Division I.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">GA review</span></h2>
<p>This is an excellent article. It is well-written, well-sourced, tight on-topic, appropriate length (and detail), and should be nominated for FA. Having reviewed many articles, I am quite impressed with this one. A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full dates should be written like this [[January 6]], [[2007]] Readers can then set their preferences to see the dates in the format that they are most comfortable with.</li>
<li>Most of the time photographs and graphics should be inserted like this: [[Image:Example.jpg|thumb|caption]] . If the author does not specify the number of pixels, then the reader's default value is used for thumnails. Users with 21" screens likely prefer larger thumbs than users with 14" screens. By specifying, all users see the same size.</li>
<li>Numerical ranges should use a – instead of a -. (See <a href="../../../n/d/a/Ndash.html" title="Ndash">ndash</a>)</li>
<li>The article is inconsistent with respect to commas preceding the word "and" prior to the last of a series of items. (I didn't attempt to fix this one.)</li>
<li>The article could use some photographs around campus. Surely there are photogenic spots. Maybe a photo of the marching band or color guard, or a cover of the literary magazine could be obtained.<br />
good luck and happy editing! <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppraiser_5597.html" title="User:Appraiser">Appraiser</a> 16:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sterling residents attending Broad Run</span></h2>
<p>The article contains a line stating "A limited number of students living in neighboring communities outside the current attendance boundary, such as <b>Sterling</b>, South Riding, Ashburn Farm and Brambleton also attend as a result of frequent boundary change "grandfathering"." I think the inclusion of Sterling is no longer accurate. Boundary changes before the 2003-04 school year removed Countryside and Cascades from the Broad Run district. Correct me if I'm wrong, but no other parts of Sterling were sent to Broad Run after this. Grandfathering only applied to the rising-junior and senior classes at the time. They graduated in 2005, and for the few of us who managed to obtain extraordinary exceptions when we were freshmen graduated in 2006. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, I will remove the statement. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny06man_5565.html" title="User:Johnny06man">Johnny06man</a> 22:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the same goes for students in Ashburn Farm and Brambleton, because they moved to Stone Bridge's attendance zone. Stone Bridge is in Ashburn Farm and the land that became Brambleton was moved from Broad Run to Stone Bridge in 2002 when Heritage opened. South Riding did stay at BR until Freedom opened. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_20176_5080.html" title="Special:Contributions/20176">20176</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/1/User_talk%7E20176.html" title="User talk:20176">talk</a>) 19:23, 7 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li>Agreed here. If we want this to become FA, we should use as many free images as possible, not fair-use. Instead of the logo, maybe a picture of the school?

<li>I kind of agree here. Not so much for the length, but I think it looks weird to have a section with 1 subsection.

Demographics was the only one that seemed to fit easily. The other ones have enough to qualify a new subsection.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lots of new citation tags</span></h2>
<p>I went back through the article attempting to fix weasel words. I think I got all of them, but as I went along I became more enthralled in tagging unconfirmed statements. Many of the ones I tagged might not need them, and if you disagree feel free to remove them, but at least try to find a cite first. Some may be easy, others could be quite difficult. The major things I found were boundary lines (so many redrawn ones, can we find records or confirmation of these shifts?) and the rivalries section. I like the concept, but a lot of what is said seems to be conjecture. Can we find proof of attendance at these games, and are they significantly higher than other ones? Schedules of different sports to show that they still compete against one another? That should be enough to continue meriting inclusion. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny06man_5565.html" title="User:Johnny06man">Johnny06man</a> 02:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In reviewing this I need to understand better citation practice and how we indicate that a reference covers more than one sentence or a whole paragraph. Also, this seems like way too many cites. Mmmmm . . . . Time to ruminate.</p>

<dd>I agree, they do seem excessive, but I would rather err on the side of caution. And as you said, some of the citations should apply to the whole paragraph. Maybe for this we should just leave the ref tag at the end of the paragraph? As for removing the tags from the article, it would increase the readability, but we shouldn't try to hide that they are not sourced. This just encourages us to find more sources quicker&#160;:) We can still check stuff off here to keep a better record. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny06man_5565.html" title="User:Johnny06man">Johnny06man</a> 03:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atmosphere</span></h2>
<p>This article is basically going over the statistics and general facts about the school, which is good and classic of Wikipedia entries, but the atmosphere and what actually goes on in school is a huge part of the high school.

While the page List of High School Subcultures has gained alot of scrutiny, I believe that the BRHS page could pull it off. Of course, I wouldn't put it in yet, as I'd really like to make sure it's well-written and as non-biased as possible.

<dd>We probably can, as you said. But if the article were to become a featured article and ever shown on the main page, the main page can only use free images. It makes more sense to make the primary picture something that is free and does not have the fair use conditions attached. I have no problem putting the logo back in, but I dislike having an image in part of the introduction. IMO, it makes it look crammed into the space, and we can put it in other places in the article that need images in the sections. BTW, really great work on all the history and statistical data! It definitely adds to the article. If we can get the rest of the cites needed, I will put the article up for peer review, and barring any major issues, nominate it for FA status. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny06man_5565.html" title="User:Johnny06man">Johnny06man</a> 02:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
