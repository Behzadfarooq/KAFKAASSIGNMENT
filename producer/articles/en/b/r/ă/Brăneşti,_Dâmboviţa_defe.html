	    <p><b>Brăneşti</b> is a commune in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dambovita.html" title="Dambovita">Dambovita</a> county, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>. The name <a href="../../../b/r/%C4%83/Br%C4%83ne%C5%9Fti.html" title="Brăneşti">Brăneşti</a> ascribed to this village placed on the right side of Ialomita river may be found in other counties of Romania as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timi%C5%9F.html" title="Timiş">Timiş</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gala%C5%A3i.html" title="Galaţi">Galaţi</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorj.html" title="Gorj">Gorj</a> or <a href="../../../i/l/f/Ilfov.html" title="Ilfov">Ilfov</a>.</p>
<p>The Commune of Brăneşti is sited in the northern part of Dambovita county, on the parallel of 45˚1’60” N and the meridian of 25˚25’ E. Neighbors: N and N-E Pucioasa, E Glodeni, S Vulcana Pandele, V and N-V Vulcana Băi. The length and the width are of 4 km, respectively 1km. The altitude at which the village is found measures less than 400 m related to the sea level. The weather is gentle temperate influenced by the Ialomitza river local weather. Ialomitza river and many more small rivers furrow the village territory: Peter’s Creek (Pârâul lui Pătru), Border’s Dale (Vâlceaua Hotarului), Pripor’s Creek (Pârâul Priporului), Forelock’s Creek (Pârâul Cârlionţu). Over the time the village has suffered many modifications in surface and administrative-territorial components. Up to 1955 the commune of Branesti was compound by three villages: Brăneşti, Scârlenţa and Priboiu. The new administration divided the place by attaching at Pucioasa the Scarlenta territory and to Brăneşti the territory of Vulcana Pandele. In 2002 the commune had 9245 inhabitants and was composed by three villages’ Brăneşti, Priboiu and Vulcana Pandele. In 2002 following a Romanian Govern Decision, the commune was again divided such its villages remain only Brăneşti and Priboiu, having 4261 inhabitants on a territorial surface of 1795 hectares.</p>
<p>For the first time, the commune’s name was mentioned in writing on 28 March 1451 with the occasion of Radu’s fortune donation to the Deal monastery. Among those 17 witnesses participating at this donation was recorded Dragomir from Brăneşti. During Middle Age the place was lived by free people (moshneni) that were involved in occupations as: agriculture, producing lime, brickwork, carpentry, forge, tissue, fruits and animals commerce etc.</p>
<p>The inhabitant’s participation at the First and Second World War had been made with human sacrifices and material aids: food, textiles, uniforms etc. For those deceased in battle a monument near the mayoralty and a memorial stone inside the “The Annunciation” (Buna Vestire) church have been built.</p>
<p>In 2002 a statistical analysis made here indicated:</p>
<p>- Romanians formed the majority ethnic structure of the place. Excepting Romanians there still were: 1Gipsy, 1 Hungarian and 1 Polish</p>
<p>- The religious structure: 4 Romano-catholics, 2 Reformats, 13 Pentecostals, 1 Greek-catholic, 10 Baptists, 30 Adventists of the seventh day, 1 Unitarian, 9 Christians from the Gospels, 57 evangelists, 1 non-declared and the remaining inhabitants up to 9245 were Orthodox.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Culture and Cults, The National Institute of Historical Monuments declared as historical monuments many houses from Branesti, among which are: Mihai Rizescu House, Ghiţă Râmbu House, Nicolae Bucur House, Culiţă Râmbu House, Serafim Mihăilă House, Ion Marinescu House, Stana Tâlvan House etc. All those houses are dated starting 1859.</p>
<p>Built in 1905, the actual studio house “Gabriel Popescu” has been donated to the community as museum in august 1969 by the advocate Eliza Popescu, the engraver niece with the furniture, book-case, personal objects of the family, documents, engravings, books etc.</p>
<p>The Annunciation (Buna Vestire) church has been sanctified in 12 September 1943 and has been constructed by the inhabitants and Stan Rizescu’s contribution. That building replaced the old church having the same name built in 1779 November 7 that in his turn had been built in the place of an older wood church. Starting 1622 up to 1775 inside the village 19 ministers and 12 vicars have served: 1622 minister Tudor, 1642 vicar Nicoară, 1697 minister Neagoe, 1743 minister Neacşu, 1775 minister Ion. Between 1817-1824, 8 ministers and 6 vicars have been recorded. Excepting this church on the Branesti territory there are another church having the name of Saint Nicolas, being dated 1779.</p>
<p>Near Brăneşti exists Bunea monastery. In the well-founded paper of the monastery,” zapisul de danie al moşnenilor din Brăneşti,” it is written that:” on the Vîlcana Hill, the boyar Vâlcu of Orbeasca and his sons want to built a monastery”. Into a documented paper of the Prince Şerban Cantacuzino from 1687 the monastery name can be found also with the name of "schitul de la Vîlcana”. The founder of this monastery was Bunea Gradisteanu that has been retried in these places and fleeing of Turks afraid coming to help Constantine Basarab, Matei Basarab’s cousin, to take the throne. Swearing to build here a monastery if he would be left alive, he really built it in 1654. Along the years the church will suffer many architectural modifications.</p>

<p>Inside the commune there are two schools one in Brăneşti village and the other one in Priboiu. Around 1800, the scholar life has been evolved inside church only by priests’ or vicars’ help and there was no building dedicated to this purpose. In 1909 the school found own place by finishing the building special risen for education purposes.</p>
<p>The scholar life has been completed by cultural life. In Branesti exists an coral formation named “ Cântarea Brăneşteană” that forms up 60 members. Those people have different occupations: farmers, teachers, engineers, traders etc. This chorus, under the guidance of the conductor Dumitru Bendic, interpreted on several scenes in the country as Galaţi, Câmpina, Sinaia, Bucureşti, Piteşti, Braşov etc but, also on the foreigner scenes in Germany, Belgium, France, Bulgaria, ex-Yugoslavia etc. The selected repertoire is composed by Romanian creations belonging to Al. Paşcanu, Gh. Cucu, N. Lungu, M. Neagu but, also contains the pieces from international repertoire belonging to K.M von Weber, P.I. Ceaikovski, Gr. Sicher etc</p>
<p>After 1885 the Romanian Tissue Industry has been born by the initiative of Stan Rizescu, the person that created the first Romanian Cotton Manufactory bringing here the first cotton loom and the first linen and hemp spinning-mill.</p>
<p>So, the occupational structure has been modified. The first workers appear here. After the industry appearance, the public bath place and the cinema - the second after Bucharest- have been built. A new school and even a bank appeared. In 1909 occasioned by the school’s inauguration, king Carol I together the Ministry of Education Spiru Haret and the great George Enescu visited Branesti. During the First and the Second World War, the Textile Industry provided to the army materials and uniforms.</p>
<p>Prof. dr. Corneliu Cassasovici with Stan Rizescu assumed the technical management of the “ Stan Rizescu” factory in 1919. At that time, the factory was little. There were only 160 looms. Corneliu Cassasovici graduated in 1909 the Polytechnic School of Dresden, Germany and wrote several books and courses as: "Primary textile matter” , "Filature, and mechanic manufactory", "Bleaching and Painting”, "Textile Industry". In 1934, he created the "High School for Textiles" situated in the Polytechnic School of Bucharest. He was teacher and manager from the beginning up to 1945 year. During 15 years that includes and the economic crisis period 1926-1929, the looms number growth at 700. There have been installed also, the modern techniques for whitening and painting tissues, mercerizing and lining. After 1995 when the territory has been again divided, “Stan Rizescu” factory passed under Pucioasa city administration. Using its shops to deliver the products created in the factory all over the country, in many cities, the factory became independent from economic point of view.</p>
<p>In present, there are 26 companies registered in the Trade Register having the site located in Branesti. The activity domain is from trade up to the furniture creation, traveler’s transportation, construction, textile production, and real agencies.</p>
