I think the sentence <i>Soon after the industrial revolution, the town became one of the industrial centres of the Czech Republic</i> does not make sense; there was no Czech Republic "soon after the industrial revolution". I changed "Czech Republic" to "Moravia", but perhaps <i>The town is now (and has ben since the industrial revolution) an industrial center of the Czech Republic</i> would be more accurate? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 23:50, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, looks like the "Etymology" section just underwent a major edit.&#160; Sadly, and typically (this is my major complaint with Wikipedia), there is no source information given for the change.&#160; Is there someone out there who really knows what's up with the etymology of Brno?&#160; Does anyone know of sources for either of the opinions that have been part of this article?</p>
<p>Just quickly, my small knowledge of Russian and Czech tells me "brn" has little to do with the words for "clay" in either of those Slavic languages.&#160; Just an observation, though, as I don't really know the answer.</p>

<p>Looks like someone's been trying to talk about the Germans in the post-WWII atmosphere lately.&#160; I guess I don't have a problem with this being in the article, <i>if</i> it really happened.&#160; Some of the stuff added to the article in the last few days has been highly POV, so I've deleted it.&#160; Here, then, are my requirements for the stuff on the Germans being kicked out: write it in a non-POV manner <b>and</b> cite things as it's written.&#160; Otherwise, keep it out until someone can write it correctly.</p>

<dd>And now, more controversy.&#160; The original paragraph looked like this:</dd>
<dd>"The Second World War caused serious damage to Brno. During the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> occupation many Czech citizens were executed. All the German inhabitants (Brünner-Deutsche) were forced to leave their homeland after the war. About 40,000 Germans were forced to the Austrian border. Thousands of them died on the way (<i>Brünner Todesmarsch</i>, Brünn death march) due to exertion. The communist party came to power in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, ushering in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> era, which ended in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> with the <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velvet_Revolution_dc30.html" title="Velvet Revolution">Velvet Revolution</a>."</dd>
<dd>The part about the so-called <i>death march</i> is the controversial part.&#160; <a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten">User:Tulkolahten</a> made some edits which tried to improve on this, but his source was a Czech source, which is not neutral.&#160; FYI, German sources are also not neutral.&#160; Now, I deleted the paragraph.&#160; I don't know a lot about it, but if it's in there, like I said above, it needs to be POV and needs to cite neutral sources (i.e., some party who has no interest in the affair). — <a href="../../../v/-/b/User%7EV-ball_b2da.html" title="User:V-ball">John</a> 02:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent edits come from the source www.bruenn.org, but I would rather accept official sources like <a href="http://ois.muni.cz/coming_to_brno/brno/brief_history" class="external autonumber" title="http://ois.muni.cz/coming_to_brno/brno/brief_history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://www.brno.cz/toCP1250/index.php?nav01=2222&amp;lan=en&amp;nav02=5&amp;nav03=1556" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brno.cz/toCP1250/index.php?nav01=2222&amp;lan=en&amp;nav02=5&amp;nav03=1556" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, first one is University of Brno and second official pages. Regarding the name - Google test (Brno: 36 500 000, Brünn: 1 200 000). Also the Moravia was not <i>driven</i> by a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> which is a wrong historical term. Holy Roman Empire was an alliance of the catholic states based on the clerical principles and members one by one were completely sovereign. So it is not truth that Holy Roman Empire ruled Moravia. The city was also known as a Brinn, Brünn, Brunan or Brinnum depending on the spelling and used language <a href="http://mapserver.fsv.cvut.cz/antos/zoomify/coronelli.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mapserver.fsv.cvut.cz/antos/zoomify/coronelli.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, but using different name in different language should not be confused as an official name in these times. I would propose a compromise when articles about Germans would use Brünn (between 1620-1918) and about Czech Brno. Also building remaining today would not use Brünn but Brno. Brünn in the main article is mentioned in the topic's name and would not be used in the main article. Brünn would not be used after 1918 at all.

<p>Why do we dispute "Carlsbad vs. Karlovy Vary", "Brünn vs. Brno" etc.? The Netherlands were the part of Holy Roman Empire as well, Belgium even longer - why don't we dispute their German names, why only the places in Czech Republic must be written with they alternative German names? This article is in English, and the city of Brno is Czech-speaking. It makes sense to use the English name, if there is any English form; and it is essential to state that the official name is Brno. People who want to look for further information in Internet will need that name. But there is no reason to use the German, Italian, Russian or Greek name in English Wikipedia. The inclusion of the German form, even in the first place, might lead people to thinking that this name is today also official, and therefore useful for further research. But Brno is not German-speaking, neither has a German-speaking majority, nor uses German name as its official.<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonzula_7d52.html" title="User:Honzula">Honzula</a> 23:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With some more or less short war periods it had not been occupied very long before 1918. It was definitely not occupied by the Holy Roman Empire, similarly as the area of the present Germany was not. It was a (to a large extent independent) <b>part</b> of the Holy Roman Empire. BTW, Charles IV who ruled Bohemia from 1333 and resided in Prague bore also the title of the Roman Emperor from 1355, and nobody says that Germany was occupied by Bohemia in that time.</dd>
<dd>Habsburgs were chosen by Bohemian nobility to rule in Bohemia in 1526, nobody can talk about any occupation here as well. Again, Bohemia was one of parts of the multinational Habsburg Monarchy.</dd>
<dd>In the time of those empires there lived both ethnic Czechs and Germans in the area of the present Czech Republic. They spoke their languages and used their names of the towns. Some towns and villages were founded with a Czech (or let's say Slavic) name, which was later also Gemanized, some with a German name, which was later also Bohemized. But ethnic Germans did not start massive colonizing of some uninhabitted areas of Bohemia and Moravia earlier than in the 12th century and so German variants of Bohemian and Moravian towns could not be spread here before this (and I think that Brno was founded in the 11th century).</dd>
<dd>There are too many towns and villages in Europe in areas with a very complicated history and I do not find very useful to have long discussions with every single city and village to find out in which period of its history which of several versions of their names were prevailing. Most probably we would have to use a different version almost for every century. As Honzula wrote, this is English wikipedia, so we can use English variants like Prague, but versions used in the countries where the towns are situated nowadays in the rest of the articles. I can see no reason for using versions of other languages, but I consider useful to mention that they existed. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJan.Kamenicek_2e45.html" title="User:Jan.Kamenicek">Jan.Kamenicek</a> 01:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This argument is ridiculous. For the past century or so, it has been known as Brno. There is no English name for the city. Formerly the German name was used, however that practice ended a significant time ago. Any respected modern source lists it as Brno. Most atlases use Czech names for EVERY city in Czechia (except for Prague usually). So, please, instead of arguing with sockpuppets and fools just continue improving the article. +<a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexagon1_7aa4.html" title="User:Hexagon1">Hexagon1</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/x/User_talk%7EHexagon1_8a7c.html" title="User talk:Hexagon1">t</a>)</sup> 02:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. If you want Brünn instead of Brno, we should translate every Czech geographical name into German which <i>does not make any sens</i> even if for a long time these towns and places were officially called by the German way. Nowadays only few of Czech geographical names are generally known in their German transcriptions (e.g. Prague/Prag or Pilsen). Brno City or Brno is nowadays better known as Brno, not as Brünn (just "ask" your spell checker or some geographical pages). In this point of view I consider this discussion senseless. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaiche_b40f.html" title="User:Alaiche">Alaiche</a> 15:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Precedence on Wikipedia calls for using the city’s current name unless 1) it has a long-held popular version in English (like Prague) or 2) the article is addressing a specific point in time when another form was being used (as it would be anachronistic to substitute “Mexico City” for “Tenochtitlan” in an article on the Aztecs). Where Brno may have been officially called “Brünn” (e.g., while under Nazi control), it should be so noted, but otherwise treated as “Brno”. Where it had a mixed population, noting what each segment called it would be appropriate, but again it should be otherwise presented as “Brno”. While it was a part of the HRE, if it was usually referred to by its German or Latin names, then these should be so mentioned. If nothing else, that would be helpful to readers who are using this article as a reference to understand secondary, non-Wikipedia sources which might employ any of these alternatives. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 23:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Askari Mark's logic above. Considering that "Brünn" is frequently used in English text books when referring to the time period before the formation of Czechoslovakia, it makes sense to me that Brünn would at least be mentioned in the introduction (with <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28GN%29_da5e.html" title="WP:NC(GN)">WP:NC(GN)</a> in mind). My suggested opening is "<b>Brno</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Brünn</i></span>, known also by other <a href="#Etymology" title="">alternative names</a>) is the second-largest <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> in the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>.

<dd>That works for me! Can we reach a general consensus on that? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 02:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>If "Brünn" is frequently used in English text books</i> so why <i>"<b>Brno</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>: </i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brünn</span><i>..."</i>&#160;??

<dd>It's not like Brno or Brünn is a traditional "English" name like "Prague" or "Warsaw". The German name is largely used for pre-1918, while the Czech name is largely used for post-1918. The style I proposed matches the formatting used in hundreds (thousands?) of other European locality articles, a simple listing of the most important of the alternative names available. Clarification about how alternative names are used should be detailed in the body of the text (the Names/Etymology section), while the introduction should be relatively concise. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 14:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The German name for Prague is "Prag" and for Warsaw "Warschau". Moreover, as far as I know, there is no letter "ü" in English. Are you sure the <i>traditional "English" name</i> is Brünn? --<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonzula_7d52.html" title="User:Honzula">Honzula</a> 17:57, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm unaware of a traditional <i>English</i> name; few would probably know anything about it. The way such names usually get carried over into English, it would probably be rendered "Brunn" (rather than "Bruenn"). That's what often happens to German words with umlauts (e.g., "Konigsberg" for "Königsberg"), and it is most likely to have entered English usage through the German. Unless we explain it here, I doubt most English-speakers would know that Brünn and Brno are the same place; however, if they were come across the name in an English-language publication (book, map, etc.), a rendering of the Germanic name is the one they most likely would have encountered prior to the Velvet Revolution. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 18:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So, regarding this, I suggest the variant "<b>Brno</b> (<a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>: <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><i>Brunn</i></span>, known also by other <a href="#Etymology" title="">alternative names</a>)..."

<p>I did not say that "Brünn" is a traditional "English" name like Prague or Warsaw; rather I specifically stated the counter. As Askari Mark and I have pointed out, "Brünn" is often used to refer to the city when it was under German control, which was a considerable amount of the city's history. It is used in reference to specific time periods, not to the current city, but it is used often enough in texts that it warrants inclusion in the introduction. While "Brunn" has been used in English, it would be odd to include it in the introduction when "Brünn" is used more. If "Brunn" was the standard English name (which it is not), the article should be at <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunn.html" title="Brunn">Brunn</a> (which I am not advocating). Because of the city's multi-ethnic history and with <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28GN%29_da5e.html" title="WP:NC(GN)">WP:NC(GN)</a> in mind, it makes sense to include Brünn in the introduction, instead of there being only a single mention of it in the entire article. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 22:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Concerning <b>current usage</b> in the English language: While the article in the 1911 <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> started with <i>BRÜNN (Czech Brno)...</i>, the article in the current EB starts with <i>Brno, German Brünn, ...</i><br />
The index distinguishes "Brünn - see Brno" and "Brunn" (a town in Austria).<br />
Looking at examples of three famous people connected with this city before 1918, I find that according to the current EB,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_20cb.html" title="Kurt Gödel">Kurt Gödel</a> was born 1906, <i>Brünn, Austria-Hungary</i> (without even mentioning the name Brno)</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Mendel_b43a.html" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> died 1884, <i>Brünn, Austria-Hungary [now Brno, Czech Republic]</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek_fabe.html" title="Leoš Janáček">Leoš Janáček</a> (born 1854) <i>was a choirboy at Brno</i> (without even mentioning Brünn)</li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems that the current EB does use the name Brünn when the context suggest this -- in particular when talking about its German-speaking inhabitants. But EB is not 100% consistent in always pointing out the current name of the city.<br />

<dd>I did not want to suggest that "Brunn" was standard English and I apologize for any confusion. I was trying to show how umlauted words tend to be anglicized; "ü" is often replaced with "u", not the correct "ue" (and, in fact, I can't recall ever seeing it spelled "Bruenn" in English sources — rarely "Brunn", but usually "Brünn"). Let's keep it to <i>Brno (German: Brünn) ...</i>. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 00:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
