The official emblem is a Knight on a horse carrying a lance surrounded by a major arc with "Bremerton High School" written upon it. The origin of the school colors and mascot comes from the unification of West Bremerton Wildcats, whose colors were blue and gold, and the East Bremerton Knights, whose colors were red and silver. They chose the colors of West Bremerton and the mascot of East Bremerton giving us Bremerton High School's Knight along with Royal Blue and Gold as its colors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremerton_High_School_6af4.html" title="Edit section: Operation Pharmacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Operation Pharmacy</span></h2>
<p>Police and undercover detectives descended on Bremerton High School on the morning of January 23rd, 2007, making a wave of arrests and uncovering a multitude of drugs, including cocaine in one student's backpack.<br />
The bust was the culmination of a two-month long investigation by Bremerton Police Department's undercover narcotics unit, the Special Operations Group, which has ultimately led to total 17 arrests -- including eight at school today -- for suspected charges of marijuana, cocaine, Ecstasy and gun possession.<br />
Dubbed "Operation Pharmacy" -- coined by a high school student who told detectives that getting drugs at the high school was as prolific as at a drugstore -- detectives used operatives to make "controlled" buys in the weeks leading to the bust to collect evidence.<br />
Sgt. Randy Plumb said the school day was both the safest and most effective way to make the arrests, and praised efforts and accommodation by Bremerton High School teachers and others.<br />
Detectives and police patrol units moved into the school at about 10:45 a.m., Plumb said.<br />
The breakdown of the suspected charges in "Operation Pharmacy," according to the drug unit:<br />
13 are marijuana-related;<br />
Six are cocaine-related;<br />
Seven are related to MDMA, better known as Ecstasy;<br />
Four are firearms-related, three of which were transported or sold on school property, detectives said.<br />
More arrests are still to be made, said Plumb. Krista Carlson, spokeswoman for the Bremerton School District, said school staff will help police whenever any suspected crime becomes known.</p>
