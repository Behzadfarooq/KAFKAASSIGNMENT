<p>I reword the pages to make <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randonneuring.html" title="Randonneuring">Randonneuring</a> the main page.

<dd>Citations and clarification of 'Audax', 'allure libre', ACP &amp; RCP are needed. I think we need to sort out the historical content from the current situation.

<li>Audax riding in Australia, and the PBP involves brevets and does not include riding in formation or with a captain.</li>
<li>An 'audax ride' in Australia equates to 'Randonneuring'</li>
<li>In Australia, the 'brevet' usually refers to the card issued upon successful completion of an Audax ride</li>
<li>'Randonneuring' is a verb, not a noun? The noun is 'randonee' (tour)</li>
<li>While <b>Audax</b> may have referred in the past to the formal controlled group riding style with a captain, it doesn't now as far as I know. The <a href="../../../p/b/p/PBP_6011.html" title="PBP">PBP</a> article partly explains this</li>

<p>Agree it is a work in progress... In my <b>talk</b> under randonee, allure libre, and audax it is clear from web pages I have found and cited that the <b>audax</b> form is still a seperate practice that is still avaiable albeit confused and the term is misunderstood outside of france, belgium and holland. So therefore the PBP article is *wrong*. The <b>audax format is not dead. It was run last year (2006) and also in 2001 (as it is run every 5 years). The PBP article is probably just as tainted as was my brain until I took a serious look and actually started reading material outside of what I was being told by word of mouth... I think the RUSA.ORG site has a very good explanation of the current state of the term audax...</b></p>
<p>There are two PBPs... The one you think of that is run every 4 years in the allure libre format and the one that is run every 5 years in the <b>audax</b> format.</p>
<ul>
<li>The abuse of the term audax is confused with the noun randonneuring... Remeber that a Gerrund is a verb which can have 'ing' added to the end and become a noun. <b>cycling</b> is a noun if it is used as <b>I like cycling(n)</b>.. I am cycling(v). Or he likes <b>randonneuring</b> ...but it can also be a verb... A randonneur(n) who likes randonneuring(n) when the randonneur(n) is on a randonee(n) is a randonneuring(v) randonneur(n)! hee hee.. I've heard the term audax also confused to mean randonnee as much as I hear brevet being confused for randonnee... Though a brevet card is given for all events the time when it is most confusing is if you are not doing a <b>brevet</b> but a fleche and call it a brevet... Brevet is really the certificate which is what the card becomes after it is stamped...</li>

<p>As per comments on the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audax_%28cycling%29.html" title="Audax (cycling)">Audax (cycling)</a> article talk page:</p>
<p>The "true audax" style seems to well in the minority of activity these days, but it does rate a mention.</p>
<p>The approach I propose is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randonneur.html" title="Randonneur">Randonneur</a> the main article, with the history (including much of the content from <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audax_%28cycling%29.html" title="Audax (cycling)">Audax (cycling)</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28cycling%29.html" title="Brevet (cycling)">Brevet (cycling)</a></li>
<li>simplify <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audax_%28cycling%29.html" title="Audax (cycling)">Audax (cycling)</a> so that it is more like a definition, with competing uses (audax vs allure libre) in different countries</li>
<li>simplify <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28cycling%29.html" title="Brevet (cycling)">Brevet (cycling)</a> so that it just focuses on the brevet card</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you think this will work? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 11:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually when I first read the proposed merge that wasn't going anywhere my thoughts were very close:</p>
<ul>
<li>make <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randonneuring.html" title="Randonneuring">Randonneuring</a> the main article with history and stuff as you perscribe for <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randonneur.html" title="Randonneur">Randonneur</a></li>
<li>Make <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randonneur.html" title="Randonneur">Randonneur</a> a simpler article possibly discussing in the history section famous randonneurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Let me think about which one again... I may be willing to go with randonneur as main instead of randonneuring)</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audax_%28cycling%29.html" title="Audax (cycling)">Audax (cycling)</a> to be more defdinition like (also like the definition like format I used for <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allure_libre.html" title="Allure libre">allure libre</a></li>
<li>I was thinking about making <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28cycling%29.html" title="Brevet (cycling)">Brevet (cycling)</a> discuss a bit more because brevet is interchangable with the card (sigh) but again we are actually starting to see the light on this and I think we are starting to agree on organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>I discovered the French main PBP page last night and I think that I want to disect their format to see if it is something we can use pieces of... This is the main link... I started to look into their pages for randonneur and such but it is more generic and related to <b>hiking</b> type of stuff...</p>
<p>Anyway I like what you wrote and I'm going to hop on my bike for a little night riding and thing about this because we are close to figuring this out!</p>

<dd>The French PBP article would be a great reference. The word randonee in French is used for heaps of "trips", including ski touring. English speaking countries have morphed the original meaning of French words/terms such as randonee and audax into somewhat different (or more specific) usages - as long as we point this out and provide references (best including within article text with <b>&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;</b> tags) - this will clarify matters. If you haven't tried it, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/language_tools?hl=en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/language_tools?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google translate</a> is very useful for roughish translations of French - you can also get entire web pages translated too. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 02:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are too kind. I hope my frenchie friends don't take offense but French as a language got crippled when they tried to prevent migration of other <b>outsider</b> terms into the language. Possibly the largest difference between English and French is that with English there are a bazillion different words that are nearly the same but those subtle differences allows English to describe something in minute detail whereas in French a term as you showed gets watered down and lost when the subject is moved from one dominion to another.</p>
<p>I personally don't think that the words <b>audax</b> and <b>allure libre</b> should be miscombobulated because the French do recognize them to be applied (fr term) for different types of riding. It is like <b>football</b> which has one meaning inside the states and another outside. Will football become soccer? Are we going to have to say a <b>french audax</b> or will we have to say an <b>american permanent</b>? So I still think as long as U des Audax is around then audax is audax... Though in the frenchie site it lookes like they are saying <b>audax</b> and <b>raundonnuer</b> to distinguish audax and allure libre...</p>
<p>Oh I'm back from my night ride. Just a short one... I'm still leaning for Randonneuring to be the main page with links to randonneur and use the randonneur page for talking about famous randonneurs <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrestonjb_82a1.html" title="User:Prestonjb">Prestonjb</a> 04:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
