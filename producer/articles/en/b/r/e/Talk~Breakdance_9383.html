<p>Gymnasts also do flares on flat ground (not on the pommel horse). Breakdancers who aren't formally trained in gymnastics will usually "cheat" on their flares by not sustaining a constant position for the two hands on the ground. Thus, making it impossible to do pommel horse flares using these cheating flares. But still, it's all about style anyway... not power.</p>
<p>Gymnasts also spell the move as "flairs" while B-boys spell the move "flares". There are other very minor differences in form and technique, but the fundamental skill is visible in both.</p>

<p>There are so many histories on the "beginning" of breakdance. Instead of many people writing their own understanding, maybe we should list the facts (meaning evidence)? Some argue whether breakdance is based on other artforms or developed on its own. (I'm not sure of anything anymore....:) Instead of interpret quotes and info from 3rd parties, we should maybe quote directly from the famous b-boys and books? Then readers can interpret themselves. Just a thought... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThechamelon_db5d.html" title="User:Thechamelon">Thechamelon</a> 09:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi! The story about the RockSteady Crew being formed by a brazilian capoeira mestre is false. I think its not respectful for them to give wrong information about their origins. Quote: "THE CREATION OF THE ROCK STEADY CREW Written by Joe-Joe, The Original B.Boy, Rock Steady Crew '77</p>
<p><br />
Founded in 1977, the crew's original name was the "Untouchable Four B.Boys". It consisted of four members, Joe-Joe, Easy-Mike, Jimmy-Dee, and P.Body 170th. However, the demands of recruits enabled them to reconsider and look past the four-member title of restricted membership. As a result, a meeting was held in Echo Place, Bronx, NY, at the residence of Jamie White [AKA Jimmy-Dee]. It was there that the ROCK STEADY name was born despite the initial idea of creating an extra crew to extend the "Untouchable Four B.Boys". "</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from the history of the Rocksteady Crew. Clearly we see no Capoeira mestre there, just some NYC kids.</p>
<p>You can find the RSC history at Mr Wiggles (one of RSC members, he is also in the Electric Bogaloo and was in the Magnificent Force back in the days, he was there when breakin and popping were being born so I think his word has got credibility) homepage <a href="http://www.mrwiggles.biz/hip_hop_timeline.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mrwiggles.biz/hip_hop_timeline.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrwiggles.biz/hip_hop_timeline.htm</a></p>
<p>Also I find incorrect the many references to Capoeira that are included in the history of B.boyin´. Quoting again Mr Wiggles from <a href="http://www.mrwiggles.biz/misconceptions_of_hip_hop.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mrwiggles.biz/misconceptions_of_hip_hop.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrwiggles.biz/misconceptions_of_hip_hop.htm</a>&#160;: "-BBOYING WAS TAUGHT TO A GROUP OF YOUNG LATINOS BY A CAPOERA MAESTRO IN THE 70'S (CAPOEIRA IS A FORM OF MARTIAL ARTS, CREATED BY AFRICAN SLAVES AND DISGUISED AS A DANCE IN BRAZIL)." WHILE I DO AGREE THAT BBOYIN WAS INDIRECTLY INSPIRED BY THIS AFRICAN ART FORM. AND BBOYING DEFINITELY HAS ITS ROOTS IN AFRICAN DANCE. BUT I HAVEN'T MET A LATIN BBOY FROM BACK IN THE DAYS THAT CAN EVEN PRONOUNCE THE WORD CAPOEIRA. (MAN I CAN'T EVEN SPELL IT) THE STORY THAT BEST SIZES THIS ARGUMENT UP WAS A QUESTION POSED TO TWO OF OUR FOUR FATHERS OF BBOYIN "THE NIGGA TWINS", WHEN ASKED WHY DON'T YOU GUYS ( THE NIGGA TWINS ) GIVE CREDIT TO CAPOEIRA??? AND THERE REPLY WAS. I NEVER MET THIS GUY CAPOEIRA THAT YOUR TALKIN ABOUT BUT IF YOU BRING HIM TO ME ILL SEE IF I RECOGNIZE HIM. "</p>
<p>Having learnt both Capoeira and Breakin (although I´m into Breakin´ now, only), I can tell you that the apparent similitudes between both aren´t that great. Sure, both are played or danced in a circle. That´s logical, since when you´re breakin´, people are watching you, and the logical shape the people will form is a circle, since it allows most people to watch who is dancing. Music from Capoeira and Breakin´ have nothing in common. Headspins, Peu di Mao/90´s and some other of the few analogous moves between both aren´t done in the same way. In breakin´ the emphasis is put on doing the move the longest time, most difficult and flashiest way possible. This is the basis for the continual developing of breakin´, since everyone is striving to find new ways to do moves or whole new moves (which is more difficult). Instead capoeira has its set of moves, and you can´t move further from there. Take for instance an invert. Some b.boys now are doing inverts with their legs on lotus position because its a lot more difficult and amazing than a regular invert. In Capoeira you can´t really make up your own Invert! You must stick with the regular invert because that´s what a capoeira invert should look like. I hope you find my point. In fact I find that breakin´ has more moves similar to those of Kung Fu than to Capoeira. Based on these reasons I´m deleting the references to Capoeira and Mestre Jelon Vieira, since Breakin´ developed on its own from a number of influences, of which capoeira wasn´t that important, and its association with it (capoeira) is damaging the reputation of B.boyin Old Schoolers, making them look like simple imitators, when they created the most important urban dance style of the XX century. If someone doesn´t agree with this, please tell me why. Also state if you´re a Capoeirista or B.boy please. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EViolenciafriki_402e.html" title="User:Violenciafriki">Violenciafriki</a> 2:26 21 July 2005</p>
<p>Nice of you explaining it. I am not a master of b-boy history, just thaught it would be more wikipedic not to edit big sections without an explanation.

<p>First off, i´d like to explain that I removed a part of the article talking about goth and punk b.boys incorporating contortionist tricks into b.boying. This is CLEARLY not accurate, since other b.boys such as Ben-J from Division Alpha or Xzoob from Ground Zero Crew were incorporating contortionist tricks before these b.boys you´re talking about were known in the scene. Also I´d like to suggest the rewriting of that part of the article. IMO, it should stress what the classical b.boy fashion is, noting that it´s mostly based around comfortable clothes for dancing. It may also contain a reference to goth or punk influence in b.boy fashion, but not in the way it is now, since in it´s actual form it gives the impression to the profane that some b.boys decided to stop using traditional b.boying fashion and started imitating goths or punks to "feel different". I do believe that it would be more accurate to say that b.boying can appeal to any kind of young boy/girl (even goth, punk, industrial music fan, etc), even when he isn´t the stereotypical hip-hop fan (i.e. dressing in tribal, ecko gear), just because the huge potential for artistic expression it has. So we could show that b.boying knows no boundaries related to race, sex, nationality or even musical tastes. I´m speaking about this from a personal experience, because i was first introduced to b.boying by a heavy metal guitarist and singer who also happened to dance, and I myself, have always been inclined to punk aesthetics.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an important point, together with the section on music that (totally accurately) says that breaking music is not typically modern hip hop, and many other styles work fine for breakdancing. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArru_dab3.html" title="User:Arru">Arru</a> 01:21, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Breakdance" is incorrect terminology. It is not correct to refer to someone as a "breakdancer" or that he/she is "breakdancing". The term "breakdance" was the product of a mistake made by a journalist in the early 80s. The correct term is that somebody is a "b-boy" or "b-girl" and that they are "b-boying/b-girling" (against what most people think the "B" in "B-boy/B-girl" does not stand for "breakdancing" it stands for just "break"). Therefore, the title of this article should become "B-boying / B-girling". I thought I should throw this out and see what others think before I actually make the change.</p>
<p>Here's a reference just incase nobody believes me: <a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/pastissuesupgrade/2002_11_14/features/celebrate_b-boy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realchangenews.org/pastissuesupgrade/2002_11_14/features/celebrate_b-boy.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Another more reliable reference would be the "Bboy Foundations" film (One of the best B-Boy teaching videos ever made). At the end they state that "Breakdance" is a misnomer.</p>

<dd>Yes, it's generally believed among breakers that the term "breakdance" was not originally used. However, today, both the general public and breakers themselves use this term in their everyday language. We need to keep in mind that Wikipedia should reflect how our language is being used <i>today</i>, and though the alternatives should be presented, the focus should not be what is <i>considered</i> correct or how we <i>want</i> it to be.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I definitely believe this article should explain how the term breakdance first appeared and that it's disliked by many breakers, but I still believe the title should be "breakdance". <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> 13:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Additionally, "b-boying-/girling" is unfortunate because if you think that girls can break too you'll have to alternate the two or say "b-person" - which I doubt a proponent of the b-words would like to do. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArru_dab3.html" title="User:Arru">Arru</a> 10:42, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The video clips section was recently removed. I support this because it worked like a web directory - only links to general breakdance video sites. <b>However</b>: in other street dance articles it has become necessary to supply a few <i>direct links to individual video clips</i> of what can be considered good examples of the particular dance style. Apart from those involved, most people have very limited knowledge of what state of the art street dance styles look like.

<dd>I agree, and I think we should focus on a few high-quality video clips, that really show off breakdancing at its best, preferably without too much focus on specific people or groups (though there might be exceptions if the clip is famous/good enough). It would be nice to have examples of both 1 on 1, crew battles and shows. One I can think of right away is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU1I8-RvXxo&amp;search=redbull" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU1I8-RvXxo&amp;search=redbull" rel="nofollow">Red Bull BC One 2005 competition highlights</a> which is beautifully filmed and edited, with some very nice 1 on 1 battles. It does, however, contain a (great) <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locking_%28dance%29.html" title="Locking (dance)">locking</a> show by Hilty and Bosch, which might be confusing as it's not breakdance, but maybe that's okay anyway. - <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWintran_e9f2.html" title="User talk:Wintran">talk</a>)</sup> 12:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. i removed a section of the article that talked about "different types" of bboys/bgirls, mainly because such a thing doesn't exist in bboying, and also because it is based purely on subjective opinion as to what the boundaries between "types" are and which dancer would be used to represent which "type" (which again, doesn't exist as a fundamental aspect of this subculture or dance). in this section, the writer also mentioned "traditional bboys" as being "predictable", which is a biased, opinionated and ignorantly general comment. such "information" is completely irrelevant and deterimental to the quality of this article, which is to explain bboying as an aspect of hiphop culture in a truthful and objective style. would like to know what you others think.</p>
<p><br />
EDIT: I would also like to know peoples opinions on the STYLE VS TECHNIQUE section. i thought that the main controversy is about bboys who neglect foundation... iv'e seen heated arguements come out of this, but rarely have i seen an arguement as superficial as "footwork steps" vs "powermoves" although it has come up and usually when it does it is essentially the foundation vs difficult moves arguement. i am proposing that the section title be renamed "Foundation" and the section would cover the two main arguements below... the foundation argument would be that bboying is an art but self expression should be done with knowledge of the fundamental philosophies, understandings and after fundamental movements and concepts have been mastered otherwise it's not bboying. the other argument would be that bboying has evolved, powermoves and blowups are more impressive and more difficult and are therefore better, bboying is supposed to be an art so anything goes.

<p>I have created independent page for <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong10.html" title="Hong10">Hong10</a>, and will link it to this site. I urge many wikipedians working on breakdancing to work on independent pages of famous breakdancers and crews too, because this page is getting quiet crowded with trying to fit all the information of all individual B-boys and crews.

<p>Surely the main picture on this page should not be of some kid doing a one-handed handstand. It is not a pike by any definition of the word within bboying. There should be some agreement on a picture that best represents bboying. Preferably a more proffesional one to give an accurate impression of the dance as people are most likely to encounter it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ska Child (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ska_Child_ca67.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ska Child">contribs</a>) 12:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I totally agree. Ideally, I would like to see a pic of people standing in a circle, preferably with a few doing random dance moves, while one person broke in the center. I haven't seen any such picture floating around, so I guess I would suggest the little cartoon to the right. Not very good, but much better that the random handstand we have now.

<p>The picture os people from around the world shows the huge impact this dance form has had, and I think that's great! <i>However</i>, I feel it is strange that there isn't <i>a good clear picture</i> of an African American, Mexican, Dominican South Bronx dancer, since they are really the ones who invented this style. There is the pic from NYC-- but it's blurry. Can someone help "represent"&#160;?

<dd>Can't give you Bronx (I live in Seattle) but here are three images that, unlike any in the article, are clearly of African American dancers. Probably if one of these were to be used in an article, someone would want to do some further image enhancement (color correction, saturation, etc.)</dd>
