<p>Don't cave so easily, Zoe--I'm with you. "Breath" should probably link to an article on <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respiration.html" title="Respiration">Respiration</a>; I don't know if that one exists either, but if I were writing an article on something else, say first aid, I might put brackets around "breath" in something like "absence of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath.html" title="Breath">breath</a> indicates...", and I would be very surprized if it linked to an article about a play. It's not necessary to disambiguate everything, especially where there's no existing article. But I think in a case like this where the one meaning there's an article about is clearly <i>not</i> the most central, obvious meaning, it makes sense to be more pre-emptive. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>But then whatever "breath" redirects to needs a link to "breath (play)" in case people are looking for the play. We need a quick cross-link either way. Having a crosslink on "breath" to "respiration" saves us a page with a () name. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say clarity for users (and future editors) should trump ease of interlinking on the part of editors. What's the big deal about typing <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath_%28play%29.html" title="Breath (play)">Breath (play)</a>? I'd even favor Breath (Samuel Beckett play). --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I didn't say breath should be just a redirect; I said it should point (i.e., contain a link) to respiration; it should also contain a link to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath_%28play%29.html" title="Breath (play)">Breath (play)</a>. The important thing is to make ad-hoc links do something sensible, and linking to a page with pointers to multiple senses is eminently more sensible than linking to a page with one sense that's clearly wrong. The way you have it now (with the pointer and the text describing the play) is probably fine too. --LDC</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Blimey, not only is the article longer than the play, so is the talk page! I'm pretty ambivalent about what points to what, for the record, although I guess LDC's suggestion seems sensible even if there are no non-Beckett links here <i>at the moment</i>. Incidentally, I made the move mainly because it seemed odd and wrong to have an article at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath_%28play%29.html" title="Breath (play)">Breath (play)</a> but none at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath.html" title="Breath">Breath</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A disambiguation block will work just fine here. There is no need to have the play at a parenthetical title just because there is a dictionary word "breath". We needn't make linking to this article more difficult than necessary. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>I thought the whole point was that there was no distinction between users and editors. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole project, was I supposed to start drawing a paycheck when I started contributing? Perhaps you'd care to tell why the page in its current state is not sufficiently clear to users? As for the idea that "Breath (Samuel Beckett play)" is the best title - maybe we should put the entire bloody article in the page title. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a>

<dd>All users can edit, and I hope all editors also use the Wikipedia from time to time. But given a choice, we should be seeking ease of use, not ease of editing.

<dd>Yes, I see the point. To be honest, I was in a foul mood last night, and probably overdid it a bit up there, for which my apologies.

<hr />
<p>Hey Larry, would it at all be possible to have an encyclopedia article on Conjecture (philosophy)? The reason I ask is becuase <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">Conjecture</a> was just move to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Conjecture (mathematics)">Conjecture (mathematics)</a> but <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">Conjecture</a> still redirects to it. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I don't know--I'm not aware of any special sense in philosophy. It's just that the sense of "conjecture" in question is unique to mathematics, and (this is my opinion, feel free to disagree) given that, the article should live at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Conjecture (mathematics)">conjecture (mathematics)</a>, since otherwise people will start giving us the dictionary definition of "conjecture," as if there were a significant topic titled "conjecture" outside of math. (I don't know, maybe there is.) --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If there isn't any other encyclopedic topic named "conjecture" then the article on the math term should be simply at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a>. Thanks for the info. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I respect that view (and don't really care much one way or the other), but for the record, I disagree with it. For one thing, I don't think it follows from the premise that there's only one encyclopedia-worthy topic titled "conjecture" that that topic should live at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> without any clarifying parentheses. This is because "conjecture" has an ordinary English meaning that is far more commonly known than the mathematics meaning. Consequently, having the article at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> is apt to make editors want to add an ordinary dictionary definition, which is exactly what did happen, and to make users wonder why we're only talking about the mathematics usage if the article is titled "conjecture" ("What about the more usual sense?"). For purposes of clarity, nothing else, I'd file it under <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Conjecture (mathematics)">conjecture (mathematics)</a>. Now go and do whatever you want, and I won't stop you. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I made pretty much that same argument on <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath.html" title="Breath">Breath</a>, which was an article about the Smuel Beckett play. Because there <i>is</i> an obvious central meaning to the word, I do think that some pre-emptive clarification is needed, even if there's currently no article with that central meaning (or even if there won't ever be). --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Larry, I think you have said once that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. So just because there is a dictionary definition doesn't mean that we must pre-emptively disambiguate from that term. Now that is just silly. If the article on conjecture is at a parenthetical title then all <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> would ever be is a redirect. That doesn't make sense. Another thing is that redirects are not obvious and having the article at a parenthetical title will mean that new contributors will be typing the unnecessary [[conjecture (mathematics)|conjecture]]. Furthermore, when people follow <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> and end up at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Conjecture (mathematics)">conjecture (mathematics)</a> many will feel that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> should be a disambiguation page. However when there is nothing other than dictionary definitions besides the mathematics term, then what would be created would be an unnecessary and invalid disambiguation page. Isn't one of the founding principles of our naming conventions the preservation of free-linking where ambiguities do not exist (such as here)? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<p>&lt;sarcasm&gt;Hm. The term "Jesus Christ" has an alternate dictionary definition in slang usage that differs from the meaning in our article <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. I propose we move the article on the person to Jesus Christ (person). That way nobody will be encouraged to place dictionary defintions in the first line of this article.&lt;/sarcasm&gt; Again, I hate this type of pre-emptive disambiguation. This is an encyclopedia and in that content we <i>only</i> need concern ourselves with disambiguating encyclopedic terms.--<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<p>"That is just silly" and "That doesn't make sense" indicate that perhaps you didn't understand the merits of Lee and my argument in the first place; you didn't address its merits in any case. Not that you're obligated to, but it would be nice. As to "Furthermore, when people follow <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> and end up at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Conjecture (mathematics)">conjecture (mathematics)</a> many will feel that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> should be a disambiguation page": why would they feel that way? And if you think that's a problem, why not simply delete <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjecture.html" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> completely and ask editors to type the extra keystrokes? Another point that you missed is that we are writing here for the convenience and clarity of <i>users,</i> not editors. Users who, by the way, perhaps don't know or care, as we do, that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. (That was the main point, by the way.) As to your &lt;sarcasm&gt;, the slang usage is a lot less common and accorded much less importance by most people than the central meaning.</p>
<p>Could we take this off my user page (perhaps move it to yours)? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>In a completely volunteer project which aims to write an entire encyclopedia it is not-reasonable to force contributors to hand-hold readers to such an extent by mandating that contributors have to type extra keystrokes for a term just to "disambiguate" from a dictionary definition. If we are to be slaves to readers then why don't we also use a hell of a lot of HTML, cgi and Flash in articles to make them look and work better for the readers too? That is a great way to loose contributors. Call me selfish, but I for one edit Wikipedia for the personal enjoyment I feel in creating something truly unique and very useful to both readers <i>and</i> contributors. A balance must be made between these two groups of people. But since Wikipedia is at best betaware and may be forever considered to be so by many, we should focus on erring on the side of contributors (a Nupedia distribution of Wikipedia could do the hand holding in the same way as many Linux distributions do). Also the arguement that newbies will insert purely dictionary definitions into article is rendered moot by the power of Recent Changes and revision histories (this has not been a problem but when I do see somebody insert such things I fix it accordingly -- others have done so as well). One great way to simplify matters for contributors is to have disambiguation <i>only</i> work to disambiguate <i>encyclopedia</i> terms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore the number one naming convention around here is that contributors above all else copy the methods they see. If we start doing as you suggest and disambiguate terms from their purely dictionary meanings then we will have things like Jesus Christ (person). To you the slang dictionary definition is not nearly as used as the encyclopedic term but that is just your POV and some contributors won't see the "widest"-use distinction (in some circles the dictionary term is used daily whereas the encyclopedia term is only used on Sundays, if at all). We can continue this on my talk page, but I would rather drop the debate and simply agree that we disagree and then get back to work on creating the best encyclopedia for users <i>and</i> contributors on the planet. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 20:26 Sep 22, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only new argument I see here is that Lee's and my way of thinking would give us such silliness as Jesus Christ (person).

Not so "breath" or a number of other common English words.</dd>

<hr />
<p>I'd just like to clarify that my concern here is indeed mostly for contributors, and in particular those who make ad-hoc links while writing other pages. It should be blindingly obvious that there is one, and only one, central, primary, and obvious meaning for "Jesus Christ", "Breath", and "Conjecture"; whether or not that central meaning has an article--or even should have an article--is secondary. Contributors to other articles ought to be able to simply put brackets around a word like that, comfortably assuming that the link will go somewhere sensible--that's my major concern here. If I put brackets around <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath.html" title="Breath">Breath</a>, my first expectation would be that it went to an article on respiration; but I might be wrong (and in this case I would). My second choice would be that it went to an article that pointed to an article on respiration, and maybe had some other content. That's a reasonable second choice. The third, and to my mind clearly the worst, possibility, is that I get sent to an article about something totally unexpected without even a pointer to the normal usage. I'm not even too concerned about the "not a dictionary" mantra. To my mind, the most important thing is just this: <i>ad-hoc links should go somewhere reasonable</i>. That's all. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>

<p>The following table was in an exam question and I am stumped!!!</p>
<p>Gas Inhaled air % Exhaled air % Alveolar air % Oxygen 20.95 16.4 14.45 Carbon dioxide 0.04 4.1 6.05 Nitrogen 79.01 79.5 79.5 X variable variable saturated</p>
<p><br />
Question 1a: What is gas X?</p>
<pre>
        1b: Why is this gas essential for the functioning of the cells in the alveoli?
</pre>
<p><br />
PLEASE HELP someone+</p>

<p>A disambiguation page is desperately needed for both "breath" and "exhale". I don't know how to though. So someone else should. <a href="../../../y/s/h/User%7EYSHOULDUKNOW123_0cc7.html" title="User:YSHOULDUKNOW123">YSHOULDUKNOW123</a> 01:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The buildup of carbon dioxide making the blood acidic is what makes one desperate for a breath rather than lack of oxygen. Hyperventilating causes an influx of oxygen that lowers blood acidity to trick the brain into thinking it has more oxygen."</p>
<p>This is unclear, and the cited source is long so I don't know what part it's referencing. The second sentince reads something like "Hyperventilating gives you oxygen, which tricks the brain into thinking it has more oxygen." Wha? --<a href="../../../s/z/a/User%7ESzabo_e38f.html" title="User:Szabo">Szabo</a> 22:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've just changed it. As per the 'hyperventilation' article, it is a *drop in CO2* that causes blood acidity to lower, therefore tricking the brain - not an increase in 02. 139.184.30.19 18:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I personally think that merging the page would be better for both articles because more people would visit <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing.html" title="Breathing">breathing</a>, than <a href="../../../e/x/h/Exhaled_air.html" title="Exhaled air">exhaled air</a>. The same information could be included in the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing.html" title="Breathing">breathing</a> article, making it easier to obtain knowledge for everyone. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackBear_4c4f.html" title="User:BlackBear">BlackBear</a> 13:37, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
