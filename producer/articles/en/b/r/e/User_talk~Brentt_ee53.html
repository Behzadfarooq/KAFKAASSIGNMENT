<p>Hey, welcome to the AA article! I've been with it for a while, and seen my share of drama... It's nice to have another skeptic there! Thanks for going back and signing your comments on the Talk page. That makes it a lot easier to keep track of who said what!</p>
<p>Also, for a little background on the controversy... I haven't see any posts by Marcus in ages, but he's been very helpful in providing pro-AA material. He clearly is a fan, but he's doesn't seem adverse to the idea of including criticisms at all like some other, newer participants are.</p>
<p>I know that I, for one, have gotten pretty "emotionally charged", so to speak, at some points in the discussions. I've found it very helpful to then take a day or two off from this article to calm down and collect my thoughts so I don't post anything that would only lead to a virtual screaming match instead of actually being productive. The week I was on vacation with no computer access was great&#160;:-) I don't know you, so I don't know if you're totally cool and collected or prone to getting into fights. But if you stick around long enough to get steamed, I hope you take my advice and be careful in your wordings so that you don't accidentally piss off anyone who's less skilled at staying cool when tempers flare, and take breaks when things get too intense because things aren't very productive at such times.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad to have you here! I hope I haven't come off as patronizing in any way, because that's not what my intentions are. I'm just sharing what I've learned myself though trial and error in this and other articles (and non-wikipedia debates) over the years. For all I know, you've been around the block a few times too, and don't need to be told any of this. But newcomer or veteren, it looks like you have the potential to be a great help in this article!

<p>Hi, I wrote a response to your statement on the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> talk page.I thought that you would benefit from the correction, you don't appear to be active on the page much anymore so I thought I'd repost it here. This is in response to you claim that referencing physicians is an "Appeal to Authority". (I don't mean to come off as hostile, from reading your web-page it seems we might have a lot in common.):</p>
<p><br />
If you would have paid closer attention in your Classical Logic courses Apeal to Authority is not a fallacy. What you are thinking of is Appeal to Improper Authority which is considered a fallacy. For example "dentists generally agree that Einstien's Theory of Relativity has been well confirmed by experiment" would be an Appeal to Improper Authority, even though the claim referenced is probably true, whereas "physcists generally agree that Einstien's Theory of Relativity has been well confirmed by experiment" is an Appeal to Proper Authority. Both are Appeals to Authority but only the former is fallicious (even though claim being supported is the same). If all Appeals to Authority were to be considered fallicious just about every single scientific paper ever written would have to be considered fallicious, as referencing the work of other scientists, i.e. authorities on a subject that the author may or may not be familiar with,and most always not nearly as familiar as the person they are referencing, is ubiquitous and necessary in science, as we can't all study every aspect of such a broad subject as physics or medicine.</p>
<p>Also note, as someone has already pointed out, if all Appeals to Authority were considered fallicious you would have no argument yourself, as the idea that Appeals to Authority are fallicious comes from your misunderstanding of logic, which is a field I'm assuming your not very familiar with yourself since you don't understand the different kinds of appeals to authority, and therefore you are obviously appealing to authority (authority which you apparently misunderstood).--Brentt 04:56, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your note, which may not have been hostile but was certainly condescending and in fact wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is in fact a fallacy to say that "the medical community agrees that X is true; therefore it is true." It is not a fallacy to say that the medical community agrees that X is true, if it can be demonstrated that the medical community agrees that X is true. I agree that "appeal to authority" is a rather misleading term; it may be that we can agree that it would be fallacious to either make improper appeal to authority or make an appeal to improper authority.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But this is the case with all fallacies - they work because they bear a resemblance to valid arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with the pseudoscience article is that those who are trying to write it seem to believe that if a certain number of people, so called "experts" label something a pseudoscience, then it must be a pseudoscience. In fact, pretty much any authority on anything you can imagine has - and in all likelihood continues to be - dead wrong on some of their tenets, and any honest expert will admit as much. (Though he/she will also say the problem is that they don't know what they're wrong about and must do their best on the basis of imperfect knowledge.) --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:52, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your comments were not appreciated, nor was your editing. Please can you undo all of your editing on the above article, and restore its previous well-researched content.

As has been explained, there is no direct evidence of it, which is due to a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> effort at the end of 2001 to destroy all evidence disputing the official story. This is one of many stories therefore that, without the help of the CIA, cannot be stated directly. Nonetheless, it is such a powerful story that it was felt by Wikipedians that this one needed to be stated, and there was enough secondary evidence to prove without any doubt that the primary evidence does exist.</p>
<p>Your edits have destroyed all of this work.</p>
<p>Let me assure you that this was not invented last week. It has been a well established theory since September 11, 2001 itself. It has just been covered up.</p>

<p>"Why did you remove this sentence: 'Terms such as "alternative" and "non-orthodox" express the same concept without being pejorative.' It seems a fair, and probably widely held, criticism. [...]"? Because it's a criticism, not an objective fact, and needed to be written as such and cited. I think that disapproval is inherantly part of the word; a quote from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pseudoscience, in contrast, is characteristically lacking in adequate tests or the possibility of them, occasionally untestable in principle, and its supporters are frequently strident in insisting that existing scientific results are wrong. Pseudoscience is often unresponsive to ordinary scientific procedures (for example, peer review, publication in standard journals). In some cases, no one applying scientific methods could disprove a pseudoscientific hypothesis (that is, untestable claims have been made) and failure to test and disprove these claims is often cited as evidence of the truth of the pseudoscience.</dd>

<p>I disagree with this edit for two reasons: The paragraph doesn't explicitly state that he was conservative, just that he was a member of the Republican Party (which is verifiable and factual, and could be ) and that he did not intend the massive social change that his papers caused (also can be verified (or refuted) with sources). Perhaps the "manifestoes" part could be re-worded, but I think it's certainly important to acknowledge the social effects of the reports. Unless you can convince me otherwise, I'm re-inserting the text, because I think it's removal takes away from the article, and possibly compromises the NPOV. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> 07:31, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read the discussion page:</dd>
<dd>Regarding this paragraph:</dd>
<dd><i>Alfred Kinsey's two volumes became the manifestoes of sexual revolution and the counterculture. However, That was not the intention of the scientist from Indiana. <b>Kinsey, himself, was a life long Republican</b>, and his research was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, established by the moderately conservative Rockefeller Family.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that whoever wrote this was trying to imply, by pointing out that Kinsey was a Republican, that he was conserative. This is an anachronistic implication, most people who held what today would be considered liberal and progressive viewpoints <i>were</i> Republican because the Republican party back then were the most supportive of liberal and progressive causes(for example civil rights legeslation was almost always championed by Republicans and zealously resisted by Democrats.) The situation changed in the 70s when a idealogical reorientation took place across party lines, thats when the most conservative element of the then conservative Democratic party crossed to the Republicans--the reason why Republicans are the conservative party today. Republicans have always been fiscally conservative, but being a Republican was the only option back then for a liberal and progressive minded individual.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And because the Rockefeller foundation was founded by a <i>moderately</i> conservative family does not mean that people they funded were conservative. Point being <i>Kinsey was most likely <b>not</b> a conservative</i> and I am going to delete this misleading paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And perhaps more egregious part of the paragraph, the reports <i>were not</i> a manifesto. They may have played a part in the coming of the sexual revolution, but a <i>manifesto</i> implies that this was the purpose of the reports, which it was not. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 07:58, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section is silly. Phrenology only bears the most superficial resemblance to modern neurology, and even that is a stretch. Yes, its been quite well established that personality is a function of the brain; but thats quite different from saying skull shape offers any glimpse into personality--and the nearness of the skull and brain offers absolutely no basis for saying that the ideas of phrenology were incorporated into neurology, as seems to be the unstated premise of the section. This section was not worth its page space--I think most people would agree aside from the person who wrote the section. Atleast be more specific as to what ideas were incorporated. (the <i>gall area</i> thing doesn't count, a chance nearness to broca's area means nothing.)

<dd>I also think that phrenology is a silly, outdated idea. However, I don't think that means this section needs to be deleted. I think the section is fairly NPOV, and if you disagree, why not edit it instead of delete it?</dd>
<dd>Many totally wrong ideas have contributed to science, and this deserves mention: I believe one of the first people to seriously research EEG was in fact looking for evidence for telepathy. If it is factually correct that phrenology was the first to claim localized brain activity, and the fact that emotion takes place in the brain, then why not mention it? As to the language faculty, that seems like a fairly minor issue to me, but I believe that this sentence just serves to point out how wrong the theory was: out of all the faculties suggested, only one was even close to being correct. The way I see it, this sentence reduces the credibility of phrenology, rather than increasing it.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, not wanting to start an edit war, I did not revert your deletion yet -- but I hope you revert it or at least replace it with something more to your liking. --<a href="../../../z/v/i/User%7EZvika_5f01.html" title="User:Zvika">Zvika</a> 13:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say phrenology was a silly outdated idea (that goes without saying). I said that section was silly and was original research--or atleast I suspect its original research (it certainly was not sourced). Its probably true that many wrong, and even pseudo-scientific, theories have contributed to science. But that doesn't mean phrenology did. There is little connection between modern neurology and phrenology, (aside from the fact that some authorities think that many conclusions reached by people studying fMRI scans are little better than phrenology, but thats the reverse of what the paragraph I removed was saying.) --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 02:14, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Eventually, Anneliese's knees were destroyed through obsessive genuflection forced by the demons' orders, which she couldn't defy. She died at age 23, acording to witnesses finally freed from the demons, after the last exorcism made on her. The autopsy report said that her death was caused by the malnutrition and dehydration that resulted from almost a year of semi-starvation. Other theories suggest she might have suffocated due to side-effects of the powerful drugs she took.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, there are apparently two main POVs in this story which we need to avoid pushing. The "natural cause" POV, and the "supernatural cause" POV. The first removal I made,i.e. removal of the phrase "forced by the demons orders which she couldn't defy", is clearly needed as it implies that she was in fact possessed, and therefore is supernatural POV pushing.</p>
<p>The "according to witnesses" mitigates somewhat the POV pushing of the second edit so I suppose strictly speaking its not contentious that the people thought they saw that she was "freed".</p>
<p>The last sentence I got rid of because it sounds like original research. The only reliable source we have of the natural, or from the supernatural POV the way in which the demons apparently killed her, cause of death is the autopsy report. If there is a reliable source for that speculation then it should be included. Otherwise it sounds like original research. That being said, I'll leave it for now since it is controversial whether the fact that a piece of information is unsourced is enough reason to delete it. Although its a bit of a superflous speculation as the natural cause of death seems to be established.</p>
<p>So I'll leave the last two contentious sentences, and get rid of the first "forced by the demons, which she couldn't defy" as it seems to be pretty clear that it is supernatural POV pushing, and doesn't really add any information which can't be inferred by someone predisposed to the supernatural POV. I hope this is a good compromise. --Brentt 22:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've spent some time on wikipedia trying to clean up the nonesense of the 9/11 conspiracy theorists (I gave up on <a href="../../../s/1/1/S11_%28protest%29.html" title="S11 (protest)">this</a> page, because it was me against a couple others who were adamant that a hanging google link was damning evidence of CIA conspiracy, and any evidence that contradicted their postion was just part of the CIA conspiracy and therefore shouldn't be in the article).

<p>I thought it was pretty uncontroversial that "full-on" is a subgenre, or style, of psytrance. "Driving basslines" would be a start I guess (although someone once said "describing music is like dancing to architecture"). Frequent uses of "reverberation, pitch shifting, and filtering..." is not much better than saying "Full-on frequently uses sound", as just about every modern music uses "reverberation, pitch shifting, and filtering", not even just electronic music (you'd be suprised at how many professional singers can't sing on key, hence pitch shifting) and EQ is filtering, HP and LP filters have been used since edison cylinders, and reverb is just something you can't really record music without (and has also been artificially simulated since edison cylinders). --Brentt 09:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Brentt I agree with you, but it is something that hard-core Psychedelic base is going to complain and whine about. I really can't tell the difference between the styles. That's why a musciology reference is important. I do know that full-on uses a lot of DSP effects. Yes, it's true a lot of music does, but not in the abundance that Full-On does. It is very noticeable especially with a pair of headphones on. I have little time to discuss this, but we can continue this discussion in a few days. -- HotshotGG 22:20, 17 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Well, I'm not entirely sure the comment was inflammatory in intent (though it certainly is in effect). Shortly before that comment was posted on the talk page, someone had edited the article to call Coulter a "cunt" (which happens fairly frequently). Perhaps they were trying to bring this to other editors' attention. Or, perhaps they were simply being facetious or offensive. I don't know and I'm not really sure I want to judge that.</p>

<p>The .999... thing is more relavant to math education than what working mathematicians actually do. Its a topic that highlights the clash between initial intuitions about numbers and sound theory. The reason why this topic is ever discussed, almost solely by math educators, has little to do with what .9999... equals (its indisputably 1), its about the reluctance of students to let go of intuitive concepts which don't work in theory. It is important that students grasp what .9999... means (or any infinite expansion) because if they can't grasp that, then they won't be able to grasp limits. And if you can't grasp limits, then your pretty much not going to be able to grasp a good portion of math and science (including the math and science that is responsible for your computer--in other words, mathematicians "wasting" time on this stuff, has given you the ability to "waste time" making yourself look stupid to mathematicians that are wasting their time reading stupid comments made by people ignorant of math on wikipedia). <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 02:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

While mathematicians in their "low-paid" work (like actuaries and economists--applied mathematicians) waste their time figuring out fundamental crap that allows them or other people to figure out how to make your car go, and your cell phone work, so you can talk and mingle with your o' so prestigous friends.

<p>There is no way I would know from descriptions alone. Your dentist would know you well enough to know the problem and hopefully tell you directly what he thinks it is. Loss of tooth structure apart from caries and anything developmental usually comes in the form of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrasion_%28dental%29.html" title="Abrasion (dental)">abrasion</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/f/Abfraction.html" title="Abfraction">abfraction</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erosion_%28dental%29.html" title="Erosion (dental)">erosion</a>, and attrition. Erosion comes from sucking on lemons or exposing teeth to acidic environments regularly. Abfraction is usually along the gumline. That leaves two things: abrasion, which is loss of tooth structure from heavy forces from things like toothbrushes or toothpickes, and attrition, which is loss of tooth structure from <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruxism.html" title="Bruxism">grinding your teeth</a>. Grinding your teeth at nite or during the day can thin out the edges of your teeth, the tongue side of your upper front teeth can be greatly affected. That may be a possibility you can mention to your dentist. If none of those reasons are the cause, then I would not know any other possibilities without again thinking of something developmental. I hope you figure out specifically the cause.
