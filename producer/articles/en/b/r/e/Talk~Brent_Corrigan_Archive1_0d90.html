<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Arbitration</span></h2>
<p>I have opened an arbitration case to have the Brent Corrigan article locked until the legal dispute is finalized. Due to the sensitive nature of the release of his real name, as well as the allegations of underage sexual performance, I do not believe that Wiki should be involved in the dispute.</p>
<p>Once the facts are laid bare, then this account should, in my opinion, either show or hide his information. Until such time, I believe this serves no one except those who intend harm to Mr. Corrigan.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Current_requests" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Current_requests" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Current_requests</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Real Name</span></h2>
<p>Whatever one feels on the Brent Corrigan/under age/Cobra issue, there is no reason not to include his real name. Except for the fact that Mr. Corrigan was under the legal age of 18 years at the time of the filming of a Cobra Pornographic Film that Mr. Corrigan was taking part in. The video producers purposely gave Brent a false name to avoid a lawsuit. Like any actor/performer, Wikipedia lists facts about them. The birth date, birth place, and birth name of actors are certainly appropriate information to list in an encyclopedia. Such a listing does not "take sides" in the on-going dispute regarding Mr. Corrigan. As an article with a NPOV, I hope basic facts can be left in the article. 68.36.193.233 13:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even if some online news media gave once Brent Corrigan real name, he has never agreed for his real name to be off public knowledge. Stage name for porn performer are here to protect their private life. Furthermore, the underage controversy isn't settled. Until then, I think the presence of his real name on this page is inappropriate, not to say unlawful, for the respect of the right of privacy. (Not user, but reader)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I respect that opinion, but disagree. As a public performer - he chose to go into acting/pornography - his real name is not a protected secret. I can understand not listing his current address, his email, or anything else, but why is the real name of an adult public performer a protected piece of information? For any other porn performer, would you remove their real name too? Why don't we both stop reverting the page for a while and see what the rest of the WikiWorld thinks of this issue? My opinion - a person who voluntarily enters public life loses certain privacy rights - one of them is basic facts (name, age) about them. There is nothng unlawful about revealing a public perfomer's given name. (I am huge Brent Corrigan fan by the way and have tried to keep this page NPOV and fair - check previous edits). 68.36.193.233 14:07, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree to this opinion as to the public nature of his craft and thus the public nature of his name.
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I agree as well. Thus, I will try to keep this page as non POV as possible, and restore "vandalism" as soon as possible. <a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESpheroide_e640.html" title="User:Spheroide">Spheroide</a> 18:39, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obviously, [[User: Spheroide]Spheriode]] has something personal against Brent, why else would he be so insistent to include his real name in the entry? His real name was only made pubic by Cobra's unenforceable "writ of summons" which is basically a legal exploratory maneuver to gather depositions to determine if enough evidence even exists to justify a lawsuit. The file was made in an effort to acquire Brent’s valid ID for the purpose to legally release newly obtained content of Mr. Corrigan, not for verification of the claim he made on August 16, 2005. Had Mr. Phillips actually filed a legitimate suit, he too would have been required to provide testimony, an option which would not have been very attractive. A convicted felons claim and testimony carry little weight in a courtroom setting. (Unclean hands) Therefore, Mr. Corrigan’s true identity is of no concern to this entry as is Mr. Phillips or his background which probably does carry merit for inclusion. If the unnecessary disclosure of Mr. Corrigan’s does not halt, a detailed complaint outlining Mr. Phillips questionable background and negligent intent towards Mr. Corrigan. Furthermore a "Discontinuance without Prejudice" was submitted on Cobra's behalf in regard to the "writ of summons" the civil action used to reveal Mr. Corrigan's identity to the public. In other words, no action was taken. The only thing discovered from this proceeding was Mr. Corrigan's private information.</p>
<p>Thank you, signed, a concerned party.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Obviously, [[User: Spheroide]Spheriode]] has something personal against Brent" --&gt; Not at all. Please have a look at the article history and note that I even wrote the initial version, long before any age concerns surfaced. I just feel strongly that factual data should be included, and a Real Name for those in entertainment is among that kind of data. Thus my continuing efforts in keeping this article NPOV and informative. <a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESpheroide_e640.html" title="User:Spheroide">Spheroide</a> 00:20, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then why do you remove the factual data and corresponding links that I added detailing the Mr. Phillip's identity and felony conviction. Please explain that? If that has no significance to this entry than Mr. Corrigan's true identity surely does not!</p>
<dl>
<dd>They should be part of a "Mr. Phillips"-like article, and not of this one. Feel free to create one. A wiki-link could be added, for example, to the Cobra Video page to the Brian Phillips-page. Please create a complete and informative, but most of all <i>encyclopedic</i> article if you do so, and not just a one-point-of-view one that serves no purpose but to name-and-shame. I'm looking forward to reading your efforts! <a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESpheroide_e640.html" title="User:Spheroide">Spheroide</a> 00:31, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't put the real name of the person in the document.

<dd>

<dd>Fact of the matter is that his real name *is* publicly known, due to the dispute between Mr. Corrigan and Cobra Video. <a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESpheroide_e640.html" title="User:Spheroide">Spheroide</a> 12:03, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Thank you for your advice on creating an entry for the "Mr. Phillips"-like article. I will get to work on that immediately and will take extra precaution to assure the article is very detailed as well as historically and legally accurate. I will be sure to include a full compliment of links and articles for authentication and verification purposes.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your infinite wisdom and input on this matter since you seem to have specifically detailed knowledge of background of Cobra Video and its models. Are there any other studios in which plan to outline in the near future?</p>
<p>I find it hypocritical that Brent has asked people not to use his real name when he has links about Bryan's past directly on his site. These links provide Bryan's real name. If Brent were truly serious about his own privacy, he would remove those links about Bryan. He hasn't done that, and I doubt ever will, as he continues to play the role of victim, even after all the debate has pretty much subsid ed. Why should Brent's name be kept private, but Bryan's name be public? Is this at all fair? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 70.83.96.69 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.83.96.69_76d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.83.96.69">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Bryan was the one who first played the card that revealed Brent’s name by issuing the press release of the lawsuit, then added the links to his website in addition to sending text versions of the article to members (Cobra fans) in which he claims he has a data base of well over 10,000 If Bryan would remove all reference to Brent’s name and identity from his site, I am sure Brent would be happy to do the same.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. First of all, a person's name is a highly relevant piece of information in an encyclopedia article that is about that person, so please don't argue that Brent's "true identity is of no concern to this entry". Wikipedia already lists the real names of porn stars (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Brandt_c20a.html" title="Billy Brandt">Billy Brandt</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Hansen_%28porn_star%29_fc6f.html" title="Tommy Hansen (porn star)">Tommy Hansen</a>, etc.) so there's certainly no policy against it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. He is a celebrity. (One I think about quite a bit, in fact... *drool*) As such, he does not have the same expectation of privacy as an average citizen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. I'm totally sympathetic to Brent's plight here. i certainly wouldn't want my own real name to be made public in his situation. But his name is now a matter of public record. It doesn't really matter how it got to be that way. Printing a publicly available fact is not an invasion of privacy, and it certainly isn't illegal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. There are no "personal safety reasons" here that any other celebrity doesn't have to contend with. Even <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a> has stalkers. There are consequences of being a celebrity, not all of them desirable. If he were a witness in a mob trial trying to stay hidden, that would be one thing. But this is someone who voluntarily got into porn acting, and continues to do so even today (thank god).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5. We can't exclude relevant, verifiable information purely because the subject of the article doesn't want it mentioned. Remember the congressional staffers who removed undesirable information about their bosses? <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13129-2032346,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13129-2032346,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> How is this any different?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6. Now, all that being said, the last thing I want to do is hurt someone. Especially someone like Brent. (I repeat: *drool*) How about this as a (semi) compromise: add a sentence that states something like, "Brent's real name, not listed here, was released (against his will) <a href="http://www.brentcorriganonline.com/blog/?p=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brentcorriganonline.com/blog/?p=32" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in a lawsuit relating to his claim that he was only 17 during the time he was working for Cobra Video." Don't state his real name, don't link to the site that lists it. It's not a perfect solution, but it should make Brent happy in that it doesn't list his name and makes clear that it shouldn't be listed here, and it makes Wikipedia purists happy in that it makes clear that Brent Corrigan is not his real name and that his real name is publicly available for those who want to put the effort into tracking down the court documents. In fact, I'm just going go ahead and put it in the article now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>p.s. what the heck: While I'm at it, Brent, *please* don't make the mistake Brent Everett did and bulk up like that. Ugh! What was he thinking???

++++++++ So... this name issue is persistent. It's stupid, really. We all know his real name. Therefore, it should be in this encylopedia article.</p>

<dd>Yes, his real name has been revealed in some news media. Now, as "public knowledge", it can be included in that encyclopedia, as it has been made for other porn actors. But the way his name has been thrown to the lions is somewhat dishonest, and clearly with intent to cause prejudice. And that bother me A LOT! Furthermore, with or without his real name, the article won't be more or less truthful (because it concerns his porn persona, not his private persona), and that's what is important. <s>So, I vote for NO REAL NAME.</s> --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam67fr_f313.html" title="User:Sam67fr">Sam67fr</a> 22:07, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OMG, my opinion is so biased... OK, his name is known, and even if I don't like how he became known, it's now a verifiable content we can add (but shall we?)in this article. But there is no need to add it in each sentence as some users try to do. A one citation is enough! As I was saying before, it's an article about a porn perfomer, not an article about a private citizen.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam67fr_f313.html" title="User:Sam67fr">Sam67fr</a> 13:26, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see that "arbitration" has made it clear that his name should be included, or, at least, that it can be included. There's nothing prohibiting it. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernieD_a85b.html" title="User:BernieD">BernieD</a> 18:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, really, what we're talking is not the fact of its inclusion but how it's included. I can agree with that. The Middle Ground! So, where should we put it? <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernieD_a85b.html" title="User:BernieD">BernieD</a> 18:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An earlier edit of the article had listed Brent Corrigan as Jewish. Someone else removed it. I have been unable to find any verification that he is Jewish, but was curious if anyone else had seen something to that effect. 68.36.193.233 13:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is ridiculous! There is no relevance whatsoever to this article in the significance to the importance of Brent Corrigan's true identity, other than the individual or individuals who are insistent in reverting it back. They are queenly aware that if under various search engines when "Brent Corrigan" is entered under almost any context the Wikipedia entry is one of the first few results. Therefore the inclusion of his true identity only serves the purpose of jeopardizing his safety. At this time, for Mr. Corrigan’s personal safety reasons, could you please remove the identity and keep it off? If not I am requesting the entry be removed or deleted all together!</p>

<p>The request for deletion is there due to some people continually placing the stars legal name in the article. Reasons for this not being a good idea are obvious.</p>
<p>Also with this happening, the star doesn't want the article to be there, and therefore if it does get deleted, is there a way to ensure it stays like that?</p>

<li>No, that isn't the way thinks work in Wikipedia. Famous people don't get to have their articles deleted just because they don't want them here, just like any other encyclopedia. There are other ways of dealing with an editing problem. An administrator can lock the article so that it cannot be edited, for example. I don't know, however, what the Wikipedia policy is on including birth names of people using pseudonyms. If there is no Wikipedia policy against it, then there may be nothing that can be done about it.

<p>Ec5618's edit to remove the birth name was accompanied by the comment "I'm not aware of any specific policy on this matter" (or something to that effect). If there is no specific policy saying that we should not include a performer's birth name, then why would it be removed? There <i>is</i> a policy that the subject of an article does not get to determine its content. If it's verfiable, and it is certainly relevant, it probably should stay in.

However, since a single anonimous editor is incessantly trying to add the name, I am left to wonder as to the motives of that editor.

<p>I think the question, Lector, is "Is there a policy <i>against</i> including his real name?" If not, then I don't think there is a basis for deleting that information. Admins can ban individual anon IPs and ranges of IPs, although it is discouraged, and the bans are intended to be temporary. I think that the bans apply to all of Wikipedia, and not just to one page, though. All unregistered and new users can be blocked from editing an individual page: temporary page protectoin is possible in cases of vandalism, for example. But a violation of Wikipedia policy has to be determined before an admin would impose portection. For the record, I don't have a real problem with the compromise position that excluded the name but linked to an external site where the name oculd be found. It's not strictly within how I understand Wikipedia works, but if it makes peace, then it's okay. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeromacnoo_1a90.html" title="User:Zeromacnoo">Zeromacnoo</a> 13:32, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, for real this time. Despite my attempts at a compromise, it borders on the absurd not to include a person's name in an article about that person without an extremely solid reason not to. "Brent doesn't want to list it here," and "Brent might get stalked" are not valid reasons. That being said, please list here any reasons you have NOT to include his name.

<dd>In my opinion, when a person has requested that their private information, which was not released in an entirely legal manner, be kept private and not be disseminated on the internet, that person has the right the their privacy, regardless of who the are or their standing as a celebrity, especially in this case where said person feels as though such an inclusion of their name would constitute a threat to their safety, regardless of whether or not it truly does. One could ask where this information stops. Posting a home-city? A telephone number? An address? I feel that, in concern for Brent's rights to his personal privacy, which nobody ever just 'gives up' by any stretch of the imagination, we should keep his name removed and defend against its inclusion. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a> 08:06, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The person or persons that seem to spend so much time adding Brent's name to the article should focus their effort creating the article/entry on Mr. Phillips aka Mr. Kocis and his colorful past if they were truly interested just in the integrity and authenticity of this piece? Rather than spend all their time in the exposure of a boy who made a highly very misguided decision as a minor, they would provide the article the balance they seek if they insisted on the same scrutiny of the adult who has shown an obviously suspect pattern of behavior. An adult who operates a business extremely sensitive and is susceptible to the potential sexual exploitation of children if basic precautions, research and confirmations are not performed. He has claimed that, twice two different minors deceived him within a two year time period of misrepresenting their age!

<dd>To this extent, the subject of the article has expressed worry over his safety. Would we post his address as well, if it were released? I'm not quite sure why his real name is such pertinent information to this encyclopedic entry either, considering that all the work he has done has been under his alias...where does his real name actually have a place in this entry at this time? I think we should justify its inclusion before we justify its exclusion. Especially in this way it is included now (quote: "His real name is...")...shouldn't that real name be included bolded in parenthesis after his false name per wiki style?

<p>I don't know if publishing BC's name will actually endanger him, but I feel his birth name should be excluded for other reasons.</p>
<p>I read earlier on this discussion page that there was no law protecting his identity, that he chose to be a public figure. In fact, there is a legal restiction against releasing a model's name, it is part of the same law that requires models be legal adults. BC entered into this profession with not only the belief, but the legal assurance that his birth name would not be released against his will. The Cobra representative could not release his true name except through a civil action.</p>
<p>I don't know the motivation behind the writ of summons, but, from a purely legal standpoint it was a useless gesture. The writ had no power whatever outside of the state in which it was issued, and it has been challenged and rendered moot. This does not mean that it never happened (I think that is called "expunged"), just that is has been legally recognized to be invalid. Since there is no legal reason to file a powerless writ, it makes me wonder if the accusations against the Cobra guy might not be valid.</p>
<p>It is possible that Cobra guy did it for the sole purpose of releasing the model's name without risking getting sued or prosecuted, perhaps in an effort to embarrass BC and damage his personal relationships outside of his profession. If, and I do mean if, that is the case, then the inclusion of the real name would be allowing the article to be used as a vehicle for the Cobra representative's agenda, and therefore the ulimate "POV".</p>
<p>Further, there is an argument that the birth name of BC is public record, making the comparison to the Cobra guy's name being public record. I do not accept this argument. There is a distinct difference: BC's name was released through legal papers filed for dubious reasons in civil court, against the subject's will. The Cobra guy's name is public record due to criminal prosecution and conviction, the result of his own actions. It does not seem equal to me to compare the two instances. Cobra guy could not have expected any degree of anonymity, like BC did. If BC's name were released from prosecution of the underage disaster, I would be in bed asleep now, instead of typing this.</p>
<p>The likelihood is that the release of his birth name was probably at least partially personally motivated. I know that Wikipedia should report facts, but it shouldn't be used as a weapon to personally attack someone. The bell has been rung, his name is out there for anyone who wants to find it, why not let them? The fact is that we have a precious gift that BC did not have: a choice.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yahoo Fansite</span></h2>
<p>The yahoo "fansite" is not worth linking here. The entire site consists of 12 messages posted over only the last 3 weeks, by a total of (at most) 5 different people, all <i>complaining</i> about Brent, plus 1 photo of someone who doesn't even look like Brent, plus 2 links to sites that this article already links to. It's fairly obvious that someone set up the yahoo group specifically to hurt Brent by linking from the Wikipedia article. The group is actually named "Sean Paul Lockhart" rather than "Brent Corrigan," despite the fact that there is no group called "Brent Corrigan". What "fans" are going to even going to search for him under his real name?? Further, the yahoo group was created on January 28, which was <b>coincidentally</b> at the height of the controvery surrounding including Brent's real name in the wikipedia article. I repeat, it should not be linked from this article. Please discuss if you disagree. -<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBindingtheory_054a.html" title="User:Bindingtheory">Bindingtheory</a> 04:55, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It was NOT set up "to hurt Brent by linking from the Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>article". It was set up to continue the lively conversation on the matter that was obviously of interest to the members, but cut short by the administration, of the JuicyGoo forum. That's all. The site was set up by a fan of Brent, and if the only posts there are anti-Brent, that is the fault of his fans alone for not posting in support of him there. Let us hope that more join and do so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Facts and verified content</span></h2>
<p>I've made some changes on this page because I believed there was a lot of babble and unverified claims. I may be new to Wikipedia, but I know for sure that, if you claim something, the claim must be verifiable.</p>
<p>Deleted - The claim about a lawsuit filed by Cobra Video concerning the age matter. No external link provided to confirm that claim. The link provided only speak about copyrights and trademark violation.</p>
<p>Deleted - Names of Sean Lockhart's business partners. The names are not quoted in the avn news article (link provided in external links).</p>
<p>Deleted - Multiple quoting of Jasoncurious.com report that had no relevance with the age matter. I provided an external link for everybody to read the complete article and thus provided a way for readers to make their own mind.</p>
<p>Deleted - Claim that "Lockhart had admitted publicly to forging his government ID's in order to work for Cobra Video". No link provided to a verifiable source. <i><b>Kept - Link to an AVN article where the news media allege that Brent Corrigan told them he obtained a false ID in order to work in adult industry.</b> (In this cas, Sean Lockhart/Brent Corrigan never admitted forging his ID, but obtaining one... slightly different... but different.)</i></p>
<p>Deleted - Claim that "If this new License is proven to be valid, Sean Lockhart would have committed multiple felonies including fraud and misrepresentation." It's up to a court to decide if felonies have been committed... Until now (and up to my knowledge) no such decision has been made. Therefore, that claim is a mere opinion, and has not its place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Fixed - External links to Brent Corrigan Blog (somebody put the link of Cobra Video in place) and added the Cobra Video website.</p>
<p>And some other minor changes&#160;!</p>

<li>As some of you may have noticed, I constantly revert this page to its former state when anon user 24.54.90.231 insert "Neither Lockhart nor his lawyer have ever supplied evidence to support their allegation". The point of this paragraf is to explain what happens with the 4 videos removed from circulation, not to support a POV. Until now, only Cobra Video and its representatives claim that "no proof has been supplied". As this claim can not been verified, I assume that a Cobra Video supporter wants his POV to be prevailing.

<dd>Thank you for these insiders informations that are unfortunately not verifiable. As for your edition, I question its relevance with the subject of the article, to say the least. As you may have noticed, the article you edited is about Brent Corrigan, not about Cobra Video or its owner and his private activities.

<dd>It's -not- my dispute. One of the editors was putting a demand in edit summaries to stop editing and then went to Arbcom because s/he thinks it's "illegal" to put the name in the article.

<hr />
<p>SchumckyTheCat, if you're going to leave commentary on this issue, at least get the story correct. I did not say it was "illegal" to put the name in the article. I first said that knowingly and maliciously spreading the private name of a porn actor is prosecutable. Given the intent of several of the editors and their commentary in the history, as well as the revert wars from several months ago, it was obvious that there was a malicious intent involved, which is legally prosecutable.</p>
<p>I elaborated further with:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have opened an arbitration case to have the Brent Corrigan article locked until the legal dispute is finalized. <b>Due to the sensitive nature of the release of his real name, as well as the allegations of underage sexual performance, I do not believe that Wiki should be involved in the dispute.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once the facts are laid bare, then this account should, in my opinion, either show or hide his information. Until such time, I believe this serves no one except those who intend harm to Mr. Corrigan.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the arbitration committee has no jurisdiction over content, who does then? <b>Keep in mind, I have no qualms with the display of his real name as it is a matter of fact. It is my concern that Wiki has become the "battleground" for a dispute that is currently in the courts. Given that the release of a porn actor's name without prior consent, particularly when dealing with a potentially underage performer, is illegal, why bring further headache until this court case is resolved?</b> This is why I requested the lock until the dispute is finalized.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd>Porn Actors sign legal agreements with the companies they contract with to use pseudonyms. This is primarily for their protection, given their line of work. It is that reasoning which I am following. Cobra Video released the real name of Brent Corrigan in a newsletter to all those who had subscribed, as well as to AVN. That is potentially thousands of individuals, if not more, that became privy to that information. That act was illegal in and of itself and is currently in court from a counter-suit by the Corrigan team. <b>Due to the potential legal problems, I don't think it would be wise to continue to place this information on Wiki, at least until the dispute is resolved. Once it's resolved, then people should do what they will given their own conscience. But at that point, the questions of legality would be answered.</b> Have I explained my stance on this issue appropriately?</dd>
</dl>
<p>It should be duly noted that I asked for a lock only until the court case was resolved, in order to avoid any potential legal issues. But after that point, people should do what they will with Brent's real name as it is indeed a matter of fact available for the world, unfortunately. That was my reason for going to arb, i.e. to get the article locked until the court dispute was resolved. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Natoma 03:58, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've left commentary because this dispute about this article disrupted lots of other places on the Wikipedia, and YOU raised the issue at the Arbitration Committee, which attracted attention. So here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The legal issues have nothing to do with Wikipedia, or anybody else except the people named in the suit. That issue is worthless to this discussion.</li>
<li>Releasing a celebrities name isn't prosecutable - anywhere (in the US), for any reason.</li>
<li>He has a civil tort against his agency. Wikipedia is not party to that suit. There is no legal issue we have to care about.</li>
<li>Contracts between porn actors and their agencies don't bind anyone else. What Cobra did might be reprehensible, but we just don't care, except to report the facts of the matter.</li>
<li>Users, via policy and consensus have jurisdiction over content, which is why I put this on Request for Comments.</li>
<li>The responses thus far are unanimous, there is no reason not to put the real name in the article. I agree though, it doesn't need to be repeated over and over. Once in the intro should be fine. There is a separation though, between his persona and real person. In the part discussing the legal case, it may be more appropriate to use his real name. So far, I neutralized that section by referring to "the actor" rather than the name.</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dd>1) I didn't disagree with you leaving commentary. I disagreed with your commentary because you got the story <i>wrong</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) The comments left in the history section of this article clearly show an argument between the Corrigan team and the Cobra owner team dating back months in which they revert warred on this article over and over again. And then there are anonymous users who have done nothing but insert Corrigan's real name as well as the Cobra owner's real name, with no comments whatsoever. Not to mention allegations of child pornography, drugs, alcohol abuse, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>That</i> is where the release of his name is prosecutable, because it's clear that this was done by the Cobra team. That then involves Wiki in the legal dispute, if it goes that far, as a matter of record.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The rules that were quoted to me on the RFA page, and the ones that I read personally, stated that when revert warring on this scale happens over and over again, a legitimate request for lock, or close watch by global wiki editors, can be submitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I stated before, there is absolutely no reason for Wiki to be the battleground between those two parties, or 3rd party affiliates, i.e. fans, while this legal dispute is going on. We have absolutely no idea how this affects Wiki's involvement due to Corrigan potentially being underage at the time of his performances, as well as both sides in that dispute using Wiki as their personal sounding board in what should be a private legal matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) You say that this dispute disrupted "lots" of other places on Wiki. Erm, only two other places other than this article was "disrupted", and that was the RFA page and the redirect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) In closing, I do not believe that it is Wiki's place to be the bludgeon tool of rabid fans of Corrigan and rabid fans of Bryan Phillips. Nor do I believe that it is conducive to what Wiki is <i>supposed</i> to be. There have already been cases where articles were locked in the past due to egregious content disputes that were reported in the news, such as when politicians send their lackeys to remove any "negative" comments about them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This warring had gotten out of hand and that's when I requested arbitration to lock the article until the court case was over.</dd>

<dd>There is still no legal issue for Wikipedia to care about.

In that case their <i>behavior</i> might stand to get them blocked.

<p>As I stated before, I see no reason (except moral, but that's not the point) why not to include the real name in the article. My only concern was how to include it. I agree with SchmuckyTheCat about the inclusion in the intro. That's how it's commonly done with any performer when the real name is known. I'm not sure about an inclusion in the "legal issues" part because only the pending law suit concerns the performer "real person". Maybe should we rewrite that part or stay with a reference to "the actor" or "the performer".</p>

<p>Lockhart is not "a potentially underage performer" but an adult whore who runs his own sexually explicit web site. Maybe we should censor Elton John's or John Wayne's real name too? Absurd. Lockhart's real name has been published in the media and this is in no way "prosecutable". Grow up-the name is not going away.</p>
<dl>
<dd>He <i>was</i> "a potentially underage performer" at the time, which is at the heart of the legal dispute brought by the Cobra team. He's an adult <i>now</i>, but that's not what the suit is dealing with is it? Given your comments about "growing up", you obviously have no comprehension of the point I was trying to make.

<dd>It is that uncertainty, as well as the use of Wiki as a battleground, that led me to want to nip this thing in the bud and put in a lock request until the dispute was settled in the courts. That's all. Natoma 18:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No no, you misunderstand. Me, or anyone else not affiliated with Cobra, including Corrigan's real name isn't illegal. It is the fact that Cobra's team are including his name that is the legal issue at hand. Because Cobra's team is blatantly doing so, as per the comments in the history log as well as the traceable IPs, that is where I see a potential problem coming as it pertains to Wikipedia. They are clearly breaking the law as it pertains to their contract, which is currently in court dispute. I just don't want to see Wiki potentially involved in that, and would rather it remain an impartial arbitor in this "war". Have I explained appropriately? Natoma 19:08, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The edit history probably does show a lot of violations of Wikipedia policy. As they are IP addresses and throwaway user names it isn't worth the time to pursue who and why they did what they did. So let's forget the past.</dd>
<dd>Let's move forward. We have general agreement that including the using the real name, which has been sourced and verified, in the intro paragraph, and using neutral phrases such as "the actor" in places where it would be inaccurate to use the stage name. Right?</dd>
<dd>Since the actions by "Cobra" appears to be insisting on including the name, that should neutralize their actions - we can stop worrying about it. The other edit warring behavior then is the removal of the real name. Wikipedia policy encourages the addition of notable information and I don't think there is a meaningful solution that makes that faction happy. The anonymous editors who continually remove the real name have not spoken up to defend that action. On Wikipedia, removal of sourced information that the community agrees is notable (such as the real name), is <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>.</dd>

If so, then the procedures on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> tell us how to deal with it. We can revert those changes without being accused of edit warring. We should put the vandal templates on the talk page of the accounts used to vandalize. We can put the article on administrators watchlists <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> and the username or IP addresses should get blocked.

<p>Ok. I suggest that you guys cancel the request for arbitration and simply treat removals of the name from the intro as vandalism. If the anons are incredibly persistent, I would suggest a request for comment or a partial page protection. I won't be here to help you with the vandalism, unfortunately, because I have a personal policy of avoiding anything relating to gay porn on the internet. Heh.

I have previously posted both the link and the actual article from Gayvn.com which identifies the case as COBRA VIDEO VS. SEAN PAUL LOCKHART. Idiots here deleted the article. If you want you can search through the gayvn.com archives so please stop whining about posting the link while I have already done so. I am ready to do this every day-so stop complaining and whining and GET USED TO IT because I am not giving in to the self-appointed censors here. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelbedewy_a0df.html" title="User:Melbedewy">Melbedewy</a></p>

<p>If you can't source your commentary Melbedewy, it will continue to be removed. If you want your version to be the consensus, source it in the article. The onus is on you to provide this information, not on the rest of us.</p>
<p>We've already come to a consensus on this. If the article you linked to was deleted, put it in and it will become part of the consensus. If you can't find this GAYVN article that you say exists, then we shall continue to use the one reference of Corrigan's real name, i.e. at the beginning of the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Corrigan_fa82.html" title="Brent Corrigan">Brent Corrigan</a> article, as it is done with other performers.</p>

A link is required for this, not the actual text of the article. Also, no court case name is referenced in this article, thus it doesn't support your claim of "COBRA VIDEO VS. SEAN PAUL LOCKHART" being the official court case title.</p>

<p>Given that the video cover shown is from a now withdrawn copy of Every Pool Boy's Dream which contains scenes of Brent Corrigan (cover model) engaged in underage sex might it be possible that use of any such images may contravene child protection laws. The fact that his penis isn't exposed on the cover means little as the picture is clearly sexual in nature featuring a minor.</p>
<p>As I don't live in the US and know even less about the laws surrounding child protection I could of course be wrong but I think it is something that should be considered.</p>

<p>The image DOES illustrate the DVD. The DVD is mentioned twice in the article, and it is especially relevant since it is the vehicle which made Brent so notable in the first place (and continues to keep him in the spotlight due to the controversy that surrounds the film itself). The image is not only a DVD cover; it is also a photo of Brent, who is the subject of the article. It is being used for non-profit, educational purposes. It is a low resolution photo and its inclusion here has no effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work (particularly since the movie itself no longer has a monetary value, since it is illegal its original form). How does that not constitute fair use? -<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBindingtheory_054a.html" title="User:Bindingtheory">Bindingtheory</a> 21:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is laden with bias. I realize that the main point of the article is to talk about Brent Corrigan, but all the edits and reverts that they seem to cause are all based on whether or not ALL of the information is presented in a pro-Corrigan light. Let's get some facts straight.</p>
<p>1) This person appeared in a relatively "new" type of gay pornography (bareback, non-safe porn that featured younger looking guys instead of guys who actually looked like men) 2) The guy who produced the movies has been in trouble for pedophilia before 3) Corrigan has CLAIMED that he was underage when he made a few of his movies (but no independent, oustside VERIFIABLE source can either confirm or deny this) 4) No one seems to know, for sure, WHY he has made this claim but the results have had profound effects on Cobra Video and Corrigan himself 5) The majority of the debate in here is coming from the fact that this revelation has caused a lot of controversy.</p>

<li>The correct title should be changed to <i>Fuck Me Raw</i>; Corrigan will release another video on September 1 called <i>Take It Like A Bitch Boy</i>. In both these videos Corrigan engages in semen eating and receptive bareback anal sex. Clips of Corrigan engaging in this activity are available. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.9.171.207.html" title="User:68.9.171.207">68.9.171.207</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.9.171.207.html" title="User talk:68.9.171.207">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.9.171.207_e54a.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.9.171.207">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I am restoring both comments, more or less.

I am, however, cutting your comments down as they're potentially commercial for Cobra Video and unnecessarily expository. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 14:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not to be an apologist for Brian but he was given a no jail slap on the wrist sentence because the "victim" not only looked 18 but represented himself on the internet as 18. Brian was never charged or convicted of any pornography offense-just having consensual sex with a person trolling the internet for sex who looked and represented himself as 18. Let me address the issue of "defamation". For something to be defamatory it must be untrue. I have stated as fact:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Corrigan engages in semen eating and receptive bareback anal sex. <i>Fact</i>-This can be easily confirmed by anyone who has seen his videos or just by googling <i>Brent Corrigan Bareback</i> Or, one could easily go to the Cobra commercial site listed in the Wikipedia article and view such scenes yourself-free. Indeed, a large measure of Corrigan's popularity derives from his uninhibited sexual practices which mainstream porn actors shun.</dd>
<dd>2. Corrigan's <i>Take It Like A Bitch Boy</i> will be released on September 1. <i>Fact</i>-This was stated on the Cobra Video site (which is a link in the Wikipedia article). Further proof, if required, can be found in the free clip on that site which shows Corrigan eating semen in a scene from this upcoming release. Again,in large part Corrigan's success in the business is due to his willingness to engage in uninhibited "no-holds barred" bareback sex acts. He is to be commended for his honesty. Last August, on the Juicygoo forum he published a lengthy and unabashed defense of his bareback sex videos.</dd>

<li>Where is the defamation? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.9.171.207.html" title="User:68.9.171.207">68.9.171.207</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.9.171.207.html" title="User talk:68.9.171.207">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.9.171.207_e54a.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.9.171.207">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dl>
<dd>I need to interject once again; even though <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, there is such a thing as unnecessary exposition, and you have made it a point to include a specific sexual phrase (or slight variations thereof) in each of your posts here, sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrent_Corrigan&amp;diff=69011142&amp;oldid=68864127" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABrent_Corrigan&amp;diff=69011142&amp;oldid=68864127" rel="nofollow">more than once within a paragraph</a>. This suggests either of two possibilities: 1) You have a healthy (or not so much) preoccupation with this activity, or you work for Cobra Video and are using promotional language to augment video sales. I understand you are attempting to counter accusations of "defaming and degrading" posts, but the appearance of PR needs to stop. Also, use four tildes (~~~~) at the end of your messages to "sign" them. Thanks.</dd>
<dd>Also, to Groy@san.rr.com: I have removed your last comment; TYPING IN ALL CAPS is the internet equivalent of shouting and is considered rude.

<p>All caps? No, we wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong idea that Wikipedia allows its site to be a haven for these sick individuals and child predators!</p>
<p>Bryan's business practice is to find young, naive boys with little or poor sex education awareness or experience then represents to the boys that with a negative test from their local clinic along with a home test taken just before a scene is shot then they are free and expected (demanded) to do the scenes bareback with all the dangerous "no holds barred" sex acts he produces! All the while the boys fully believe their best interests and safety are in Mr. Kocis' hands! This is why he never uses a boy after a few scenes. They usually wise up and realize he's been manipulating and misleading them all along! The likely person adding these posts, (Kent Barclay) or Damon Kruezer is just a sick individual who has nothing better to do then be Bryan's mouthpiece and try to wreck other's lives from his anonymous postings! It is the same person who was vandalizing the article before and will continue to do so unless it is locked until after a legal decision has been made!--Groy@san.rr.com 19:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To include an individual's work on that individual's page, irrespective of your <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unsourced</a> beliefs, is not vandalism; please read <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a> (what vandalism is and is not) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (including a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">soapbox</a>—your opinion is commendable, but an encyclopedia is not its forum).
