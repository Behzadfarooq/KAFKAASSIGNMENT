Kids with Cameras is a photographic educational program promoting visual cultural exchange. Kids from Mbare, Zimbabwe participated in workshops on photography, art, communication and creativity. Participants then used donated FUJI disposable cameras to photograph their environments.</p>
<p>Kids with Cameras wants to give underprivileged kids an extraordinary opportunity to explore their world with a camera. An opportunity they may never be given in on an ordinary circumstances. We want to educate, excite, and challenge participants to look at their environment from a different perspective. We hope proceeds from gallery exhibitions and donations will fund participating children's school fees and Kids with Camerasâ future projects.</p>
<p>Thirteen students ages 8-12 were selected from Harare, Zimbabweâs high-density suburb Mbare. Workshops were taught by the following volunteers. With their combined experience and energy, participants in the program learned a lot and had a great time. • Jill Mott: photojournalist, artist, teacher • Clayton Gunguwo: actor, musician, poet, teacher • Patrick Lindsell: camera person, teacher</p>
<p>Workshops were conducted at Savannah Arts, a community performing arts center in Mbare, Zimbabwe and participants photographed their surrounding environments.</p>
<p>February 2000 First Kids with Cameras workshops for kids held-Mbare, Zimbabwe April-May 2000 Our first exhibition: National Gallery of Art- Harare, Zimbabwe August 2000 Exhibition- Zimfest-Eugene, Oregon, USA November 2000 Pilot project in Gisenyi Rwanda May 2001 Participants from original pilot project will be staff photographers and assist in additonal workshops as part of the Third Annual Harare International Festival of the Arts. Keep posted for more 2001 events!!</p>
<p>Experienced volunteer teachers donated their time and 13 disposable cameras to Kids with Cameras. The workshops have been a wonderful success thus far. With generous donations from individuals, film and camera companies, non-government organizations and non-profit organizations, we hope we can fund this low-cost event and develop future workshops.</p>
<p>Workshop topics were taught in both English and Shona Topics included • Introduction and getting to know each other: - Introduction to Kids with Cameras • Teachers Introduction - Discussions of each child's favorite photo - Discussion of photos in current publications writing and sharing autobiographies art activities-hands on projects games • Photography - What is photography? - How do cameras work? - What makes a good photography? • Communications - How to talk with subjects and answer the basic questions who? what? when? where? why? how? - connecting with your subject through the camera creativity and learning about self importance • Instruction - Having confidence to be creative, being free, getting inspiration from your environment and surroundings, how to express yourself Each topic was approximately an hour interspersed with hands on activities and games. Games were a big part of this event. Kids must be kids and be comfortable with participants and teachers Review and discussion of photographs evaluation of program</p>
<p>Kids were given a short list of suggested photographs including of pictures each other and the individual's family. Kids were then given a camera to photograph what they like. Some suggested ideas • people at work -- women selling vegetables, hair salons, doctors, nyangas • market place music -- dancing, playing instruments, making instruments • games -- pada/manumbwe/Playing football with plastic ball • transportation • school • your environment i.e. house, neighborhood, ceremonies,weddings, lobola, birthdays, funerals, pets</p>
<p>If the camera is lost, stolen, or damaged there will not be any replacement and child is disqualified from the program. Respect and politeness: we expect all participants to respect fellow students, teachers and especially their subjects. Participants were required to make conversation and gather information from the subject either before or after the photo has been taken. Participants also explained to interested people what they are doing and shared information about the Kids with Cameras project.</p>
<p>Twenty-six color photographs chosen by the workshop coordinators and teachers make up "Mapikicha Edu", our pictures. At least one photo from each child will be selected to be a part of the exhibition. Each photo is accompanied by the photographer's picture and information about the project. A short promotional video accompanies the exhibition.</p>
<p>The workshop was free to participants, thanks to the generous help of donors. Lunch and transport was provided for participants in addition to tuition. We seek continual funding for disposable cameras and processing and development of photos for each project, in order to provide this workshop free to participants.</p>
<p>We hope Kids with Cameras will turn into a multifaceted event, developing into more workshops in both rural and regional areas of Zimbabwe, continuing and advanced education, a sister project in the aboard that will create friendships, correspondence and cultural exchanges. We hope to make this a continual event and possibly theme workshops geared towards specific groups of kids, for example street kids, refugee and squatter camp children, Aids orphans etc. The ultimate goal of Kids with Cameras is to produce a book including a wide variety of photographs taken by children from all walks of life. In conjunction with this book we hope to put together an interactive CD-ROM that will educate and entertain people about Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Kids with Cameras will be evaluated by not only students and teachers of the program but by donors, sponsors, the public and other interested parties. We will accept constructive criticism and make appropriate changes and additions guarantee the programs continued success. Note: This program is run completely on volunteer support and donations, we continue to seek any kind of assistance available. Thanks for your support</p>
