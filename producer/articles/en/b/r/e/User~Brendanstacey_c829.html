	    <p>Brendanstacey is the wikipedia username of one Brendan Stacey (1/10/1990-), a young <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweedish.html" title="Sweedish">Sweedish</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian.html" title="Malaysian">Malaysian</a> decent who currently resides in the western Sydney suburb of <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plumpton.html" title="Plumpton">Plumpton</a>. He is notorious for poor pronunciation, poor commitment and above all, being useless.</p>
<p>The only child of Ronald and Chooi-May Stacey, Brendan has submitted some rather interesting posts on the wikipedia website, including adding to pages regarding <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shangri-la.html" title="Shangri-la">Shangri-la</a> hotels, and produced two original pages, on '<a href="../../../u/n/d/Underclocking.html" title="Underclocking">underclocking</a>' and '<a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Grade_Cricket_a0b6.html" title="Sydney Grade Cricket">Sydney Grade Cricket</a>'.</p>
<p>Brendan is one who often falls victim to the disturbing, and horrifying 'lunch-time pranks' that occur mainly in the Morley Plaza, at Parramatta Marist. One such incident being the mob-mentalitised raiding of his lunch box, in which no food was spared, as the ruthless group ate all contents inside the lunchbox (including the disgusting orange sugary straps), of course primarily being led by the insane ring leader himself - <i>Chris Dundov</i>, who is known for these type of wild and unorthodox behaviours. This particular instance had (twice during the past week) left Brendan in tears and resulted in the innocent bystander Oliver Stewart, being placed in Brendan Stacey's 'Bad Books'. Hence the reason Brendan has been punishing Oliver of late, and blaming him for the lunchbox raiding incident. One example of such punishment was 18th September 2006, where Brendan had denied Oliver a mere <i>20c</i> for a popular Marist '<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butt_plug.html" title="Butt plug">Butt plug</a>'. This action displays Brendan's lack of compassion for his fellow man, and quite clearly proves that he is an uptight, cheap, wanker brought up, obviously, in <b>Plumpton</b>.</p>
<p>Amongst some of his better achievements includes a longstanding connection with the Blacktown District Cricket Assossiation. This commitment has, however, led to a lack of commitment in many areas, including school cricket training, spending time with his parents and creating himself a social life.</p>
<p>In a previous Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../j/b/u/User%7EJBurn_d623.html" title="User:JBurn">user:JBurn</a>, many people became worried about some of Brendan's <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> tendancies. Brendan tried in vain, as usual, to defend himself against these claims. Many critics, notably Nathan Cross and Andrew Sergis, labelled the article '<a href="../../../s/t/u/Stupid.html" title="Stupid">stupid</a>' and 'self indulging'. Many other critics questioned the reliability of his sources used to compile the article, with many quoted sources found to have been false. This leads to questions regarding the reliability of his previous wikipedia contributions.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2006, his latest contribution to wikipedia was made, and it has left wikipedia's resident analysts totally puzzled. In an unprecedented and certainly unprovoked move, he changed the article on <a href="../../../j/b/u/User%7EJBurn_d623.html" title="User:JBurn">user:JBurn</a>, for only a few minutes, to three simple words- A <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> <a href="../../../l/o/s/Loser.html" title="Loser">loser</a>. This was then promptly changed back to the article's previous state.</p>
<p>As said above, many had been worried in recent times about his homosexual tendancies, and it is quite obvious to all those that know him that he is a loser. Thus, calling <a href="../../../j/b/u/User%7EJBurn_d623.html" title="User:JBurn">user:JBurn</a> 'A gay loser' could be interpreted in three ways.</p>
<p>- He is a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocrite.html" title="Hypocrite">hypocrite</a> of the highest order, and is blind as usual to his own faults and is aiming simply to <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabricate.html" title="Fabricate">fabricate</a> and then exaggerate facts about others; - He is trying, in vain as usual, to compensate for in own incompetencies, by materialising false realities in the form of other people's faults, in the hope that they will make his own problems smaller and less noticable; or - He has realised that no girl could ever possibly like him (except possibly <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_French_a0e5.html" title="Jane French">Jane French</a>, who once asked for his photo so that she could show <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa.html" title="Santa">Santa</a> what she <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanted.html" title="Wanted">wanted</a> for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>), and that he had ought to reveal his true feelings, by calling randomly selected people homosexual, in the hope that they infact are gay, thus being able to pick them up. This third theory has been strongly agreed with by many high ranking scholars, including Proffessor Stuart McCreanor and Dr. Daniel Lovarini, both experts in the field of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexuality.html" title="Sexuality">sexuality</a>.</p>
<p>User:JBurn has issued a statement, claiming that he sincerly hoped that he was not being hit on by a fellow male, and offered to put Brendan through some intensive therapy.</p>
<p>An ever more contreversial figure, Brendan Stacey shall forever remain one of his country's most <a href="../../../u/s/e/Useless.html" title="Useless">useless</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boring.html" title="Boring">boring</a> yet treasured wikipedians.</p>
