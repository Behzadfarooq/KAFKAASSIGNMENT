<p>The episode opens with the Kira Investigation Team discussing Naomi Misora's disappearance and probable death. L suggests that if the disappearance is publicised, it should be presented in a way that makes it seem unrelated to the Kira case.</p>
<p>The discussion is interrupted by Watari, who directs the team to broadcast by the Sakura TV Station. The reporters state that they are effectively hostages of Kira, who has sent them four tapes to be broadcasted. The first tape foretold the deaths of two criminals, who indeed died the day before. The tape also directed the reporters to air the second tape in a matter of moments, otherwise they would die. The second tape is then broadcasted.</p>
<p>In a manner similar to L's method of communication, the word "Kira" appears on the screen in a distorted version of the font L uses. A similarly masked voice directs viewers to switch to Taiyou TV, where they will find the news anchor dead. The members of the investigation team switch the channel and indeed see the presenter collapsed. Back on Sakura TV, the voice of Kira directs viewers to another channel, where one of his detractors has also just died. After viewing this death as well, L immediately calls for the broadcast to stop, and various members of the investigation team try to do so, with no success. One of them, Ukita, leaves to go to the station and stop the broadcast personally.</p>
<p>As Ukita speeds towards the television station, the voice of Kira states that he doesn't want to kill any innocent people, as he hates evil and loves justice. In fact, he declares that he does not consider the police his enemy. What he wants is to create a world with no evil, which will be easy if everyone co-operates with him. As long as they do not try to find him or speak against him publicly, no innocent people will have to die. It seems that Kira wants everyone to wait a while until this new world will be accepted by all. All of this is also watched by Light's father in his hospital room. His wife turns the television set off, concerned for her husband's health, but Light's father is determined to continue watching, since he is the leader of the Kira Investigation Team.</p>
<p>By this time, Ukita has arrived at the shut doors of the television station building and gets ready to shoot the locks open when he suddenly gets a heart attack. He tries to press his belt buckle to alert L, but collapses dead on the ground before he can do so. His death, however, is broadcasted by reporters on the scene and viewed by L and the other detectives. One of them, Aizawa, starts for the door, but L stops him from going to the television station and urges him to calm down, as Aizawa will also die if he goes there. Aizawa counters by stating that Kira needs both a face and a name to kill, and they all use fake names. Matsuda wonders if this means that Kira knows their real names. While L thinks he cannot rule this possibility out entirely, he also believes that if this were the case, they would all have died long ago.</p>
<p>L concludes that Kira must be either inside or near the television station building so that he can see the face of everyone trying to enter the station. Aizawa still wants to go, and angrily reminds L about L's resolve to risk his life in order to capture Kira. L, however, tells Aizawa that risking one's life and letting it to be taken away so easily are two completely different things. Aizawa finally calms down after hearing this statement and noticing L clutching his own legs tightly, a sign of his frustration L's own powerlessness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kira's message ends with him giving the police a four-day ultimatum about whether they are going to work with him or not. He has prepared the third and fourth tapes to be shown for each potential response. At the same time, Light's father has left his room in the hospital and drives through the front doors of the television station in a van. Coming out with his coat covering his head, he asks the security guard to show him where the studio televising the Kira tape is located. On arriving there, he commands the television manager to hand him every tape Kira sent as well as all copies, going so far as to threaten the manager with his gun.</p>
<p>The investigation team sees in the television screen a police car arriving at the station, and realise that there are some policemen who still want to fight Kira. L gets Aizawa to phone police Vice Director Kitamura on his mobile phone and tells him that the policemen who just arrived acted on their own volition. He adds that Kitamura needs to act quickly and responsibly to prevent a tragedy from happening. Kitamura sees the two policemen fall dead and the news crew hastily leaving the scene, and agrees to follow L's instructions completely. At the same time, Watari gets a call from Light's father and passes it to L. Light's father reports that he has all tapes, but is stuck on how he will leave the station safely. After speaking with Kitamura, L directs Light's father to exit the station from the main entrance in five minutes. Five minutes later, Light's father leaves the station through the main entrance, in front of which a large number of policemen have gathered, hiding their faces behind shields. Curtains and other obstructions help Light's father enter a car unseen and leave. Another journalist, encouraged by these acts, speaks out against Kira and in favour of the police, and even announces his own name in defiance.</p>
<p>Light’s father returns to the hotel and gives the tapes to L, who notices that the postmark is from Osaka. However, he takes into account Kira's suggested ability to manipulate people's actions and doesn't think much of it. He then delivers the original tapes to Aizawa to examine them for clues and views the copies himself. The next morning, L tells everyone that if the police agree to help Kira, they are supposed to broadcast the third video, which details various methods of co-operation between Kira and the police, such as announcing the names of all criminals and leaving them to the judgement of Kira. It also demands that L and the chiefs of police appear on television and state their support of Kira. This, the investigation team realises, would enable Kira to kill both L and the police chiefs if they ever moved against him. As far as the video corresponding to a negative answer is concerned, it essentially states the same things phrased differently. L allows this last video to be broadcasted by Sakura TV, and everyone hears Kira demanding a sacrifice: within four days, either Light's father or L must appear on television and be killed.</p>
<p>Light has watched all this from the television in his room and laughs at the thought that the gods are on his side. In this case, the gods are Death Gods, as Light is certain that another Death God besides Ryuk must have come to this world and given a spare Death Note to another human. This human appears to be a supporter of Kira, and also seems to possess the Death God Eyes, enabling him to learn someone's name by looking at their face. Light thinks that if he takes no action, L will die in four days. On the other hand, he feels he can't let this imposter Kira sully the real Kira's name. Besides, if the imposter is caught, the existence of the Death Note might be revealed. Light concludes that the best thing to do would be to involve himself in the Kira Investigation Team, so he can get information on both th real ira case as well as the imposter Kira.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, Light's father returns to announce that every nation in the world agrees that L should be the one to appear on television and die. L thinks that this is the correct decision, but is unhappy with it - not because he will die, as he explains, but because he will be killed by someone taking advantage of the Kira case. He reveals that he thinks it is quite probable that this Kita is an imposter, or second Kira. L explains that the two criminals this Kira killed in the first tape to prove his identity were reported only in a women's magazine and a variety show. The real Kira would never bother to kill such unimportant criminals, and the second Kira also needed criminals that were unlikely to be killed by the real Kira before he had a chance to do so. Furthermore, L reasons that the real Kira so far has refrained from killing innocents.</p>
<p>L believes that if they can capture one of the Kiras, they can obtain useful information on the other one, and asks Light's father to let Light join the Kira Investigation Team. Light's father wonders if ths means L thinks his son is innocent, but L denies this, mentioning instead that Light's excellent deductive abilities are useful to him in any case. However, L does want to hide from Light all suspicions about the existence of a second Kira.</p>
<p>The scene then changes to a young girl, who is actually the second Kira. She is shown walking down a street, followed by a female Death God. The Death God asks her why she doesn't use the Death Note she gave her more for her own sake, but Misa - the girl - states they she is in fact using it for her sake by supporting Kira and drawing his attention to her so that he will meet her. She believes that Kira is already interested in her. The Death God warns her against playing such a dangerous game and mentions the possibility of her death, but Misa is convinced that Kira will not harm an innocent girl like her. Besides, she adds as the camera zooms on her unnatural-looking eyes, if it does come to the worst, her eyes will give her the edge.</p>
