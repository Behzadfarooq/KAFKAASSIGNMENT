<ul>
<li>Joey (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Howitt_b539.html" title="Peter Howitt">Peter Howitt</a> until series 4; <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Bickley_3096.html" title="Graham Bickley">Graham Bickley</a> up to series 7) was the eldest and wisest of the offspring, dressed in smart leather clothing, using the earliest (ie, enormous) <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phone</a> and driving a classic <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaguar_%28car%29.html" title="Jaguar (car)">Jaguar</a>, despite having no obvious source of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income.html" title="Income">income</a>. He contributed large sums to the family kitty and was often his mother's spokesman. He had an on-off relationship with a girl called Roxy (played by <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Phillips-Lane_9d3a.html" title="Joanna Phillips-Lane">Joanna Phillips-Lane</a> and of whom his mother disapproved because she had a child and had broken his heart before) and preferred to acknowledge people with the word "greetings".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jack (<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_McGuire_9bf0.html" title="Victor McGuire">Victor McGuire</a>) was arguably the hardest-working and most likable of the five, with no wild aspirations to have a glamorous job, but just to make a reasonable living. His main source of income was as a dealer in anything which would fit into the battered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a> he drove. He left the family home to visit the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> in series 4 (which covered McGuire's decision to take a break from the show) and came back wiser but still not rich. He had little luck with women until the elder Leonora Campbell (<a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Grant_33e9.html" title="Deborah Grant">Deborah Grant</a>) moved in further down Kelsall Street, and the two had a relationship, of which his mother naturally disapproved due to the age gap.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adrian (<a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathon_Morris_533e.html" title="Jonathon Morris">Jonathon Morris</a>) - a character who was baptised James and called Jimmy as a child but decided the name was too common and changed it - was the artistic and <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">idealistic</a> one of the quintet, and continually pointed out that he was the only one with a proper, honest job (in an <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_agent.html" title="Estate agent">estate agent</a>). He became a published <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poet</a> and artist and also worked as a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_%28person%29.html" title="Model (person)">model</a>, but his successes were tempered by an extraordinary inferiority complex, especially around women. He had a relationship with a <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymphomania.html" title="Nymphomania">nymphomaniac</a> called Carmen who broke his heart. He frequently emphasised his panicky outlook on life with the phrase <i>"Hanging by a thread!"</i> Eventually, he found happiness with a woman called Irenee (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Byatt_5bd4.html" title="Sharon Byatt">Sharon Byatt</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aveline (<a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilly_Coman_a668.html" title="Gilly Coman">Gilly Coman</a> until series 4; <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Hill_b9ed.html" title="Melanie Hill">Melanie Hill</a> up to series 7) was the only daughter and was therefore protected hugely by her mother and brothers, to the extent of vetting <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">boyfriends</a> and wearing a <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle.html" title="Whistle">whistle</a> round her neck at all times in case of attack. She had aspirations to be a model, which were partly achieved, but she temporarily gave up her ambitions when she met, fell in love with and married Oswald (<a href="../../../g/i/l/Giles_Watling_f31d.html" title="Giles Watling">Giles Watling</a>), a local <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar.html" title="Vicar">vicar</a>, which brought out her mother's religious prejudices, although her brothers liked him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Billy (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Conway_526d.html" title="Nick Conway">Nick Conway</a>) was the youngest and daftest of the quintet, who worked in a variety of jobs, including running his own <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandwich.html" title="Sandwich">sandwich</a>-delivery business. Despite his youth and immaturity, he was the first Boswell to marry, leave home and have a child, thanks to a fiery, on-off relationship with the astute and cynical Julie (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_Milmoe_5734.html" title="Caroline Milmoe">Caroline Milmoe</a> until series 2; <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Crowson_7b4d.html" title="Hilary Crowson">Hilary Crowson</a> thereafter) who lived across the road. Billy moved in with Julie and they had a daughter, Francesca, but found it tough to escape his mother's apron strings due to the distance, and Julie regularly kicked him out. Billy drove a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Beetle_927d.html" title="Volkswagen Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> which frequently emitted loud bangs from the exhaust system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nellie and her children all took it in turns to visit and deliver meals to Grandad (<a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Waller_d875.html" title="Kenneth Waller">Kenneth Waller</a>) - It was never made clear as to who's father he actually was; even Nellie and Freddy called him Grandad. He was referred to by non-family members as Mr Boswell, therefore it could be assumed he was Freddy's father. However In an episode from series 3, Grandads name is revealed as William Thomas Duvall. After the death of Freddys brother Cyril, in series 1, Joey reveals that Grandad was fond of him "even though he doesn't usually get on with Dads side of the family". Also, Nellie once refers to Freddy as Grandad's only <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affinity_%28law%29.html" title="Affinity (law)">Son-in-Law</a>, which would mean that Grandad was in fact Nellie's father.) who lived next door. He was a cantankerous and obnoxious man at times, never appearing grateful for the way the family kept him, but they all doted on him, and he was always willing to hand out serious advice. His wife, referred to by everyone as Granny, had long since died and Grandad mourned her, although he had always reserved love for another woman (the never-seen Edie Mathieson) and told the family so.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freddy's girlfriend, Lilo Lil, was an <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> woman of a similar age to the Boswell parents, but with a more flamboyant dress sense and a self-confessed desire for passion in her relationships, which she claimed in her frequent confrontations with Nellie (who called her a "tart", to her face and to others) was the main reason why Freddy preferred her. That said, Freddy - who swept roads for a living - often tried to get back with his wife before finding Lilo Lil too tempting. She was often heard to scream, publicly: <i>"I love you Freddy Boswell."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derek (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Byrne_b454.html" title="Peter Byrne">Peter Byrne</a>) was a <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widower.html" title="Widower">widower</a> who befriended Nellie when he met her in a park and tried, unsuccessfully, to forge a relationship with her (in a parallel with the Ria/Leonard dilemma depicted in another Carla Lane sitcom, <i><a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterflies_%28TV_series%29_a787.html" title="Butterflies (TV series)">Butterflies</a></i>). Nellie was tempted by him but couldn't bring herself to have another relationship while she was still technically married. If he called her and she was in company (she told no-one of his existence) she would say "thankyou!" in a comedically high-pitched voice and hang up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two local businessmen and small-time thugs and crooks were the monosyllabic Yizzel (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lawson_ed58.html" title="Charles Lawson">Charles Lawson</a>) and his partner who, despite being the brains and voice of the duo, was never named in dialogue and was therefore always credited as 'Yizzel's mate' (<a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Rouse_ba09.html" title="Simon Rouse">Simon Rouse</a>). They ran a <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limousine.html" title="Limousine">limousine</a> company called <i>Occasion Cars</i> and were acquaintances of Joey.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Father Dooley (<a href="../../../j/2E/g/J.G._Devlin_ff66.html" title="J.G. Devlin">J.G. Devlin</a>) was the local Catholic priest to whom Nellie - and, less regularly, other family members - would go to seek advice or confess.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The family had a <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a> called Mongy, a shortening of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongrel.html" title="Mongrel">mongrel</a>. He was only seen in outdoor scenes shot on location, never in studio scenes. He met his end when a storyline required him to be run over and killed and the Boswells were united in grief.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In series 4, cousin Shifty (a nickname derived from his nature and played by <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Murray_%28actor%29_384c.html" title="Bryan Murray (actor)">Bryan Murray</a>) turned up after leaving <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> and moved into Grandad's house while occupying Jack's seat at mealtimes. Initially this was to compensate for the absence of Jack, but the character stuck around after Jack's return. He was Grandad's favourite grandchild, despite being a career <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">criminal</a> (less subtly than the others) and combined dead end jobs and failed business interests (including running a mobile <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greengrocer.html" title="Greengrocer">greengrocery</a> from the back of a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearse.html" title="Hearse">hearse</a>) with more petty crime. His ex-girlfriend Celia (<a href="../../../r/i/t/Rita_Tushingham_e155.html" title="Rita Tushingham">Rita Tushingham</a>) turned up briefly, before he began a relationship with the Boswell nemesis, <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Social_Security_a3ed.html" title="Department of Social Security">DSS</a> (then <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Security_8282.html" title="Department of Health and Social Security">DHSS</a>) clerk Martina (<a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Power_a60f.html" title="Pamela Power">Pamela Power</a>), who had spent previous series' fending off the begging and sweet-talking attempted by various Boswell members to get more financial aid from the Government. This relationship with Shifty allowed Martina, a popular character, to be seen beyond her working environment.</li>

<p>The show's title is a reference to the use of 'bread' as a slang term for money. A regular scenario in each episode was that of Nellie opening a cockerel-fashioned kitchen storage pot prior to the evening meal, into which the family would place money for their upkeep. The amount of money placed in the pot by each depended on how successful a day they'd had. The pot would be at the forefront of the screen at the end of each episode as the credits rolled.</p>
<p>Other frequently-seen scenarios included Nellie answering a cordless phone (a newfangled item in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>) which she kept in the pocket of her pinny (she always said "Hello yes?" when answering); and the parking places outside the terraced house for the family's many vehicles being kept free by some illicitly-acquired police traffic cones, normally used by police to keep road sides free of stationary traffic.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the show's success was its use of <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a>-style <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhangers</a>. This meant that viewers had to tune in each week to see how the previous week's cliffhanger would be resolved. This also meant that each episode was not self-contained, but the <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_%28narrative%29.html" title="Plot (narrative)">plot</a> unfolded as the series progressed. This was very unusual for a comedy at the time, but has been used to great effect by comedies since, for example <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a>.</p>
<p>The theme tune was sung by the cast members and was released on BBC Records but failed to make the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_singles_chart_21be.html" title="UK singles chart">UK singles chart</a>.</p>

<p>Critics of <i>Bread</i> claimed it belonged to a peculiar sub-type of British sitcom which repudiated any explicit effort to produce jokes and instead existed in a kind of timeless, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperreality.html" title="Hyperreality">hyperreal</a> world where a scatter of catchphrases and minor <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slapstick.html" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a> were sufficient to engage the audience and induce them to laugh. It was also criticised for perpetuating the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a> of lazy, criminally-minded <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouser.html" title="Scouser">Scousers</a>. The changing of <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actors</a> for various key roles (including Joey, Aveline and Julie) also didn't help with the show's flow, although in hindsight only the impact of Joey's character was affected to any great extent.</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, the programme was enormously successful and at its peak obtained viewer figures of more than 20 million. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_McCartney_2d21.html" title="Linda McCartney">Linda McCartney</a> appeared in one episode - Linda took tea with Nellie (who didn't recognise her - <i>"your husband got a job has he?"</i>) before being picked up by Paul in the car outside the house.</p>
<p>The show has dated more than many sitcoms of the 1980s, largely due to the emphasis on the effects of the era's political climate, and therefore is infrequently repeated on terrestrial or satellite television.</p>
