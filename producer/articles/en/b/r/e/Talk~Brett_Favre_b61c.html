1. moved into 5th all-time for games played by QB, 1 behind Marino<br />
2. 2nd all-time for both total TDs and total points by QB (to tie Marino, needs 2 TDs)<br />
3. Favre is 2nd for points per game (10.6), tied with Marino, PManning 1st at 12.0<br />

5. Favre moved up in consecutive games started (ref. Packers.com)...<br />

<p>I don't get it. Tonight I post up that he has 5,000 completions. A few minutes later someone reverts the number back to the old number. Then someone else changes it back to 5,000. &#160;?? There was a game this evening, and he did become the first QB to ever complete 5k. And there is one game left. <a href="../../../l/e/j/User%7ELejonis_de8e.html" title="User:Lejonis">Lejonis</a> 06:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apologies on that. We've been having some issues here in the past week with people modifying stats back and forth, so likely someone saw that you changed it to 5,000 and didn't know they played tonight so figured it was an invalid change. It's good you brought the discussion here, where it belongs. Don't get discouraged, stuff like this happens on WikiPedia.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWeeden_2921.html" title="User:AdamWeeden"><font face="tahoma, verdana, georgia, arial, sans-serif">Adam Weeden</font></a> 11:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also one thing you may want to do to avoid this probalem in the future is to update as many of the stats as you can, in as many of the places as you can. This will make people less likely to think your changes to be false and will improve the accuracy of the article. Since you only changed completions and not attempts, people will wonder how he could have completed those passes without even attempting.&#160;;) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWeeden_2921.html" title="User:AdamWeeden"><font face="tahoma, verdana, georgia, arial, sans-serif">Adam Weeden</font></a> 13:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I should have updated the others. That was actually my first wiki post and was sort of watching to see if took. For an hour after the game no news source mentioned the completion record - and I thought the record significant.<a href="../../../l/e/j/User%7ELejonis_de8e.html" title="User:Lejonis">Lejonis</a> 23:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well the media seems to be getting Brett Favre'd out. I get the feeling most of them just want him to retire already so they can talk about someone else. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWeeden_2921.html" title="User:AdamWeeden"><font face="tahoma, verdana, georgia, arial, sans-serif">Adam Weeden</font></a> 01:49, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MVP Awards</span></h2>
<p>Second paragraph loudly proclaims that he is the only three-time MVP in the history of the NFL. But surely that should be qualified as three-time <b>Associated Press</b> MVP, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The league has no official MVP (is that right?)</li>
<li>He only won the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_3e78.html#As_awarded_by_the_Pro_Football_Writers_of_America" title="National Football League Most Valuable Player Award">Pro Football Writers' MVP</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_3e78.html#The_Bert_Bell_Award.2C_awarded_by_the_Maxwell_Football_Club" title="National Football League Most Valuable Player Award">Bert Bell Award</a> twice -- both of those awards were given only to Barry Sanders in 1997 instead of the AP Sanders-Favre tie.</li>
<li>Otto Graham and Johnny Unitas both got three <a href="../../../u/p/i/UPI_NFL_MVP_fc60.html" title="UPI NFL MVP">UPI NFL MVP</a> awards. Otto Graham received his before the AP started their awards, and it looks like the UPI awards were pretty much the only game in town at that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>this is where wikipedia told me to put this message, so don't say it's wrong, and the stats are crap, do YOu not have an education, one place says he has 56,756 yards. At the top it says 56,463 and at the top in the side box it says he has 56,197, that's three difference numbers and you say that's accurate, where did you go to school, wikipedia told me to request the {editprotected} in the talk section and you say it's the wrong place, Brett favre being protected is making the page look laughable, your so off, it's says his career recors is 143-88, that's adds up to 231, he's has started in 234 consecutive games as a quarterback and his record is 144-90 and you think I'm going to put incorrect stats, he's my favorite player and I want his page stats to be correct on all accounts, this page is embarrasing right now, he can't have three different numbers of stats scattered around the page, it should be correct all over the page, I don't care about the dialog and biography, I just want the stats correct and for your info, the stats under Favre continues to close in on several NFL career records, I typed all that, that's why it's there and the Playoff records under the career stats, I typed all that months ago, so don't say I'm going to put incorrect info, most the stat info on the page was originated by me before the page was protected. Please unprotect the page so I can fix the stats, you have my word I won't put incorrect info, I'm to much of a Brett fan and I also added all the stats to the Morten Andersen page if you want to check it, I didn't put false stats on his page, I just want wikipedia to be a credited website. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.245.122.216 (<a href="../../../4/2E/2/User_talk%7E4.245.122.216.html" title="User talk:4.245.122.216">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.245.122.216_f5fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.245.122.216">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>You don't know nothing about Brett Favre, his record was 143-90 correct, but he won the game this Sunday 30-19 against san francisco, that's 144-90, not 143-91, and if you went to school you would know that and please take off the Brett is on pace crap after the stats, that looks stupid, I'm not cutting you down and trying to degrade you, I'm just frustrated because I'm giving you acurate info and you are ignoring it and you won't let me fix it.

<p>I didn't delete the page, the talk page had a ton of stuff earlier, now it hardly has anything, I didn't delete all that stuff, the stats are easy for me I follow Favre and any page that isn't accurate isn't very good, I could fix that. I don't mind if you fix it though, the only thing wrong is consecutive starts at the top and the side top it says 233, it's 234 and 254 with playoffs and it's also wrong in the records and milestones section, also under records and milestones, delete all that would finish the season at current pace junk like you did with the career wins, other than that the page looks great now, thanks for updating. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.245.123.105 (<a href="../../../4/2E/2/User_talk%7E4.245.123.105.html" title="User talk:4.245.123.105">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.245.123.105_4c1c.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.245.123.105">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Image</span></h2>
<p>The discussion was getting pretty long, so I archived the old talk which wasn't being discussed. I think this article needs an image. If you browse "Brett Favre" on flickr, you'll find a bunch of results. I was thinking about emailing one of the users with a Brett Favre photo and asking if they'd release the image to Wikipedia. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cvalentine/247872689/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cvalentine/247872689/" rel="nofollow">this</a> seems like a nice one. I'm not sure how the copyrights work with players in uniform. I believe you have to get "express written consent from the NFL" or something if you want to include a player in a uniform or logo. If anyone knows anything about this, please respond. If we're allowed this, then I will email some of those Flickr users. I found an image of Favre <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/66936559@N00/311364921/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/66936559@N00/311364921/" rel="nofollow">of him golfing</a> that doesn't include a team logo.

<p>I think the page looks awful with the current pace stuff, I have to agree, it's very incorrect,innapropriate, and unneeded, What he is on pace to do is not what he will do and it's just cluttering the page with a lot of dialog that no one will read because it's to much to read and it not even fact, it's speculation, lets just celebrate his factual numbers, that's what people want to see and be impressed by, no credible Brett Favre page like espn or nfl.com would put such nonsence on there Brett Favre pages, just the stats and factual numbers and if this is to be a credible page, it should be the same, but this page will be better because it includes a extended biography on his life before getting to the records and milestones, so lets get rid of the on pace stuff, it weekens the page and the whole records and milestones section. starwars1955</p>

<p>Yes, ESPN might mention on sportscenter that bonds is on pace to hit so many homers, but not on there espn home pages of Bonds and Tomlinson, they just put recent news, career stats, and biography, what you are on pace to do is not what you will do and no credible website would put that, they would put only correct information, not what might be. People don't visit the site to find out if he's going to break records this year, they visit it to learn things about Brett Favre that the don't know, creditble stats, mature people don't care what someone is on pace to do, and I think other users should be running this page and not kids, please wikipedia users, bote below on whether or not to keep the current pace dialog on here or now, I don't think people care because no one is voting but the people that have been fighting me on this, I think you need to work on a page that needs it and let a Favre fan take care of this page, but please put below if you approve or dissaprove.

<dd><b>Strong Approve</b>, ESPN does it all the time on Sportscenter and announcers do it all the time during games. Favre's pace adds to the article and Favre may not play next year. His pace takes into account his averages during the season and it is not harming anything being there for two weeks. And besides, just because NFL.com might not do it, it doesn't mean it is unencyclopedic and a bad idea. The great part about the pace thing is that it <i>is</i> sourced. And people DO want to see if Favre is going to break the records or not. They wouldn't be reading the section if they didn't want to find out.++<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAviper2k7_0275.html" title="User:Aviper2k7"><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">aviper2k7</span></a>++ 04:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Outside view: Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball. An unmaintained/undermaintained article should be frozen at the beginning of the season. A well-maintained article can have stats updated game by game and list records actually broken. If someone in authority (like Favre himself or his coach) says, "Favre will not play next year" or "Favre is considering not playing next year", that's an encyclopedic statement (provided it is sourced). But Wikipedia is not ESPN and it's not SportsCenter - we shouldn't be in the business of guessing what records he might break or whether he might retire. I have no interest (or knowledge) of the issue ... I only noticed it because I have been checking up on everything in the Falcons category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/Category:Atlanta_Falcons_players" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/Category:Atlanta_Falcons_players" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> since some vandalism earlier this week. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your concise and compelling argument is appreciated. I had not seen that specific (crystal ball) statement before, and it appears as if the calculations being done are, in fact, extrapolation.

<dd><b>Disapprove, for other reasons</b>. Upon looking at the article and the discussion here, I would say that I disapprove of the projections, but I'd like to suggest a different reason it's probably not a good idea - I think an editor doing their own statistical analysis, simple or otherwise, consititutes <i>original research</i>, which is also against policy. Let's take the article <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Knight_83c6.html" title="Bobby Knight">Bobby Knight</a>. The article says: 'As of December 17, 2006, Knight ranks second on the all-time Division I coaching wins list with 878. He needs one more win to tie Dean Smith, who currently holds the record with 879.' These are verifiable facts, not projections.

<p>Have we decided that the separate citations on the "Second all time $STAT" thing is a bad idea? I thought that having the reference point to the particular leaderboard for each stat was a good idea, as one could click and see who was first, second, third, etc. It shouldn't just point to Favre's page at profootballreference.com. That doesn't cite that he's second, that only cites how much of "statistic X" he has.

<p>No, by going to that Favre page, below it says completions, attemps, TD's and yards, and where he ranks all-time, by clicking on any of those 4 you get the all-time leaderboard for those 4 categories, which provides you with the top 50 all-time in those 4 categories, so that page is a direct link to those leaderboards, and that's much easier because they are all there, all you have to do is go to that Brett Favre page and that info is right under his career stats before you get to his playoff stats, this is a easier and more suitible way of doing it. starwars1955</p>

Secondly, there should be a ref (a la the ones I had for the projections) explaining that as the source of those numbers at least, though I would argue that using that logic can only be as accurate as the person who put that mentioned list into points order, since points aren't mentioned there. Did they do it by hand? Did they use a program to calculate it? Did they calculate the total TDs of EVERY QB to make sure no one had more total touchdowns? What about players such as George Blanda who were kickers AND QBs in many games? Do we only count their TDs, or are they automatically marginalized as we do no by saying "but most of their games were as kickers" (which doesn't sound very scientific in my humble opinion)?

<dd>I remind you again, please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. Firstly, the fact that the Dan Marino page has it (also without a reference) proves nothing. Two wrongs don't make a right. Secondly, it's not my responsibility to compile the list you gave me into a sorted points list. I'm asking you to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">PROVE</a> that what is stated is true. I follow your calculations exactly that Favre has 2,556 points, and that point is self explanatory (though I think a reference stating how that calculation was made would benefit the article for those who may not know of the simplicity of such a calculation). My point is you must prove the claim that he is second, because as you know, rushing touchdowns don't factor into his 413 or Marino's 420. What if someone way behind him in passing TDs had enough rushing TDs to give them more total? I'd be willing to bet that there is no such player, but Wikipedia is about verifiability, so unless you can verify that no one else does with a source, it has no place here. Again for men who played as kickers and QBs where do we cut it off? If Brett Favre went out and kicked a field goal next week would he be eliminated because some of his points were as a kicker? Of course not,we would just be unlikely to count those 3 points. Similarly with Blanda and Morrall, VERIFY how many points they made as kickers vs. how many they made as QBs. Be careful for those games they did both in. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWeeden_2921.html" title="User:AdamWeeden"><font face="tahoma, verdana, georgia, arial, sans-serif">Adam Weeden</font></a> 21:50, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Therefore, I have put the 'Unreferenced' tag on the section, as I see a dozen or more uncited statistics that I believe should be cited in the simple interest of proper record-keeping. I'll see what I can do about a few of them.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Cite web format</span></h3>
<p>I think if we want to get this article to featured status, we should change all the web citations to the {{cite web}} format. Is this an issue or not? It really makes the citations appear a lot cleaner in the references, and maybe it's a help. Of course, it could just be a lot of wasted man hours, as this article has something like 70 references. –<i><b><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a></b></i>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Bee_0f2c.html" title="User talk:King Bee">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_King_Bee_9e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/King Bee">C</a>)</sup> 16:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm emphatically in favor of this. It cleans up the article text itself significantly and makes the whole article "appear" more encyclopedic (in that we aren't forcing readers to jump around across the Web to see what our sources are - all they have to do is check the References section).

<ul>
<li>Third all-time in career wins by starting quarterback, with <b>146</b> (Elway, 148; Marino, 147) <sup id="_ref-favrewatch_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-favrewatch" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>

<li>Third all-time in career record by a quarterback, at <b>146-90</b> (Elway, 148-82-1; Marino, 147-93)</li>
</ul>
<p>is a ranking.</p>
<p>I added in the page; What does this even mean? Is it referring to wins? If it is, then the record for career wins is right above this. If this is included, his losses are not sourced. Do the losses include the time he was in Atlanta? Is this being updated every week? Is there even a citation that proves this record? Please keep this out, it doesn't make any sense</p>
<p>but you responded with; (It means greatest record all time by a quarterback and it deserves a mention for goodness sake,it's a factual stats,what's your problem with it aviper2k7,and quit deleting the DeionSanders fact,vandal)</p>
<p>The stat is based on wins, and not winning percentage, so how is his record being ranked? If it's ranked by wins, it's already mentioned. If it's winning percentage, I don't think that's true and is unsourced. Feel free to add his record somewhere in the page with a proper source, but please stop calling me a vandal.

<dd>Also of note: If it is based on winning percentage, what is the minimum number of games needed for consideration? We can't have a player play 1 game, go 1-0, get injured, and then he owns the record. This, however, shouldn't be for us to decide as that would fall close to original research. I say we remove it either way unless someone can provide a link to a ranked list of winning percentage for quarterbacks by a reliable source. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamWeeden_2921.html" title="User:AdamWeeden"><font face="tahoma, verdana, georgia, arial, sans-serif">Adam Weeden</font></a> 12:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you've hit the nail on the head. In the interest of simplicity, I think it's going to be easiest to leave this stat out of record comparisons, and keep to wins, which is a fairly straightforward record to maintain. Who is 'best' by win percentage depends completely upon how many minimum games are required, and that minimum is <i>subjective</i>. Too few, and you get 8-1 quarterbacks; too many, and there are too few players under consideration. Since there isn't a "standard", it shouldn't be included, except as a statement of fact of win percentage, (rather than who is "better" than who). <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 17:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks good so far. Among the things needing cleanup - the "citation needed" tags need to be sourced or the statements removed, the "Awards and honors" needs some cleanup, preferably in the prose and without trivia items like the <i>There's Something About Mary</i> note that's neither an award or an honor.

<dd>I was in the process of changing all the citations in the article to the cite-web format, as you can see in the above discussion and in my edit summary at the very end. We are doing this to get the article closer to featured article status, and because the cite-web template makes the references appear very clean at the end. I don't know what you find confusing about the template; there is simply a spot for url, publisher, date, accessdate, and title. There's probably a field for author as well, I haven't checked. I can understand how you might have missed the discussion above, but the next time someone is seemingly making sweeping changes to the article, check out the talk page before reverting their work. I just want to stay friendly here, since we both want the same thing in the end: a damn fine lookin' Brett Favre article. –<i><b><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a></b></i>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Bee_0f2c.html" title="User talk:King Bee">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_King_Bee_9e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/King Bee">C</a>)</sup> 01:05, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hi guys</span></h2>
<p>I've been asked to have a look at the disputes on this page. Having looked briefly through the history and reviewed some of the accounts that seem focussed only or mainly on this page (who I would hazard correspond to the entity requesting assistance) I do have some concerns, I will mention a couple. (You will have to forgive my ignorance on the subject matter.)</p>
<p>Firstly there doesn't seem to have been an in-depth discussion, on a point by point basis to try and resolve the differences. Secondly the dispute of the number of "passing attempts" (I would have thought passing successes would be more interesting, but no matter) the total of the column in question does indeed match up with the number the IP address was trying to insert.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 10:24 <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_February_a554.html" title="10 February">10 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the attempts did you actually add up the columns? From the look of it the dispute is between 2 sets of sources: NFL.com/Packers website vs the source the other editor was referring to. I'm not super familiar with this disute either and I too would like to see some actual discussion here of the changes. I reverted to the earlier version simply per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> or a rather disruptive sockpuppeteer not because I necessarily agree with the content.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:20, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes I did add up the column.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have no idea what you mean about there being no discussion, but let's enumerate the changes of this banned sockpuppeteer right now.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The correct number of attempts; this is discussed two sections above. I think the solution is rather simple, that we go with NFL.com (since they should have the official stats) over PFR.com. Completions ("successes") are also a stat, but attempts matter as well.</li>
<li>Rewording the "consecutive" streak for seasons of 30 TD passes or more; the current revision has cleaner prose than his revision.</li>
<li>He readded the quote of "Put Ty in," which was unsourced (as the source was a dead link, and I removed the quote as I couldn't find another reference).</li>
<li>He prefers the "hanging citation" to citing every line, which as was discussed above in the citations section, looks much better.</li>
<li>Lastly, this user is banned for an inability to work well with others. His changes should not be considered.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if that's what you were looking for or what, but we did assume good faith a few months ago when this user showed up. We ganged up a bit, yes, but <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">MrDarcy</a> stepped in and told us to cool it.

While the issue being discussed there is a much more contentious issue than whether Favre threw 8,223 or 8,224 attempts, it does bring up the possibility of somehow noting this discrepancy between established, reliable sources (assuming I don't get a timely response to my emails). Since I think it's been established that the NFL statistics are what we should include in the main article text, would it be possible to also add some sort of note indicating that other sites report a different number? <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="../../../p/s/u/User%7EPSUMark2006_e6e5.html" title="User:PSUMark2006"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #036;">PSUMark2006</span></a> <a href="../../../p/s/u/User_talk%7EPSUMark2006_44f0.html" title="User talk:PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PSUMark2006_b7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">contribs</span></a></span> 19:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to add my two-pence worth - unless Mark recieves any offcial replies to the various emails (well done for doing it Mark), I'd say <b>go with the NFL.com stats</b>. As an aside note I can't be sure without doing research into but I'm guessing the problem could be in his first ever passing play. IIRC his first pass attempt was batted down and Farve caught it he then attempted another forward pass, is this one pass attempt, two pass attempts (or Zero beacuse of the penalty (although IIRC it is a loss-of-down penalty so the attempt would count - but would the second one)?

<dd>I concur with Rehnn83. This is a statistic pertaining to an NFL player. The NFL absolutely should be the recognized authority. If it's a typo, a misprint, or a calculation error, so be it, we're not in any position to extrapolate why there is a difference (because doing so would constitute violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). If I don't get a reply to any of the four emails I've now sent out (seems unlikely to me), I would propose we list the NFL.com statistic with a <b>&lt;ref&gt;Sources including ESPN.com and profootballreference.com list 8,223 passing attempts.&lt;/ref&gt;</b> or something along those lines. Indicating a difference isn't original research, but trying to figure out why would be. <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="../../../p/s/u/User%7EPSUMark2006_e6e5.html" title="User:PSUMark2006"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #036;">PSUMark2006</span></a> <a href="../../../p/s/u/User_talk%7EPSUMark2006_44f0.html" title="User talk:PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PSUMark2006_b7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">contribs</span></a></span> 21:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

Subject: Favre's attempts

Regarding your recent query, Brett's official passing attempts for the year 1991 was five until a few years 
ago, when the official league statistician reviewed tape of one of his games as a rookie and determined 
that the RFK Stadium press box had mistakenly given him one too many passing attempts.
His official total is 8,223.

<p>Finally a response! I'm going to see if I can pass this information along to ESPN and PFR so they might consider making the appropriate changes. Does anyone have any objections to now removing the asterisked stats? And, if so, how should we reference this "official verification"? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="../../../p/s/u/User%7EPSUMark2006_e6e5.html" title="User:PSUMark2006"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #036;">PSUMark2006</span></a> <a href="../../../p/s/u/User_talk%7EPSUMark2006_44f0.html" title="User talk:PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PSUMark2006_b7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">contribs</span></a></span> 21:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No objection to removing the asterisk stat... and nice job on finding that out. I'd say just leave it at 8223 cited to NFL.com. There really is no way to reference that email without running afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, but I'd leave it here as something that could be pointed out if a certain individual shows up again... ah, the sweet irony.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:53, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One pattern I see widespread in this article is what amounts to POV commentary. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>He clawed his way up from the seventh string to the backup job...</i></li>
<li><i>Favre's college career was turned upside down on July 14, 1990...</i></li>
<li><i>Favre replaced Majkowski and did not play well during most of the game...</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Statements like this are not acceptable in a featured article class article. With regard to the second statement, his coach is later <i>quoted</i> as saying Favre was "larger than life", which is fine as long as it's referenced, but statements like the above can't stay in here when the point of reference is the encyclopedia itself. Facts have to speak for themselves; what's going on above is editorial commentary suggesting what a reader should feel. Any subjective statement like <i>One of the defining moments of Favre's career, and arguably his greatest game ever, took place on December 22, 2003...</i> should be backed up by references which make both assertions. They're out there; the point is, they need to be in here. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 16:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wanted to ask if maybe the line, "<i>He is of French and Choctaw ancestry; one of his paternal grandparents was a Native American affiliated with the Choctaw,</i>" could be moved into the early years section?
