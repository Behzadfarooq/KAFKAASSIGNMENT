<p>I would normally include all forms of breast fetishism under this category, namely including attraction to especially small breasts. <i>rumplefurskin</i> 20:03, Apr 25, 2005 (MST)</p>
<p>I don't think that the existence of alt.* newsgroups is valid evidence to establish that a fetish has a substantial following, for two reasons: (i) it is very easy to create and perpetuate an alt.* group, and (ii) those groups listed in the articles have relatively low activity for an alt.* newsgroup. <i>rumplefurskin</i> 20:05, Apr 25, 2005 (MST)</p>

Those Breasts on the right really arent that huge, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Charms_fe03.html" title="Chelsea Charms">Chelsea Charms</a>' boobs should be there if you want to talk about fetishism 63.164.201.23 09:17, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, for two reasons. Firstly, the girl on the right's boobs are very large and prominent in proportion to her overall frame, an effect obviously impossible without surgery. Secondly, and more importantly, this is not a page about fetishism for gigantic boobs, but breast fetishism in general. Many men and women who are breast fetishists prefer smaller (sometimes very small) breasts. Perhaps the most common preference is for breasts in realistic proportion. This is not to say that a picture of a woman with gigantic breasts would not be appropriate for this page, but it would be misleading to have pictures of only very large breasts. (I think at the moment this page IS misleading in this way, but I am not sure how to add more photos.) Rachbubs 10:52, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"There are also fetishes concerned with lactation in general, and with nursing (" <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_Lactation_b347.html" title="Erotic Lactation">milk fetishism</a>"). The former is quite common in many hentai games/anime/manga, where busty girls will be able to lactate, despite not being pregnant"</p>
<p>That last comment seems to indicate that women are only able to lactate while pregnant, and further, it could be contrived that it's using this "fact" to point out a fallacy in breast fetishism, which is biased (if mildly). But factually speaking, women can indeed lactate when not pregnant (and so can men, if you really wanted to know that). I'd edit this myself, but I'm not sure how to reword it without outright deleting the sentiment altogether. Check the entry on <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breastfeeding.html" title="Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> for information on lactation whilst not pregnant.</p>

<p>"Many adult film and pornography stars have capitalized on this cultural phenomenon by having their breasts enlarged to implausible sizes."</p>
<p>Unless we're talking about Zena Fulsom here, the sizes aren't implausible - the breasts really are that size.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But not usually on women that thin: what we have in (large) breast fetishism, in the context of Western culture as a whole, is the collision of the <i>matronly</i> paradigm of female beauty (large breasts being indicative of motherhood, increased weight, and the fuller figure) with the modern cult of perpetual nubility (looking teenaged). It's still putatively based in the <i>selection-for-mating</i> theory of attraction, but unites two exemplars from opposite ends of the body-mass index.</dd>

<p>Enlarged to sizes far beyond what is natually plausible, sure, but the article acknowleges that Pamela Anderson embodied a trend to not pretend to be natural. Lolo Ferrari had breasts enlarged to the point of looking like a cartoon character, but that was exactly the point. How about "sizes beyond natural limits", though I'm not entirely happy, as it's a rather ugly phrasing (which is why it's not just an edit). --<a href="../../../p/o/8/User%7EPo8crg_7994.html" title="User:Po8crg">Po8crg</a> 00:07, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS "Adult film" is a redirect to "pornographic movie" now; we shouldn't be linking to "adult film". I'm not sure how best to edit this sentence, though, as "pornographic movie and pornography" is horrible. Can we just say "porn stars" and be done with it?</p>

<p>The article states both that breast fetishism is something primordial and that it is a fetishism (meaning, acquired). I mean, if it is a natural instinct thing, wouldn't that make it basically wrong to state it is a cultural phenomenon?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if it is a purely acquired thing (i.e. a fetish) wouldn't that make the instinctual arguments superfluous? What is it then, instinct or culture? I request clarification on that part Dabljuh 03:38, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Cleavage fetishism is certainly alive and well. However, discrimination on breast size is alive and well. In Australia, women can now sue on the basis of harrassment if someone hassles them by using unfavourable comments about the size of their chest. [www.dailycleavage.com]</p>
<p><br />
There is a theory that during the early development of the human species men sought lactating women for supplemental nourishment during seasonal or winter famine; and that women maintained their milk supply throughout most of their adult lives. Women store fat easier than men, women have slower metabolisms than men, and women can initiate lactation independent of pregnancy or childbirth. This theory embraces the metabolic differences between men and women and gives a lone male hunter a practical survival reason for keeping and protecting a woman in the wilderness. It ties the details of lactation, bonding, fertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and infant mortality into the overall survival equation. It promotes the notion that Adult Breastfeeding is a survival tool unique to our species, and is more about survival instincts and male-female bonding than it is about sexual gratification or fetish. It also explains why human females have enlarged breasts, why men are attracted to female breasts, why lactation promotes infertility, why women often have too much milk after childbirth, and why the emotions generated within Adult Nursing Relationships are so powerful.

<p>I don't see how this is a fetish either, it seems so widespread. If being attracted to a woman's breasts is a fetish, you almost wonder if being attracted to a woman at all is a fetish. 6:42 Monday, April 17 2006</p>

<dd>You presuppose that for something to be a fetish, only a few weirdos and their gerbil must be into it. So many millions of us idolise breasts that it disappears from the fetish atlas; but back in the 1920s and earlier, popular culture actually concentrated on women's <i>legs</i>, the era of slinky silk stockings and killer heels; and only a generation earlier, hemlines were so long that <i>a glimpse of stocking</i> really was an erotically charged event. Imagine a place like Afghanistan, where the <i>burqa</i> is commonly worn: they have so little girlflesh on show that their sensitivity to women's sexuality must be on a hair-trigger - and foot-fetishism must be the national obsession, so normal that no-one even thinks twice about it.</dd>

<dd>The arse. That is, ass, butt, buttocks, rear, tush, tuchas, hiney, derriere, fesses, culo. Specifically <i>women'</i>s buttocks, for although gay and bi men also appreciate them, the most typical taste in <i>masculine</i> rears is the bubble butt, whereas the presence of adipose tissue (or otherwise) makes for a rather more varied distribution table as to taste in feminine booties. In Brazil, the national enthusiasm for <i>as bundas</i> ["ash boondash"] - the truly magnificent Brazilian arse, for which <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copacabana_Beach_6f55.html" title="Copacabana Beach">Copacabana</a> is justly famous - is completely and utterly normalised, and even invites comment from that country's most distinguished intellectuals.</dd>

<p>I have done some significant reworking of the article including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I order some content and created separate section. I am not sure the section titles are the best we can come up with.</li>
<li>I modified some content for accuracy or NPOV. I improved the mention the mention that not all men prefer large breasts and moved it to a more better location.</li>
<li>The sentence that described the puffy nipple fetish as somewhat controversial was inaccurate when it seemed to imply that adult puffy nipples where rare. I change to reflect that while not common they is still a significant number of adult puffy nipples out there. I left the claim of it being somewhat controversial though I think this should be sourced as I have not heard much discussion if any regarding controversy over puffy nipple fetishist though I can imagine it could exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some areas for further improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some claims in the article could use citations such as linking to surveys showing large breasts as indeed preferred by many men in western countries.</li>
<li>Info should be added regarding preferences for medium sized breasts and those who have no size preferences (though they may preferring natural breasts over fake.) Added some survey and study results on breasts size preferences would be nice.</li>
<li>I think a mention of cleavage fetishism should be added.</li>
<li>Add a picture representing a common object of breast fetishism such as publicity photo of Pamela Anderson, for example.</li>

<p>This page would be better served if it alluded to "Breast fetishism" in the colloquial sense, instead of dressing itself up to be a precursor of a new and robust clinical definition of an unusual psychological phenomena; A definition which appears to be forming on the premise that if an insular minority believes 'something' to be a correct and legitimate pursuit within their life then it must follow that that thing may be defined as a fetish, regardless of a broader majority accepting such a thing as entirely normal within its culture.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest amending the title to "The relationship between male sexual desire and female breasts".</p>
