<p>Thanks for the heads-up. The relevant section in the consolidated <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automotive_lighting.html" title="Automotive lighting">Automotive lighting</a> article was woefully deficient, wasn't it! I have transferred the relevant info from your stub, together with regulatory information, into a newly-expanded section in the main article, and redirected <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taillight.html" title="Taillight">Taillight</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taillamp.html" title="Taillamp">Taillamp</a> thereto.

<dd>Yeah, I was kind of thinking the same thing. (I mean the why doesn't he go to German cars and remove the POV himself, I myself have responded to all sorts of comments on other people's talk pages&#160;;-)) What I can't figure out is why Sam is addressing me in the third person-I guess I'm royalty-oh, well... <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 23:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again, could you revert Sam's last revert? I would be running into 3RR, Sam actually already did, but I don't know whether he was aware of that, so I placed a warning message on his talk page. You are still safe, so you can revert it. If he continues to do the revert thing, we are now clear to submit a 3RR complaint, as he is now aware of the rule.

<p>Hi! I just wanted to say that perhaps I was overly sensitive concerning the Luxury Cars Task Force. Indeed, if the task force would consist of people intending to cut down on POV, it could do very much valuable work cleaning up and developing articles and setting standards pertaining to this type of cars. The hidden agenda behind those Task Forces is to finally get people to review all the articles we have and concentrate efforts - sometimes, there is something really large to do, like a bunch of articles interconnected, and if everybody's just doing thier stuff, this can never be finished. So, I proposed a scheme that I hoped would catch all articles we have, or at least the majority (funny how nobody complained yet that Saab and Volvo were left out). A Luxury Cars Task Force has one flaw - the borders of this project would be pretty fluid, and also if the divide went that way, it might be hard to find people for, e.g. Small Family Car Task Force...</p>
<p>I am getting tired and rumble without sense - what I mean is go on and propose the TF if you have a good idea for outlining the scope. What we need now is to get ANY Task Force up and running to show how it may work, we'll worry later about overlapping scopes and blank areas.</p>
<p>Now something more important - the Design and Marketing Task Force. This goes quite against my original idea, as you can't actually assign a specific group of articles to it, or rather all articles would fall under it! Moreover, the issues you mentioned are actually one of the basics when editing any article, if I understand you correctly, so more or less we are all in this TF anyway (esp. given that it encompasses ALL our articles). Perhaps you just wanted to propose some more specific standards and conventions, so why not do that outright without a "Task Force"? We need to work on standards and conventions anyway, I am just too tired to do a good write-up on that at the moment?</p>
<p>Bottom line - please rethink this Task Force.</p>
<p>Regards, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 19:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, now I see the lexical problem... I used the name Task Forces aping the other WikiProject, but actually those are "Interest Groups" and tasks are something quite different - ALL TFs should have adding info on design/marketing and removing POV as their tasks. I think we need to work general guidelines for auto articles (perhaps bei Gelegenheit of developing the Assessment Scheme) that would include all that info. Would you be willing to try to start compiling them? Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 20:11, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, well du'h. Yes, those should be taks of any TF-sorry about that, I get it now. I think working "bei Gelegenheit" is perhaps the best way-let's see how thinks come along. Start compelling-well I'm still trying to compell people to review some of my articles and put their disucssions in the right place on the US project- a lot of things at one time-so I'll see what I can do. <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 20:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yo G. I noticed you have a User template for Lincoln Town Car. I'm guessing you probably made it yourself. Well, I happen to be a very enthusiatic Lincoln LS V8 owner, loaded and in "Vivid Red" (sometimes I get to drive a loaner Town Car while my LS is getting serviced). Anyway just wondering if maybe you thought about making similar User templates for the rest of us Lincoln owners, or perhaps you already did? We gotta take a stand for our red-blooded American Luxury cars. Yes I know you are German, but we can overlook that ... --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 23:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why thank you - I'll polish it up and get to work on that. I will have to make it a really good one though, after all the grief I have been giving to other users, who went around systematically replacing the well composed "fair use" professional photographs provided by automakers, with really crappy, sub-amateurish, poorly lit, badly composed, fuzzy, and horribly exposed pics of some car they saw in a supermarket parking lot with distracting backgrounds, and shadows (or even reflections) of themselves and other nearby objects falling on the car. I'll let you know when I have something, and if it is high enough quality, you can decide if it is worthy of further use on the Wikipedia. I kind of wish we could adopt a policy where other amateur photographers would post a number of their automobile photographs in a sandbox area, and allow the rest of us to critique them and decide which ones are worthy of posting in articles. Some folks just "bull doze" their photos in, without discussion, and they are just horrible examples from any sort of critical photographic quality perspective - but they serve as terrific examples of how to make a really bad photographs, from Photography 101 class. There I go, rambling again. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 13:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True a sandbox would be a good idea. But consider we still don't really have a "good" photo af an LS-the best one is again in a parking lot and the other is from the side. I think what a lot of users forget is that the background is just about as important as the car.

<p>Hello there. We've cut quite a bit of material from the Great power page this weekend. We've also managed to source quite a bit of the history of the term. There's still a lot of work to do, but I think that the page is finally on the way up. (I've found <a href="http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472112872-ch2.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472112872-ch2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472112872-ch2.pdf</a> especially useful - some proper academic work on the subject, for once!).</p>
<p>I'm just giving you a quick heads-up to watch out for attempts to introduce countries/propositions into the article, citing spurious or unreliable sources as justification. At the moment we have claims that Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, and the Ottaman empire should be included (claims which may have valididy, or not) - but the sourcing provided as justification is pretty poor. In such circumstances we ought to have no hesitation in taking the country off the page until it is supported by a proper source, no matter what our view of its power/status. If we are to continue the good work on the article, reliable sourcing ought to be our top priority.</p>
<p>I've been trying to police this over the past day or two, but the more of us that get involved, the better. It makes it much harder for the issue to get clouded in accusations and personal attacks against individuals if we are all acting in unison.</p>

<p>Good work on the Super Power article. Sorry that I sounded POV in my wording, I'm only human and sometimes get soo tired about this US/EU super power controversy. I'll watch my wording more carefully. And personally,I believe if you take away all the political mumbo-jumbo, and just leave the economics, military power, population, land area, and control of resources...there is really no reason to say the EU isn't currently a super power. All thats really needed is a Foreign Policy that everyone agrees on (which will hopefully come soon)! Regards! smooth_operator september 7</p>

<dd>No problem, we all have some of our POV show inadvertanly at some point or another. Thank you for telling me that you didn't mean to sound POV, I am personally a bit weary after so much deabte of people trying to push their POV, but its good to know that you're not one of them and that you edit in good faith. As for the EU's status I think we see I to eye on that. Happy editing!

<p>I blocked him for a week. He really crossed the line. And I want to commend you for staying cool. What I think users like Éponyme don't realize is that accusing someone of OR or pushing POV is ok. Bullying people by calling them ignorant and the like is not ok. I think you've done a pretty good job of not crossing that line and making it personal. Éponyme needs to learn the same lesson. Thank you for bring him to our attention. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 01:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:20 2007-LS-460.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a <a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Help:Image page">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

<p>Gerd, it's very nice of you to say so, and I do appreciate that, even if I cannot agree with most of what you said&#160;:D To make it clear - it is not a <i>"set-back with one particular out of hand WP policy"</i>, it is mounting stress and dissatisfaction stemming from the progressive realization that WP is not what I perhaps expected or hoped it to be. My activities here as an editor have caused me nothing but stress and negative feelings for the past weeks, and it is constantly getting worse. I don't want to suffer any more disappointments and "setbacks", and I don't think pushing against fundamental WP policies is of any use. I do hope, however, that your experience with Wikipedia will continue to be fundamentally different.

<p>Looking at the history, I guess it must've been me who deleted these parameters – if so, it was entirely unintentional and I apologiz/se for my error (probably due to careless copy/pasting).

<p>Hello Brendel,</p>
<p>This is in reply to the small section in the upper middle class article. I did make an error, the small section that I added should have been in the section for "American Middle Class". You stated "Are you talking about the upper middle class, which includes many members of the inteligista, professors, economists, scientists, etc...? The upper middle class whose members commonly hold at least a Masters degree are usually not described as "the new peasantry" but rather as a "new petite bourgeoisie." While I am curious as to what you meant with that statement I also need to inform you that it might compromise the WP:NPOV policy (You need to provide sources for your statements-especially if they're of such subjective nature). Regards, SignaturebrendelNow under review! 06:32, 15 November 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Below I have listed some references from books to newspaper articles, very creditable web sites from Universities, etc. The small section I added is not my personal views, the WP:NPOV policy would cover bias views. However your articles are very good, though I cannot understand why you painted a picture of the American middle class as if it above all approach. Based upon news paper articles and studies and a vast amount of people in middle class America are not well rounded people, cultured, or exposed to a higher level. I have listed several references for you, however I don't think it is fair to be so one sided when talking about the middle class. Income level or that fact that they have a Masters, does this mean middle class? Possible, however in no way can they be the new bourgeoisie class, nor could they even be considered the former merchant middle class of the Renaissance. However even if we do not take the three estates into consideration. One can come to this conclusion that being in the middle class does not make one the new aristocracy, nor does it make them of a higher standard, or cast. There are those who are of noble blood and those who are not. There are those who are numismatists, antiquarians, or philatelists, and then there are those who are not. However it is up to you, it is your opinion. Though it would not be fair or correct to the American Middle Class as vastly learned, or well rounded.</p>
<p>Thank you, I hope I posted this in the correct place.</p>

<p>Read the article and you will discover that there are many definitions for "white people" used in different parts of the world. None of them take precedence over the others as Wikipedia has a global scope. There is NO WAY you can argue that the information you claim describes white people describes the Bai. The information in the template is flat out wrong and/or ethnocentric and, in any event, is unsourced.

<p>Hello brendel:</p>
<p>Not familiar on how to work the comments feature but wanted to respond to your note.</p>
<p>Your crime statistics appear incorrect or out of date to me (the data does not agree either with FBI UCR stats that I downloaded yesterday nor does it agree with other parts of wikipedia. Your conclusions on cities with highest crime rates thus appear to be incorrect.</p>
<p>see <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_3506.html" title="United States cities by crime rate">United States cities by crime rate</a> for corrected data that someone else enetered. Note all totals rates and populations are different than yours.</p>
<p>Take Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for example. Note that the original FBI source does not agree with your data but does agree with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_3506.html" title="United States cities by crime rate">United States cities by crime rate</a>. <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_pa.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_pa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_pa.html</a></p>
<p>I have attempted to update your data and so far have finished 4 of the ten cities (Dallas, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Houston).</p>
<p>I am happy to finish by correcting the other 6 cities if you like. I note that we could consider including the Las Vegas metro area in the top ten and excluding #11 San Jose as is done in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_3506.html" title="United States cities by crime rate">United States cities by crime rate</a>. However san jose is in fact the 10th largest city although only the 11th largest in the table in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_3506.html" title="United States cities by crime rate">United States cities by crime rate</a> if you count las vegas. I'd be happy either way.</p>
<p>We need to ensure wikipedia data matches its sources. New York does have the lowest property crime + violent crime rate 2,675 per 100,000 (162,509 + 54,623) / 8,115,690. Philadelphia has the highest violent crime rate 1,467 per 100,000 (21,609 violent crimes divided by 1,472,915)</p>

<p>Yeah, I saw that somebody had the manners to slap deletion tags all over it. It just baffles me why there is a list of every type of flop on Wikipedia, yet this one keeps geting deleted. I even went through it and removed all of teh POV Wiarthurhu injected into it adn even rewrote entire sections to make it more neutral. I am not even going to defend it, it is worthless. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 21:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How do you tag an article with importance? I'm not sure. Do you just add the template to the page (like by adding {{Top-Class}} to the top of the page) or is it part of the wikiproject template (like with the quality scale)? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086">James086</a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James086_7264.html" title="Special:Contributions/James086"><font color="green">Contribs</font></a></sup> 05:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>HAHAHAHA!... sorry but with all of the disputes, it'll probly be given a 0 or so.</p>
<p>Anyways, merging culture into adolescent sexuality?</p>
<p>BAD IDEA! Check out <a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdolescent_sexuality_12f7.html" title="Talk:Adolescent sexuality">talk:adolescent sexuality</a> all that article needs right now is just a gablillion dollops of unrelated material.</p>
<p>It's a GLOBAL articxle on the topic of adolescent sexuality. Mainly mean't to address WHAT Adolescent sexuality is, STd's a bit, possible orientations including fetish's and the like, along with some info on variations from country to country.</p>
<p>It's FILLED with POV, for a world article. United states culture elements would only (In my opinion) mess it up more.</p>
<p>Branch off the culture part if you'd like. But please!, take a look at my suggestion of branching off all POV'S on the subject into another article.</p>
<p>Boldness is good and all, but when it screws up an article so bad as to have tons of templates, full protection, and a lengthy debate. POV's should be considered for seperation into another article.</p>
<p>The main article is for info on WHAT it is. Not peoples opinions, adolescent sexuality in itself isn't exactly a 'debate' over if it's good or not. It's WHAT IT IS&#160;!-)</p>
<p>See? Just take a peek at the discussion, review it, and perhsaps make a post or two. boldness isn't so good if it dramatically slows down an articles progress.

<dd>I didn't say it's a GA. I merely said the article boasts a good discussion of adolescent sexuality <b>in the US</b>. Therefore include part of this article in the Culture of the United States article presents itself as a good idea. <b><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 05:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been slowly working on this page over time, and it's reached the point where I think it meets the criteria of a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a>, although with two copyrighted fair use images and only 13k of content, it's well short of being <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">FA</a>. The biggest trouble with expanding the article is that the car was only released 12 months ago, so I'm still waiting on a lot of info to become available (e.g. production/sales figures).</p>
<p>I didn't want to throw it open to the whole motley AutoProject community, some of whom may be compelled to "improve" the article by replacing metric with imperial measurements, adding badly laid out galleries of the rear of the car, reams of technical information in tabular or bulleted format, and expounding at length on the North American market perspective. Instead, I thought I'd just test the water by canvassing the opinions of some random auto editors who don't seem obsessed with making WP a Buyers' Guide.</p>
<p>Anyway, you think it's worth taking <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_i.html" title="Mitsubishi i">Mitsubishi i</a> through the <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">WP:GA</a> nomination process?</p>

<p>I've noticed you've done the dropout effect a number of images now. I'd just like to add some constructive criticism, in that some are being cropped in too close (no distracting background to worry about, so not an issue) and that probably a white background would be more mature for an encyclopedia.
