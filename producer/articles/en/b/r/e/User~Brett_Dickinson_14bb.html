<p>Brett was preaty much the greatest person to ever live. Brett born 12/27/89 was named the greatest person ever to live by the president himself. At age 1 Brett was already talking and stacking up a great amount of mackage points with the other 1 year old ladies around him, at age 5 Brett was already running his elementary school with "iron fists" bullying others for lunch money it wasn't enough Brett needed more to satisfy him. At age 10 Brett was already the ruler of the world. By the time Brett made it to middleschool he was already familiar with many people including Tyler,Nick,Gabby,Hannah,and more. Brett was already stacking up as much mackage points with these new women as soon as he stepped foot in his new school. Gabby played a huge role in his mackage in middle school he macked her until she could be macked nomore. Around 7th Grade him and Nick joined forces in mackage which made an unbeatable team. It was around that time that they formed the group formally known as Chubby Cox. Chubby Cox [Chub-bie cocks] was macking all girls high and low until they hit Highschool. It was around this time that Chubby Cox layed low and settled down a bit but their reign didnt stop there. They met Amy and Melanie the summer of going into Highschool it was around that time that Chubby Cox would use them to make their mackage go world wide but it wasnt gonna be easy, they were going to need alot of help to spread this mackage. Chubby cox then met a girl named Angela, Nick and Angela never got along and always tried to fight eachother in the hallways but Nick was obsessed on macking Angela, for if she was macked 100% all of her friends would get macked by word of mouth making Chubby Cox's success even better. At age 16 Brett fought off 800 Dragons just to prove he could do it winning Melanies heart in the process from saving her from the evil Dr. Dudleys clutches. Dr. Dudley swore revenge on Brett but was not able to get his revenge for Dr. Dudley suffered from a heart attack a year later. Melanie was deeply in love with Brett now, he figured his mackage was at it's peak and at it's peak it was. But the Chubby Cox didn't last.</p>

<p>The Chubby Cox team was more than just Brett and Nick. By the year 2007 female members Gabby, Melanie, and Amy joined the CC Team, resulting in only heavy bashing by eachother to other members of the team, they usually got along. Even though the founders Brett and Nick were the only serious ones in the group about mackage points, the others still made a formidable addition to the team.</p>
<p>Brett - One of the two Founders of Chubby Cox, considered to be one of the greatest mackers ever but hesitates on claiming the prize when his mackage points reach 100%.</p>
<p>Nick - The other Founder of Chubby Cox, usually sleeping but when awoke is named smartest macker of all time, using his great ideas to get mackage points has made Chubby Cox a household name.</p>
<p>Gabby - The 3rd addition to the team childhood friend Gabby, the weirdest one of the team, and the first female CC member, usually seen hanging out with the 2 masterminds behind the whole CC movement, ususally likes to diss and bash Nick for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Amy - The 4th addition to the team, even though she never keeps in touch with the some of the team members she is still a CC member, 2nd female CC member.</p>
<p>Melanie - The latest 5th member of the CC and 3rd female member, she is another one who likes to diss Nick for no reason, she also is known to be a little "fond" of Brett, enjoys to annoy Nick along with Gabby.</p>
<p>These are the members of Chubby Cox, without the first 2 the fame of the Chubby Cox team would never exist.</p>

<p>The Golden Year was known to be the best point in time of Chubby Cox's mackage, their mackage was off the charts on this year. Almost every if not every girl was macked. Their mackage was spreading like disease it was hard not to get macked in this period of time if you were a woman. They started making late night chatrooms and invited girls they knew which invited other girls they knew and so on and so on and more girls would end up macked. Even occasional "foreplay" was offered to Chubby Cox at this point in time, they were macking to the fullest this year and it payed off. But a year passed and noone remembered the reign of the Chubby Cox's golden year another event that led to the Fall of Chubby Cox.</p>

<p>2006 was the year everyone and their mom got a myspace. It was at this time that Chubby Cox would make seperate myspaces for mackage, right when the myspaces were made endless comments and pic comments were given by several women including Jennifer, Angela, and many more. Comments such as WE LOVE YOU were made, Chubby Cox took this into consideration that this was the perfect plan for mackage. They then found every girl they knew and added them as a friend, more comments arised. In year 2007 things started to slow down for the myspace plan, late female Chubby Cox member Gabby was posting vulgar things such as YOU SUCK on Nick's myspace which made him furious. Angela also did the same, Angela's action resulted in heavy assbeating the next day, The Chubby Cox members still have Myspaces til this day but the plan has died long ago leading more to the Fall of Chubby Cox.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Brett wasn't aware that Dr. Dudley made a woman robot for Brett to mack before his untimely death. Brett not knowing of the evil plan macked the woman robot to 100% and decided it was time to cash in his mackage points. Brett died on 3/18/2007 in the middle of an orgasm. It seems that Dr. Dudley got his revenge. As for the other half of Chubby Cox, They say Nick is still macking not as much but even without one of it's founders Chubby Cox still macks hard under Brett's Rule.</p>
