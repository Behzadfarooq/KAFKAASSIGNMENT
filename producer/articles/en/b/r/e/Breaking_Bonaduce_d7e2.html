<td>1</td>
<td><b>Danny Had An Affair</b></td>
<td>The Bonaduces have turned to couples therapy to begin repairing the damage caused by an infidelity. The discussions are not one-sided however, as it appears Gretchen's lack of a sex drive 'pushed' Danny into the arms of another woman. And now, at this very fragile point in their relationship, Danny Bonaduce, the ex-child star, is booked to perform stand-up at The Palms Casino in Las Vegas. This raises dangerous stakes, as the question becomes, can a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, who has just cheated on his wife, be trusted to behave 'unsupervised' in Sin City? Danny's answer is to live as dangerously as possible to determine if he's capable of flirting with disaster without consummation. And, in this instance, Danny proves to be worthy of the challenge, pulling himself out of a world of flowing booze and receptive women to drive home to his wife in the middle of the night.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><b>Dangerous Behavior</b></td>
<td>Things appear to be on the mend in Bonaduce household as the family is functioning normally once again. But beneath the surface, trouble is brewing. Danny has entered a world of physical fitness and body-sculpting as a 'positive' substitute for his propensity toward 'destructive' behavior; he has even become a licensed personal trainer. However, the 'new' Danny is falling into some old habits. By taking on only young, pretty women as clients, and experimenting with anabolic steroids, Danny is once again showing an inability to get out of his own way.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><b>Anger Management</b></td>
<td>It didn't take Dr. Garry long to realize that Danny has a problem with anger. In fact, it's clear that he runs, works out and even takes karate in an effort to channel some of his excess angst. But during a therapy session, when Gretchen reveals a secret about an innocent, funny photo she's taken with a male member of her band, Danny's anger boils over and he storms out of the session. In the coming days, Danny struggles to maintain a normal routine, all the while knowing he will confront this guy at Gretchen's next gig. Dr. Garry of course warns him that any aggressive move will only serve to push Gretchen further away. However, on the night of bands next performance, in front of a packed house, Danny decides to pull the guy off the stage in the middle of a set, and verbally assault him for having even the appearance of impropriety. Ultimately, his inability to exercise some semblance of self-control leaves even Danny wondering if their marriage is headed for serious trouble.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><b>No Time For Love</b></td>
<td>Danny's past behavior has forced Gretchen to build a wall around her that prevents them from achieving any real intimacy. She keeps herself very busy with the kids, the house, errands and, more recently, planning her own 40th Birthday party. Danny struggles to cope with Gretchen's cold and distant demeanor until his fear and pain send him off the wagon and into a fit of binge drinking and destructive behavior. So on the night of Gretchen's `all-girl-slumber-party' 40th Birthday, Danny decides to go out with friends and drink until he blacks out. While on his way to doing just that, he finds out that male strippers are on the guest list for Gretchen's party. Angrily, Danny demands a halt to production of the show until he can get his wife on the phone to discuss the strippers. As Danny is stewing, the show dips to black ... to be continued.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><b>Out Of Control</b></td>
<td>When we left Danny on the streets of Hollywood, he was ringing Gretchen's cell phone off the hook trying to warn her against having male strippers at her 40th Birthday. When he finally gets her on the phone, she refuses to allow him to dictate what she can and can't do at her own party. In a huff, Gretchen practically hangs up on him. Moments later Danny has a violent outburst of volcanic proportions. In a rage, he begins menacing the crew of the production, threatening to go to the party and assault people if the strippers are allowed to perform. After several hours of erratic and violent behavior, Danny eventually breaks down in tears, confessing that he's completely lost control of his mind and his life. Later that evening, in a cry for help, Danny slashes his wrists. The next day, in a final act of madness, Danny accuses Dr. Garry of conspiring with Gretchen against him.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><b>Leaving Los Angeles</b></td>
<td>As Danny spends another night of drinking himself to sleep, Gretchen sneaks off to therapy looking for answers. She reveals to Dr. Garry that the drinking, steroids and painkillers have taken control of Danny and her house has turned upside down. Dr. Garry confronts Danny off camera and demands that he check into rehab. Danny reluctantly agrees. However, before entering, he decides to tattoo his first day of sobriety onto his arm as a gesture of his commitment to get well. Though difficult and frightening, Danny explains to his children that he must go away to get well, but loves them and will return. As Gretchen drives away from the rehab center, leaving Danny standing alone in front of the De-tox center, they both have an expression of impending doom.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td><b>Tough Love</b></td>
<td>In the first weeks in treatment, the rehab team is attempting to get Danny to come to a healthier place. Not just physically, but mentally as well: Breathing exercises, yoga, spiritual-counseling - anything to get him to slow his mind down. But expectedly, Danny is resisting the program. Fits and tantrums stunt his early progress. Eventually however, Danny begins to warm up to some of their more `new age' methods and he at least attempts to play nice. But when the facility decides it's time to bring Gretchen in for a couples exercise, the sparks begin to fly as Danny becomes enraged with Gretchen's lack of trust for him and he threatens to leave rehab.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><b>Daddy's Girl</b></td>
<td>When we last saw Danny, he was storming away from a couples exercise and threatening to leave rehab. As far as Danny's concerned, he doesn't want to be at rehab, and if Gretchen isn't going to trust him regardless of what he does - why stay? Gretchen begs him to stay for the sake of their marriage. Her reinforcement of their commitment sparks a change in Danny. In the coming weeks, he begins to show real signs of progress. Eventually, the rehab staff feels he's ready to see his children. Not a moment too soon for Isabella, who's been acting up and acting out because of how much she misses her daddy. When the two see each other for the first time in weeks, Danny vows that he will never leave her for thirty days again. And for Gretchen, he makes a solemn vow to become a better husband and father.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td><b>Home Alone</b></td>
<td>After 30 days of drug and alcohol rehabilitation, Danny seems like a new man. He's sober, reflective and feeling equipped to return home. But, for the first time in months, Danny is in a position to examine his marriage with a clear eye. He concludes that at its core, their relationship is a union between two very different people with conflicting romantic and sexual appetites. Coupled with his already fragile state of mind, this revelation leads Danny to portend troubled waters ahead.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><b>Party Of One</b></td>
<td>Danny and Gretchen are both struggling to understand the others language of love. Danny wants overt, passionate gestures while Gretchen feels silly when romance gets sappy. At one point, Gretchen cavalierly chides him that maybe he should `be with someone else.' This seemingly minor infraction leads to an exaggerated reaction and Danny decides to move out.</td>

<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td><b>Dannys From Venus</b></td>
<td>
<p>On the verge of moving out of his home and possibly leaving his wife, Danny realizes that he has a great life worth keeping, but the small thing that's missing is just so important. Dr. Garry tries to get through to him one last time that Gretchen is not the woman Danny wants her to be. Still unconvinced, Danny has high hopes for his Father's Day present. But true to form, Gretchen botches the romantic element again. After a bout of anger, Danny finally realizes that Gretchen can't speak his language, and he can't ask her to. Will they now live happily ever after?</p>

<p>At the onset of season two, we see the impact that 'Breaking Bonaduce' has had on Danny and Gretchen's lives. In fact, the show is successful enough to get international distribution. So in order to keep the momentum moving forward, Danny agrees to help promote the show in Mexico City. On his trip, he visits a dubbing house where 'Breaking Bonaduce is being translated into Spanish. But because Danny has never seen the show before, after viewing an episode from last season in which Gretchen has strippers at her birthday party, Danny goes into a tailspin.</p>

<p>Perhaps best known for his role on the classic 70's series <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Partridge_Family_c79e.html" title="The Partridge Family">The Partridge Family</a>, Danny Bonaduce's show business career began at the age of four when he appeared in his first commercial.
