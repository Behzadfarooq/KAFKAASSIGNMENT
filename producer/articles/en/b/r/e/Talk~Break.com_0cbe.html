<p>This article seems to be written by someone with an axe to grind. It's not balanced and includes a large # of uncited sources (listed below). Can someone please get rid of these&gt;</p>
<p>- Visitors are supposedly able to rank site material on a scale of 1 to 5, which is factored into an average score. + Supposedly? Why supposedly?</p>
<p>- This being because clips have made the mainpage with very few visits and low ranking. + Citation?</p>
<p>-Apart from the sponsored adult content, Break.com is a target of spamming from camsites and others. It can take several hours for staff to remove this content, allowing children who access the site to see it. + Citation? Does it take several hours to remove?</p>

<p>Not much of a wikipediast, but clearly someone is writing thinly veiled smears, with every description being derogatory in some fashion or another. Please someone stop this person who is preventing a balanced, factual entry.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><br />
- Break.com (formerly Big-boys.com) is a highly publicised kids humor It's obviously a men's site targeting men 18-35, and says so on the site. Highly publicisized? Whatever, but goes to show the spirit of this editor's 'work'</p>
<p><br />
- 'This being because clips have made the mainpage with very few visits and low ranking.'</p>
<p>Citation? Another vague accusation that shows intent of editor</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>NOTE: Citations did accompany this entry but were mysteriously removed.</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>- 'with approximately 60 percent of video content being reposts from other video websites. (Kids hoping to cash in if their repost makes mainpage).'</p>
<p>Outrageous claim with no citation</p>

<p>Once again, a back-handed attempt (probably by a competitor) to try and paint Break.com in a less than even-handed way.</p>

<dd><small>Why are you trying to discredit the editors work when there is so much evidence supporting his additions?</small></dd>
</dl>
<pre>
                     ----------------
</pre>
<p>- The "Spirit of the Editors work" seems to revolve around the TRUTH. Links to break.com have been provided in relation to what is stated. The proof is in the pudding. Nothing derogatory in depicting the truth. Seems to me that you are on Breaks payroll.</p>
<p>"spurious uncited sources"?? Are you refering to the amounts paid for submissions that make homepage? You are right! These should be removed! As for the rest I suggest you click onto the references/links provided!</p>
<p>You state "Visitors are supposedly able to rank site material on a scale of 1 to 5, which is factored into an average score. + Supposedly? Why supposedly?" Answer... As soon as material hits the page it has a rating of 3 even though there have been no recorded hits. A blind man can see this. How can something be rated if it has not even been viewed?</p>
<p>There are enough references relating to what the Editor has put on the page. Esspecialy in relation to the pornography, the time taken by the staff to remove such content and the material "scavanged" from other websites. How much proof do you want?</p>
<p>You question whether it takes several hours to remove pornographic content. I see the reference in the "Pornography and adult content" section after "It can take staff several hours to remove content". Clicking onto this reference reveals pornographic content that has been there for 2 months! Whilst looking around I have actually found 47 more references.</p>
<p>Another baseless comment for the sites defense: "It's obviously a men's site targeting men 18-35, and says so on the site". WHERE DID YOU READ THIS?</p>
<p>Well go <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7682524@N05/450013191/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7682524@N05/450013191/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://info.break.com/static/v2/pages/privacy.html" class="external text" title="http://info.break.com/static/v2/pages/privacy.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> and have a good read! When creating an account yesterday I tried to sign in as a 12 year old only to be hit with a pop up stating that I must be at least 13 years of age to create an account! NICE TRY!</p>
<p>You question the "Highly publicisized". You only need to go to Break.com scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit "ABOUT US". Enough said?</p>
<p>More references and proof behind the Editors work than you can poke a stick at.</p>
<p>You obviously do not like Wikipedias ACCURACY in regards to Break.com, but thats the way it is. If the hat fits WEAR IT.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia based on fact, not a medium for publicising or glorifying your website! This whole page is clearly <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> and it is beyond me why it is still here at all!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this page needs to be semi-protected.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveswagon_48cd.html" title="User:Daveswagon">Daveswagon</a> 23:07, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I second the motion that this page be semi-protected to prevent it being used as an advertising platform. I have (again) cleaned this page up after it was (pro-break self back patting) modified. The page as it stands at this point in time is accurate and is Adequately referenced.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even though I aggree with the comments above, Wikipedia is not the place to decide whether a site is a good site or a bad site. Wikipedias inclusion of this website is for reference purposes relating to it as a site. No more, no less.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, all references to this site be they good or bad are valid and must be incorporated within this page to keep its accuracy value. As editors it is our responsibility.<small>—The preceding Pollyfodder comment was added by Pollyfodder (<a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPollyfodder_76d4.html" title="User talk:Pollyfodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pollyfodder_587d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pollyfodder">contribs</a>) 23:55, 7 April 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that any valid (eg objective facts) should be included. That's what wikipedia's all about. There is NO intention to use wikipedia as an ad. It's not.</p>
<p>Conversely, it shouldn't be used as a slander tool. Want to mention the adult R-rated material? Fine. Mention that it once. Mention that it requires 18+ age gate. Mention that it includes a family filter which is on by default. Mention that content is R rated. But don't plaster the article with multiple references, which, through repetition and uncited editorialization, hope to even some score.</p>
<p>It's most a humor site for men 18-35 and,more specifically, college students.</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Not from what I can see.</small> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7682524@N05/450013191" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7682524@N05/450013191" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Compare the article to metacafe or collegehumor.com. See if they are on par in terms of objectivity editors. If so, it's cool. But some people (probably competitors or banned users) are trying to use as reverse advertising -- a soapbox for personal attacks. that's wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>I see no slander within the content. Everything relating to the adult content is verifiable via the links to break.com (provided). Just because facts are a part of the pages content does not mean the editor is bias or has grudge against break.com.</small></dd>
<dd>I certainly would not go as far as calling it a soapbox for personal attacks, given this page has been created and modified by several people. You refer to the break site as "a humor site for men 18-35". Have you read the comment several paragraphs up and clicked onto the reference link? Nothing wrong with calling a spade a spade. Check your email too. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Pollyfodder (<a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPollyfodder_76d4.html" title="User talk:Pollyfodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pollyfodder_587d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pollyfodder">contribs</a>) 01:29, 8 April 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>Editors - The various edits and additions speak for themselves.</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>They certainly do! You have shown us all that you do indeed work for Break.com and Wikipedia is not the place to beat the Break.com drum! The Editor obviously does NOT have a grudge, nor do I. The contents of the break.com page must be accurate and must include the pros and cons of your site! Don't like it, then delete the page! I have emailed Wikipedia Admin asking they review this page.</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>There are plenty of blogs for editorial petitioning. The jedi mind trick accustaion of the article being used 'for advertising' is silly. It's being used the opposite way. I'm sure you can tell that by looking at the site break.com and searching news.google.com for break.com. Get facts and general consensus about break.com and make that the basis for a fair-minded entry that doesn't have the single objective 'get r-rated content off break.'</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Modifications to the page over several weeks do not reflect your grudge theory nor do they indicate a more than normal dislike of pornography on a site frequented by minors, given the video submissions on the just submitted.  :I myself have seen many a saucy clip on there! Because this is (obviously) the case, the inclusion of references to pornography within your site is valid. (sorry).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Also, the editor (Pollyfodder) has actually increased the number of references on the bottom of the page! I refer your attention to all the articles relating to Keith Richman, break.com's founder. This certainly does not indicate bias to me.</b></p>

Look forward to your supervision to bringing a fair minded pov to reviewing additions and edits. If you look at any additions and edits and ignore some of the rhetoric and attempts at deceptive posturing, you'll manage this properly. If you make semi-regulated, just get a wikipedia editor who has solid track-record and no axe to grind. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.108.152.153_207d.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.108.152.153">69.108.152.153</a> (talk) 20:37, 8 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>No problem. From this point forward I will remove any text that is not sourced by non-trivial secondary sources or is written with a point of view. I don't care about break.com in any way.

<dd>Polly, the most important thing for you to do now is find news articles on Break.com. You can check the typical anti-pornography groups (the major ones) and see what they have to say about break.com in official publications. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 17:41, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mr Smith, what I am doing has nothing to do with just the pornography but an endevour to keep the page as FACTUAL as possible. These "facts" must include the pornographic content as kids who frequent Wikipedia will as a matter of curiosity use the link to break.com provided within the break.com page. You will notice I have added quite a few GOOD media references in the last 2 weeks and was one of the people who spoke out to keep the page when it was considered for deletion. Go look at the history. And here is a sockpuppet labelling me as BIAS! Second, Who removed the "sockpuppet" warning and why? The rules relating to sockpuppets in Wikipedia are clear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You cited my modifications to the page but forgot to include the sockpuppets who again tried to beat his break.com drum. I removed them and reverted the page back to what it was with explaination therefor. Wikipedia is not a platform for free advertising, esspecially one containing pornographic spam and sponsored adult content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know you have nothing to do with the sockpuppet Mr Smith as you have a long history as a Wikipedian :) The sockpuppet does not, other than the modifications to their page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I refer your attention to "catagories" and the following "including animation, military, sports, humor, movies and entertainment". Do we need to have both there when the "catagories" links to the said content? I was going to modify this but thought no point lest I be singled out again for "MY" modification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many kids frequent Wikipedia and I question the reasoning behind removing the "parental discretion" warning I placed within the content. Would not look good for Wikipedia if a kid found this page and used the link to break.com only to be hit with adult content. I dont think the parents would be too happy, and I dread to think how the media would take it. I browsed the site not more than 10 hours ago and 2-3 pages in their just submitted section were saturated with XXX spam. (Screenshots available). In all fairness, no fault of Break.com, nontheless their responsibility for alowing it to stay there for several hours. Hence the addition where I made reference to those who browse break.com calling on the sites admin to police the site for which I did indeed include citations, but were "mysteriously" removed. At the end of the day do we want kids entering break.com from here to see this XXX content? This is why I added the "Parental discretion" warning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also draw your attention to the latest addition to the MEDIA section the first entry "Break partners with Audible Magic for copyright compiance in 2007". A whole page dedicated to copyright but break only has a minute mention "break.com" within the sentence. Is it worth being there? The numerous references I added included at least 60 percent reference to break.com or Keith Richman.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your help. And, PLEASE dont take me the wrong way, I have put in alot of GOOD things about break.com and unfortunately the good must also include the bad to keep a fair balance. As for the "Weed" when clicking onto it it does not take us to Businessweek.--Pollyfodder 20:54, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, I'd really like to keep this conversation about the article and avoid any accusations about the people involved in editing here. They may or may not be a sock puppet... it doesn't matter when we discuss the merits of inclusion.</dd>
<dd>We do not design our site to be "kid friendly". Take a look at <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">this</a> article if you doubt me. :) Our job is to relate information that has been covered by other major secondary sources. For example.... Lets assume the fictional John Doe is a notable actor. Lets also assume that you know for a fact that our fictional John Doe is a child molester. Unless you had a reliable secondary source it wouldn't be ok to say that on wikipedia. It would be "the truth" and "factual" but it would also not be acceptable to post on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Likewise, wikipedia can't host your personal experiences (Ie, You saw that porn was left up for several hours) because the next person to come along has no way to verify your experience. However, if some notable group complained about it and some media outlet picked up on the story we could then cover it here on wikipedia. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 23:01, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Joe Lazlo, a senior analyst with Jupiter Research, said the companies that are attracting funding are ones that are finding ways to differentiate themselves. He said one creative concept was that of Break.com, which allows people to post videos, then buys the more popular ones and runs ads with them.
<p>But so far at least, Break.com is not biting at venture capital offers. Keith Richman, its chief executive, said the company had declined financing a number of times as it tried to build the business on its own.</p>
<p>Mr. Felser, the president of Grouper, said there was a limit to how much a video creation and sharing company can hope to grow independently, because of the expense of bandwidth and advertising infrastructure.</p>

<p>The article continues from there. A much more substantial source with some decent information. If you want to expand the article, those three articles above would be a good place to start.

<dd>Mr Smith, help me out here. I understand your point regarding research, though, if I were to go out and find more material for inclusion in the references is that not "research"? How would there be anything on the page bad or good unless someone went out and found it? Is seeking information whether it be for confirmation or to establish authenticity etc research. If this is the case every page in Wikipedia should be deleted as the method used to collect the information is obviously "not allowed". I'm not one for opening cans or worms but...</dd>
