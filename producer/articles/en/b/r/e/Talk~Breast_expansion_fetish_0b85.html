<p>Giantism as defined by Wikipedia is not the “fetish” that is often (loosely) associated with BE. It should be macrophilia, or more specifically, giantess fetish.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My above post was made at a different time and was not intended to appear connected to the post that followed it. To clarify, the term <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giantism.html" title="Giantism">giantism</a> needed to be removed because it’s unrelated, so I did remove it. <i>Therefore this is ironic considering some of the flippant remarks lower on the page. It is sad that an attempt to clarify something on an article’s talk page would be used as nothing more than fuel to <b>further</b> harass its editors</i>. 64.11.244.251 07:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I’m astounded that someone [216.107.3 &amp; <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabecorp_a334.html" title="User:Babecorp">Babecorp</a> one and the same?] who obviously doesn’t know what BE is, would just blank most of the article and try to concoct one of his own. Not only does it grow more nonsensical with his every edit, it has less and less to do with BE fetishism. He/she did the same to the breast fetishism article – just erased a HUGE amount of content without giving any reason! (It is in light of the mess this BE article has become that I’m going to ignore <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Psb777</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../p/s/b/User_talk%7EPsb777_2f3c.html" title="User talk:Psb777">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psb777_b9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psb777">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Psb777_f29e.html" title="Special:Blockip/Psb777">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) aka Paul Beardsell's response to it: <b>vandalism</b>.) Actually the original BE entry (which I didn’t write) was a heck of a lot more informative than the fractured nonsense this article is currently.

<p>The title of the article is "breast expansion fetish". It is not "breast giantism". Any improvement can not be vandalism. That someone else might have destroyed a good article does not make edits which I do which improve the grammar, the wording into vandalism. Even if the article remains ridiculous. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 16:38, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uh huh. And “<b>A few write encyclopedia articles on the subject</b>” wasn’t vandalizing the article at all. It was a definite improvement in fact. [sarcasm] 64.11.244.75 18:27, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If writing stories is part of this fetish, then what is writing encyclopedia articles about it? I, for one, experience a frisson in so doing. What do you want to do? Deny me my fetish? Suppress the facts? Or is censorship your fetish? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 18:31, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And thus you reveal yourself to be the troll you are. How many times have you been blocked? And you’re still here? 64.11.244.93 18:50, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But at least I have the courage to identify myself. You, it seems, won't stand by what you write. And, BTW, calling someone a troll is considered by the Wikipedia powers that be to be a personal attack. So, you should be blocked. Certainly your edits here seem to lack the intellectual rigour necessary to address the argument and possibly that is why you resort to <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 19:02, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>“Certainly your edits here seem to lack the intellectual rigour necessary to address the argument” seems to be a lot more of a personal attack than correctly identifying you as troll and vandal. Should I now resort “to ad hominem attack” by calling you a hypocrite? At least I came to this site with the right intentions. <i>You</i>, clearly, have <i>not</i>. BTW if you don’t approve of the current edit feel free to improve it -- I would be the first to agree it probably does need improving -- without once again resorting to <i><b>vandalizing it</b></i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21450410&amp;oldid=21450102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21450410&amp;oldid=21450102" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21450670&amp;oldid=21450631" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21450670&amp;oldid=21450631" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> 64.11.244.93 19:46, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Interestingly your truth (if that is what it is) would not be taken as a valid defence by the ArbCom. I am careful not to make ny attack personal: I refer to your edits, not to you. This weasel wordery is the standard technique here at Wikipedia. Endorsed as official policy! Now, I suggest you return to your <i>extraordinary</i> fetish. Surely you're not <i>ashamed</i> to identify yourself? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 19:51, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don’t recall stating that this is my fetish. (It isn’t as a matter of fact.) But more interestingly you’re implying people with this fetish are and should be <b>“ashamed.”</b> You even drove the point home further when you went to the trouble of going back and italicizing "extraordinary" and “ashamed” in a retaliatory edit<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21645398&amp;oldid=21643929" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABreast_expansion_fetish&amp;diff=21645398&amp;oldid=21643929" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> making your meaning all too clear (as if there was ever any doubt). Or are you implying that anyone that makes an effort to improve the article should be “ashamed” as well? 64.11.244.41 19:15, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everyone will continue to assume this page is about anything and everything until somone finds a source for the term 'breast expansion fetish', or someone finds a source on the subject and renames the page under that terminology, or somebody deletes this page.</p>
<p>I doubt that there's really that documentable a connection between Gigantism,erotica envolving the 50 foot woman and breast implants. I guess what I'm saying is: Prove me wrong. Uh, with sources! <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 20:27, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Verification is a policy of wikipedia. This page has some chance of being deleted if published works are not cited for it. Please keep that in mind when adding to or editing this page- if you are not working from some published work, you are probably doing original research and breaking the rules. Unless you're fixing writing errors, or something like that. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 14:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd feel like a big douche if I nominated this for deletion for being original research if in fact someone just didn't bother to cite their sources but did have them. So I will wait some arbitrary amount of time before nominating this page for deletion. In the meantime, please take care not to create original research, and to base your writings on verifiable things in published works. It is the rules, and if you don't like them, you can write for answers.com instead. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 15:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that there are several websites that cater to the fetish doesn't nessasarily validate it, but let's assume it does. Then would you reference <a href="http://myfreeimplants.com" class="external text" title="http://myfreeimplants.com" rel="nofollow">MyFreeImplants.com</a> as a source for real-world breast expansion, and sites like <a href="http://www.bearchive.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bearchive.com" rel="nofollow">The Breast Expansion Archive</a> as a source for all types of BE? I've tried looking for other sources, but I just get copies of wikipedia articles, and a mention of it in this blog: <a href="http://www.markdery.com/archives/news/#000048" class="external text" title="http://www.markdery.com/archives/news/#000048" rel="nofollow">Sex Organs Sprout Everywhere</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> 23:37, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See wikipedia guidelines for verification and sources. But in general, the answer is no. You verify things through "trusted, published sources." <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 22:59, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be honest, it's going to be hard to cite anything on BE because it's rather a niche interest... the only thing I can think of as possibly holding anything on BE is that deviant desires book. I honestly think you'll struggle to find any source that the Wikipedia standards. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.131.145.64 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.131.145.64_baa9.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.131.145.64">contribs</a>) 14:57, 20 January 2007.</small></p>
<p>Lotusduck is right.

<p>Parts of this article also need to be defluffed against weasel words such as "many fetishists are morphers". There is likely no way to reference that as a fact and then there is the definition of what "many" means.

<dd>The idea that a site about sexual fetishes needs to some how incorporate the literal and full title in every mention of its terminology is ludicrous.

<p>The Deviant Desires book is indeed a published source, but the link does not support the claim on this wikipage. The link talks about body inflation and never mentions breast expansion fetish, much less how they are related. I believe that these edits were made carelessly but in good faith. Please do not restore them without settling this discussion of their lack of any direct reference to the term or idea "breast expansion fetish."128.101.70.95 15:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find it hard to believe you can be editing in good-faith if you can't find the parts of the Deviant Desires links that says things like <i>There are BE (Breast Expansion) fans who are only interested in breasts.</i> and the picture on the page taken from BustArtist. The fetish map also explicitly says "Breast Expansion" as one subject within the Body Inflation genre as well. There are numerous ways that this book directly cites and discusses this fetish and it is wrong to relegate it to the External links (and without even a link to the actual text, but only to the image). Please discuss your desired changes here further before reintroducing them. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 15:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I didn't log in but the sentances do not match the references. If altering the article to accurately reflect the content of the references makes it confusing and badly structured then this is the fault of the references being added poorly.

<dd>Wait a second here. Paraphrasing: <i>If your edits harmed the article, it's the fault of someone else.</i> Astounding. Also, the Deviant Desires book page directly addresses and reliably sources the ways in which the fetish is manifested by the fetishists (pregnancy, etc) and you just removed it as refering the credential of that statement. Furthermore, the fetish map link references how other similar fetishes are related and suit the same ends of satisfying the fetish. Finally, by blanketly reverting me you introduced horrible cut-n-paste grammar and destroyed the point of having a WP:LEAD. You over-specify the details of the Tribune article in what should be a summary section and furthermore moved a sentence to follow it with the word "they" in it (which originally referred to the fetishists in its original context, but now refers to the family and friends of the article writer??). You ALSO just inserted a [1] instead of using appropriate reference notation which is essentially junk characters in the article now. Finally, when moving the image to the External links section, you didn't put any sort of phrasing to describe the link so it's just an ugly dereferenced out-link with no appropriate annotation. I'm putting it back and I ask that if you feel that <i>any</i> or even <i>all</i> of your changes have merit, you do them with far more attention to detail and caution for grammar, manual of style, and continuity of thought.

<p>That said, the deviant desires page deals primarily with a different fetish, glancing at the page it is clear that it is not the sort of expansive article on breast expansion that we would prefer. The other articles have exactly nothing to do with breast expansion as a fetish. Even the films do not have an explicit erotic connection to the actual growth of breasts--the scenes where breasts grow are not sex scenes. I created the bad paragraph structure so that someone could move the references to somewhere they might be appropriate. What would have been more appropriate, removing them outright?<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 01:52, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Deviant Desires page deals with "inflation" fetishes. This is a meta-category that includes whole body, breast (BE), and belly/butt (B2E). The first example given in the second sentence on the page is breast expansion as a form of inflation fetish. It is dishonest to say that BE is not a primary concern to that page since the term BE is defined and printed no less than a half-dozen times in the 7 paragraphs on the page. As for the other references, the Carey article is entitled "Breast Enlargement Fantasy..." and the others provide support for statements made in the article that satisfy how the fetish is expressed as the article is written.</dd>
<dd>In other words, not every reference on an article page needs to include the terms in the article title. Often references are used to qualify the content of our articles that define the article topic. For example, the New York Times article might say that readership is down in recent years and the article linked may not mention the NYT specifically but be a more general treatise on how all major newspapers are losing to other media. That doesn't make that reference wrong for the article.</dd>
<dd>Finally, while Wikipedia is always changing, it's not a perpetual rough draft. Bad sentence structure, grammar, etc. is not a means to an ends for an article because the article is always supposed to be display quality. If you're unsure of how to rearrange something, then it's best to discuss it on the talk page first. If you don't believe a reference fits *anywhere* in the article, then it should be removed...of course, others may disagree and reinsert it where they find that it fits...which should then be discussed on the talk page. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

I am not sure the narrowness of your viewpoint here will have consensus, but I want to do it is some detail.As a preliminary, I mention that it is highly appropriate for an article on Mars to give a reference to a standard textbook in Astronomy where Mars is discussed perhaps incidentally, but well. Even a book on the Earthy geology may have something relevant. It is furthermore not productive to get into detailed discussions of whether two very closely related topics are the same or slightly different. At finally, editing is not a mechanical process.

<p>I'll agree with you on that last point/semi personal attack, and throw it right back at you. Even if it is okay to add sources that are not directly about the subject of the article, it is obviously not okay to add sources to a fact that the source article does not address, like adding an article on family disapproval of hypnotism and breasts to cite a fact about fetishism.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 17:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>"Today I've tuned in during the middle of a conversation between my favorite morning show host and a gentleman who claims he can temporarily enlarge a woman's breasts through hypnosis. I learn that the enhancements are safe, painless, last only three days, and can add approximately 4 inches to your bustline by increasing blood flow to that area of the body. Or you can listen to this guy's tape series and permanently enlarge your breasts in just one month. For some reason, which perhaps I need a therapist to figure out, I'm intrigued. The deejay says he'll take the first 20 female callers who want to come to the studio the next morning to participate in a "group enhancement." ... I hang up the phone and wonder what the heck I'm going to do with temporarily enlarged breasts. "Does your husband want you to do this?" she asks, assuming that I am heroically trying to fulfill a sexual fantasy of the man I love. I assure her that is not the case and relay the earlier conversation with my spouse. ... "What if they don't shrink back to their normal size?" [a friend] adds, skeptically. This is a troubling thought that I had not considered. I suddenly have visions of oversized shirts, backaches and bras the size of a horse harness.</p>

Abstract (entire abstract is fair use) "When [Tony Gardner] stopped laughing, he took the job on "A Dirty Shame," the raunch-friendly director's NC-17-rated sex farce that came out on Friday. The prosthetic designer's primary directive: Transform the gamine [Blair] into an exhibitionistic exotic dancer whose stage name, Ursula Udders, bespeaks her monumental physique. "[John Waters] said he wanted to get these as large as we can -- but not just be boobs on legs," Gardner says.
</pre>
<p>The construction of such breasts involved a higher degree of technical expertise than anyone had imagined. Six pairs were constructed out of materials such as foam latex, urethane rubber and balloon rubber, while the custom latex breasts used for Blair's nude scenes required a lengthy application process that would begin on her shooting days at 4 a.m. Other nonprosthetic "stunt breasts" functioned like bustiers, allowing the actress to slip them on and off easily -- even if they resulted in some unusual side effects. "She couldn't see her feet, couldn't tie her shoes," says Gardner, 40. "She couldn't put on a bathrobe or cross her arms in front of her face"</p>

<li>J Medical Ethics (Fair use abstract from pubmed) I consider this a general reference on the theme of the article, not a ref to illustrate any particular point. I cannot see how any objections raised apply to this. It is good to have one scholarly article among all the newspapers.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Facelifts, tummy tucks and breast enlargements are no longer the privilege of the rich and the famous. Any woman can have all these and many more cosmetic surgical treatments, and an increasing number of women do. Are they having cosmetic surgery because they are duped by a male-dominated beauty system, or do they genuinely choose these operations themselves? Feminists (and others) give diametrically opposed answers to this question. At the heart of the controversy, or so I claim in this article, lies a conceptual problem about free choice; therefore, the only thing that can settle it is a conceptual analysis of "freedom". After having briefly outlined the views of both sides of the debate, I offer such an analysis." <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
