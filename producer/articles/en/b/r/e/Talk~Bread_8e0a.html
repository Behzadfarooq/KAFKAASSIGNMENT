<p>I deleted the Cheese and Broccolli and French bread recipes as they added nothing to this entry. The French bread recipe was useless as it clearly stated at the end that it wasn't a French bread recipe. As for the cheese and brocolli one there are thousands of recipes for different kinds of bread and they can't all be listed here. Charlie</p>
<p>Why has my whole paragraph about bread in Germany been deleted? Germany is world champion in bread consumption. Is that not worth to be mentioned here? It was my first contribution to wikipedia - what a disappointment that someone deletes it completely without a comment.</p>
<p>I did not delete your paragraph about bread in germany but i would suggest that you make it its own entry with a link to it on the bread page. the information is overly specific given the general nature of the remainder of the article. I.E. there are no Bread in France or Bread in China sections. also the first sentence "Germans are crazy about bread" is a little informal for an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../m/h/b/User%7EMhbourne_cbcf.html" title="User:Mhbourne">mhbourne</a> 00:31 PDT, 20 Sept 2005</p>

The French are crazy (strictly, deviens fou) about bread too! Wikipedia is tough on authors - hang in there and keep contributing. Just keep things factual. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnSankey_13f7.html" title="User:JohnSankey">JohnSankey</a> 19:33, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out the "no yeast" comment from the sourdough link. Although strictly gramatically correct as it was written, it's misleading - sourdough does contain yeasts, natural ones that are all around us even in flour. A person who is sensitive to yeasts may still have problems with sourdough breads. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnSankey_13f7.html" title="User:JohnSankey">JohnSankey</a> 13:56, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Should a recepe be included in the definition of bread? Probably not.</li>
<li>This definition leaves some huge holes. How do you fit cornbread, and unleavened breads like pita, matza, etc. Are all speciality breads like rye, made using wheat flour? Not sure how to change this or I would try myself. --rmhermen - 15:43, 25 Feb 2002</li>

<p>"Many breads (such as the famous baguette) are made from a straight dough, which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough baked after the rising time."</p>
<p>I'm not sure this is correct; a baguette - the ones I know - are made with a starter called a "poolish" . This starter dough in either based on bakery yeast or sourdough and is left to rise in a refrigerator for about 12 hours/overnight. This practise was introduced by Polish bakers in the 1840s and adopted in France in the 1920s for making baguettes. I have this from two (swedish) books by artisan bakers; Jan Hedh and Johan Sörberg. thats right! its a special thing about frnech bread!&#160;:)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The development of leavened bread is commonly believed to have occurred in Egypt, due to its favorable wheat growing conditions, and required the development of wheat varieties with two properties not available in earlier varieties. The first development occurred by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Egypt_296b.html" title="Early Dynastic Period of Egypt">beginning of Dynastic Egypt</a> and consisted of a grain that could be satisfactorily <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threshing.html" title="Threshing">threshed</a> without being first toasted. Discovery of a wheat variety containing sufficient gluten-forming protein was the second development required for raised bread. Initial development of leavened bread is believed to have occurred during the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century_BC_f91d.html" title="17th century BC">17th century BC</a>, but the wheat capable of producing it appears to have been rare for a very long time after it was initially developed. This scarcity is suggested by the fact that such grain did not become common in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> until the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Century_BC_ffcc.html" title="4th Century BC">4th Century BC</a> despite regular trade having occurred between Egypt and Greece for the previous 300 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as it represents a very garbled understanding of the history of bread &amp; wheat. The fact is that emmer wheat, cultivated since the Neolithic, makes excellent risen bread, which was widely consumed in Ancient Egypt. It is true that spelt wheat and bread wheat (neither grown in ancient Egypt) make (arguably) even better risen bread, but we have a very incomplete understanding of which wheat species was preferred where, and for exactly what culinary use. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknesbitt_5453.html" title="User:Marknesbitt">Mark Nesbitt</a> 12:56, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have restore the section in question. The text you removed contains inline citations (<a href="../../../i/n/o/Template%7EInote_2698.html" title="Template:Inote">inotes</a>) to the references that were used to generate the text, so the removed text is clearly not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. The development of yeast leavening is also a major development in the way that bread was produced so eliminating this development for the history section seems somewhat excessive.

<p>This is a very good article, but it strikes me as being somwhat <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentric.html" title="Ethnocentric">ethnocentric</a> - it gives European and North American bread much more attention than bread from other countries. There is mention of Matzos, and of unleavened bread in the history section, but it doesn't say much about bread in other countries <i>today</i>. There's a whole section on French, Danish &amp; German bread, but having just eaten some Morrocan bread, I'm wondering where the section on Middle Eastern bread is. Surely someone knows a lot more about Middle Eastern bread than I do, not to mention bread in India and Africa. So please add some info about it and we can get rid of the cultural bias!&#160;:) ~~<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaluton_9119.html" title="User:Saluton">Saluton</a>~~</p>

<p>"Bread is a popular food in Western and most other societies except for the Asian societies that typically prefer rice". I don't think so. In both India and China, people eat rice in the South and bread in the North. It probably has more to do with the climates in which wheat and rice grow than with the inscrutable tastes of those cunning orientals. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerdinand_Pienaar_ba6c.html" title="User:Ferdinand Pienaar">Ferdinand Pienaar</a> 14:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed. In Wiki there are already articles on Mantou and Bing(Chinese flat bread), traditional staples in Northern China. In this case Northern China doesn't mean Mongolia etc, but more northeasterly locations such as Beijing. In this view bread has just as much heritage as rice does in China.</p>

<p>Does anybody know anything about Laffa/<i>Esh Tanur</i> bread. It is very popular in middle eastern countries, sort of a cross between pita and lavash bread and is frequently used interchangably with pita in restaurants (at least in Israel). It is pocketless, is, thinner than pita and is used as a wrap. <i>Esh Tanur</i> is a hebrew term literally meaning "oven fire" <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 16:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think this is a good article. Bread is obviously a messy subject because it means lots of different things to different people in different cultures. I've been meaning to put the 'Denmark and Bread' section on its own page for ages.

<p>This is a question really... It seems to me that although yeast and therefore the raising of bread is widespread, the preference in hot countries appears to be for unleavened bread, whereas in Europe, and by export of the concept to North America, the preference is for leavened bread. Is this a cultural/anthropological artefact, or is it more to do with the local grains and/or cooking technology, or is it to do with heat increasing the rate at which raised bread goes stale?

<p>I found the section on fats to be a bit confusing. The second paragraph seems to be saying that fats make bread harder while the 3rd paragraph says they tenderize bread. I read the section a few times and thought that perhaps the key is in the first paragraph where it says that fats strengthen the protein structure (which would make it harder, right?) only up to a point (~3%), but adding more fat beyond that point weakens the protein structure (which would make it softer but also less leavened?). Anyway, I'm still not sure if that is what it is trying to say. Maybe everyone else found it clear but to me it was hard to figure out. 24.7.254.33 19:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
