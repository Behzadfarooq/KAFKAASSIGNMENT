<p>Holly Golightly first appeared in the the pages of Truman Capote's short novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1958 - from there her story has inspired what is considered one of the most memorable romantic films of all time, a classic fashion style, and the most popular and reproduced theme song in cinema history. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bcash/breakfasthomepage.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bcash/breakfasthomepage.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The below passage does not appear to be objective:</p>
<p><br />
"A number of changes had to be made to make the storyline acceptable to a film audience and fans of Audrey Hepburn. For example, in the novella, Holly is more explicitly described as being a prostitute, something only hinted at in the film. There was also no love story between the narrator (played by George Peppard in the film) and Holly, because he was a closet homosexual. Capote's novel also included language that was toned down as well as a more complex ending which became a conventional romantic happy ending for the film."</p>
<p><br />
First, as far as I can see, the book makes no more explicit reference to Holly's 'profession' than does the movie.</p>
<p>Second, there are no references to Paul Varjak as a closet homosexual in the book. In fact, he states that his hand wants to feel Holly (in a sexual manner) as he is massaging her back.</p>

<dd>I just finished reading the book. I absolutely must agree that the book makes no more explicit reference to Holly's 'profession' than does the movie. I never ever interpreted the the book's writer character, known as "Fred" in the book and christened Paul Varjak for the film, to be homosexual. Nowhere is this even hinted at, while he has a strong and intense longing for Holly that seems like unrequited love. Also, where in the book do Holly and Mag enter into a possibly "bisexual" (?) relationship? They are both strongly and fervently heterosexual in the book, and Holly clearly states that she is not a lesbian. Main change from book to movie is the film's addition of the Tooley character, as portrayed by Patricia Neal, a character who absolutely is not in the book. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 11:35, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"In the original novella, Holly and Mag Wildwood, a model with a stuttering problem enter into a vaguely bisexual relationship." More "vague" than "bisexual" one would think. What would a bisexual relationship be like? Who would be partaking of a "bisexual" relationship? --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 05:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am trying to remedy this by actually writing about the movie.&#160;:) In the process I am trying to disambiguate this page about the movie from pages about the novella, the play, and the song.

<dd>As this pertains to spoilers, the line "The film ends with a famous scene in the rain (no spoilers here)," with the actual picture of the kiss in the rain a few lines down, and directly underneath a spoiler banner, confuses me greatly.</dd>

<p>The character played by patricia neil is supposed to be named 2E, not Tooley. I have made this cange. I watched the film, and the subtitles reffered to her as 2e.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree 100%. I have no idea where that character name came from. Even on the DVD featurette her character is referred to as 2E. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tooley is evidently a mis-hearing of Tooey, which is how the name is sometimes (erroneously) rendered. I believe the origin of Tooey is people trying to figure out the name of the character, 2E, and not understanding that 2E is her nickname. Additionally, 2E is often thought to be the flat number of this character, but it stands for her first and middle names, Emily Eustice. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 13:42, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that the article is included in the category "1995 singles", which undoubtedly refers to the pop song of the same title, by Deep Blue Something, with lyrics that reference the movie, as follows:</p>

<p>Obviously the link intended to be that song shouldn't point to this article.

<p>I have made this page the main page for search links for "Breakfast at Tiffany's", since in contemporary culture the <b>movie</b> is surely the main meaning one has in mind for the phrase.

<dd>Just go to edit page and delete the tag. However if we're going to split the article up we need to change some titles around. The original novel needs to have the "undisambiguated" Breakfast at Tiffany's title, while the film article needs to be named <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_%28film%29_71d1.html" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)">Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)</a>. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I think the movie should have the "undisambiguated" page, for reasons I state both above and at the disambiguation page I created, namely that the movie has largely overtaken the novella in the public consciousnness as far as what the term "Breakfast at Tiffany's" means. In addition, the page about the movie is far more complete than the one about the novella, which barely has any information. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 15:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the phrase</p>
<p>"and the film marked a major comeback for the actress after several years of unsuccessful films"</p>
<p>because it is entirely inaccurate and misleading.</p>
<p>Audrey Hepburn was at the peak of her career when she made <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i> It was very easy for the studio to enforce its will upon Truman Capote and have Ms Hepburn play the role of Holly Golighlty instead of Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p>Before <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>, Audrey had a string of sucessful movies, including <i>The Nun's Story</i> (1959, Best Actress nominee); <i>Love in the afternoon</i> (1957), <i>Funny Face</i> (1957), <i>War and Peace</i> (1956), <i>Sabrina</i> (1954, Best Actess Nominee), and <i>Roman Holiday</i> (1953, Best Actress Award), her first major picture. She also starred in the critically acclaimed <i>The Children's Hour</i> in the same year she made <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>, although it was released the following year. Only <i>Green Mansions</i> (1959, directed by her husband, Mel Ferrer) and <i>Unforgiven</i> (1960) were sub-par movies. After <i>Breakfast</i>, Audrey continud her string of successes with <i>Charade</i> (1963), <i>My fair lady</i> (1964), <i>How to steal a million</i> (1966), <i>Two for the road</i> (1967), and <i>Wait until dark</i> (1967). --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 16:11, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then you're contradicting the Barry Paris biography among others. Hepburn's career hit a slump with Green Mansions and Unforgiven, and her professional work was also impacted by her broken back, and the fact she took time off to have Sean. I'm reverting the change because it is an accurate statement. There's nothing in there about Sabrina or War &amp; Peace or Funny Face or Nun's Story. But BAT was considered a comeback for her. Children's Hour was also, IIRC made after BAT. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>it is not an accurate statement</b> and neither are some of your "proofs". Let's check the facts once again:</p>
<p>1) Audrey was extremely successful movie star and a fashion icon from the movies up to and including 1957, which I have listed.</p>
<p>2) She and Mel made a largely unsuccessful movie <i>Green Mansions</i> in 1959.</p>
<p>3) <i>The Nun's Story</i> was released <b>after</b> <i>Green Mansions</i> and received nothing but accolades and it was Warner's biggest grossing film up to that point (Barry Paris, 153); Audrey was named Best Actress by the New York Film Critics and the film received ten Oscar nominations. (ibid). I would say that this movie pushed the husband-wife flop (if you will) of <i>Green Mansions</i> out of the public mind and put Audrey back into the lime light (although I do not think she ever left it, in the public's point of view); in fact, for perhaps the first time she was taken seriously as an actress. If there was a comeback movie, it was <i>The Nun's Story.</i></p>
<p>4) <i>The Unforgiven</i> was a flop. However, says Paris: "<i>The Unforgiven</i> had not helped her career, but neither had it inflicted any great damage." (Paris, p 168).</p>
<p>5) Sean was born in January 1960. (Paris, p 169).</p>
<p>6) Audrey began filming Breakfast at Tiffany's in October 1960. (Paris, 170). This is hardly taking an unusual amount of time off and Sean's birth did nothing to (negatively) impact her work, as you state.</p>
<p>7) Neither did Audrey's "broken back" (negatively) impact her work, except that it kept her off the set of <i>The Unforgiven</i> from Jan 29 to Mar 10--six weeks!</p>
<p>8) Thus we have, in order of release:</p>
<p><i>Green Mansions</i> (a flop),</p>
<p><i>The Nun's Story</i> (a major success),</p>
<p><i>The Unforgiven</i> (a flop),</p>
<p><i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.</p>
<p>I repeat the statement in question is inaccurate and misleading. Let's look at it:</p>
<p>"and the film marked a major comeback for the actress after several years of unsuccessful films"</p>
<p>1) it was not a MAJOR comeback:</p>
<p><i>The Unforgiven</i> had not hurt her career.</p>
<p>there was NO "several years" of "unsuccessful films"</p>
<p>I have never heard of <i>Breakfast</i> described as a comeback or major comeback, and I reread the Barry Paris sections (as you can tell) and he does NOT say this at all; if he does, quote him. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 06:30, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I still think you're wrong. Have you checked <i>Elegant Spirit</i>? The Walker book? Of course we won't count Mayerchuk's book as she allegedly made most of it up. You also don't count Mayerling which was not a critical success either. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:44, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can refence Sean's book tonight. And I agree about Mayerling. However, to keep the peace, what about this sentence:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"and the film B@T marked a major success for the actress in 1961 after the previous unsuccessful release of <i>The Unforgiven</i> in 1960, which incidently followed the hugely successful <i>The Nun's Story</i> released in 1959."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I don't think such a sentence is necessary, since it isn't that pertinent to <i>Breakfast.</i> Mainly because even after <i>Green Mansions</i>, <i>Mayerling</i>, and <i>The Unforgiven</i>, Audrey's career hadn't taken a nose dive, nor had her popularity or critical success plummeted (remember <i>The Nun's Story</i>), so I don't see the phrase <i>major comeback</i> as accurate or necessary. <i>Major success</i> I can agree with. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 18:45, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hepburn was still one of the top actresses of the time. An actress doesn't automatically become unpopular just because she doesn't make a hit in 2 years, especially if that actress is still as vibrant and attractive as ever. 70.231.249.18 06:56, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I rewrote the sentence.

It should also be kept in mind that, contrary to most news reports, the dress auctioned by Christie's was <i>not</i> the dress worn by Audrey in the movie. This is clearly explained in the Christie's reference. The dress sold at auction has a thigh-length slit; the dress worn by Audrey in the movie did not have any slit. Movie posters such as the one shown in the article, and possibly PR photos, may show a dress with a slit. But such a dress wasn't used in the movie. --<a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 16:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This issue has been raised again, in the summary, by someone changing the phrase "call girl" to "(non-sexual) escort" and gives the reason <i>"call girl" makes it sound like the character is a prostitute.</i> Well, I believe the correct interpretation to Holly's profession in the movie <i>is</i> call girl (sort of a high-class hooker, or more formally, "a female prostitute hired by telephone").</p>
<p>In an above section, there is some discussion of what Holly's role in the movie is, as compared or contrasted to that in the novella. Someone notes there is no more unambiguous evidence in the novella (which I have not read) as to her exact role than in the movie. So what are we let with? A few clues from the movie (I would rather go with the clues in the movie and not the novella, since the two are different entities):</p>
<p>"$50 for the powder room" =&gt; Could this mean a (non-sexual) escort only? It was my understanding that this euphemism pointed to sexual services. Now that I think about it, after Paul and Holly have sex (and they do, on the evening/night of the day that they go shoplifting), Paul the next day gives Holly (in the library) his check for $50 and asks her if she thinks of him like all other guys she has been with, and she asks what it is for, and he says "Fifty dollars for the powder room." I think this is strong evdience that Holly's role or (side-)profession in the movie is that of "call girl" who provides sexual services; as does the demand</p>
<p>"Doesnt that give me some rights?!" uttered by Mr Sid Arbuck at the beginning of the film, when he follows Holly home and pounds on her door and asks for his rights since he paid her "$50 for the powder room." This, again, very strongly implies that Holly provides more than just an escort service.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am changing the phrase back to call girl. <a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 13:49, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have once again changed the description of Holly Golightly back to "call girl." I wish people would stop changing this phrase without at least discussing it. Refer to my remarks above to show that Holly was indeed a "call girl," who received money for sexual favours. She did not provide merely an escort service, and whoever changed the phrase 'earned money by being a call girl' to 'earned money by dating rich men' is way off the mark. She didn't earn money by dating rich men. She wanted to marry a rich man so with part of that wealth she could help her brother Fred. <a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 22 February 2007</p>

<p>It is not a "Hollywood myth" that Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play the role of Holly Golightly in the film. This is a fact that has been documented several times, not the least by Mr Capote himself (see <i>Audrey Hepburn</i> by Barry Paris, p 170, where he references a quote by Capote).</p>
<p>Paris (p. 170) continues that "George Axelrod was hired to tailor the screenplay for Monroe." Monroe acted out two scenes for Capote and Paris quotes Capote as saying "She wanted [the role] so badly."</p>
<p>Paris continues by quoting "Monroe's dramatic advisor, Paula Strasberg" as declaring "she would not have her play a role of a lady of the evening."</p>
<p>Paris continues with another quote by Capote (who sold the film rights): "Paramount double-crossed me in every way and cast Audrey."</p>
<p>Therefore I am re-writing that section, with a view toward making it more like the original content before someone changed it and said this was all a myth. <a href="../../../s/p/3/User%7ESp3lly_c0a7.html" title="User:Sp3lly">Sp3lly</a> 14:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed references to the song being made a hit by Andy Williams. Surely this and other such facts would better fit in the trivia section and not in the <b>movie summary</b>. Sp3lly --71.145.206.164 07:00, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
