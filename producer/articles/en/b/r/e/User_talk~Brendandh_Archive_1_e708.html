<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> article simply claims that they can trace their heritage back to the ancient Britons, I don't understand why this is at all contentious. There is no doubt that English people are descended from ancient Britons, there's plenty of research to back this up. It is also true that many archaeologists claim to see continuity in the record throughout the period, indicating an indigenous influence on <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> culture. Nowhere in the article does it claim that <i>Angles spoke Welsh</i>. I fail to understand why it is not obvious that English peple are the product of the fusing of two cultures, that of the indigenous Brythonic peoples and that of the incoming Germanic peoples. I think I can find a reference to support this claim in <i>Britain AD</i> by Francis Pryor. Please don't make this sort of very big change to an article before getting consensus on the talk page. All the best. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:16, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's some bits and bobs from Susane's <i>History of the French Cavalry</i> in the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maison_du_Roi_88df.html" title="Maison du Roi">Maison du Roi</a> piece, but I think you already have more in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garde_du_Corps_%28France%29_6247.html" title="Garde du Corps (France)">Garde du Corps (France)</a>. The book I got my info from is L.A.V.V. Susane, <i>Histoire de la cavalerie française</i>; the Gardes du Corps are in volume one mainly, but it doesn't have much information beyond when and how they were created, uniforms, mottos and commanders. I don't know if you've tried <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr" class="external text" title="http://gallica.bnf.fr" rel="nofollow">Gallica</a>: the subject catalogue doesn't have anything under "Gardes du Corps" or "Garde et maison militaire du roi", but that doesn't mean that there isn't anything. If you're looking for particular people, it might be helpful. There are no end of C19th periodicals on there. Apparently there's an ancient book by one Francisque Michel, <i>Les Ecossais en France et les Francais en Ecosse</i> (2 vols, 1862), which gets quoted quite often. Contamine's piece on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Stewart%2C_Lord_of_Aubigny_81e5.html" title="Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny">Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny</a> quotes an article he wrote in Grant Simpson (ed.) <i>The Scottish Soldier Abroad, 1247–1967</i> (Edinburgh, 1992), which should at least be easier to find than some antique from 1862. Probably not really helpful. If there's anything I can do, let me know.

<p>I suggest you read the wiki Manual of style with regard to not including knighthoods for peers. Wiki articles should follow wiki style or policy guidelines so I will have to revert changes that go against them.</p>
<p>As to the Dukedom you're mistaken about the the remainder. Even assuming N could under peerage law confirm someone who is not the heir under the remainder to the title (which he couldn't in strict law) it would still not be held by the present duke. The clear claimant to the title is the present Earl of Derby as heir general under the terms of the original creation. Setting that aside to play fiction and assume that N restored the original title it would, under the original remainder, have descended to the daughter of the 12th Duke and her heirs male then female. It would not have jumped back all the way to the decendants of the 4th Duke this is french peerage law not scottish it was not to heirs male whatsoever. Most authorities maintain that Ns actions were a new creation which would under the law of the time be heirs male again in its french meaning not Scottish and so have become extinct with his death.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 22:30, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'd appreciate your input on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_cuisine.html" title="Scottish cuisine">Scottish cuisine</a> talk page, further to our wee exchange earlier. I think there's room for compromise on this article. It is far from my intention to talk down about Scottish food and I recognise that my choice of words ("hearty") didn't adequately describe the real situation. I've suggested a way forward on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Talk%7EScottish_cuisine_4c0c.html" title="Talk:Scottish cuisine">talk page of the article</a> - let me know what you think!

<p>If you can help I think this article should carry the island's correct name, which is <b>The Bass</b>. I know that locals here commonly call it the Bass Rock, but that is incorrect. These forms of vulgarisation of place-names in Scotland are common. Any map correctly calls it The Bass. At least there should be some sort of invisable redirection link so that any references to The Bass take one to the article.

<dd>Could you please have a look at the work I have done on the Whitecastle page. There needs to be some sort of redirection set up for <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nunraw.html" title="Nunraw">Nunraw</a>.

<p>You asked if I knew anything about North Berwick Castle. I presume you mean the ridge to the east of the town known locally as Castle Hill? The remains, concealed in its grassy mound, are of that castle. Andrew Spratt, something of an expert on East Lothian castles, Peles, etc., wrote an article, with a brilliant "as it might have looked" drawing, on North Berwick Castle in the magazine <i>East Lothian Life</i>, number 29, Spring 1999 ISSN . He states that in the 14th century Sir Robert Lauder of The Bass built a stone tower with barmkin on the site, but abandoned it within a century. He says they used the stone to reinforce the castle on The Bass as well as their Tyninghame Pele Tower. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 11:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey. I've gotta be honest, I'm not sure I know what comments/conversation you're referring to. Interesting to note is that in Scotland the name Bricius is typically a Latin/French "transation" of the native names Gilla Brigte and Máel Brigte, "Briget's lad" and "tonsured devotee of Briget" respectively; the church of Douglas was dedicated to St Briget/St Bride. This, I would suggest, is no coincidence. Archibald, I thought, is certainly the later English rendition of Flemish Arkenbald Looking over de Dovglas and de Muref naming patterns, Flemish names feature prominently and confirm their respective Flemish origins. I'd guess they were in the same group of Flemings hired in by David I. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 23:43, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hiya, I have in my notes (unfortunately I didn't keep the reference although I could probably find it with a good bit of searching) that all the brothers except Archibald went to Moray. They probably were not all there at the same time though. Bricius became bishop, Alexander was Canon of Spynie as was his brother Henry; Hugh and Friskin both became Dean of Moray. A couple of sources say that William de Duglas married a sister of Friskin de Kerdale (an estate at Boharm) and hence the introduction of the "Friskin" name in the Douglas family and the three stars in the coat-of-arms.

<p>I'm not sure what the problem is. I did not remove the information you put in, but reorganized it for style reasons. You'll see that the info is still there. Regarding "petty", this does not mean the lordship had no importance, it just distinguishes it from magnate lordships like Annandale (large scale, regality legal jurisdiction, etc) and princely lordships like Galloway or the Isles. Regarding "the peerage was not as hierarchical in terms of nomenclature", well, firstly, there was no "peerage" in Scotland until the 1440s, and secondly, nobility was hierarchical; a lord/prince (rí) or earl (mormaer) had much more status than a thane (toisech) or Anglo-Norman magnate or baron. In the scheme of things in 12th and 13th century Scotland, the Douglas lord was a minor royal demesne baron; Bricius, if he was in fact a "Douglas", achieved far more status than any of his pre-Wars of Independence relatives. And dozens of other families of like rank also produced bishops; a bishopric was, after all, often a reward for meritorious service as a royal functionary. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 13:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only possible pudding here is the clootie dumpling — which is really a dumpling. The quotation including <i>desert glasis</i> suggests to me something akin to cranachan.</p>

<p>I just added Fowler's brilliant definition of a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prig.html" title="Prig">Prig</a> to your article. I hope it stays on WP - maybe a little discussion of the term's class connotations, or something like that, could go in to persuade the admins to keep it?--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 22:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure how to stall the transwiki process.

<dd>I once uploaded to Wiktionary an article on the word Hubbub - it had eytmology and bits of info about its Irish origins and Edmund Spenser's role as a colonist in Munster. The article got kicked over to Wikipedia, and promptly kicked back to Wikitionary. I'm not sure where it is now - maybe cyber-purgatory.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 19:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, The usual method is <b>Move Page</b>. If that doesnt work (as here), try #redirect wherever (which I have done) or ask an administrator. You will have to carry your edits across. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 09:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brendandh, I appreciate your contributions to Wikipedia. I acknowledge that you have specialized knowledge relating to the Hamilton family name and in that respect most likely have a wealth of factual information to share. However, on Wikipedia, editors with a direct connection with a topic are discouraged from editing the related articles directly. You may find it useful to review <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Editors who find themself in this position are advised to post their information on the article talk page for consideration for inclusion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 11:02, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> quite obviously refers to contentious political and other obvious issues. I find it extremely difficult to believe that it refers to genealogy and factual sourced comment on such matters - or even casual views. You are saying that anyone with the surname Jones must avoid anything whatsoever which has a Jones in it. Too ridiculous. Do you actually understand the meaning of "conflict of interest"? Is this your way of attempting to eliminate someone from a discussion? I think I have seen this sort of attitude somewhere else. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 13:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brendandh, I recently came across a guideline on edit summaries that you may find useful, <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">WP:ES</a>. There are editors and automated bots whom and which monitor Wikipedia for vandalism.
