<p>The game follows the adventures of Ryu (the protagonist) who is the sole survivor of the Dragon Clan, as he struggles to discover why his clan was wiped out. The adventure takes him to many places, on journeys thought impossible, and in the end he will discover power in the ability to choose his own future.</p>
<p>As the last survivor of the Dragon Clan, Ryu must continue his struggle against the evil goddess Myria, who has taken over the world and now controls it.</p>
<p>To fill in the timeline, this occurs after Breath of Fire II. In a large fresco in a secret Brood (Dragon Clan) stronghold, portrays the Breath of Fire I characters battle with a woman with snake like tentacles (Tyr/Myria). The battle with Deathevan is not mentioned, so it can be assumed that Deathevan never reappeared or is never going to become a recurring villain.</p>

<p>Gameplay within Breath of Fire 3 consists of, for the most part, three main screens; the world map, the dungeon, or a town. Furthermore, there are mini games prevalent throughout, Such as propogating a colony of faeries, as well as fishing for both profit and items to trade for. Travel is consistently on foot for a large part of the game, although much later one can teleport, a feature that was not included in prior games.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath_of_Fire_III_2eb0.html" title="Edit section: Playable Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playable Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryu_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_7b89.html" title="Ryu (Breath of Fire character)">Ryu</a></b> is related to the Dragon Clan, or Brood, and has natural blue hair. The main protagonist of the game. He is arguably the best character in the game, with most of his stats above average. He equips swords and most armour and is an effective warrior. He can be an effective magic caster too if given some attack magic through mastering and skills. As he levels up he will gain powerful healing magic. The main skill that puts him above the other characters is his skill “Accession”. This allows him to mix ‘Dragon Genes’ (which are found throughout the game), and transform into a powerful Dragon. However, this takes a lot of AP and is only really worth using during Boss fights.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_a286.html" title="Nina (Breath of Fire character)">Nina</a></b> is the main supporting character as a princess of Wyndia with a mastery of the magical arts. In this game, as in Breath of Fire II, she specializes in attack magic. Unlike in the other games however, her clan has lost their wings due to the passage of time and now she wears ornaments that resemble wings attached to her back. Nina is the weakest character in combat, having a low Power, Defence &amp; HP. Her strengths are her speed, but mostly her Magic. She has a good intelligence and gains attack magic as she levels up.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../r/e/i/Rei_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_b9c1.html" title="Rei (Breath of Fire character)">Rei</a></b> is a Woren (originally Furen in Japan), or tiger-person, that finds Ryu and takes care of him as a child. He's a talented thief who wields two large daggers. Rei is the fastest character in the game (although with the master system it is possible for other characters surpass him). He is mainly a warrior type character although he does gain some lightning magic later in the game. He starts off with the ‘pilfer’ skills which allows him to steal items off enemies. Half way through the game, he gains the ‘Weretiger’ skill that transforms him into a strong tiger, which goes berserk in battle. While berserk he can sometimes attack the other party members, unless they cast the ‘influence’ skill.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../t/e/e/Teepo_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_cbdb.html" title="Teepo (Breath of Fire character)">Teepo</a></b>, a young thief and friend to Ryu and Rei that wields powerful magic; one of the less-addressed aspects of the game is his duality with Ryu. He was revealed near the end of the game as one of the surviving members of the Brood as well.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/o/m/Momo_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_2664.html" title="Momo (Breath of Fire character)">Momo</a></b>, a Grassrunner (dog type clan), scientist who carries a large bazooka armed with magical shells, and is a genius of machines. Honey, who is a machine soldier, is her companion. Momo is a mix of a fighter and a magic user. Her Bazooka does lots of damage (although never criticals), but her HP and Defence are only average. She has the highest natural Intelligence stat in the game, and she gains a lot of support magic as she levels up, as well as some earth attack magic. It is also noted that her Bazooka misses a lot, which can be somewhat off-set by the 'Artemis Cap' accessory.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../p/e/c/Peco_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_e23c.html" title="Peco (Breath of Fire character)">Peco</a></b> (originally <b>Pecoros</b> in Japan) is a walking, gibberish-talking onion plant. It turns out to be tree sap from Ygdrassil. When you first acquire Peco, he is at level 1, and requires time and effort to bring him up to the standard of the other characters. This is well worth it however, because Peco can become a great fighter in the group, even surpassing Garr if used properly. Magic wise, he gains a few breath weapons that cause various effects. Being a plant, he is weak against fire attacks.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garr_%28Breath_of_Fire_character%29_8a1f.html" title="Garr (Breath of Fire character)">Garr</a></b> (originally <b>Garland</b> in Japan) is a Guardian (who looks the same as the demons of <i><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath_of_Fire_II_175e.html" title="Breath of Fire II">Breath of Fire II</a></i>) whose purpose is initially unknown. He is the champion of the Tournament of Champions, has massive strength, a dedicated disposition, and wields a powerful spear. It is revealed that he is created by Myria. As Myria is destroyed, he says his goodbyes and turns to stone. Garr, as you would think, is a powerful warrior, capable of causing massive damage with his spear. On the downside, he is very slow, and not very effective casting magic (even though he gains fire magic as he levels up). He also has a resistance to fire.</li>

<p>The game begins with two men, Gary and Mogu,(a reference to two playable characters from Breath of Fire one [where Gary was "Bo" in the US], working in Duana Mine, setting up explosives to reveal a young dragon that was apparently sealed in the middle of the Chrysm, still very much alive. The men confront the dragon, but are soon burned alive by it. The dragon, very confused, starts wandering the mine, killing all that get in its way with its fire breath, or Whelp Breath as the game dubs it. It is impossible for the player to actually lose any of these fights as the little dragon counter-attacks with Whelp Breath even if the player takes no offensive actions. Eventually, the little dragon encounters an ox-like man and gets into a fight with him, a crane and its operator to his side. Right before the little dragon attacks the man with his Whelp Breath, a voice that says, "No! Stop!" stops the little dragon from attacking, resulting in the crane bashing against his head, knocking him out.</p>
<p>It can then be seen that the little dragon is put into a cage and transported by train to an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>While hunting in a forest known as Cedar Woods, a local thief named Rei loses his prey because of some loud noises. Upon investigating, he finds an unconscious nude boy with blue hair being attacked by several wild animals. After taking care of the animals, Rei struggles with an internal debate as to what to do with the child. Despite the lack of food from the bad harvest of the year, he takes the child back to his hideout where he confers with his companion Teepo. Teepo is a child about the size of Ryu with long purple hair. At first Teepo thinks this boy, Ryu, is dinner. Rei informs him of the actual situation, and Teepo draws a parallel to how he was found by Rei. Teepo is already cast as a clear foil to Ryu's character. Ryu is placed upstairs where he sleeps in a bed while Rei and Teepo head to town in an attempt to steal food. While sleeping, Ryu encounters an angelic figure (later found to be Myria, the goddess Ryu seeks in the second half of the game) who speaks to him as though he were her child. He also encounters a man with long purple hair (later revealed to be an older Teepo) who tells him that Ryu is different from humans.</p>
<p>Ryu awakens from his dream to find the house empty, so he ventures into the local village in the hopes of finding anything. After reaching the small farming village, McNeil Village, he encounters Rei and Teepo, who are currently attempting to pillage different people's houses. Upon seeing him, Teepo calls Ryu by his name although they have never spoken. This foreshadows the deep relationship between Teepo and Ryu as they are both part of the nearly extinct dragon race known as the Brood. Seeing as Ryu is dressed in nothing more than a sheet, Rei quickly runs into the weapon store and steals some clothes and a sword for Ryu. After Ryu gets dressed, Rei and Teepo decide to head to Yrall Road in an attempt to mug people and procure food for the night. Once there, a humorous scene ensues where Teepo shoves Ryu into the next person coming down the road despite Ryu's silent protests. He runs into a woodsman, Bunyan who suspects that Rei and Teepo have something to do with this, but he continues on his way. Rei and Teepo then decide to go to Bunyan's house since he is clearly not home in the attempt to find food. After exploring the house, Bunyan returns and manages to tie up all three companions after knocking each one out. Despite his actions, it is clear from his words that he wants to help the boys, so he puts them to work. He first sends Rei up to Mt. Glauss to deal with a monster known as the Nue, which has been terrorizing the villagers in its attempts to find food as well. He has Teepo and Ryu stay behind and chop wood, but as soon as they finish they hurry off to Mt. Glauss to help Rei.</p>
<p>After climbing the mountain, they find a small cottage at the top where Rei is resting. Teepo updates Rei on the situation with Bunyan. Rei is glad to see them, but he alludes to something he can no longer do because Teepo and Ryu are now with him (this is his ability to turn into a weretiger, which is revealed later in the story). Together the three fight the <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nue.html" title="Nue">Nue</a>, which they badly injure, chasing it into the caverns of the mountain. After following the blood trail, they jump into the subterranean river and find the nue defending a cave. They finish it off, and discover what it was protecting. The dead bodies of its children are strewn across the ground; they had died from starvation a long time ago. The three solemnly reflect over what has happened. The nue's situation is a clear reflection of their own predicament. Both the nue and the boys were faced with the struggle of finding food to survive. In killing the nue, they symbolically cast off their roles as outcasts, and kill that aspect of themselves which steals and the part of them the villagers hate. Once at the base of the mountain, they encounter Bunyan. Rei accuses him of knowing that he knew the nue was only looking after its young. Bunyan responds with a question, asking that if they knew that, would they not have killed it anyway.</p>
<p>After this encounter, time passes and spring comes to the land, and the villagers once again have plentiful amounts of food. One morning Teepo askes Rei if they could go into town. While Rei doesn't want to appear boastful over slaying the nue, he agrees to Teepo's proposition with some skepticism. As the three make their way into town, they are confronted by the entire village. As Rei had thought, Teepo had told the people they were coming, but instead of being greeted with scorn they are welcomed into society. They are told that they will no longer have to steal for food. After the scene has ended, they are approached by a cagey looking man named Loki, who is covered in his green robe so they cannot see his face. He tells them to meet him in a barn down the road to discuss something with him. Once in the barn, Loki discusses the mayor with the three. He accuses the mayor of being too greedy, having taken too much money from the villagers. He proposes to Rei, Teepo, and Ryu that they go to the mayor's mansion and steal back the money he took from the villagers. The boys agree to this plan, since they believe it will make them even more popular with the townspeople.</p>
<p>Later that night, they sneak into the mansion's grounds after knocking over a part of the wall which had not been fully repaired. While in the grounds, they encounter a series of lax guards who are mostly bought off with bribes in exchange for not revealing Rei, Teepo and Ryu. Through a series of clever actions to distract different guards and appease others, they manage to find an entrance to the mansion. In order to gain entry, Rei distracts the guards so they chase after him while Ryu and Teepo sneak in. While in the mansion, the boys encounter the ghosts of past McNeils as they battle their way to the roof. After all of the ghosts are defeated, they discuss their losses and decide that the current McNeil is not up to the task of defeating the boys. Meanwhile, Ryu and Teepo find Rei relaxing on the roof, and Teepo chides Rei for being lazy while he and Ryu were fighting their way through all different types of enemies. Rei apologizes, and the boys continue on. They find the rope Rei had brought and use it to form a path across the different rooftops. After another humorous scene, the boys descend to find the mayor, McNeil chasing a prostitute around his room. The boys announce their plans to McNeil, and the ghosts of the former McNeils come in. After forming a ghost known as Amalgam Mcniel the boys fight it, and manage to destroy the spirits. The humor continues as the prostitute admonishes McNeil for being a coward and runs out. The boys take the money back and distribute it throughout the village by leaving the money on the villagers' doorsteps.</p>
<p>The following morning, Teepo suggests that they go into the village again to see how the people liked getting all their money back. However, the villagers are quite shocked at what has happened. Most are angry and have returned their money for fear of reprisal from the mayor. The boys don't understand this reaction so they confront Loki, who does his best to dodge them. He tells them to meet him in the same barn in a couple minutes, but he doesn't show. Instead, Bunyan comes in with a cow he plans to milk. He then indirectly begins to fill Rei in about what has happened by prefacing what he says as just him speaking to the cow. He tells the boys that McNeil was actually involved with a pretty serious gang that would take revenge on whoever took the money. Rei realizes that it is time for him, Teepo, and Ryu to leave or their lives could be in danger. They decide to head back to the house once more before setting off. However, when they arrive the house is engulfed in flames. Standing outside are two horsemen, Balio and Sunder. They have come to take vengeance on the punk kids who stole from their gang.</p>
<p>The battle that ensues is both very pivotal and highly controversial. The fight is pivotal because it shows the absolute breakdown of the trio. They have lost their home, and after the fight they have lost each other. Each is once again alone in the world. Their diverging paths however eventually do meet again, with each of the characters changed greatly. The fight itself is also highly controversial. The official strategy guide for the game says that it is possible to win this very difficult fight, but all attempts to do so have failed. It is believed that the caption that states this was mistakenly placed in the wrong area because there is a fight later in which it is possible to win against the two, but you don't have to win. The attempts to actually win the fight have been well documented, and the total damage administered to the horse Balio has reached into the millions before the console was turned off in frustration. Furthermore, if one looks at the actual coding of the game, Balio and Sunder are just sprites that your characters can attack; their HP levels cannot be changed through attacks.</p>
<p>When Ryu awakens, he is in Bunyan's care. Bunyan tells him that Ryu was the only one he found, as Rei and Teepo are presumed dead. Ryu wastes no time preparing to go off in an attempt to find them. He remembers that Rei had always planned to go to Wyndia when they had made a big enough name for themselves. One of the main themes of friendship is demonstrated strongly in the camping scenes. Up until now, Ryu had friends to talk to, but now that he is alone, the silence is tangible. The idea of friendship is one of the most integral parts of the story.</p>
<p>The first step towards Wyndia requires that Ryu traverses the Myrneg mountain. Once he reaches the summit, he encounters Balio and Sunder once more. After a short scene where Sunder is convinced that Ryu is a ghost, Balio arrives on the scene and investigates Ryu before Sunder stabs him from behind. As he lays there on the ground, Ryu once again transforms into the whelp dragon form. Balio and Sunder realize the value of finding a dragon, since they were thought to be a long extinct race. They decide to deliver the dragon to the king of Wyndia in the hopes of receiving a reward. After caging and covering the dragon, they go to the castle of Wyndia to deliver their treasure to the court. However, once the cover has been drawn back all that sits in the cage is a boy with blue hair. Despite their efforts, the boy does not retransform. The king is disgusted by what he sees as a vicious prank and throws all three of the criminals into the castle jail. The princess, Nina, takes note of what has happened and feels bad for the boy.</p>
<p>When he awakens, Ryu is in a cell, with Balio and Sunder a few cells down. The girl Nina comes to visit Ryu to see if he is alright. While there, Balio and Sunder convince her they are very sorry for what they had done. She lets them out, and immediately they knock her out. A ransomed princess will certainly yield a lot of money. Upon hearing of what is going on, Ryu manages to break free of his cell by ramming the door repeatedly. After chasing after the fleeing Balio and Sunder, he fights them once more (this fight is the fight that is possible to win). Whether the player wins or not, the result is the same (but by winning you can net a broad sword and asbestos armour). The princess manages to escape while you distract them, and they flee the castle. In order to get you out of the castle, Nina elects to sneak you through the underground catacombs of the castle. After making their way through the caves, the pair emerges in the burial ground of the Wyndian royal family. Ryu explains that he is looking for his friends Rei and Teepo and Nina wants to help, so they explore the town of Wyndia together. After talking to other kids and playing them in hide and seek, Ryu is no closer to finding his friends. He moves the search to Eygnock Road. There is one house on this road, and as Ryu enters he hears Nina scream outside. Talking to the elderly couple that lives there, they vaguely refer to a child who stopped there (the boy being Teepo). Once Ryu goes outside, Balio and Sunder are there to knock him out.</p>
<p>Then the pair is taken to the city of Genmel, Balio and Sunder leave the children and are to be watched by an alcoholic bartender named Fahl. The two are able to sneak away from Fahl after he has had a couple drinks. The pair then go north towards a mountain, where they meet two men at the top. The men offer to let them stay in their house until morning. when they wake up they hear Sunder talking with the two men and decide it's time to escape. Ryu and Nina see a lift in the men's backyard and get on it just in time. When they get to the other side of the mountain Sunder is there to meet them. The only way to escape is to jump off the mountain. Ryu forfeits his body to save Nina's life and then has the dragon gene: Defender. The two walk out safely.</p>
<p>The first thing they see when they get outside is a tower. they go in the tower and eventually find a nerdy girl named Momo, who joins your team. You then have to solve some puzzles to get to the top of the tower, once you get there you can take the escape rocket that Momo's dead father made before he died.</p>
<p>Once outside the tower you go to a coffee shop and learn that Balio and Sunder have blocked the road leading to Wyndia. Then you see Momo's dead father's friend Doctor Palet, he tells you that he needs Momo's help at the plant her late father built, and she agrees to help him. When you get to the plant Doctor Palet tells you he needs you to dispose of some kind of mutant plant at the dump. When you go to dispose of the plant you learn that it can talk just like a human, but it starts attacking you so you have to kill it. After the fight the monster tells you that he's sorry for attacking you and that he thinks he deserves to be disposed of. You then toss him in a giant pool of lava, and he thanks you by leaving you his son, Peco.</p>
<p>You go back to the plant and tell Doctor Palet that you got rid of it and he says thanks, and that he knows a way for you to get back in to Wyndia. His plan is to put you in a wheel barrow with goods and whatnot so they won't see you. After they leave, Palet reveals that he really didn't want to hide them; he simply wanted to remove them so they wouldn't reveal the problem at the dump. It doesn't work, Balio and Sunder find Ryu and his friends and take them back to Genmel(the place where Fahl was watching you). When you're there you learn about the tournament of champions that is held in that city, and that the winner gets whatever they want, so you enter. Balio and Sunder keep either Momo or Peco hostage (it's your choice).</p>
<p>The first two fights in the Tournament of champions are preliminary matches and are easy. Then you get to the finals and must fight Garr, he is impossible to kill so you lose. He knows that Ryu is a dragon and would like to talk to him, and he knows that Balio and Sunder were going to do bad stuff to them, so his choice for his prize is Ryu and his friends.</p>
<p>As you're walking with Garr to Wyndia you see a bunch of Balio and Sunder's men. Then you must fight Balio and Sunder's transformed selves (stallion). After you've killed them then you are free to go to Wyndia. Back in Wyndia the King and the Queen (Nina's parents) are relieved to see that Nina is alive and well. They give you a passport that is needed to go to Rhapala. Nina is faced with a dilemma, does she stay there and listen to her parents, or does sneak out and help Ryu? She chooses Ryu. You then go to Rhapala.</p>
<p>Rhapala is a port town.</p>
<p>When Ryu arrives at Rhapala, it appears that the ship, which the party need's to travel east, has not yet returned. After talking with Sinkar, the Guildmaster, you learn that the road is also blocked, thus leaving you effectively stranded. The Lighthouse is broken, and fixing it would probably get the ship to come back. After talking with Shadis (Sinkar's Daughter) and Beyd (Guild Bookkeeper), you learn that Beyd is in love with Shadis, but is to afraid to tell her, as she is already engaged with Zig, the toughest sailor in Rhapala. Shadis needs a strong husband, so that he can continue the Guild when Sinkar retires. Nina gets an idea to train Beyd to make him stronger, so that he can go in and fix the lighthouse and marry Shadis. So after training Beyd sufficiently, Beyd is ready to go into the lighthouse. However Zig overhears this and challenges Beyd to a duel. (You are not allowed to help Beyd, but can do so in secret when Zig is not looking). After defeating Zig, Shadis falls for Beyd. But Beyd is in no condition to go in the lighthouse. So you go instead. At the top of the lighthouse, you defeat Gazer, and fix the light. As soon as you turn it on however, a faerie comes swoooping down on you, outraged that you turned on the light. It gives you a faerie tiara and tells you to go to their village. With the ship still due back in sometime, you go to the ring of flowers and, with the power of the faerie tiara, you enter the faerie village.</p>
<p>When in the faerie village, you learn that the faeries kept the light off was because of a monster that didn't like the light and ate the faeries. You offer to defeat the monster, and so go to the beach and wait for nightfall. When nightfall arrives, you see a pink fin swimming in the water. Momo attacks it, but it turns out to be a harmless dolphin. Nina and Momo decide to go ask the faeries if the dolphin is the monster they are looking for. When they are gone, the dolphin accosts Ryu. Nina and Momo return with the faeries, and the faeries say that that is the monster. The faeries call the monster names, and this causes the dolphin to not be so harmless and transform into a giant dolphin. You defeat it.</p>
<p>After this, you can rebuild faerie village, which can be quite useful. Once you leave faerie village, you go back to Rhapala. The boat is still not in, so you have to go through Mt. Zublo, a volcano. Near the end of the volcano, you are attacked by a strange, dribbling man babbling about revenge. He summons up two lava snake-robot things. You defeat them. You are then in the east. You go to The Urkan Tapa, a very religious village. Garr goes to talk to the village elder, and they talk about you. When you leave the Urkan Tapa, Ryu and Garr start talking about why Ryu is going to die, but then Garr says never mind.</p>
