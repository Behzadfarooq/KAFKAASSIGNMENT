	    <p>I was born in a suburb of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. My family moved to a satellite city, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrie_%28Ontario%29_ee08.html" title="Barrie (Ontario)">Barrie</a>, when I was five, and I was soon living a pretty free and easy life, aside from doing chores and being restricted from over-indulging in Saturday morning cartoons, the staple of my generation's youth.</p>
<p>A precocious and independent-minded youngster, I quickly learned that my insatiable appetite for new ideas was not shared by everyone. I learned to learn on my own, becoming an avid reader fairly early. I read widely and sporadically, but with a significant weakness for <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a>, especially stories and predictions about the future. I discovered <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._R._Tolkien_236d.html" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> in grade seven, and fell in love with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>, especially works by <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Niven_d1bb.html" title="Larry Niven">Larry Niven</a>.</p>
<p>Barrie was a somewhat strange place to live, rather culturally wanting, so I made do with riding my bike, hanging out in abandoned farmers fields and wood lots (in the Summer), playing <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colecovision.html" title="Colecovision">Colecovision</a> at Towers and working at a paper route (which gained me a brief notoriety) and later assisting at a local convenience store. I continued to read and do well in school without effort. I was enrolled in a gifted program which started to intrigue me regarding academics, but not seriously. My pattern of co-dependent, passive aggressive relations with school was settling in. I developed a tendency to become infatuated with some pretty girl whom I would idolize and view with awe approaching terror. (I later consoled myself that James Joyce had a similar affectation.)</p>
<p>My family moved again when I was fifteen, closer to "the big smoke" (as the outlying regions like to call Toronto), to a new house in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markham%2C_Ontario_22ac.html" title="Markham, Ontario">Markham</a>. Soon after, my dad got laid off from his job with Rothman's Tobacco, and things became a bit strained. I withdrew into my personal interests -- <a href="../../../b/m/x/BMX_aa44.html" title="BMX">BMX</a> bikes and, in 1987, my <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> 500 computer and its games. I continued to devour science fiction and do well in science and math, though somewhat poorly in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> and humanities. I toyed with drawing and learned about <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_design.html" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typography.html" title="Typography">typography</a>. I found an interest in <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, especially <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediaeval.html" title="Mediaeval">mediaeval</a> <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castles</a>.</p>
<p>I went to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, Scarborough Campus, starting in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. After abandoning the idea of architecture studies, for which I felt ill-suited for lack of a portfolio, I rather impulsively chose <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> and specifically <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysics.html" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. I quickly ran into trouble with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratory.html" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> work. I spent my quality time playing <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_21fa.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and participating in a creative writing group. After two years floundering, failing, and procrastinating, I took a year off to take a depressing job in a bookstore in a decaying shopping mall. I had moved out of my parents' when I started second year in college, but had to move home again. School was better, so I went back and started over, switching to a humanities program.</p>
<p>I did well in English courses, and by third year (fifth including the two lost years) I was planning a specialist major in English literature and criticism, dropping my minors in art studio and humanities. Amusingly, I began to feel a sort of longing for science, especially computers, which I became more exposed to in my year-long tenure at the student newspaper, doing editorial and layout work on the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macs</a>. I toyed with the idea of journalism, but felt it was too gritty. I decided I would be a writer. I continued to fall in love with girls, except now they had boyfriends. It would be another year before I would learn to not let that stop me, a morally ambivalent decision.</p>
<p>I moved away from home again, this time for good, when James, my former roommate, returned from his time in the U.S. acquiring a teaching certificate. We got a good place closer to downtown which gave us better exposure to the city's cultural and business environments. I got a job in a more interesting book store, a sort of curse I laid on myself I guess, eventually graduating into a series of bookstores and a fit of despair about my purpose in life vis a vis authorship. I had a brief, soul-destroying affair to aggravate my condition of self-absorbed nihilistic existential anxiety. It was all very silly, although I still have stress-induced flare-ups. (I now try to keep them in check with my personal weblog/diary.)</p>
<p>While mired in the poverty of bookstore employment, I had one benefit: free book borrowing priveleges. You cannot get current computer books at the library, but I had access to everything I cared to read about programming languages and operating systems, and, to my credit, I took full advantage. James bought a low-end Macintosh, which I proceeded to explore scientifically, learning all about system extensions, file types, and other rigamarole, and later, how to program it. I leveraged this knowledge into a significant career move: I got a job selling Macs at a local boutique. My income tripled virtually overnight, and I was able to soon pay back my defaulted student loans, returning me to a state of financial respectibility (though I was still practically poor, with the size of the payments).</p>
<p>Of course, once I had paid my debt to the government, what choice did I have but to do the whole thing all over again? Oh, right, I could have just gotten a programming job -- it was the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> after all, before the tech crash. But no, I went back to school, this time at <a href="../../../r/y/e/Ryerson_University_318f.html" title="Ryerson University">Ryerson University</a>, for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a>. I am now in my fourth year. It has had its ups and downs, but I'm sticking with it, and intend to become a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmer.html" title="Programmer">programmer</a>/<a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_engineer.html" title="Software engineer">software engineer</a> and work on one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>end-user applications</li>
<li>games</li>
<li>operating systems/system libraries</li>
<li>artificial intelligence systems</li>
</ul>
<p>I graduate (for the second time, yikes) in May 2004, if all goes well, and begin my search for gainful programming employment, in a much less attractive atmosphere than existed four years ago. I have already acquired some significant experience, producing a specialized image viewing tool for use by astronomers studying survey images of galactic clusters. This is to be open sourced and placed on <a href="http://sourceforge.net" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">SourceForge</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>Now I'm just this guy who likes to mess around on the wiki, hopefully in a beneficial way for y'all.</p>
