<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_Behan_846a.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Though Brendan's life was short, it was certainly not without mileage. He was born in the inner city of Dublin into an educated working class family. The house the Behan family lived in belonged to his grandmother English, who owned a number of properties in the area. His father Stephen, a house painter who had been active in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_War_of_Independence_d28c.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>, read classic literature to the children at bedtime from diverse sources such as Zola, Glasworthy and Maupassant; while his mother Kathleen took them on literary tours of the city. If Brendan's interest in literature came from his father, then his political prejudices were injected by his mother. Brendan said: "Only a deaf mute could be reared by my mother and be unable to catalogue England's misdemeanours from Africa backwards." She remained politically active all her life, and was a personal friend of the famed Irish republican Michael Collins. Brendan recanted how when his father was in jail for republican activities his mother met Collins on the Liffey Bridge, when he was-at that time-the most wanted man in Ireland. Hearing of her plight he gave her twenty pounds-a gesture that Brendan's mother never forgot. Brendan wrote a lament to Collins: "The Laughing Boy", at the age of thirteen. The title was derived from the affectionate name Mrs Behan gave Collins. She published her acclaimed autobiography "Mother of All The Behans", a collaboration with her son Brian, in 1984. Behan's uncle Peadar Kearney wrote the Irish national anthem <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amhr%C3%A1n_na_bhFiann_af80.html" title="Amhrán na bhFiann">A Soldier's Song</a>. His brother, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Behan_aa5c.html" title="Dominic Behan">Dominic Behan</a>, was also a renowned songwriter most famous for the rebel song The Patriot Game, while another sibling, Brian Behan, was a prominent radical political activist and public speaker, actor, author and playwright.</p>
<p>He developed his taste for drink from his granny English, and knew what it was like to be inebriated well before his teens. His biographer Ulick O'Connor recalls one day, at the age of eight, he was returning home with his granny and a crony from a drinking session. A passer-by remarked: "Oh, my! Isn't it terrible ma'am to see such a beautiful child deformed?" "How dare you", said his granny, "he's not deformed, he's just drunk!"</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen, Behan left school to follow his father's footsteps in the house painting business.</p>

<p>In 1937, the family moved to a new local authority housing scheme in <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crumlin%2C_Dublin_ed03.html" title="Crumlin, Dublin">Crumlin</a>. Here, Behan became a member of <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_%C3%89ireann_69e1.html" title="Fianna Éireann">Fianna Éireann</a>, the youth organization of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_%281922-1969%29_80f4.html" title="Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)">IRA</a> and published his first poems and prose in the organization's magazine <i>Fianna: the Voice of Young Ireland</i>. He was also the youngest contributor to be published in the `Irish Press` when a poem of his entitled: "Reply of Young Boy to Pro-English verses" was published in 1931. At the age of sixteen, (in 1939), he joined the IRA and embarked on an unauthorised solo mission to England to blow up Liverpool docks. There he was arrested in possession of explosives. He was sentenced to three years in a reform school (or <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borstal.html" title="Borstal">Borstal</a> in British English) (see his autobiography "<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borstal_Boy_6f2c.html" title="Borstal Boy">Borstal Boy</a>") and did not return to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> until 1941. In 1942, during the timeframe leading to the IRA's <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Campaign_%28IRA%29_066c.html" title="Northern Campaign (IRA)">Northern Campaign</a> Behan was tried for the attempted murder of two detectives in Dublin while at a commemoration ceremony for Wolfe Tone-the father of Irish Republicanism. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison he was incarcerated in Mountjoy and the Curragh-experiences which he relayed in "Confessions Of An Irish Rebel". Released under a general amnesty for Republicans in 1946, his "military" career was over by the age of twenty-three. Aside for a short prison sentence that he received in 1947 for his part in trying to break a fellow republican out from a Manchester jail, he effectively left the IRA, though he remained great friends with the future Chief-Of-Staff Cathal Goulding.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_Behan_846a.html" title="Edit section: Behan the writer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Behan the writer</span></h3>
<p>Behan's prison experiences were central to his future writing career. In Mountjoy he wrote his first play, <i>The Landlady</i> and also began to write short stories and other prose. Some of this work was published in <i>The Bell</i>, the leading Irish literary magazine of the time. He also learned Irish in prison and after his release in 1946, he spent some time in the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaeltacht.html" title="Gaeltacht">Gaeltacht</a> areas of <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Galway_ba18.html" title="County Galway">Galway</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Kerry_4b36.html" title="County Kerry">Kerry</a>, where he started writing poetry in Irish. He left Ireland and all its perceived social pressures to live in Paris in the early 1950s. There he felt he could lose himself and release the artist within. Although he still drank heavily, he managed to earn a living, ostensibly by writing pornography. By the time he returned to Ireland he had become a writer who drank a lot, rather than a drinker who talked about what he was going to write. He had also developed the knowledge that in order to succeed he would have to discipline himself. Throughout the majority of his writing career he would rise at seven in the morning and work until 12 noon-when the pubs opened. He began to write for various newspapers such as The Irish Times and radio, where a play entitled "The Leaving Party" was broadcast. Additionally, he cultivated a reputation for himself as carouser-in-chief and swayed shoulder-to-shoulder with other literati of the day: Brian O'Nolan, Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, JP Donleavey. For reasons unknown he had a major fall-out with Kavanagh, who reportedly at the mere mention of Behan's name would visibly shudder. He referred to him as "evil incarnate". Amid all the merrymaking though Brendan sensed that he hadn't wrote anything of significance and feared the boozer would eclipse the writer. Nearly five years after his return his literary niche had yet to be carved.</p>
<p>That changed though with his major breakthrough in 1954 with the play "The Quare Fellow", (Irish slang for "condemned man"). Originally called "The Twisting of Another Rope" and influenced by his time spent in jail, it chronicles the viccisitudes of prison life leading up to the execution of the "the quare fellow"-a character who is never seen. The "prison" dialogue is vivid and laced with satire but reveals to the reader the human detritus that surrounds corporal punishment. It was produced in the Pike Theatre in Dublin. The play ran for six months. In May 1956, <i>The Quare Fellow</i> opened in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre_Royal_Stratford_East_0264.html" title="Theatre Royal Stratford East">Theatre Royal Stratford East</a>, in a production by <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Littlewood_d677.html" title="Joan Littlewood">Joan Littlewood</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre_Workshop_ba5a.html" title="Theatre Workshop">Theatre Workshop</a>. Subsequently it transferred to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_theatre_47e0.html" title="West End theatre">West End theatre</a>. Behan generated immense publicity for "The Quare Fellow" when appearing drunk on the Malcolm Muggeridge show. The English, unaccustomed to drunken authors, took him to their hearts . A fellow guest on the show the American actor Jackie Gleason reportedly said about the incident: "It wasn't an act of God but an act of Guinness!". Behan and Gleason went on to forge a friendship. Brendan loved the story of how walking along the street in London, shortly after this episode, a Cockney approached him and exclaimed that he understood every word he had said-drunk or not-but hadn't a clue what that "bugger Muggeridge was on about!" Brendan while addled would clamber on stage and recite the play's signature tune "The Auld Triangle". The transfer of the play to Broadway provided Behan with an international recognition.</p>
<p>In 1957, his Irish language play, <i>An Giall</i> (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hostage_%28play%29_dbb2.html" title="The Hostage (play)">The Hostage</a></i>) opened in the Damer Theatre. It remains one of the most damning indictments of the IRA ever presented on stage. Reminiscent of Frank O'Connor's "Guests of The Nation" it portrays the capture of a British soldier who is being held in exchange for the release of a imprisoned IRA volunteer. This soldier though falls in love with an Irish girl Teresa. Their innocent world of love is incongrous among their surroundings-the play was set in a brothel. The soldier incredulously feels until the end that he won't be executed and will survive to marry Teresa. Tragically he dies revealing to the reader the human cost of war-a universal suffering. One of Brendan's former comrades referred to him as "a chancer". No doubt, if the play had been written by any other writer repurcussions would have visited the perpetrator. His autobiographical novel <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Borstal_Boy_6f2c.html" title="Borstal Boy">Borstal Boy</a></i> followed in 1958, and remains forever his masterpiece. Kenneth Tynan, a 1950s literary critic said: "While other writers horde words like misers, Behan sends them out on a spree, ribald, flushed and spoiling for a fight." He was now established as one of the leading Irish writers of his generation.</p>
<p>As his fame grew so too did his alcohol consumption. Brendan saw that it paid him to be drunk, as the public wanted the witty, iconoclastic, genial "froth of a boy". And Brendan gave it to them in abundance. He staggered through the drunken hoops held out to him exclaiming: "There's no bad publicity except an obituary." His health suffered terribly with diabetic comas and seizures occurring with frightening regularity. Towards the end he became the caricature of the drunken Irishman. The public who once extended their arms now closed ranks against him; publicans with ignominy flung him from their premises; and former friends tired of his ancedotes and stories finding him a bore. Although Brendan cried out he was a writer, inside he knew his fears had materialised-he was unable to generate another classic. His last two books "Brendan Behan's Island" and "Brendan Behan's New York" were talk books and can't be compared to his former works-they were littered with pretentiousness and sycophancy, something which he wouldn't have tolerated earlier: "As Norman Mailer said to me......" Arthur Miller came up to me..." "One day with Groucho Marx...."</p>
<p>Amid the chaos he married Beatrice Salkeld (the daughter of painter Cecil Salkeld) in 1961. They had a daughter Blanaid, born in 1963. Love wasn't enough though to drag him back from his alcoholic abyss.</p>
<p>By early March 1964 the end was in sight. Collapsing at the Harbour Lights bar, he was transferred to Meath Hospital, and never re-surfaced. On March 20, the bawdy, boisterous boy who clung to the whiskey bottle never did make it home.</p>
<p>Anecdotes.</p>
<p>Brendan's life is swamped in stories and anecdotes-both true and fiction. For those who criticised his drinking he exclaimed: "Where I came from to get enough to eat was an achievement, to get enough to get drunk was a victory."</p>
<p>To accusations that the IRA court-martialled him: "Yes, I was court-martialled in my absence, sentenced to death in my absence, so I said go ahead and shoot me...in my absence!"</p>
<p>Another occasion saw him enter a priest's house, badly shaking with alcohol withdrawl and gasping for a "cure". The priest provided him with a little whiskey in a glass, exhorting that providing him with it was like "tapping a nail into your coffin". Behan reportedly looked at the meagre amount and said: "You wouldn't mind giving the nail another tap would you father?"</p>
<p>Behan was perhaps the most famous Irish writer of his time, and was once hired to write an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising_slogan.html" title="Advertising slogan">advertising slogan</a> for <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a>. As part of his payment for this, the company offered him half a dozen kegs of their <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stout.html" title="Stout">stout</a>. After a month the company asked Behan what he had come up with; Behan had already managed to drink all of the beer they had given him and produced the slogan <i>Guinness Makes You Drunk</i>. Erroneously, he is also sometimes credited with "Guinness is Good for You", which was actually written by <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_L._Sayers_bb9e.html" title="Dorothy L. Sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>.</p>

<p>Behan found fame difficult to deal with. He had long been a heavy drinker (describing himself, on one occasion, as "a drinker with a writing problem" and claiming "I only drink on two occasions - when I'm thirsty and when I'm not") and developed diabetes in the early 1960s. This combination resulted in a series of notoriously drunken public appearances, on both stage and television. His last two works: "Brendan Behan's Ireland" and "Brendan Behan's New York" were tape-recorded, a device which Brendan hated, preferring to write or type his words. Bad health though dictated different. He died, aged 41, in the Meath Hospital, Dublin, and was buried in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasnevin_Cemetery_75b9.html" title="Glasnevin Cemetery">Glasnevin Cemetery</a>. He received a Republican funeral.</p>
<p>Renowned for his legendary wit his last words were said to be to a nun: "May all your sons be bishops."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
