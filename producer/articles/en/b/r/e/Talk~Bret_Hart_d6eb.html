<p>It is stated that his ex-wife Julie is attending the Hall of Fame ceremony. Surely this is a mistake? Why would he attend with his ex-wife and not his current wife?</p>
<p>So what? Are Italians barred from attending the Hall of Fame induction ceremony?</p>
<p>Did the United States stop issuing entry visas or something? In fact, she doesn't even need one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#Eligible_countries" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#Eligible_countries" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#Eligible_countries</a>. Moreover, his current wife may hold a green card by marriage to Bret (who is also a US citizen). Do you have a source that his ex-wife is attending?</p>
<p>Your argument makes no sense. Julie is estranged from Bret, so the fact she was "around" during WWF career is irrelevant. Harry Smith on the other hand is a blood relation. I ask again, do you have a source that his ex-wife is attending? (and what you "believe" does not count as a source.)</p>
<p>Gosh you are real witchy about stuff aren't you?! Well you can be obsessed with Bret Hart all you want to be because it is stupid to be this way! <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Mar.23,2006</p>
<p>Do you have a source that says that Julie is estranged from Bret?! Because on her website it seems like they have a good relationship with each other so what source did you get this from? And by the way I haven't heard nor read that anyone is coming with him except for Harry Smith and I don't even think that is completely true.(<a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> 23 March 2006</p>
<p>I'm obsessed? You're the one making up factually incorrect statements about him. Divorce= Dissolution of marriage= estranged.</p>
<p>Just because they are divorced doesn't mean that they don't have a great relationship with each other! Estranged means that they are alienated from each other and I haven't read anything that says that they don't talk to each other. Neither one of them have said that their divorce was ugly so I ask again do you have a source that says that they are not on speaking terms with each other? I haven't find anything yet. And by the way I'm not the one who started the rumor in the first place, I just tried to help it out. You act like people can't make mistakes. Gosh. <a href="../../../m/g/t/User%7EMgTurtle_b391.html" title="User:MgTurtle">User:MgTurtle</a> Mar.24,2006.</p>
<p>Julie Hart has confirmed that she will be attending the Hall of Fame ceremony with her and Bret's four children. And Harry Smith has been confirmed to be attending the Hall of fame ceremony as well.

<p>First, could we please see the source of these interviews where Hart admits to being emotionally volatile?</p>
<p>Second, Hart did not change his mind about the DVD set because of being "emotionally volatile." He decided he wanted his side of the story told rather than having it told for him. That's not being "volatile." It's much more likely he simply decided to start letting go of a years-old feud with the company. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcarlson33_70ca.html" title="User:Bcarlson33">Bcarlson33</a> 22:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already seen this link. It directly contradicts the "emotionally volatile" explanation. Bret clearly states that his relationship with the company changed because Vince made a point of calling him while he was recovering from his stroke. "Emotionally volatile" does not belong in the section in question. It's unwise to assume that I don't read sources, or to lecture me about basic points of fact about those sources. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcarlson33_70ca.html" title="User:Bcarlson33">Bcarlson33</a> 20:43, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"I'm not expecting to do the Hall of Fame. Maybe some time or some day, but I just feel, maybe it's because of my stroke, but I don't feel like I'm ready for that yet". This just after he stated that "For me, with my stroke, I have a lot of trouble with emotional issues in the sense that if something is pulling at my heat strings, I can't control my emotions. I can have these heartfelt moments and the tears can come, and for me, it's very draining, very uncomfortable to find yourself fighting back tears all the time." It is important to note that Hart was (initially, at least) unwilling to be inducted due to his stroke and the issues arising from it. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 22:40, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two things. First, those quotes sound as if he's saying he's not sure he'd be able to handle the rush of emotions that would inevitably result from his induction into the HoF. While that certainly involves Bret's emotional state, it's a very different thing than saying he changes his mind because of emotional volatility. Being "volatile" implies he changes his mind randomly because he's mentally unstable. These quotes directly contradict that; it would be more accurate to say he claimed he wouldn't be emotionally ready to handle being inducted.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, and more importantly, chalking this up to emotions neglects the much longer story of Bret's relationship with Vince McMahon and the WWF/E. Bret has had "Montreal" as a main menu link on his website for years, and has mentioned the event in essentially every interview he's done since it happened. Bret's mixed feelings over the WWF/E date back before his stroke, when he would publicly bring up his anger over Montreal yet privately encourage WCW wrestlers like Chris Benoit that they needed to jump to the WWF to truly "make it." Every action Bret takes regarding WWF/E needs to be viewed through the lens of his history with the company, and his decision to be inducted into the HoF after initially saying no is certainly no exception. Bret himself alludes to this in both the interview you cited above and <a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/02/15/1444277.html" class="external text" title="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/02/15/1444277.html" rel="nofollow">an interview with Slam Wrestling</a>: "Vince McMahon called me up when I had my stroke in 2002, and I think that was a big step towards where we are now. I always appreciated the fact that he called me and that softened a lot of the bad feelings between us." <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcarlson33_70ca.html" title="User:Bcarlson33">Bcarlson33</a> 01:49, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've added my site to the external links, but it keeps getting removed. It is the only regularly updated Bret Hart dedicated website on the web, even more so than BretHart.com, therefore I feel its relevant to be there, as it holds more information on Bret than any of the other sites listed. I understand if any of you guys want it removed, but please take the time to visit the page, and maybe even feeding back in my forum as to why you disagree, if you do remove it. I must also point out, that the site is non-profit and I only have it running so Bret fans can find out about the Hitman, and join a community of avid likeminded fans. Cheers guys! Kevin Smith</p>

<dd>I don't speak for everyone on Wikipedia, but I think that there needs to be a general consensus to keep a fan site on the external links. Especially considering it was a self posting. <a href="../../../t/v/3/User%7ETv316_cbb8.html" title="User:Tv316">tv316</a> 13:29, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, can you explain what you mean by general consensus?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I mean that a majority of the people in the Wikipedia community (who at least visit this article} need to decide among each other if it should go on as an external link. <a href="../../../t/v/3/User%7ETv316_cbb8.html" title="User:Tv316">tv316</a> 15:50, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, sounds like a good idea to me! You had a look at the site yourself? Whats your opinion? Do you think its relevant?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that your site is a nice fan site for Bret Hart fans (myself included). The problem with linking to it here is that all of the information on your site can be found in this Wikipedia article or on the already existing external links. <a href="../../../t/v/3/User%7ETv316_cbb8.html" title="User:Tv316">tv316</a> 15:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about a compomise then, if we put a link to this page <a href="http://www.itechnet.co.uk/matchhistory.php" class="external free" title="http://www.itechnet.co.uk/matchhistory.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.itechnet.co.uk/matchhistory.php</a>, as i dont see this on any of the sites listed, this being his (nearly) full match history, i.e. every single match he has had. This also ties in with what wikipedia is all about. Do you agree?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can all the information on that page be verified? If it can, I, personally, wouldn't mind seeing it on there. Of course, there should be some other opinions about it from other contrbutors. <a href="../../../t/v/3/User%7ETv316_cbb8.html" title="User:Tv316">tv316</a> 16:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only way to verify it is to check every match. I have checked most of them, especially the random ones, like the UK house shows(which i attended, so know they are correct), but I suppose again its up to the majority of the users here if you want the link added. Anyone else want to provide their opinion?</p>
<p>I am going to add it under external references, nobody seems to have voiced an opinion, and I think Bret Harts entire match history is relevant to his Wikipedia article. Again if anyone has a problem, please feedback in here before changing it.</p>

<p>Due to the ridiculous back and forth of whose site should be used for Bret's match history, I'm removing it from the article. And I suggest it remains that way until some sort of consensus has been reached.

<p>Considering how crazy it is that my site and Kevin Smith's site have been constantly been trading space on wikipedia, I thought I should address the situation and Kevin Smith's lies.</p>
<p>This guy who runs itechnet/brethart.info stole most of the content on his website from mine. My webpage, www.hitmanhart.tk, is the LONGEST RUNNING Bret Hart site on the internet. Kevin Smith's site has been around for less than 6 months, mine was founded in 1998. That tells you everything you need to know right there.</p>
<p>When I first added my page to the wikipedia links, I left Kevin's on there to have them both linked. I didn't care. It should be noted that Kevin was the person who took it upon himself to constantly delete my link but leave his up. This is where the back and forth war started.</p>
<p>To tell you a little bit about this character Kevin Smith, he went to my hosting company, sending a false email claiming to be someone from WWE and tried to have my site shut down! I am not making this up. This guy is absolutely obssessed with being the only Bret Hart fan-site on the web. Luckily my webhost saw right through this, and they have taken action against him.</p>
<p>Once again my site is the longest running, most updated, most resourceful and most visited Bret Hart fan-site on the internet. I'd love to see it linked here on wikipedia. And unlike Kevin Smith, I don't mind if his site is also linked on here with mine.</p>
<p>PS- His match listings are slightly off and incorrect. He lists some cities in the wrong states and claims Bret Hart's debut was in 1978. My match listing is more accurate.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading guys, keep up the good work! -Ryan www.hitmanhart.tk</p>

<p>Thats the biggest load of BS I ever heard in my life. The only ever time I removed his links were when he was listing under external links, as this had been decided to be inapropriate. I only removed his match history items, because he kept editing my entry in there, and changing it to his. If anyone wants proof he took these results from me, I knew he would steal them so I took screenshots of his site with his results when they were an EXACT copy of mine. He changed them to what they are now when he learned what I had done. I got these results direct from Hitman Productions, as my site is currently being used as a test site for the future BRETHART.com. For proof of this please login to my forum to see details of my continued business with Hitman Productions. This guy is just blatantly jealous that a new site has come along, and has done everything he can to put my site down. Including downright lying about me, and falsely accusing me of things I haven't done, while stealing my content. I never wanted a war, and if it shuts him up, put his link up here, I couldn't give a damn. I just wanted to help the Bret Hart community, by supplying some info that wasn't here. At one point I even offered to merge the sites, and if he didnt like that idea, I would let him use my host free of charge, to host his videos and music! Then I saw him slagging me and my members off on his forum which started the war. He has since edited/deleted every post that was made to make himself look good. Luckily enough he cant do that here. By the sounds of it, me and Ryan should have our own Wiki article about the war that is going on!!! For gods sake Ryan, just give up on this! Its over dude, chill out! I'm not interested in anything you guys over there do, its not worth it. Coming onto my forum and mass emailing my members is fine, but at least send them to a decent Bret Hart website in future please. --<a href="../../../i/t/e/User%7EItechnet_2cc6.html" title="User:Itechnet">Itechnet</a> 00:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kevin, you are so full of it. Give it up. You are NOT the future BretHart.com...someone from my website contacted Bret Hart's people and they confirmed this. They also contacted you to tell you to quit telling people this, it's no coincident that you took the "future brethart.com" reference off your main page.</p>
<p>He didn't get the match listings from Hitman Productions, they have been widely available on forums for years. There was slight inaccuracies on them which I have changed to have the most accurate match listing on the internet.</p>
<p>Kevin you were deleting my link on the wiki article, as I would put mine right under yours and then come back the next day and find that yours was still there but you had deleted mine.</p>
<p>You are OBSESSED.</p>
<p>PS- Your one to tell me about mass emailing members of a message board? Good one. Why don't you come spam my message board again with 15 different user names. Pretty sure that has never been done on your website.</p>
<p>12.205.183.27 17:52, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh and PPS- He continues to say I am lying about him which is not true. I have not said anything here that is not a FACT. Contact the administrators at x10hosting.com and ask them if it is not true that a "Kevin Smith" emailed them trying to get my site taken down, claiming to be part of the WWE. They had to send him an email telling Kevin that they do not take these kind of threats lightly and they basically reprimanded him for the little game he was playing.</p>
<p>BretFan1 17:55, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again total BS, WHO did you contact from Hitman Productions Ryan??? And why did I not recieve this email your talking about??? And how come they have never even mentioned it to me on the phone??? Jealousy is a real bad thing Ryan, maybe you should try and get over it! Also check the other skins at itechnet, the refernce is still there at the top of the page. The only reason I changed the main page was because it was a better description for google! I'll even put the BretHart.com heading back there if you don't believe me on this and your more than welcome to contact Bret's office again! Because that did not happen!<a href="../../../i/t/e/User%7EItechnet_2cc6.html" title="User:Itechnet">Itechnet</a> 18:05, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you sit at your computer 24 hours a day? That was a quick response. You about ready to go spam my forums some more too, maybe throw in a few more verbal insults to people on there? You aren't even listed on google. Hitman Productions wants nothing to do with you. Oh, and you didn't even address the issue of when you claimed to be someone from WWE and emailed my webhost trying to get my site taken down. That was low, even for you. Seriously man, let it go. I don't care about your website, I never cared if it was listed on here. You are the one that started all this, I could care less about your site that is still relatively brand new in the world of Bret Hart websites. I've told you goodluck on a number of occasions, but you became obssessed with getting rid of my site ever since I turned down your offer to merge sites. Why would I have wanted to do that, my site has been around since 1998 and you had nothing to offer me that hadn't been on my site for years. You just wanted to piggy back on with a site that had a long, established tradition. That's fine, I just wasn't interested, and you took offense. I let you post on my forums until you started causing arguments, calling people names, and genuinely spamming my site for yours. BretFan1 18:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>GIVE UP!!!! For gods sake!!! Have the Wiki link, and shut the hell up!!! Leave me, my site, and my forum members alone, we are all fed up with you and your BS. Just go away!!! I'm not addressing these storys your typing, because they are blatant lies! Lets just agree to disagree, and not cross paths again, its pretty much for the better, as this could turn ugly for you and for me. You believe what you want about Brets official site, you will see when it does/does not happen, and then I will respond to you on this. Otherwise just give up on it, makes it easier for both of us. As I said feel free to take the Wiki link, it does not bother me anymore. <a href="../../../i/t/e/User%7EItechnet_2cc6.html" title="User:Itechnet">Itechnet</a> 18:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Notice he said it does not "bother me anymore." It obviously did when he started all of this, constantly removing my link. I think everyone can clearly see from his response above who is acting like a child, and who is responsible for this mess. Talk about someone avoiding the subject, he didn't even want to address all of the facts in my last post which really showed just what type of man this guy is.</p>
<p>The Kevin Smith that just posted above with the numerous exclamation marks, swearing, and name calling is just a taste of what this guy is really like. These were the type of antics that originally got him banned from my forum when he was first starting his website.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree we will stay clear of each other. That's what I have wanted ever since your obsession began. The members of www.hitmanhart.tk have had enough of you, your constant games, and the people you have brainwashed. You're really just not a good person, and so breaking off contact with you and your site is for the better.</p>
<p>It should be noted that over the 9 year history of my website, I have worked with numerous other Bret Hart fan sites without incident (Tara's Bret Hart Page, Ismail's Bret Hart Page, etc.). I was happy to do so, the more Bret Hart sites the better. I've never seen such antics from someone who claimed to be a Bret Hart fan. BretFan1 18:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have just been informed by one of your forum members that you have started a new thread on your forum sending people to this page. Thats a really good way of giving up on the matter don't you think? One last thing I will ask, can you provide a copy of the emails sent between you(or your forum member) and Hitman Productions? If you can, that would be remarkable, and then I would be willing to address all of the other things you are pointing out.</p>

<p>well well once again ryan cant except the fact its all said and done! Ryan , enough is enough , I was a member of your site and I am a member of Kevin's site and I wont go back to yours! Kevin does have a deal with the hitman production and soon you all will know about it! the members of the site are all wounderfull people! a real Hitman Fans&#160;! stop saying all those bs about the site , about kevin and about the members! your jelusy is ugly! and that is the only reason why you are left alone!</p>

<p>What? That didn't even make sense. Real intelligent post. Kevin sending his narrow minded flockies. Believe what you want, your mind has been warped. I'm sorry you are one of the few who have been brainwashed. Luckily there are hundreds more at my website that have not.</p>
<p>Kevin, yes I posted on my forums about the ongoing situation here because people know about it and are interested. I am not "sending them here." You see, that would be spamming. Your specialty. I see you have started that with "bret-girl"s rather intelligent post above. BretFan1 19:55, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>well tall me what part you didnt understand and i'll do my best to explain! cause if thats the best thing you can write as a respond than Im not the one who is narrow minded. btw how many members do you have on your site Mr. "ever since 1998"&#160;??? - about 91 -79 out of 91 members have 10 posts or less, most of you memebers have 0 posts and how many members Kevin has??? - 92 and keep growing! Thank god I have my own mind and I dont need anyone to tall me what to do! Kevin did not send me! Im posting here cause im sick of your bs!!!20:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)~bret-girl</p>
<p>Are you questioning whether my page has been up since 1998? Because that is beyond ludicrous. Actually Kevin did that once in my forums when he started to become bitter, if you'll recall. Been through this before with some of you new-school Bret fans on the internet that weren't around here in 1998. Check the internet time-machine for www.angelfire.com/ia/brethart Yes, my site was actually around when Bret was still wrestling. My site was also one of the first to break the news when Owen tragically passed away in 1999 (check my Owen Tribute for more on that).</p>
<p>Anyways, yeah the 91 members. Kevin's has 92? Good for him. My page underwent a massive reconstruction (plus new server, moving from angelfire to x10hosting) in August 2005, and the new forum was created then. The 91 members in the forums is since August 2005, and actually some data and members were lost in October.</p>
<p>Don't even talk about who posts of those members. If you look at the post count on Kevin's forum, he and his moderators make up over 1/3 of the posts. Actually, it might even be closer to 1/2. Haven't looked in a while, nor do I care to.</p>
<p>BretFan1 20:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is this still going on? bret-girl dont respond. Ryan lets just call a truce. This is not the place to have an argument, and we shouldnt be arguing anyway. You may have the Wiki link if they let you. I apologise for SOME of the things I have done, but I must say your version of the story is different to mine. But I'm not saying either of our storys are 100% correct. So lets just call it a day. We don't have to be friends, or even talk to one another. But lets just stop all of this. OK?</p>

<p>Well, Kevin, I'm glad you have calmed down. I agree. I do have to say, though, both of our sites should be entitled to a link on the Bret page here, and I've said that from the very beginning. It's up to the people here. BretFan1 22:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well as I said before, I dont think we are allowed to be listed under external links. So maybe we can agree with the guys on Wiki, that one of us has a link under references, and one has a link in the externals. If so you choose which you want. <a href="../../../i/t/e/User%7EItechnet_2cc6.html" title="User:Itechnet">Itechnet</a> 22:48, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Before becoming a member on Wikipedia, I added some info on Bret's Stampede days because I felt that needed more elaboration. I mentioned his feud with Dynamite Kid and wrestling with his father, Stu. But the information I added is gone now. It doesn't make sense to get rid of that important information, and I feel Bret's page needs more elaboration on his decision to become a wrestler, his Stampede days, and his time in Japan. All the information I wrote was obtained by watching his DVD set, so I don't think there was a need to cite sources.</p>
<p>Today, I also added a list of all the Video Games Bret appeared in over the years. It took a little while to gather them all, so please don't delete that.</p>

<p>Re: I've seen Bret billed as both 6' and 6'1 throughout his career and I've seen him stand face to face w/ Steve Austin and they're pretty much the same height, no more than an inch between them, even less. Despite celebheights, I've seen other 'true heights' lists and Austin was listed as either 6'1, 6'2, and 6'3 w/ 6'2 being the most common</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do find it difficult to belieeb that Steve Austin is not 6 ft 2 in, it is the height he has always been billed at. Whereas Bret's height has fluctuated over the years.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 14:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>Re: I've only seen Bret billed as either 6' or 6'1. Judging by that I wouldnt find it hard to believe that Bret is 6'1 because in a picture of him standing face to face w/ Austin, he was the same height, although I'd give a slight edge to Austin because he has no hair</p>

<p>In his DVD, Bret Hart says Konnan is the one that taught him Sting's Scorpion Deathlock. In his 06/04/2004 IGN interview for "Showdown: Legends of Wrestling", Bret Hart states: "I learned it in Japan. It was more of a Japanese move that I learned when I first got in the business, but it was a move I didn't do for a long time. It's been around for a long time, but I was doing it before Sting was doing it." (<a href="http://sports.ign.com/articles/521/521356p4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.ign.com/articles/521/521356p4.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't know about this. That's the danger of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a>. In my opinion, the more likely explanation is the one on the DVD. There's a chance Hart might have come across the move (the "sasore gatame" or something) while training with the Japanese wrestlers that he mentions taught him during his days in Stampede Wrestling, but not picked it up until Konnan came along. There's no mention of Hart ever extensively working in Japan before his WWF days and before Sting adopted the move. I believe he began doing the move as his finisher in 1992, which is around the time <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konnan.html" title="Konnan">Konnan</a> made his run in the WWF, adding more credibility to Hart's claim on the DVD. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a></dd>

<p>Does anyone know who inducted Bret into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame? Was he inducted by anyone? Thanks.<a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMgHoneyBee_39e0.html" title="User:MgHoneyBee">MgHoneyBee</a> 02:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No specific wrestler/manager/etc. inducted him. I believe the committee simply inducts whomever they choose. I attended the incredibly humid, crowded, and prolonged ceremony (see the photo I added to the article) and the wrestlers were simply handed their plaque and spoke a few words before sitting in folding chairs. I have some other photos from the event, and I'd be happy to offer any other info you're curious about. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaleson_9aee.html" title="User:Caleson">Cale</a> 22:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made the ff. additions to Bret's moveset:</p>
<p>- suicide dive</p>
<p>His aerial maneuver</p>
<p>- plancha</p>
<p>An aerial maneuver which Bret uses to shift the momentum to the opponent's side</p>
<p>- bulldog</p>
<p>Sometimes incorporated into the so-called "Five Moves of Doom"</p>
<p>- small package, roll-up, crucifix, sunset flip</p>
<p>Together with the victory roll, they're what I call Bret's (no pun intended) "Five Pinfalls of Doom", which he often incorporates in a recurring series of spots in his matches. The small package, in particular, is probably his most infamous pinfall maneuver, often used in his trademark "goldbricking/playing possum" spot.</p>

<p>Fair enough, but keep the "five moves of doom" term out of the article. It's a term limited mostly to internet fans, and there is some debate as to what exactly the "five moves" are. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 00:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find it quite insulting that my link keeps getting removed from this article. My site IS the most active Bret Hart site on the web, has its own ORIGINAL media section, i.e. we have had 2 seperate music tracks made based on Brets theme music. We have met him and conducted interviews on three occasions, we have the most information on the man compared to any other resource on the web, and we have a MASSIVE forum. This link probably deserves to be here more than brethart.com. A LOT of time and effort has gone into this site, and the link WAS allowed before "rival" sites decided to come and start spamming. Check the history. <a href="../../../i/t/e/User%7EItechnet_2cc6.html" title="User:Itechnet">Itechnet</a> 01:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does everyone keep on deleting the Bret Hart "favorites" topic? I really find it interesting and I'm sure other people will to. If you guys want me to post it under a headline such as "Miscellaneous" or "Other", then tell me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I find it unecesarrily lengthens an already lengthy article, and I don't find all his favorites that notable as it pertains to his career and overall life. Not to mention, I don't see sections like that in other articles that are classified as biographies of living persons. <a href="../../../b/m/g/User%7EBmg916_32e8.html" title="User:Bmg916"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">B</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">mg</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">9</font><font color="#009900" face="Arial Black">1</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial Black">6</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../b/m/g/User_talk%7EBmg916_77ed.html" title="User talk:Bmg916"><font color="navy"><strong>Speak to Me</strong></font></a></sup> 20:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
