<p>Violetriga, my alteration to the wording of the 'breastfeeding in public' section was small, but the point I endeavoured to make is significant to the subject of that section. It may be obvious to you, but it is a widespread misconception that all mothers who <i>choose</i> to express will be <i>able</i> to. The sentence below suggests to the uninformed that whether to breastfeed or feed expressed breastmilk is a choice, and that is frequently not the case:</p>
<p><b>"Some mothers choose to pump or express milk by hand so that they can carry a small bottle of milk with them if they plan to be out at mealtimes."</b></p>
<p>The 'option to express' is commonly used in arguments against breastfeeding in public, and for this reason I believe that the modifiers are appropriate if this is to be used as the closing sentence on the subject of public breastfeeding. My alteration, however, made the sentence clumsy. I welcome suggestions on how to improve it.</p>

<dd>Perhaps it should read
<dl>
<dd><b>"Some <i>breastfeeding</i> mothers choose to pump or express milk by hand so that they can carry a small bottle of milk with them if they plan to be out at mealtimes."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Isn't any woman who can breastfeed, given a decent pump, able to express her milk? As for using pumped milk to avoid breastfeeding in public, it's just not very practical. Even if you bring a bottle, your breasts still get full of milk. Unless you actually nurse, you'll have to go somewhere to pump it out anyway, or else risk plugged ducts or mastitis. (Believe me, I've had both, and they're no fun.) It's much easier to just feed the baby directly. <small><span style="white-space: nowrap" class="plainlinks"><span style="border-left: 0px #505050 solid; border-right: 1px #505050 solid; color: #505050; background: #FFCCFF; font-weight: bold; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 90%; line-height: 80%" class="nounderlinelink"><a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">MamaGeek</span></a>&#160;</span><span style="border-right: 1px #505050 solid; color: #505050; background: #ffffa0">&#160;<a href="../../../m/a/m/User_talk%7EMamaGeek_3208.html" title="User talk:MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">TALK</span></a>&#160;</span><span style="background: #a0ffa0">&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MamaGeek_df5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">CONTRIB</span></a>&#160;</span></span></small> 11:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those are all valid points, but to answer your question: When a mother encounters pump resistance - especially common after the first three to four months - the quality of the pump may have little to do with how easily she finds it to express and how much milk she is able to let-down for a pump. Then you have the expense - even good manual pumps can run into hundreds of dollars, electric more. This sentence has the subtle implication to the uninformed that expressing milk for feeding in public places is a viable option financially or practically - or indeed, that it is even physically possible - for any mother choosing to do so. Assuming that the general public will be aware of these things is misguided. This gap in public knowledge on breastfeeding is frequently displayed in editorials and online forums. The wording as it stands feels a little ignorant to me. I'm undecided over whether it even has a place in the section on public breastfeeding, as there is already a section on expressing. If it does, perhaps a longer, detailed section on breastfeeding in public would be appropriate since this is an important factor in breastfeeding rates and duration. <small>above unsigned commment was made by 203.167.131.226 08:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>What is pump resistance? I've never heard of it.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I think a sentence on feeding expressed milk belongs here, but you're right, it does need to be edited. Your point about being able to express is a valid one. I also don't think a distinction needs to be made between "pumping" and "expressing by hand." The word "express" alone covers both. How about the following:
<dl>
<dd><b>"Some breastfeeding mothers <i>who can express</i> their milk will carry a small bottle with them if they plan to be out at mealtimes."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>BTW, you should always sign your comments. Simply put four tildas (~~~~) at the end, and Wikipedia will handle the sig for you.</dd>

<p>I like that amendment to the wording. It's a small change, but at least it raises the question "So some mothers can't?" rather than "So why doesn't everyone express?". I'll alter it, if no-one else objects. Oh, and thanks for the tip! 203.167.131.226 13:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Policy, or guidelines, or suggestions, or whatever, exist in part so that people can think about more important things than spelling and formatting. Moreover, they exist so that what a particular person (let alone an admin) "thinks" or feels won't rule the day. You think one thing takes "massive precedence," I think another does. We disagree. Ergo we follow policy/guidelines so we can stop fighting about something that ultimately is quite silly. Guidelines say that the first non-stub version (to which I contributed -- under a diff. name) takes precedent. It doesn't say that a somewhat stable result of "dialect creep" should be cast in stone. So please stop reverting me, unles you can cite something other than your personal views.

<li>If the original article was in AmE then technically your first edit (of three) was a revert - a further one would mean you violate the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> policy</li>
<li>Discussion is preferred to edit-warring. Generally things should be left at the status quo and discussed until a clear way forward can be found. I plan to keep this as British English and, if you are determined for it to be AmE without compromise then I can only suggest mediation.</li>

<dd>Disturb is a rather strong word! I don't understand your final comments as they seem to be contradictory. We always go by policy, and usually go by guidelines, but it's not right to think that every situation can be covered by them. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 20:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First: Imagine I really believe in spelling reform. Imagine I really believe that the American spelling system, while weird in plenty of ways (<i>defense</i>, for ex., should be <i>defence</i>, unless <i>fence</i> were changed to <i>fense</i>, which is closer to the Latin <i>defensa</i> -- and there are few other weirdnesses), is best as a global variant of English. And, either way, it's just the system I use. Spelling matters to some people. (It certainly matters to you.) Yet I would never impose this on anyone, esp. not in a community where all dialects are to be respected, in accordance with policy and guideliness the community has developed. Imagine that I contribute to a Wikipedia article that includes the spellings "estrogen" and "anemia". And then you come along and willfully change those spellings to your favorite spellings. And you make other changes. Then, a year later, I come along and change them back, following spelling guidelines that the Wikipedia community has developed.</dd>
<dd>And your response? You invoke a principle that doesn't exist: your violations, because no one caught them within a period of X weeks (where X is more than a few), shall (you decree) no longer be considered instances of guideline-violation (or "non-following").</dd>
<dd>"Disturb" is indeed the operative word. When an admin, at his or her fiat, claims "I plan to keep this as British English" it is indeed disturbing to those here who believe that we should follow guidelines more closely. Can you tell me why you changed the spellings in the first place? Was it wrong then? Why won't you just change them back? It's not a rhetorical question. Think about it. You made a mistake. I was trying to rectify that. You simply reverting me. (And then upbraided me for my errors....)</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, how do we request mediation? (I ask because it seems like you have not interest in compromising.)

<dd>You misunderstand my point. It is in no way "I was here first." I was trying to get you to step into the shoes of the people you "violated" (too strong a word, perhaps, but reflect on the force of your "I PLAN to keep this .... in British English"...) with your initial changes. My linking my account to the previous one is irrelevant to my point. You violated guidelines, and you don't seem to care. I'm trying to understand why you don't care. Could you answer this non-rhetorical question: why won't you undo your spelling changes? Your primary reason seems to be "X amount of time has gone by". And that reason doesn't exist in any guideline, it's your will, not (as far as I can see) community will. Invoking reasoning like that, talking about "common" (even if it's not reflected in community guidelines anywhere) sense, etc., just doesn't seem like reasonable admin behavior to me. But, I'm very new here. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-25 21:23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have explained why (as far as you can remember, and I know it was a while ago, and I wouldn't expect you to remember) you made the changes intially. But that's not really what I'm getting at. My main question is why you won't change them back; after all, you recognize the changes violated guidelines. Why be stubborn about this? The issue itself obviously <i>is</i> a big thing to you. Think of all this time we've spent discussing this. Why not just follow the spelling guidelines, instead of invoking (what you think is) common sense? --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-25 21:46 (UTC) P.S.

<dd>Oh, I wouldn't deny being stubborn!&#160;:) I strongly believe that dialect creep should be avoided, and that the invokation of "a violation of guidelines that took place a while ago doesn't matter" principle is <i>really</i> bad for Wikipedia. (And I think it's bad in general.) I believe both of those things strongly. That's why I'm pushing this. You're claiming your change from American spellings wasn't a major thing yet my change <i>is</i> a major thing. I see why you feel that, I think, but nothing of what you've described is actually in existing guidelines. I think that, too is bad for Wikipedia: people invoking common sense, which hasn't been codified, is generaly an instance of their invoking the principle of their own will. This might not be what's happening here! I don't know you. Maybe something else is going on. But I do know that spelling policy was debated at length (I'm reading it now), and that the decisions arrived at were wise: for topics not tied to a particular region with its own spelling, the spelling of the first überstub version is always to be considered the correct spelling for the article.

<dd>Your are violating that well-reasoned, carefully thought-through guideline. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-25 22:00 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No set of guidelines could possibly cover every eventuality. I have not violated any guidelines, especially since the one you are referring to was only added to the Manual of Style <i>after I made the changes</i>.

<dd>To be sure, anyone who accused you of being anti-American (or anti-spelling reform, anti-Shakespeare [for he mostly used "American" spellings] etc.) because of the changes you made a year ago would be committing a great injustice. Your changes may well have been entirely innocent. The question is: what do we do now? The guidelines are quite clear on this: when conflicts arise (and the topic of the article isn't tied to a particular region), "the dialect of the first significant contributor (not a stub) should be used." The guideline does <i>not</i> say "the dialect of the first significant contributor (not a stub) <i>after 2004</i> should be used." My change was intended to follow that guideline. The additional benefit would be that a few minutes would be removed from your purgatory tally (kidding). In sum: the timing of the establishment of the guidelines has nothing to do with what we do now. What we do now is follow the guidelines, seems to me. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-25 22:21 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't change the fact that I think that, in this case, the guidelines do not adequately match the situation.

<dd>And I have been contending that your arguments seem to amount to "it's just what I want." I've been trying to suggest, in particular, that your "it's been stable for a long time" argument is particularly bad for Wikipedia. I explained this on my talk page by way of an analogy: The fact the U.K. "took" Northern Ireland a long time ago isn't a reason for the U.K. not to leave Northern Ireland. There may be plenty of other reasons! But the passage of time per se isn't one of them. You then said "Suddenly we're talking politics?" It wasn't sudden. The question of spelling became a political issue in March of last year ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breastfeeding&amp;diff=11377987&amp;oldid=11376548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breastfeeding&amp;diff=11377987&amp;oldid=11376548" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]), when you started "fixing" spellings by changing them from American to UK for no good reason. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-June-26 06:09 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>March of last year? You mean many months <i>after</i> it had already passed through peer review and featured article candidacy using British English? If that is the first such change that you are saying I made then you are mistaken that it was me that initiated the Ame--&gt;Be change. In that case I brought the two words in line with the rest of the article. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 07:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't say you, and you alone, initiated the change. I'm saying you're a part of violation, one that is political, that should be corrected, since correcting it is good for the Wikipedia community.</dd>
<dd>You took an article that had inconsistent spelling and you normalized the spelling in a direction opposite of that which the guidelines recommend. (And, looking through the article's history, I see you made many other such changes. I didn't look into this closely before because I thought the guidelines were very clear on this matter, and never imagined anyone would simply revert me.) My contention is that what you and others involved in the dialect drift of this article should have done is to look at the article's history, discover the spelling used in the first non-stub version, and use that. You still haven't given an adequate explaination of why you didn't do that, and, more importantly, why, now that a dispute about the spelling has arise, you believe violating the guidelines (which say "if all else fails... go by the first nonstub version") is a good idea here, beyond saying, in effect, a violation that's been around for a while shan't be considered a violation -- a notion that is your opinion, not a community-vetted idea. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-26 08:15 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The guideline you refer to did not exist when this article was going through its rewrite. And I mean total rewrite - what existed before no longer bore any resemblance to how it was after it reached FA status. During that time it became BE, and as no guidelines existed at the time no violation occurred. You coming along and changing it to AmE simply because you want to is totally inappropriate. The guideline exists to help with ongoing disputes, not one that has been stable for well over a year. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 16:38, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I pointed out before, the guideline refers to a method for determining <i>current</i> spelling, based on <i>past</i> events. There is no "nonstub version <i>after</i> this policy went into effect" clause. Moreover, there is nothing that I can see -- if I'm wrong, I sincerenly apologize! -- about FA status having anything to do with conferring a change on what is considered the correct spelling. Finally, I didn't "come along." I made a change that I thought accorded with guidelines, one that rectified a situation created by your "coming along" and changing the spelling of the many who worked on the article in its original form (and it was not "just because I wanted to"). Again, I see no guidelines that say that a certain amount of work on an article entities the editor to change the dialectic. You're invoking principles that make sense to you, but which haven't been vetted by the community. You're being, it seems to me, almost possessive about this article, which ignores the feelings of others who worked on it previously. It seems adhering to guidelines would be a good idea here. Or proposing new ones, if you really believe what you're saying! But I think a "someone who works on an article later gets to change the dialect that is considered correct for that article" principle would be a bad idea. And any principle based on the dialect at time of FA status would be bizarre, seems to me. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-26 16:49 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I already explained my motivations: I like proof-reading and copyediting articles. I start with a spell-check, after a review of an article's history to make sure I adhere to WP guidelines about Eng. dialects. I took that first step, and you immediately reverted me, invoking what I believed and still believe to be very bad reasons, reasons that you invoke as "common sense," but which I don't believe are common sense. One could just as easily say you invoked the spelling war by not seeing 1) I actually had good intentions; and 2) I was following MoS guidelines; and then, 3) leaving my minor changes as they were. But you didn't. You felt that this issue was important enough to simply revert me. Why?

<dd>Because I don't like it when people change from one long-standing dialect to another. Yes, I have a natural bias against AmE and would prefer articles that I have worked extensively on to be in BE, but I always try to take a common sense approach to such things. Plus, there are too many people that push a country bias, and your edits (innocent and well-meaning though they may have been) came across like that. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 18:00, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I skimmed the 'suck on this' article, it seems to raise a lot of good points. Is there really no ingredients list on formula? and no regulation of what those ingredients are and how they may vary as costs vary? However the tone is very soapboxy (OK it's not an encyclopaedia) but a few bits seemed suspicous e.g. 'The packaging of infant formulas occasionally gives rise to contamination with broken glass and fragments of metal'. Can this really be a current ongoing issue? 'But newer data from the West clearly show that babies in otherwise affluent societies are also falling ill and dying due to an early diet of infant convenience food'. While I think bottle fed babies do have an increased chance of SIDS this is only an <i>increased</i> chance, but even breast fed babies die of SIDS. Surely most of the 'breast is best' data in on the lines of less allergy, reduced chances of cancer etc. Therefore while I think breast IS best I think the sentance overstates the point.</p>
<p>The history of why breastfeeding has become less common in the last few decades is interesting, but in the table at the end: 'in the UK, the NHS spends £35 million each year just treating gastroenteritis in bottlefed babies. In the US, insurance companies pay out $3.6 billion for treating diseases in bottlefed babies'. This doesn't say what percentage of these costs are normal to babies in general and what percentage are actually CAUSED by the bottle feeding. Therefore again descending to advocacy (admitedly in a worthy cause).</p>
<p>The lack of suppport at the hospital is definately an important point. A friend of mine is bottle feeding, and the hospital's 'baby friendliness' was pretty abysmal. I visited her 22 hours after her birth at 8.30am and she had been kept apart from the baby the whole night! and the baby wasn't brought in till 10.00am after she repeatedly asked to see the baby. I was almost tempted to just go and find the baby and fetch him, but unfortunately I showed too much deference to authority. That's also a problem for the first time mother with all these highly trained doctors and nurses round them telling them what is best. (When my mother wanted to go home after her first baby (me) the nurses told her she couldn't go because they didn't have a health worker available. After her second baby my mother said she didn't care, she was going home anyway, so they found a health worker).</p>
<p>I think the best case scenario would be to take all the info from the article, and incorporate it in a measured, calmer, referenced way into Wikipedia, if anyone is at a loose end!</p>
<p>My, that was a through article. Your question: '<b>The packaging of infant formulas occasionally gives rise to contamination with broken glass and fragments of metal'. Can this really be a current ongoing issue?</b> Yes, this is an current issue and happens quite often, even if you never "hear" about it in the media. One site that regularly posts formula recalls is the WABA homepage at www.waba.org.my And, yes, there are no requirements that the manufactures of artifical baby milk make public their recipies or the sources of their ingredients. Just, what are "comfort proteins" Spend a litte time next time you are in the market reading formula cans. It can be quite an education. Frankly, I wouldn't post info from this article here on the breastfeeding page, but on the infant formula page --<a href="../../../i/27/m/User%7EI%27m_nonpartisan_6c89.html" title="User:I'm nonpartisan">I'm Nonpartisan</a> 04:01, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>And of course, according to Greek mythology, the Milky Way was formed by Hera, who spilled milk in the sky after discovering that Zeus had tricked her into feeding young Heracles. In another variant, Hermes snuck Heracles into Olympus to drink from the breasts of Hera who was asleep. Heracles bit Hera's nipple shooting her milk into the skies forming the Milky Way.

<p>I was just glancing over the reasons for Defeaturing this article, and one which I found somewhat odd was this: "Seems to have a strong bias towards breastfeeding, whereas bottle feeding is a choice made by many."</p>
<p>To make a very hyperbolic analogy, smoking is a choice made by many, but that doesn't mean that articles about the tobacco plant should include a pro-cigarettes section.&#160;:p</p>
<p>Removing my tongue from my cheek, what I mean to say is that the encouragement of breastfeeding (especially in underdevelopped countries) is currently a great objective of governments, health organizations and the UN, because its benefits have been <b>proved</b>, and the <b>risks</b> of its avoidance are also well reported.</p>
<p>The fact that many people choose to use other methods which are less healthy, doesn't mean that these methods should be given equal "air-time". One should also not forget that the reasons for choosing bottle-feeding include vanity (fear of future breast-sagging) or the logistic impossibility of breastfeeding (such as a mother who works in a factory, away from the child). These reasons have no influence on the content of the article on Breastfeeding. <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMIP_a875.html" title="User:MIP">MIP</a> 20:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me put it this way: breastfeeding is a biological function, just like breathing - if the article were about breathing, the fact that it didn't delve too deeply into artificial ventilation would not be seen as a bias; it would just be a reflection of the fact that the article is about the biological function itself and that the alternative is not as good as the original. <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMIP_a875.html" title="User:MIP">MIP</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/p/User_talk%7EMIP_63da.html" title="User talk:MIP">Talk</a> 14:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was an interesting discussion to read, and I think that there are some sources that can be relied upon here to prove without a doubt that breastmilk is the superior infant food. For example from Gerber.com: <a href="http://http://www.gerber.com/bf/help/benefits/index.html" class="external text" title="http://http://www.gerber.com/bf/help/benefits/index.html" rel="nofollow">Your Breastmilk is the best possible food for your baby.</a> In fact, on every can of infant formula and in every piece of printed material made by infant formula manufactures they state, over and over again, that breastfeeding is the preferred way to feed an infant. Read a can of infant formula, there are long and specific discloure statements about the adverse reactions some babys will have to formulas.--<a href="../../../i/27/m/User%7EI%27m_nonpartisan_6c89.html" title="User:I'm nonpartisan">I'm Nonpartisan</a> 16:38, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, I have many times got to the end of a major edit only to be told "edit conflict"&#160;:-( I would be happy to make less informative and more generic summaries such as "General tidy up", and see if this incurs the wrath of the existing community.

<p>________________________ Well, I guess it is high time we broke out the numerous studies that have been done on breastfeeding. What will it take to get the NPOV tag removed? If the only studies I can find AGAINST breastfeeding are from the formula companies, will that be enough?</p>
<p>I think perhaps there needs to be another article created that can be referenced here and that would be, perhaps: "Breastfeeding vs Infant formula controversies". Would inclusion of such an article lend itself toward dropping the NPOV and regaining a path to FA status?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As they say - everything in its place. I think the article can and should include references to breastmilk substitutes - all of them, including pasteurized donor breastmilk, commercial substitutes, and even historical references to other substitutes used historically. Nobody disagrees that there is a place for using feeds other than breastmilk (see section on contraindications) and this can easily include other POV's without contradicting scientific evidence.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamwells_2746.html" title="User:Williamwells">Williamwells</a> 04:34, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the first things I will research for inclusion here is the World Health Organizations Baby Friendly Hospital initiative which requires participating hospitals to cease from giving out free formula samples. When hospitals refrain from giving out those samples, breastfeeding went up aprox 30%. I will also bring in the story of Nestle Foods and their formula program that cost thousands of African babies their lives.</p>
<p>Am I sounding militant? A little, yeah. But, I will get the research in here, cited and everything. If folks are just plain uncomfortable with the subject matter from then on, that is hardly the fault of an encyclopedic entry.</p>
<p>As a busy mom myself, I invite anybody else with some good cit-able info to get it posted here as it will be slow going if you leave it just to me.&#160;;) The Pearl 19:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When I read the introductory overview section, it seems biased <i>against</i> breastfeeding, giving several reasons for mothers to prefer formula, and no reasons at all why anyone promotes breastfeeding.

I think it would be a shame to make this article into a debate about the benefits of breastfeeding - as you say, there really isn't a significant medical point of view that doesn't support the breast milk is preferable idea. I think the NPOV tag is more about the fact that aspects of the article read as though they're <i>advocating</i> for or against breastfeeding, whereas they just need to be <i>about</i> breastfeeding. So editing out some of the more activist language (for sake of a better term) would help. Good studies would be a great addition.

<p>I'm curious about producing milk for an adoptive baby just by suckling it. I knew this was possible, but how long does it take for the milk to come in? If you were stuck on a desert island with a young (new born? older?) baby could you produce milk before the baby died of starvation? Bascially does anyone have more info on this. ChristineD 21:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding is that simply suckling doesn't work. I've heard from several friends who adopted kids about <a href="http://www.asklenore.com/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/gn_protocols.html" class="external text" title="http://www.asklenore.com/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/gn_protocols.html" rel="nofollow">the Newman-Goldfarb protocols</a> (this is just a link I found through google, don't know how good the website is), which requires a cocktail of hormones.

<dd>This requires frequent (every 2-3 hour) nipple stimulation - which requires a very motivated mother. Some medications might help (<a href="../../../d/o/m/Domperidone.html" title="Domperidone">domperidone</a> for example - not available in the US). I am an allopathic provider, not a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturopath.html" title="Naturopath">naturopath</a> - but some say that <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenugreek.html" title="Fenugreek">fenugreek</a> also helps and is available everywhere. The time required is relatively unpredictable. On the positive side, many adoptive mothers can provide at least a portion of their infants milk requirements daily and can supplement with breastmilk substitutes while the infant is attached (fed through a small tube) for the remainder. Try La Leche League for advice or referral to a lactation consultant for assistance - they will be happy to help. 08:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Often Supplementation with the use of an SNS (Supplemental Nursing System) may be needed to help induce a partial or full milk supply for an adoptive mother. The SNS is a feeding system in which the supplement comes through a tube that has been taped to the nipple. This can help supplement the baby while continuing nipple stimulation. Mother may want to pump after each feeding to add even more nipple stimulation time. There is more information on this topic in the Breastfeeding Answer Book - available through La Leche League Leaders and most Lactaion consultants.</p>

<p>I've started adding {{fact}} tags to assertions in the article as the first step for improving it. There are lots of tags, but I expect we'll find that a number of assertions willl be covered by each source. There are a few sources already in the article that aren't really appropriate - in particular books that express health opinions but are not authored by medical experts, and ones like "Hopkinson 1988". I've already removed one that was to an online site that had no clear editorial policy to ensure it was publishing well respected and peer reviewed work.</p>
<p>I'd also like to see some more qualification around some of the bulleted lists like the "Breast milk may help to lower the risk of or protect against:" list. Some of these are going to be much stronger effects and better supported by clinical evidence than others.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of sites linking to well referenced research it would be great to list them on the talk page, then we can add them as needed.

<dd>If we can't source claims like this then I do think they should be removed from the article (along with a lot more besides). These are significant claims and not ones we should be making if they aren't supportable. I added the tags as way to focus on individual assertions. There has been a general request for sourcing on this article for some time but little movement towards backing up claims. And we continue to develop a page that reads more like a piece by advocates than an encyclopedia article representing current significant opinions of experts in the field. If removing all the unsourced stuff is the way to change that then I'm for it. But in my experience that is not a particularly collaborative approach.</dd>

On the health benefits/medical side, again - lots of research, this time at least in peer reviewed journals, often with slightly different and sometimes conflicting results. I've been trying to work out which works represent expert consensus - since it's a area of interest to me, but not an area of expertise, I've had a hard job doing that. And since it means I need to go to the library to research, it is slower than if everything were easily available online.</dd>

<p>Article says this... 'Feeding a baby on demand, which may mean nursing many times more than the recommended minimum, is the best way to maintain milk production' (with no citation) but research pointed to in the artcle says 'Ongoing research [9] shows that more fully draining the breasts also increases the rate of milk production'. From my experience it's clear that demand feeding rarely properly empties the breast (the baby just isn't that hungry if it is feeding once every hour or two), so that would seem to imply it is detrimental to long term milk production. I think unless one can find a citation to prove the first statement above its factual basis is questionable.</p>

Please forgive another short answer to this question. First foods are very much defined by a family's culture, and different first foods are offered all over the world, usually within the second six months of life. But, to be frank, most babies will decide when they are ready for solid food by taking a handful of food out of someone else's plate and stuffing it into their mouths. A baby eats, not when he is nutritionally ready, but when he is developmentally ready, that is, can sit up straight, swallow, chew, not gag, and use the finger and thumb to pick up small pieces of food. It is comparable to when a baby is ready to walk. There is no optimal age for the baby to walk, or not walk, rather it is when the baby gets up on his feet, and walks.--<a href="../../../i/27/m/User%7EI%27m_nonpartisan_6c89.html" title="User:I'm nonpartisan">I'm Nonpartisan</a> 04:38, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current version states "Typically, if a baby is born in a hospital in Canada, the mother will be given a bottle filled with formula "just in case" she has any problems breastfeeding."</p>
<p>Really? I have never heard of this practice, nor have any of the other Canadian moms (who've given birth recently) mentioned any such thing. Any stats to back up the claim that it is "typical" for Canadian hospitals to provide formula?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<dd>In Oklahoma it happens all the time. I would pull my hair out if I wasnt bald already. They get a whole six-pack most of the time, and are given a "discharge pack" that includes a nice bag, lots of free "formula" (breastmilk substitute) and other advertising. Massachussets outlawed this practice last year sometime but I have not heard of any other states jumping on that bandwagon yet. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamwells_2746.html" title="User:Williamwells">Williamwells</a> 08:53, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a wonderful article in general, and obviously an important public health issue. I have spent a little time cleaning up sections where I have specific knowledge and adding references as I go. I have also removed a few sections that were references to "how to" books that were not well referenced, opinion, or just plain wrong. I am sure some grammar and speling&#160;:) issues made it through my horrible ADHD so I would appreciate some revision for form. Adhering to "orginal author form" I tried to stick to either British(English) format for references that were very different (as in pacifier) - or just British for words (e.g. Oesaphagus) where the meaning is obvious.</p>
<p>I am interested in correcting the perceived neutrality problems, but it will be difficult to present breastmilk substitutes as a viable option in the face of so much evidence that breastmilk substitute use leads to increased morbidity including infections, weight regulation issues and lower IQ to name just a few. Find me experimental allopathic evidence that breastfeeding has a true equal and I will happily cite that evidence and call it a "difference of opinion" but until then I am working on the assumption that nobody disagrees about the health benefits of breastfeeding.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There has never been any true study that proves that breastfeeding is superior to formula feeding in an industrialized society. There's a whole lot of "may" and "possibly"s and "could"s, but nothing concrete. If breastfeeding was the key to superior baby health, then explain why so many breastfed babies in 3rd world countries die, while formula fed babies in industrialized countries thrive. 172.167.169.191 04:35, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The health risks of artificial feeding are NOT in any doubt. While the exact probabilities of risk are not precise, the fact that artificial feeding puts both mothers and babies (and the adults they become) at risk of a range of serious health conditions is not up for debate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is purely common sense: instead of a natural process which is adapted to the baby's particular family biology and environment, we have a variable industrial process which is as prone to error and contamination as any other, which cannot possibly reproduce the mix of volatile nutrients or live immune agents contained in breastmilk because it has to be stored on a shelf in varying temperature for (possibly) months and because manufacturing most of them is simply not currently economical on a mass scale. It can be contaminated in manufacture, storage, transport, mixing, or storage in the bottle after mixing. Because the powder settles in transport, the same size scoop can give varying levels of concentration - in one study, trained scientists with precise equipment and plenty of time to follow guidelines to the letter were unable to mix formula to a consistent concentration, and in some cases the concentrations were unsafe.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So formula fed babies in industralized societies do NOT thrive, they are just less likely to die because we have more advanced health care systems which protect them better from the morbidity associated with artificial feeding. But they are at substantially greater risk of allergy and other immune disorders, altered gut flora, different muscle/fat ratios and different fat composition (with attending effects on brain composition)... the list goes on, but I will have to get some sources to continue this conversation. But one anecdote before I go: a doctor working in an emergency ward refused to believe that breastfeeding rates were increasing as all the statistics showed. When asked why, he said "all the kids I see are artificially fed".</dd>

<dd>On review, I don't think the Breastfeeding in public subsection even really fits with History of breastfeeding, although a "History of breastfeeding in public" section would work nicely with a stand-alone BiP article (and a small mention and link in "History of breastfeeding"). The "History of breastfeeding" section itself could be further trimmed without requiring its own article. Most of breastfeeding "history" has been in the past 150 years or so, and focuses mainly on alternatives being developed, which is covered in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_formula.html" title="Infant formula">Infant formula</a>.

<p>I understand that there are self-proclaimed "boob nazis" who want to beat everyone over the head with their "breast is best" messages, but this is getting ridiculous. Nearly all of the "facts" are referenced from sites that are actively pro-BFing (with a few whopping lies on those sites to boot - not to mention a lot of doctors-as-psychics!), and not neutral sites.</p>
<p>I seem to remember a connection between breastfeeding mothers and jaundiced babies, but I see nothing about that here. There's also too many opinions masquerading as facts. For example, the fact that breast milk is "immediately available" is not a plus nor a minus; neither is the fact that breast milk is free.</p>
<p>I also see nothing surrounding the bullying tactics that have come into fire over the past couple of years in terms of advertising, which HAVE been written about exstensively in parenting magazines. There's a REASON why this article is no longer a featured article.

<dd>Jaundice is a continuing problem in infants. Historically, there were concerns that breastfed infants had a higher rate of jaundice as a group. As far as I can find, however, current clicnial research has found that the issue is related to proper infant feeding, regardless of the nutrition source.

<p>Exactly who would proclaim themselves a "boob nazi"? I would love to see a reference or citation of any person referring to themselves that way. The correct term that you are looking for is Lactivist. A lactivist is a person who actively promotes breastfeeding as a public health measure, and to protest active discimination against breastfeeding mothers. Women do what they know how to do. Corporations who sell artifical baby milk make millions of dollars every year because the federal goverment purchases formula to give to low-income women for "free." If no woman in your family has breastfed for three generations, how likely would you be to do so?--<a href="../../../i/27/m/User%7EI%27m_nonpartisan_6c89.html" title="User:I'm nonpartisan">I'm Nonpartisan</a> 04:29, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The World Health Organization recommends that all mothers be encouraged to breastfeed.<sup id="_ref-WHO_breastfeeding_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WHO_breastfeeding" title="">[1]</a></sup> Hospitals that are accredited by the World Health Organization are tolerant of formula feeding but do not offer it to infants who can be breastfed as feeding a new baby with formula undermines the establishment of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>If the decision is made not to feed the child breast milk, or if breastfeeding is not possible, then <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_formula.html" title="Infant formula">infant formula</a> can be given to the infant, usually using a baby bottle. According to the WHO, infant formula is the last option for infant feeding as breastfeeding expressed milk of the baby's own mother and the expressed milk of another lactating mother (donor) should all be tried before resorting to infant formula. Infant formula may also be introduced as a supplemental liquid drink to weaned babies. Because it is proportioned for human babies it is healthier than simply drinking the milk from another mammal. Dry-nursing or drinking the milk of another mammal has been associated with high infant mortality.</p>
<p>While it is inferior to breastfeeding, infant formula has been effectively marketed and promoted to new mothers as a modern, easy or convenient option to feeding a baby. A 2004 <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> survey found that 34% of women incorrectly believe infant formula is very similar or the same as breast milk.<sup id="_ref-UK-DOH_2004_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UK-DOH_2004" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1979 the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baby_Food_Action_Network_d456.html" title="International Baby Food Action Network">International Baby Food Action Network</a> (IBFAN) was formed to help raise awareness of such practices as supplementary feeding of new babies with formula, inappropriate promotion of baby formula and to help change attitudes that discourage or inhibit mothers from breastfeeding their babies.</p>

<p>Being from the united states, I have no idea what the word uptake means as used in this article especially the table at the end. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.67.64.41_9edb.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.67.64.41">72.67.64.41</a> (talk) 20:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>As far as I am concerned this has been debated at length, with the decision to have the article in British English. However, any words not common to both variants should be avoided where possible. Is "uptake" really unknown in AmE? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 00:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies if I am not responding correctly, but I agree with the word uptake. I actually have an English minor from an American University and am fairly well read, but I have never come across uptake used in this manner. "Intake" perhaps? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephcarson_cf00.html" title="User:Stephcarson">Stephcarson</a> 14:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)stephcarson

<dd>I suspect the use of the word <i>uptake</i> is used in the business sense, as in these examples I just pulled from Google:
<ul>
<li>Dell "bullish" about Vista uptake</li>
<li>Looser rules could speed EMR uptake</li>
<li>Osteoarthritis: safety concerns over COX-2s will limit uptake</li>

<p>The following section was removed from the article, as most information here is covered elsewhere in the article. However, some of it may still be useful. Ciotog 09:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Breastfeeding may hurt some women. Sometimes this is related to an incorrect technique, but it usually eases over time. Milk ducts can block up on occasion, leading to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_engorgement.html" title="Breast engorgement">breast engorgement</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastitis.html" title="Mastitis">mastitis</a>, and should be addressed with massage and by encouraging the baby to suck from that side to keep it as empty as possible until the problem goes away. The presence of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidiasis.html" title="Candidiasis">thrush</a> in the nipples can also be painful. Limiting feeding time does not prevent soreness.</i></p>
<p><i>Cracked nipples can happen to anyone whose baby is not positioned correctly. The baby's rough tongue can also cause grazes and the suction can cause bruising if the mother and baby have not learned to latch and unlatch. To break the suction, mothers should wait for the baby to come off the breast, insert a finger just inside the baby's mouth, or press down gently on the breast. The use of nursing pads or poorly fitted bras can lead to breast and nipple pain, as can using hair dryers, sun lamps, soap, alcohol, perfume, deodorant, hair spray, body powder and incorrect use of breast pumps. Bottles and nipple shields may change the way the baby sucks, as well.</i></p>
<p><i>Some mothers apply medical grade <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanolin.html" title="Lanolin">lanolin</a> to sooth nipples. Mothers can also express milk and rub it on the nipples.<sup id="_ref-LL_FAQ_Heal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LL_FAQ_Heal" title="">[3]</a></sup> After about six weeks of breastfeeding, the process usually becomes easier, as both mother and baby learn the best technique for them. Mothers can also buy or rent <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_pump.html" title="Breast pump">breast pumps</a> to extract the milk, if nipple pain becomes unbearable. It should be noted, however, that pumping breast milk can also be associated with nipple pain, and is best used only as a temporary solution while the most common culprit, a poor latch, is improved.</i></p>
<p><i>Nipple damage due to breastfeeding can increase the likelihood of a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidiasis.html" title="Candidiasis">Candidiasis</a> infection. If a baby develops symptoms of oral thrush, both the mother and the child must be treated at the same time.<a href="http://safe-baby.net/articles/oral_thrush.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://safe-baby.net/articles/oral_thrush.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Proper antifungal treatment will help neutralise the infection and aid in the nipple healing process.</i></p>

<p>I have added reference to a South African study which says breastfeeding can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child in infants less than 6 months old - and is reported in the Lancet, so is peer reviewed. But I have to say the edits are a bit clumsy, also I wonder if this topic has been an issue in the article - though I could not find it in the discussion page. Anyway - it's there for now. <a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpringnuts_c117.html" title="User:Springnuts">Springnuts</a> 06:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also added it as an expanded note into the <i>When breastfeeding is harmful</i> section, as to make it easier for reader without having to refer to the <i>Benefit</i> section again.

<p>While not all women have husbands or partners, I can't say I'm keen on the term <i>secondary parent</i>. As a father myself, I can't say I'm keen on being so labelled! It also might not be appropriate in some situations where the woman's main support may be another relative (her mother or sister) or even a neighbour or friend. <i>Partner</i> would seem to be preferable, but another word might be even better. (<i>support person</i> is rather clumsy.) <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 05:37, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not keen on it myself, but sometimes compromises have to be made. Partner implies that the other caregiver is a, well, partner, which has connotations. How about secondary caregiver (whether partner, relative)? Ciotog 15:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't like the connotations of 'secondary'. How about 'other caregiver'? It doesn't have the implied put-down of 'secondary' and is therefore more NPOV. It would also cover the other caregiver without discriminating between a husband, lover, partner, relative or friend. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 01:38, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another option would be to say "father (or other caregivers)" which uses the majority case but acknowledges that there are other family situations. Ciotog 07:11, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That would be fine except if it was repeated several times in a passage. In that case it would become rather ponderous. Perhaps we could use 'father (or other caregiver) for the first occurrence in a paragraph and then use 'other caregiver' in all later occurrences. In that way we would get many of the advantages of the longer phrase but also gain the advantage of a shorter but more succinct phrase thereafter. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:35, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I have no problem with the sentence or the information it gives, I feel it is misplaced at the very beginning of the article where the word 'breastfeeding' is being defined.

<p>When writing it is usually best to use the simplest wording. Every time we use a big word unnecessarily we create unnecessary trouble for readers. Everyone knows what a <i>month</i> is; not everyone is sure of the meaning of <i>trimester</i>. As Fowler's <i>Modern English Usage</i> says in <b>love of the long word</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It need hardly be said that shortness is a merit in words. There are often reasons why shortness is not possible; much less often there are occasions when length, not shortness, is desirable. But it is a general truth that the short words are not only handier to use, but more powerful in effect; extra syllables reduce, not increase, vogour. This is particularly so in English, where the native words are short, and the long words are foreign....Good English does consist in the main of short words.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's why I prefer <i>month</i> to <i>trimester</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 03:05, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quotation you gave was talking about choosing a shorter word over a longer word, not using a longer phrase with shorter words in place of a long word with a precise definition.. You can't just substitute "trimester" with "month" - you have to say "in the first three months" instead of "in the first trimester", or "after the sixth month of pregnancy" instead of "in the last trimester", etc. If someone doesn't know what a trimester is, a <i>very</i> common word relating to pregnancy, then it behoves us to educate them (as you would expect in an encyclopedia). Same with "post-partum" instead of "after the birth". I would argue that this is <i>necessary</i> trouble. Ciotog 05:24, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Trimester is the word used by all midwives and doctors - it is the professional and correct term. Not to use it would be silly as it is the de facto use of referring to time in pregnancy in the most part. Further, most of our sources use the word and we should too. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:33, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
