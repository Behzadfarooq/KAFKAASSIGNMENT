<p>It has over 430 retail stores, operating as "The Beer Store", which sell beer to the general public. It also has the government legislated exclusive right to sell domestic beer to Ontario bars and restaurants, of which more than 17,000 are licensed to sell alcohol. The LCBO sells imported beer to bars and restaurants. Imported beer is available for sale at The Beer Store, but this product is actually imported by the LCBO and then sold to Brewers Retail.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewers_Retail_Inc._912f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The company began in 1927, with the end of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a> in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be a complete farce, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Canada_bc70.html" title="Provinces of Canada">Canadian provinces</a>), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail.</p>
<p><a name="Brewers_Retail_today" id="Brewers_Retail_today"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewers_Retail_Inc._912f.html" title="Edit section: Brewers Retail today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brewers Retail today</span></h2>
<p>Most <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_provinces.html" title="Canadian provinces">Canadian provinces</a> have since allowed privately owned stores to compete for sales of beer and wine while retaining tighter controls over the sale of spirits, while <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> has privatized its entire liquor industry. However, in Ontario, no changes have been made and Brewers Retail continues to sell over 90% of the beer sold in the province. Despite its near-monopoly, it is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries substantial listing fees for each beer carried in stock. This practice has been criticized as restricting competition in the Ontario beer market, especially from smaller brewers.</p>
<p>Although the province-owned <a href="../../../l/c/b/LCBO_0340.html" title="LCBO">LCBO</a> also sells beer to the general public, Brewers Retail is the sole distributor to restaurants and bars. The company refuses to grant <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit.html" title="Credit">credit</a> to any customer, meaning that even the most solvent establishments in Ontario must pay <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cash_on_delivery.html" title="Cash on delivery">cash on delivery</a> for their beer. This is a constant source of friction between Brewers Retail and the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospitality_industry.html" title="Hospitality industry">hospitality industry</a>.</p>
<p>Many stores (currently 129 of the 441 locations) have extended shopping hours. Hours vary in different cities, but many are open past 9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, with some stores open until 11p.m.</p>
<p>Despite their unpopularity, the BRI-aligned AGCO conducts a heavy-handed enforcement of the laws proscribing off-sales by sending <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undercover.html" title="Undercover">undercover</a> agents to perform random spot-checks. Observers have frequently noted that AGCO agents often seem more concerned with off-site consumption than they are with enforcing the legal <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_age.html" title="Drinking age">drinking age</a>. Bars can be heavily fined (and even lose their liquor licences) if they fail to take stringent steps to ensure that the beer and liquor they sell is consumed on-site.</p>
<p>Representatives for Brewers Retail claim that not offering credit means that everyone is treated the same way and also ensures that Brewers Retail and The Beer Store do not have to pass on costs associated with <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_debt.html" title="Bad debt">bad debts</a> to consumers. They also offer free delivery of orders province-wide (only if the licensee orders a certain amount otherwise there is a $25 delivery fee - as of 2005). The company claims that unlike the LCBO, it does not refuse shelf space to any eligible product approved for sale in Ontario.</p>
<p>The company claims that the Brewers Retail monopoly generates significant <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economies_of_scale.html" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> and that most of the savings generated compared to the systems used elsewhere are passed on to the consumer. <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/Columnists/Toronto/Christina_Blizzard/2004/08/08/pf-573357.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/Columnists/Toronto/Christina_Blizzard/2004/08/08/pf-573357.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The company claims that allowing corner stores to sell beer (as is done in neighbouring <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> where about 20,000 stores sell beer compared to 1,250 in Ontario - about 25 times the number of stores per capita) would cause increased distribution costs of about $4/case that in other provinces have been either passed on to consumers or absorbed by the government in the form of a tax cut. However, officials in Quebec and Alberta have strongly disputed these claims.</p>
<p>Brewers Retail further claims that selection is greatly reduced in the more liberalized jurisdictions, especially outside the major cities. They reason that a small, independent store will only have space and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cash_flow.html" title="Cash flow">cash flow</a> to stock a few major brands as opposed to the hundreds on the shelves of The Beer Stores. These claims have developed a hollow ring with the recent changeover of many Beer Store outlets from the Self-Serve format to the “Ice Cold Express” format. Critics of this change claim that its only purpose is to discourage customers from buying brands other than those of the Brewers Retail shareholders. One survey found that 78% of The Beer Store’s customers are opposed to the format change.</p>
<p>Supporters of more open competition counter that average Canadians are not normally connoisseurs of obscure beers and usually prefer the increased convenience that limited or full privatization has been responsible for in other provinces. They also contend that the LCBO is more than capable of filling the needs of consumers who want less common brands.</p>
<p>Brewers Retail has become politically controversial especially following the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molson.html" title="Molson">Molson</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/o/Coors.html" title="Coors">Coors</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger.html" title="Merger">merger</a>, which placed the majority of its ownership in the hands of foreigners. In 2005, Ontario's alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. However, the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Ontario_0e2c.html" title="Liberal Party of Ontario">Liberal</a> government rejected the proposals and refused to change the laws. The government has received considerable criticism for perpetuating a virtual monopoly on Ontario beer distribution by a foreign-owned <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartel.html" title="Cartel">cartel</a>.</p>
<p>Brewers Retail also received negative publicity in 2002 when it used monopolistic tactics to force the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brick_Brewing_Company_cb96.html" title="Brick Brewing Company">Brick Brewing Company</a> of <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo%2C_Ontario_d76e.html" title="Waterloo, Ontario">Waterloo</a> to stop offering beer in "<a href="../../../s/t/u/Stubbies.html" title="Stubbies">Stubbies</a>" by withholding supplies of industry standard "<a href="../../../l/o/n/Long-necked_bottle.html" title="Long-necked bottle">long-necked</a>" bottles.</p>
<p>In response to the growing unpopularity of the Brewers Retail monopoly, both main opposition parties in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> now oppose the status quo with regards to Brewers Retail, although they propose radically different alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_opposition.html" title="Official opposition">official opposition</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario_4e61.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario">Progressive Conservatives</a> propose abolishing the Brewers Retail monopoly and initiating a licencing process that would allow any private retailer who meets the necessary qualifications to sell beer and wine at least. The previous PC government of <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Harris_6536.html" title="Mike Harris">Mike Harris</a> mused about complete <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatization.html" title="Privatization">privatization</a> of the retail liquor industry, although the PC's did not carry this out during their time in office and their current policy on LCBO privatization is unclear.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democratic.html" title="Social democratic">social democratic</a> <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">New Democrats</a> on the other hand now support the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalization.html" title="Nationalization">nationalization</a> of Brewers Retail by means of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expropriation.html" title="Expropriation">expropriation</a>, with the company and its assets then being absorbed into the LCBO. Beer Stores would be converted into LCBO stores. In places where Beer Stores are too close to existing LCBO stores for it to make sense to maintain separate LCBO locations, the outlets would be merged with one store, shut down, and sold. The LCBO would hence become the sole distributor of alcoholic beverages in Ontario.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, The Beer Store offers 300 brands from 70 brewers in 436 stores province wide.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sapporo_Breweries_abab.html" title="Sapporo Breweries">Sapporo Breweries</a> reached a tentative deal to purchase Sleeman Breweries Ltd. for approx. $400 Million. Directors and Shareholders have agreed, and the terms and conditions are to be disclosed in the coming weeks. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/business/national/2006/08/11/sapporo-sleeman.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/story/business/national/2006/08/11/sapporo-sleeman.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>This takeover by Sapporo would mean that no portion of Brewers Retail would be held by any majority Canadian-owned entity, and will likely increase pressure on the government to force an end to the Brewers Retail near-monopoly.</p>
