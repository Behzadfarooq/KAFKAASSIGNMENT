<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lactation without pregnancy</span></h2>
<p>I removed the time period for the commencement of lactation in males and non-pregnant women. As far as I've researched and heard, the time frame varies widely from person to person and also depends on the amount of stimulation the nipples receive. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoele_Gilbert_cc0c.html" title="User:Joele Gilbert">Joele Gilbert</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unknown content of breast milk</span></h2>
<p>The following seems unlikely, or a non sequitur, or something. Surely human milk has been analyzed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The exact content of breast milk is unknown, but the nutrient content after this period is consistent"</dd>

<p>Have you seen the dreadful things said about wet nurses over in the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infanticide.html" title="Infanticide">Infanticide</a> article?</p>

<p>Human milk has been analysed to the extreme. It's not that we don't know a lot of what is in breast milk; it's that we keep discovering more and more ingredients. For one thing, breast milk is a living food; so it more than an issue of what the nutrient list is, it is a matter of cells interacting with cells. We just don't really understand everything about breast milk that makes it the best for a baby. We just know that it is impossible to duplicate by artificial means. I'm not a medical expert (just a mom who is interested), so I'll try to find a more technical explanation.</p>
<p>As for infanticide article... yikes!</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoele_Gilbert_cc0c.html" title="User:Joele Gilbert">Joele Gilbert</a></p>
<p><br />
Joele, I changed "the exact content of breast milk is unknown" to "the exact interactive properties of breast milk are unknown" because I think this is more what you are getting at. I also removed marijuana from your list of potential dangers, because there is NO documented suggestion that this is the case. I think it shows bias to include marijuana just because it is illegal ... it's very different from caffeine or crack. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESara_Parks_Ricker_d241.html" title="User:Sara Parks Ricker">Sara Parks Ricker</a></p>

<p>A comment on the image: I like it. It's very clinical and informative. I only have one minor criticism: it is a bit low-res. Is there a chance of getting a <i>slightly</i> higher resolution image?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Breastfeeding in public</span></h2>
<p>I think the article needs some discussion of breastfeeding in public. I'm not sure about other countries but in the UK it is illegal to stop a woman from breastfeeding publicly. In the Royal College of Midwifery journal (August 2004) there is an article about The National Gallery in London admitting a mistake after banning a breastfeeding mother from one of its exhibition rooms. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> 09:11, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I met Tina Kimmel in meatspace. She explained what I did not understand <i>(which is most of the subject).</i> Basically, this is it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sexual mutilation drives the baby into a catatonic state</li>
<li>After coming out of the catatonic state, the baby is usually too irritable to nurse</li>
<li>When the baby can nurse, placing the baby firmly against the body of the mother as the baby requires for a good latch, puts pressure on the genitals, causing excruciating pain, making nursing impossible</li>
<li>In order to keep babies from starving and dehydrating, mothers often bottlefeed the babies, which often leads to the babies getting used to bottlefeedind</li>
<li>By the time the baby can nurse comfortably again, the amount of milk the mother makes is much lower, leading to more bottlefeeding for preventing dehydration and starvation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tina Kimmel stated that <a href="http://lalecheleague.org/" class="external text" title="http://lalecheleague.org/" rel="nofollow">La Leche League International</a> refuses to condemn sexual mutilation because of the objection of a few religiously motivated women in the leadership.</p>
<p>I take full responsibility for errors <i>(this is all from memory).</i> You may write to Tina Kimmel thus:</p>
<p>"Tinna Kimmel " &lt; Tinakimmel @T Motherlove . D . O . T . Org &gt;</p>
<p>The address is spamproofed. Some assembly required.</p>

<p>I suggest that until you have some scientifically proven evidence to present you desist from pushing your POV anti-circumcision agenda in this regard. It should be clear that parents who choose to circumcise their sons should insist on the use of the best pain relief available, both during and post the procedure. Your scare tactic only works where pain relief is not used. The more people begin to insist on its use the less your scare tactic will work. - Robert the Bruce 05:33, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pain relief does not stop it entirely. Circumcision does have a negative effect on breastfeeding, no doubt, but as this is difficult to handle NPOVly then I think the article covers it well enough as is. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 07:17, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sentence seems kinda added on and out of place. Does a topic like circumcision really need a whole subtopic in breast feeding? It should be integrated or eliminated instead of added as an addendum. 04:51, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have now integrated the topic as a reason for Breast Refusal which is where it should of been in the first place.</p>

<dd><i>(summarized &amp; expanded)</i> <b>I have changed the bullet on circumcision to reference infant surgery and medical procedures, circumcision being a member of the later.</b> I googled and asked a pair of nurses about this. This edit covers more material under "discomfort", and properly notes that circumcision is neither a unique source of discomfort nor surgery (treatment of disease via incision). Circumcision is the one of the most common medical procedure which can cause discomfort, so its inclusion does not require a qualifier (e.g., <i>frequently</i>), as extra attention is already drawn by noting it. IMO, the correct descriptor for circumcision is <i>ritual body modification</i>, however (1) this term is likely to incite violence in peace-loving devout Christians, and (2) a criticism of circumsion is not necessary in this article, but it's prevalence warrants noting its effects on <i>breastfeeding</i>. The amount of notation this requires above and beyond other medical procedures, <i>in an article on Breastfeeding</i>, is a matter for debate.—<a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaelin_2c3c.html" title="User:Daelin">Daelin</a> 13:38, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No criticism is intended in the article, but then again one cannot hide scientific knowledge and research. Effects of circumcision are related to breastfeeding in some people's minds, and not in others. There is no reason both views cannot be respected. Are we to add breastfeeding information to the circumcision article to appease the puritanical anti-sexual POV? Please remember that circumcision is not medically-indicated surgery to treat disease or injury, so blur that line deliberately is POV. I believe this can be presented in some neutral way. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 18:36, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> had added back a paragraph on <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> three times to the section on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Maternal_bonding.html" title="Maternal bonding">maternal bonding</a>.

</dl>
<p>However, given that the section on maternal bonding is about the benefits of breastfeeding for bonding, not vice versa, and that the effects of surgery, such as <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>, on breastfeeding is already mentioned in the section on breast refusal, I don't think this is necessary and have removed it twice (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa knott</a> did once too).

<dd>Give me time to check the references and I might push to have the first scrubbed as well. Look at the reference that Dan is linking to. It only mentions breast feeding. There is no mention of bonding at all. What's more, the paper is not research, it's a pov statement in itself. The paper says words to the effect of "circumcision causes children to be unable to breastfeed" it backs this claim up by a reference to a research paper. However that research paper says "Feeding behavior deteriorated in breast- and bottle-fed infants in both groups, and acetaminophen did not seem to influence this deterioration." I.e. the research paper is talking about both sorts of feeding, not breatfeeding in particluar.Therefore it is off topic here. What's more despite wqhat Dan says below, adding it in here does not NPOV the topic, it merely adds complete speculation to it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Not the skater)</a> 19:51, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(EDIT CONFLICT) Talking to Dan, I don't understand your question. If circumcision causes pain, and this affects feeding then by all means add that fact to the circumcision article. But it's off topic here. This article is about breast feeding. You can't just go down the cirp list and say to yourself "Oh look this article is about breastfeeding, I'll stick on wikipedia's breastfeeding page, this articles about sexual intercourse, I'll stick it on wikipedias sexual intercourse page, this ones about infant circumcision i'll stick it on Wikipedia's infant page.

<dd>Breastfeeding is impacted. Look at the article - there is a big section on nicotine, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. If those have impacts, so does circumcision. I ask only for NPOV here, not for personal attack or judgement. If we are to relocate breastfeeding into the circumcision article, should we do the same for cigarettes and alcohol. As you said, what on earth do those have to do with breastfeeding? Personally, I believe it's better to just leave every potential negative here and let the reader judge.

As I said, the is research there, and circumcision is usually not medically-indicated as the article hints.

Wikipedia distinguishes between <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a> (the former is to treat disease or injury). Even voluntary adult circumcision is plastic surgery, not surgery proper without some diagnosis.

This is more <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> than the strong anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco slant in the article, and the tenuous mention of marijuana which has little or no research.

<dd>Plastic (or cosmetic) surgery isn't true surgery which by many medical definitions is usually some kind of repair or a treatment of a disease. But some loose definition, all mutilation is surgery -- ear piercing is too probably. But this is an encyclopedia, and we should expect some scientific accuracy with our words. With regard to maternal bonding, I thought my edit did just that. The totally unproven POV is that circumcision is unrelated to breastfeeding problems. There is zero evidence to prove that, yet such slanted POV is asserted so emotionally. The article already has anti-tobacco and anti-alcohol POV in there without a shred of scientific research cited. Seems like there's work to do there. So it doesn't seem at all unreasonable to mention the Marshall study <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/marshall2/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/marshall2/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> which covers both feeding and bonding, just to say some research exists and any parents planning to breastfeed can make up their own minds on circumcision. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 23:13, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco slant is still there. Why are those presented as "harmful", instead of leaving that value-loaded opinion up to the reader? NPOV says we should not advocate a position. If circumcision is censored as to its potential harmful effects, even though there is scientific evidence of bonding problems, why are cigarettes and alcohol opposed so blatantly? That judgemental stuff should all be taken out, and the relevance research simply cited. With regard to breastfeeding, the effects of circumcision on bonding are not even presented as a parental choice in this article, despite the fact that parents can choose to prevent it. Instead, other parental choices (smoking and drinking) are judged as "harmful". How can you say that isn't POV when it judges one activity as "bad", and the other is not even mentioned as a choice? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 17:55, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Circumcision is already mentioned in a negative light as a potential issue with respect to breast refusal, which is directly relevant to this article, which is about breastfeeding.</li>
<li>The maternal bonding section is about the effects of breadfeeding on maternal bonding; it is not about other things that can influence maternal bonding. If circumcision has negative effects on maternal bonding then the article on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Maternal_bonding.html" title="Maternal bonding">maternal bonding</a> should say so, not this one - this article is about breastfeeding not maternal bonding.</li>
<li>The section "Negative effects upon the infant" explains that breastfeeding can be harmful to the infant in certain circumstances. Circumcision is not one of those circumstances - unless there is some other issue at play, breastfeeding does not have harmful effects on a circumcised child (irrespective of whether circumcision is a good thing or a bad thing). There are peer reviewed and published academic articles saying that alcohol and nicotine can be harmful in any event (find me someone who thinks they are not) and some of those articles say the same thing in the specific context of breastfeeding. Hence, this is mentioned as one of the potentially harmful circumstances mentioned in that section.</li>
</ol>
<p>You still haven't responded to my two questions above - I don't see why this article on breastfeeding should mention the detrimental effects (if any) of circumcision on maternal bonding, rather than those effects being mentioned in the article on maternal bonding, and you have not suggested any language to change the reference to surgery (including circumcision) - for what it is worth, I still think circumcision is a form of surgery. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 18:23, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>ALoan, you make several good points. The POV slant is not exactly what you say, but is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Circumcision is not presented as a choice in this article, but only hinted as happening somehow, as though it blames the doctor or the hospital. These days, it is parental choice. Drinking and smoking are clearly implied as being choices (and condemned as bad ones too).</li>
<li>Circumcision is mentioned as surgery instead of cosmetic. There is no birth defect, no injury, no disease. The procedure should be listed without that connotation, and the word "discomfort" (not even in Wikipedia) is purely a euphemism for pain and trauma (which are articles in Wikipedia). The word is POV to weaken what is stated by research.</li>
<li>This issue is related mainly to breastfeeding and bonding. But maternal bonding lasts throughout childhood. Maternal bonding is a significantly broader context than just breastfeeding, and much of the research focuses on feeding habits of babies.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe the line on breast refusal could be changed from "Discomfort, possibly due to recent surgery or medical procedures (for example, circumcision)" to "Pain, possibly due to surgery or circumcision procedures" which leaves the judgement of medical necessity in neutral territory.</p>
<p>I don't think it's hard to put this in NPOV format in the bonding section. "Some people believe breastfeeding and bonding is impacted negatively by the choice of circumcising a child, and research supports this. Circumcision is common in the United States, and parents should take this into consideration before making this decision." Any objections? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 19:18, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Circumcision and the affect it has should be mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> article.

<dd>I'm not clear what factual objection you have. The disruption of bonding is relevant to breastfeeding -- a bond is essential, and any likely source of concern is warranted. If your opinion is that it's not in the right place, then how about relocating the anti-alcohol and anti-smoking propaganda to the right article? Those relate to the harm the <b>substance</b> might cause, not the actual act of breastfeeding itself. I'm only asking for you to formulate a neutral view on this, and not erase valid causes of problems.

<p>As someone who is strongly opposed to non-therapeutic circumcision of children I agree with ALoan and violet/riga regarding DanP's comments. Circumcision is already mentioned in the breast refusal section of the article in an appropriate way. The controversy over whether circumcision should be called "surgery" or "permanent body modification" belongs in the circumcision article, not the breastfeeding article.

<dd>OK, that's fine. I wasn't trying to add controversy, but just wanting to leave out any value-judgements either way (which is NPOV). Relocating this issue to the circumcision article is agreeable with me. But again, why is the prejudice against smokers and drinkers in this article? That should be toned down just a bit, as there are some who breastfeed without quitting those activities. NPOV is supposed to be non-negotiable, and the marijuana reference is about as irrelevant as outer space in this article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 21:01, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nicotine and alcohol cause problems for breastfeeding infants. It is better for breastfeeding women not to smoke or drink excessively. That is an undisputed fact and should be discussed in the article, just like it is. Yes, many women still do it but if they think it has no negative effects then, frankly, they're wrong and no pedia should pander to them. As for marijuana please refer to this statement as linked to at the relevant section of the article:</dd>

<p>Almost by definition, <b>a fact</b> cannot start with the words "it is better that". That is a matter of degree and opinion. "Better" is a comparison and an opinion. Whether it is opinion backed by the AAP, Congress, or all of humanity, it is still opinion. Saying "no pedia should pander to them" is simply POV -- how can it not be? NPOV is to state both sides without claiming one is right. If the article says it is a fact that alcohol/tobbacco causes some problems, that is fine with me. But to judge the act as "harmful" is not magically more justfiable than judging the signature of consent to leave a boy scarred and it's impact on breastfeeding (bottle feeding is easier, so please don't blur them together with regard to bonding). I respect your opinion and mostly agree with it, but this is an encyclopedia.

<dd>Indeed, if we were to say circumcision was <i>potentially</i> harmful (which even I don't push for just on grounds of POV) and then cite sources where babies have died, babies were in severe pain and didn't breastfeed with articles to support that, that is twisted by advocates of circumcision. "Harmful" is a cheap shot at smoking mothers, whether potential consequences are there or not. I can certainly respect the opinions and research behind it, but the selective bias on both issues is obvious. In any case, Violetriga's latest addition is good enough for me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 22:24, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>October 2004</p>
<p>Suffering at the Breast is Not Best</p>
<p>La Leche League Censors While Mothers and Sons Suffer</p>
<p>To La Leche League Board of Directors, Staff, Leaders, Members, and Alumnae:</p>
<p>In a shocking display of mixing with religious causes, La Leche League’s Board of Directors has let a small group of women defeat the free exchange of information on circumcision’s negative impact on breastfeeding success.</p>
<p>In April of 2003, NOCIRC signed a contract with La Leche League International as an exhibitor and paid for exhibit space for their international conference held in July 2003. Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors. Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.</p>
<p>NOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally. We are asked back year after year. Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision. We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue. Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.</p>
<p>NOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members. The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side. Attendees who were interested would have appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.</p>
<p>The vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents. Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC. This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk. Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her son’s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.</p>
<p>La Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations. The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care, including the requirement that service providers must “discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.” (on-line at <a href="http://MotherFriendly.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://MotherFriendly.org/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>).</p>
<p>The breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum. In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, “The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,” available at <a href="http://NOCIRC.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://NOCIRC.org/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the mother’s breast after circumcision. The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition. The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.</p>
<p>La Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization. However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization. A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint. For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim moms. Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk.</p>
<p>The Board’s action is hypocritical in light of LLL’s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents. LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL.</p>
<p>LLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding. New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons. NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens.</p>
<p>NOCIRC is not asking for an endorsement from LLL nor are we asking for leaders to discuss circumcision during meetings. We are simply asking to be one of the many outside organizations and merchants not directly involved in breastfeeding that exhibit each year at their excellent conferences.</p>
<p>Are you surprised by the League’s lack of courage on this issue? If so, then write to the board at <a href="http://lalecheleague.org/BOD/BOD.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lalecheleague.org/BOD/BOD.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Demand that they stop this petty censorship and trust conference attendees to make their own informed choice about circumcision. On behalf of babies yet to be born and parents yet to be educated, demand that they take the moral high road and let NOCIRC be a participant in breastfeeding success.</p>
<p>On behalf of all the children, thanks!</p>

<p>A naive male writes: I'm told that ovulation ceases while a woman is actively breastfeeding. Presumably an evolutionary reason for this would be to ensure that an infant was properly weaned before its mother gave birth to another child, but the article mentions that a woman can breastfeed children of different ages. Is there any truth in what I was told? Don't worry - I'm not so naive that I'd want to <i>rely</i> on it as a form of birth control!!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambisset_c392.html" title="User:Adambisset">Adambisset</a> 00:54, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I took a course about Women in Western Civilization. The course was not about famous women, but about the history of the treatment, conditions, and liberty of women. As a side note, the professor spent part of a class talking about historical contraceptives. She said that her doctor had told her, incorrectly, that breastfeeding could prevent conception, or at least full term pregancy. Historically this <b>was</b> true, however modern women are <i>too well fed</i> for this to work. The contraception works somehow because a woman, historically, could not nourish a growing fetus and breast feed at the same time, and the breast feeding took priority. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaelin_2c3c.html" title="User:Daelin">Daelin</a> 11:55, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Now this article is in excess of 41k I think it needs breaking down a little. I'm thinking of creating a Benefits, contraindications and complications of breastfeeding article to take those two large sections out, but the article name is hardly great. The other idea was for a History of breastfeeding article, but I think the content works well in this one and the former idea is better. So, can anyone think of a better article title than that first one? Or another way of splitting this, perhaps.</p>

<dd>What constitutes "necessary" can be subjective. A mom who is home with her baby can decide for herself what would make using a bottle "necessary", it isn't a set-in-stone rule. If a bottle is introduced too early, nipple preference can cause huge breastfeeding difficulties. In real life some babies switch back and forth no problem but a few have trouble. In real life it can be extremely difficult to get an older baby to accept a bottle, but the fact is, a bottle is not the only option for an older baby,(sippy cups become a possibility after the baby is sitting up) so it is less of an issue. I too am interested in seeing if any studies have been done in this area. Maybe if people are coming into this section asking questions about the topic the section needs to include clearer explanation and/or options.</dd>

<p>"Breastfeeding mothers must use caution if they regularly consume nicotine through tobacco smoking.

The fantasy is that Motherhood is so special and sacred that a mother's body will (and should!) sacrifice itself to keep her baby healthy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fathers' effect on breastfeeding choice?</span></h2>
<p>"If looking after the child while the mother is away, the father may find it impractical or inappropriate to feed expressed breast milk to the infant. This may remove the choice of the mother of whether to breastfeed her child or not."</p>
<p>What does this mean? What would be <i>more</i> practical, a bottle of formula would have to be fed the same way; and what is meant by "inappropriate"? Is this a reference to the family dynamics or social beliefs in some cultures? I would like to see some clarification of how a father's discomfort with feeding expressed milk could possibly "remove the choice of the mother". Can it be reworded to show both sides of the theoretical situation - it is referring to the idea that a father's discomfort with feeding the baby would be an insurmountable problem and make a woman give up the thought of nursing her baby? Can we see some references to the father's needs being the priority, and then balance them by including some possible solutions to the problem? I think both could be presented briefly, those few sentences as it stands make it appear as though the father has the absolute power to take away a mother's choice. And maybe in some places they do, but to say so and not mention any alternative seems unbalanced.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I take it that "impractical" refers to the fact that the mother must express her milk and leave it, perhaps therefore being impractical for the mother more than the father. "Inappropriate" would refer to men feeling odd at feeding the mother's milk to the child, especially if the couple are separated. This would remove the choice of the mother if the father has access rights but refuses to give the child breast milk. Perhaps it could be slightly reworded to better reflect this. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:02, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the father has visitation with his child and refuses to feed expressed milk, it does not remove the mother's choice to breastfeed. That is an opinion statement and should be reworded. The mother can pump while the baby is with the father and resume nursing when the baby is returned home. With an older baby, she may choose to cease pumping and just nurse whenever mother and baby are together. It is simply untrue that if a father doesn't like feeding expressed milk, the mother has no choices. She does. She may not like them and they may make life more complicated for a while, but those subjective issues are not typically addressed in a reference article. It would be more accurate to say that a father's discomfort with feeding expressed milk can have an affect on breastfeeding management choices made by the mother.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Physiological and Historical Oversights</span></h2>
<p>This article overlooks the physiological fact that a healthy new mother will automatically produce breast milk after childbirth, whether she wants to or not. Modern medicine does have the capability to artificially curb the lactation process, but the POV of the article ignores the fact that her developed lactation and the breastfeeding of her newborn is the natural, healthy course of events. The POV takes the position that breastfeeding is a chosen alternative to formula feeding; when in fact it is the opposite that is true.</p>
<p>The “History of Breastfeeding” barely touches on mothers who actually breastfed their own children, moving quickly to alternative methods and the employment of wet nurses. There is no discussion of the inherent advantages of breastfeeding for a woman and child in the wilderness, or in a similar primitive setting, as compared to the modern world. This would more accurately titled as the “History of Breastfeeding Alternatives”.</p>
<p>There is no discussion of how life in a primitive setting favors breastfeeding and lactation development as a survival tool for her family (and/or tribe) to help ensure their strength and survival under extreme conditions such as seasonal or winter famine, or recovery from illness or injury, both of which were commonplace in the primitive wilderness environment. A woman’s inherent ability to induce lactation and release her internal stores as food for others increases her value to a mate or to the tribe, thus ensuring her protection and survival in the harshness of the wilderness. This supports the theory that during early development of the human species women nursed their mates as well as their young and maintained their milk supply for most of their adult lives.</p>
<p>While this article is overall very good, it appears to look at breastfeeding as an oddity of human nature instead of the natural and normal human function that it is. It also leaves a vast area of related material unexplored. See "Roman Charity" to learn more. <a href="../../../m/l/k/User%7EMlklvr_27e1.html" title="User:Mlklvr">Mlklvr</a> 18:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accuracy Issues</span></h2>
<p>"Mothers can also buy or hire breast pumps to extract the milk, if nipple pain becomes unbearable."</p>
<p>While this is not an untrue statement (yes, mothers can get a pump and use it when they have sore nipples) it is based on the incorrect assumption that the use of the pump is a <i>solution</i> to the problem of sore nipples. It gives the impression that a mother can simply switch to pumping instead of nursing from the breast, give her baby the expressed milk, and all will be well. That is not the case. I have never seen pumping offered as a first choice solution for soreness in any reputable breastfeeding resource, nor was that a solution in the eyes of the lactation consultants I saw after my son was born. I have seen it offered merely as a very short term way to obtain a brief respite from difficulties, while in the process of solving the problem, but with the caveat that pumping and bottlefeeding have their own drawbacks and possible complications that would be better avoided.</p>
<p>Most breastfeeding experts agree that the main cause of soreness is incorrect latch which can have various causes. Pumping does nothing to remove the cause of the problem, and in some cases can itself be painful. A breastfeeding mother with sore nipples must seek help to determine the cause of the problem so that it may be solved. I would like to see this sentence replaced with a fact based, expert supported statement about what a mother can do if she has sore nipples.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the latch is the problem then expression can be used as a short-term solution to allow the nipples to become less sore and then, having taken advice regarding proper latch, give the mother the chance to start breastfeeding again. The sentence does not say that it is a good thing to stop breastfeeding and change over to EBM. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:08, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In addition, the extremely negative use of descriptions of pain make it easy to see why some parts of this article are being seen as biased. Referring to breastfeeding as something that has to be "endured" and can cause "unbearable" pain seems less than neutral. We can surely describe the very real problems some breastfeeding mothers have in a truly neutral way, without resorting to descriptives that seem designed to evoke negative reaction.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere does it say that it happens to everyone. We should avoid weasel terms such as "some women" and "a small amount of" but I'm not aware of any published statistics regarding the number of women that have sore nipples. The word "unbearable" is fine in this situation because the woman should only turn to expressing if she can no longer bear the pain. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:08, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

While breast pumps are not a first choice for dealing with pain, women can turn to them if they want to continue to feed their child (expressed) breastmilk while allowing nipples to heal and learning to latch better. --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWestendgirl_7150.html" title="User:Westendgirl">Westendgirl</a> 05:44, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once again I've just had to revert changes to this article because an unregistered user has introduced biased wording. This time it changed the lead, which is supposed to give a summary of the article rather than present a one-sided view.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree that breastfeeding is the correct thing to do, but we must reflect that some people choose not to. Yes, it is recommended by WHO and most other organisations but the rewrites keep adding a wording bias which almost implies that you're an unfit mother if you don't breastfeed your child.</p>
<p>Please can these changes be discussed here before changing the article, just like the above two sections are working to a solution. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 11:40, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

Just quoting you where you said "adding a wording bias which almost implies that you're an unfit mother if you don't breastfeed your child." -- hardly an absurd accusation when it's there in your own words. Scientific *fact* is that all other feeding methods are inferior. Says nothng about fitness as a mother as you seem to feel it implies. Or are you trying to say that you believe that formula is just as good?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why on Earth would you think I was talking about my inner feelings when I said that?! As I've already said I agree that it is better for the infant but there are many women that choose (or are forced or even advised in some countries in history) not to breastfeed. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 12:20, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reading through the breastfeeding information offered by these sources, so far I find nothing to indicate that medical professionals consider any other form of nutrition equal to breastmilk. The statement above certainly does appear to be expert supported and in no way a misrepresentation of the current best scientific information. There is no valid reason to remove it from the article unless it can be shown to be a subjective statement rather than an accurate portrayal of the current information on the topic of infant nutrition.</dd>

<dd>Agreed, and the edits you have made are good ones. I think that many mothers see teething as an appropriate time to wean because most tend to not want to continue after a few months of feeding.

<p>Could be a good topic to touch on in a "breastfeeding myths" section. It comes up freqently among mothers in conversation. Hormones like relaxin soften tissues during pregnancy, and engorgement happens when the milk comes in whether a mother breastfeeds or not. Genetics also plays a part.</p>

<dd>Cirp.Org is unbiased. It even has your biased studies like that one out of Africa. I am certain that those men were sexually active while they healed. I am sure that they celebrated their præpucectomies by going to the bordello the night of they day they were mutilated. I among others pointed out the methodological flaws over a year ago and told them that destroying the controlgroup would make followup impossible. They did it anyway. ¿Do you believe that if the researchers would not have destroyed the controlgroup we would test everyone in study on 2006-01-01, eliminate all HIV-positive people people and then would retest the remainder of the participants on 2007-01-01, the difference between the two groups would be so extreme?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of your studies are biased such as that study Wiswell (a foreskin is 125 dollars to me) did. Before you write it, this is what you call the Lexis-Theory. Well, I stand by it: Ob/Gyns mutilate the genitals of mothers and babies with unnecessary Episiotomies, Circumcisions, and Cæsarian Sections just so they can add the fees to the bill. That is why Ob/Gyns are sued so much. I would not let an Ob/Gyn near my wife; I would insist on a Midwife.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you do not like Cirp.Org, ¿why do not you link to Circs.Org, the Cirp.Org-Clone you created? ¡Oh! ¡That is right! ¡Circs.Org is a joke! ¡None take it seriously because it only lists studies favorable to your side! Let us take Wiswell and UTIs as an example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wiswell did his so called study in the 1980s and published in 1987. He did his study in the US-Army. The military, in order to function, has to standardize, sometimes arbitrarily. The Doctors circumcised all boys except those who were underweight, sick, premature, and/or had congenital abnormalities of the urinary track. To top it all off, the sick babies were isolated from their mothers who could not give them their antibody-rich milk — none can say this thread is offtopic now. Army-doctors, in order to justify the standard Army-Circumcision later, would forcibly retract the præpuce for irritating it, so that they tell the parents that the præpuce is diseased and has to go. Frankly, the study was methodologically flawed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Followup studies done with proper methodology consistently failed to find protective effects of circumcision against UTIs. Indeed, an Israeli study found the opposite. <a href="http://cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/cohen/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/cohen/" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, this ignores little things like pain and suffering, the reduction in sexual pleasure, complications like meatal stenosis (over 10 times greater than the supposed benefits), or cost (using the finding of Wiswell, it takes about 198 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI, and given that treating a UTI with antibiotics costs about 100 dollars while a circumcision costs about 400 dollars, using Wiswells own numbers, circumsing is about 800 times more expensive than not circumcising).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Comparing Cirp.Org with Circs.Org on UTI, one finds that Circs.Org has 13 articles while Cirp.Org has Cirp.Org has 98. You only include articles in your favor because you know the bulk of the evidence is against you while we include everything because the bulk of the evidence is with us.</dd>

All of those thirdparties think highly of Cirp.Org.  ¿What do people think about Circs.Org?  Not one third party has endorsed Circs.Org.  Before I restore the link to the unbiased site which publishes both side because it knows the truth is on its side, let us compare Cirp.Org and Circs.Org on breastfeeding
</pre>
<pre>
Cirp.Org: 47 articles
</pre>
<pre>
Circs.Org: 0 articles
</pre>
<pre>
Circs.Org seems about as Fair and Balanced as FoxNews.Com, while Cirp.Org is full of articles published in peerreviewed Journals listing both the good and the bad because we know that the truth is on our side.

<dd>Editorial and the republished articles are clearly separated. Even peerreviewed journals have editorials, but they clearly separate it for the published studies. Cirp.Org does not try to be what it is not. The webmasters know that involuntary sexual mutilation of nonconsenting adults and all minors without medical necessity is wrong, but they also know that the truth is on their side. They publish <i>everything.</i> At <a href="../../../c/i/r/Talk%7ECircumcision_a023.html" title="Talk:Circumcision">talk:circumcision</a>, we established that the republished reports are not changed and that if Cirp.Org fails to republish a paper, a gentle reminder will get it on the site quickly. ¿Can you say the same about Circs.Org? It is not like it would be hard for Circs.Org to be more comprehensive, since it gets most of its articles from Cirp.Org. If Cirp.Org is so biased, then ¿why does Cirp.Org have articles on it worthy of republish by Circs.Org? This brings up another point:</dd>

<dd>Cirp.Org does not hide that it is run by Intactivists. It just presents every study and lets people read the studies. Circs.Org pretends to be totally unbiased, while giving only the subset of studies most strongly supporting its position. Going back to the example of UTIs, Cirp.Org republishes 98 studies. Circs.Org republishes 13. I would not be surprised if at least 10 came from Cirp.Org. For our purposes, let us suppose that all 13 come from Cirp.Org. While pretending to be neutral. Circs.Org only republishes the one seventh of studies which support circumcision. That seems misleading to me.</dd>

<dd>Gentlemen, can we please keep the circumcision holy war from metastasizing into the <b>Breastfeeding</b> article? Whoever is wrong and whoever is right, you must be able to see that this is an awful lot of text to be spending on what, in context of breastfeeding, is little more than a footnote.

For goodness' sake, I've removed the Howard reference. There are many problems with the whole issue, and I think a small study of 44 infants which looked <i>only</i> into paracetamol (as opposed to e.g. prilocaine) and <i>only</i> addressed Gomco clamp circumcions is not really encyclopedia material. The findings cannot possibly be extended to daily practice. In my personal experience, I've never seen an infant breastfeed as good as in the hours after a non-anaesthetised circumcision! <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:27, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

Case in point: my own three sons were all circumcised at home at 8 days at the traditional Brith Milah. Breastfeeding was well established, my milk supply was ample, and the babies had a full week to perfect their skills. As soon as the mohel was finished, the baby was whisked back to mom's breast for a comforting feed, with no problems at all! This is so unlike what I observe in the hospital again and again, with babies shocked into a stupor, some having not yet even suckled well, milk volume not yet increased, and mom not yet experienced with feeding." -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 09:54, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Many lactation consultants are aware of the fact that infant circumcision may be a factor in breastfeeding failure.[1] Boys who are circumcised in the hospital before a successful pattern of breastfeeding has been established are at greater risk for breastfeeding failure than boys who are circumcised several days after birth when a successful pattern of breastfeeding has been established.[2] In their book <i>Impact of Birthing Practices on Breastfeeding: Protecting the Mother and Baby Continuum</i> Mary Kroeger and Linda J. Smith discuss circumcision as a possible cause for breastfeeding failure.[3]
</pre>
<pre>
Anesthesia used during the surgery does not reduce the post-operative pain caused by pressure on the circumcision wound during breastfeeding.  If a lactation consultant is aware that pain from the circumcision wound may be a factor in a boy refusing to breastfeed, she can suggest ways for the mother to hold her son to reduce the pressure on the circumcision wound.

<dd>They do provide circumstantial support for the <i>hypothesis</i>, yes, Dan. But how many letters were actually published on the subject, I wonder. The problem with anecdotal evidence is that it is fundamentally subjective, and often misleading. When assessing it, it's wise to be aware of the fallacy of the striking instance (superficially, "I walked across the road and got hit by a bus" supports the hypothesis that every time you cross the road you will be involved in an accident. Only empirical data can address the matter objectively, though common sense reasoning and <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> are a good substitute).</dd>

<dd>It's certainly possible, but it isn't an established fact. As you can see, I originally reworded it to say "such as circumcision with ineffective anaesthesia", which was supported by the link. I don't strongly object to including circumcision with that qualification, though I think it is unnecessary - after all, it is blindingly obvious that circumcision is a medical procedure. However, as Jfd and one of the letters noted, it may be necessary to craft a further exception for circumcisions performed later on. These caveats, combined with the fact that the evidence is so tentative, suggest that perhaps the article would be better off without. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:16, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
The article explicitly states that "Pain or discomfort; for example, due to recent surgery or medical procedures" can be a cause of breast refusal.  It does not state that there is a direct link whereby all newborns having a medical procedure will have feeding difficulties.  Circumcision can cause problems, mainly discomfort, and that can lead to feeding troubles.
</pre>
<pre>
I'm sure that some of you have checked the archive about this, but the inclusion of any mention of circumcision was based on a compromise.  The article used to have a much bigger chunk of text about the two things, but that was certainly not appropriate.  I personally don't think it needs a mention over and above it being hinted at with "recent surgery or medical procedures", but to maintain the previous peace I lean towards keeping a small reference to it.

<dd>You might have a point if infant circumcision in the United States were as uncommon as it is in Europe. However in the United States infant circumcision is the most common form of surgery performed on infants. Approximately half of all boys born in the United States are circumcised before they are discharged from the hospital after birth. Boys who are circumcised in the hospital before a regular pattern of breastfeeding has been established have a greater risk for breastfeeding failure than boys who are circumcised after a regular pattern of breastfeeding has been established and boys who are not circumcised.</dd>

<dd>I don't think that anyone will disagree on grounds of prevalence, Dan. However, relevance is questionable. The evidence for the purported link is one small-scale study using Tylenol (aka paracetamol for those of us in the UK) plus two opinion pieces in letter form and a book noting the study previously mentioned. In contrast, consider the evidence for other statements in the article. As an example, consider the statement that breastfeeding helps prevent diabetes. Searching PubMed for "breastfeeding diabetes" returns 212 articles (not all relevant, of course, but what a difference)! - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:09, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not opposed to the "such as circumcision" reference; it seems that the recent bout of edit-warring was in fact centered around Jake's fairly conservative link-tweaking. His edit removed the link to the advocacy site, cirp.org (can I call it an advocacy site without upsetting people?), but left in a link to the actual study at nih.gov. I think the follow-on edit war was a result of people getting sick of the issue. I suspect that Jfdwolff's surgical removal of the entire reference (pun intended) was mostly due to frustration at seeing the amount of bickering that was going on over what is essentially, in the context of this article, a mostly unimportant sideshow. My personal opinion is that the "right" balance is for circumcision to be mentioned, and the nih.gov link to be provided as a reliable, neutral, non-advocate source. But, frankly, if the various parties involved here can't get themselves under control and insist on making the article about <i>breastfeeding</i> a proxy war for their own personal feelings about male genitalia, I am not above forcing the issue by removing the mention and reference entirely until the warring editors have settled their differences and both share the exact same position on male circumscision, sometime after the heat-death of the universe. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:31, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consider a hypothetical Pepsi employeee editing an article on avoiding dehydration. "Drinking water or soft drinks regularly helps avoid dehydration" includes Pepsi. However, he wants to promote Pepsi, so he edits it to read "Drinking water or soft drinks (eg., Pepsi Cola or all-new Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi) regularly helps avoid dehydration." Another editor removes this.

<dd>It is important to mention circumcision in the section on breast refusal because circumcision is by far the most common form of surgery perform on infants during the first few days of life in the United States. Some contributors to this discussion with a pro-circumcision POV want to delete any mention of circumcision from the section on breast refusal. The only purpose served by deleting the reference to circumcision is to protect a cultural and religious practice from the unpleasant, but relevant, fact that infant circumcision may be a factor in breast refusal. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 07:47, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've been lurking here for a bit... Thought I'd add my $0.02... I am against routine infant circumcision. Let me first get that out on the table so no one can accuse me of having a pro-circ bias. However, I think Jakew's analogy is very apt. When a category is listed, to then point out one specific item in that category is to emphasize that one. Unless there is good reason to emphasize that particular item, it shouldn't be specifically pointed out. I'm open to hearing suggestions as to why circumcision does merit emphasis above other forms of surgery (I'll throw two out onto the table right now for anyone who wants to debate them:1) to remind people that circumcision is indeed surgery, when it's prevalence leads to some people thinking that it's status as a surgical procedure is a mere technicality and 2) it's the most commonly performed surgical procedure, so <i>if</i> any specific procedure is mentioned it makes sense that this would be the one), but until and unless some sort of consensus is reached, it should be assumed to already be covered in the general category of "recent surgeries". --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 03:25, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. Circumcision should be mentioned for the reasons you cited: (1) many people do not think of circumcision as surgery and (2) it is the most common surgery performed on infants. Circumcision should also be mentioned because it is an elective, non-therapeutic procedure that can easily be delayed until after a successful pattern of breastfeeding has been established. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 21:23, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Painful medical procedures can interfere with establishment of breastfeeding. <a href="http://Cirp.Org/library/birth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://Cirp.Org/library/birth/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> Therefore one should therefore use anæsthesia for necessary medical procedures, and avoid all unnecessary procedures, whether medical or not, such as branding, circumcision, piercing, tatooing, et cetera. The unnecessary procedure of circumcision is especially to be avoided because not only does does the unnecessary procedure of circumcision cause unjustifiable torturous pain, but in order to latch properly, the baby must place his genitals against his mother, causing excruciating pain just as the baby starts feeding.</i></p>

It seems like this version above says it all.  It is accurate.  I belive we should add it to the article.

I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but if the circumcisionadvocates will leave the main article alone, so shall I.  Michael Glass did some excellent wordsmithing of the introduction, so I would like an exception for all sections not involving, pain and medical procedures.  As a sign of goodfaith, I shall withdraw to the talkpage firstly.  I ask that you look at my proposed rewrite when you rewrite the section (it still needs wordsmithing).  I shall now voluntarily withdraw to just the talkpage.  I shall not edit the sections about pain and medical procedures unless circumcisionadvocates force mine hand.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Simpler language</span></h2>
<p>I have noted that 'Breastfeeding' is a featured article. Therefore I hesitate to make changes. However, I feel that it would be better with simpler wording.</p>
<p>For example: the opening paragraphs could read as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Breastfeeding</b> is when a woman feeds an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant.html" title="Infant">infant</a> (or sometimes a <a href="../../../t/o/d/Toddler.html" title="Toddler">toddler</a> or a young child) with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_milk.html" title="Breast milk">milk</a> produced from her breasts, usually directly from the <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipple.html" title="Nipple">nipples</a>. Babies have a sucking instinct that enables them to take in the milk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While many mothers breastfeed their children, some do not, either for personal or medical reasons. Breast milk has been shown to be the best nourishment for a child. As with other bodily fluids, some diseases, such as <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> and <a href="../../../h/t/l/HTLV-1_a523.html" title="HTLV-1">HTLV-1</a> can be passed through breast milk and some medications may also transfer in this way. However, most medications are transferred in very small amounts and are considered safe to take during breastfeeding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many governmental strategies and international initiatives have promoted breastfeeding as the best method of feeding a child in its first year – this supports recommendations by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Health_Organization_57ba.html" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics_d21f.html" title="American Academy of Pediatrics">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> (AAP) amongst others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The idea of such changes is not to introduce bias or spin, but to make the article easier to read. This is helpful to everyone. What do others think? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 10:51, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There doesn't seem to be too many changes there, and so I don't really have a particular problem with most of the changes. The one objection I would have, however, is that breastfeeding is not just about nutrition and is the most "beneficial feeding method", not just "the best nourishment". <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:59, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope the further changes that I have made help to clarify the meaning of the passages concerned and simplify the wording.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Evidence on the effect of Circumcision on Breastfeeding</span></h2>
<p>I believe the following links have evidence that should be considered:</p>
<p>1 <a href="http://cirp.org/library/pain/re9933/|" class="external text" title="http://cirp.org/library/pain/re9933/|" rel="nofollow">AAP Policy Statement - The Assessment and management of Acute Pain in Infants, Children and Adolescents</a> This says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some common painful minor procedures, such as circumcision, do not always receive the warranted attention to comfort issues. Available research indicates that newborn circumcisions are a significant source of pain during the procedure and are associated with irritability and feeding disturbances during the days afterward.9-11 Opportunities for alleviating pain exist before, during, and after the procedure, and many interventions are effective.12-17</dd>
</dl>
<p>2 The following comments from the Journal of Human Lactation are also worth pondering:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have noticed that boys who are circumcised before breastfeeding has been established have more problems with breastfeeding. Conversely, boys who are recovering from a traumatic birth but are left intact have fewer breastfeeding difficulties. Could we recommend that circumcision be delayed in cases of traumatic birth until the boy is feeding well? What do readers think?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nikki Lee, RN <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Nikki Lee (2000;16:295) that baby boys are at lower risk for breastfeeding difficulties when circumcision is delayed and breastfeeding is more established. Case in point: my own three sons were all circumcised at home at 8 days at the traditional Brith Milah. Breastfeeding was well established, my milk supply was ample, and the babies had a full week to perfect their skills. As soon as the mohel was finished, the baby was whisked back to mom's breast for a comforting feed, with no problems at all! This is so unlike what I observe in the hospital again and again, with babies shocked into a stupor, some having not yet even suckled well, milk volume not yet increased, and mom not yet experienced with feeding.</dd>

</dl>
<p>3 A randomised, controlled study of pain relief for circumcision had this to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Objective. Recognizing the concerns about the use of local anesthesia in neonatal circumcision, a painful procedure usually performed without analgesia or anesthesia, we undertook a study of acetaminophen for pain management of this procedure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Design. A prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of acetaminophen analgesia in 44 healthy full term neonates undergoing circumcision was conducted. Beginning two hours before Gomco circumcision, neonates received either acetaminophen (15 mg/kg per dose, 0.15 mL/kg per dose) or placebo (0.15 mL/kg per dose) every six hours for 24 hours. Neonates were monitored intraoperatively for changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and crying time. Postoperative pain was assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 360 minutes and 24 hours using a standardized postoperative comfort scoring system. Feeding behavior was also assessed before and after circumcision by nursing observation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Results. Neonates in both groups showed significant increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and crying during circumcision with no clinically significant differences between the groups. Postoperative comfort scores showed no significant differences between the groups until the 360-minute postoperative assessment, at which time the acetaminophen group had significantly improved scores. (P&lt;.05). Feeding behavior deteriorated in breast- and bottle-fed infants in both groups, and acetaminophen did not seem to influence this deterioration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Conclusions. This study confirms that circumcision of the newborn causes severe and persistent pain. Acetaminophen was not found to ameliorate either the intra-operative or the immediate postoperative pain of circumcision, although it seems that it may provide some benefit after the postoperative period. Pediatrics 1994;93:641-646; <a href="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>With evidence such as this it is not surprising that the Breastfeeding Answeer Book contains statements like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When a baby undergoes a painful medical procedure, such as a heel stick, injection, spinal tap, or circumcision, he may shut down and be unreceptive to feedings until he is feeling better. Vigorous suctioning of a baby's mouth can also cause a sore throat and injured vocal cords, which can cause a baby to reject anything by mouth for a time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Research indicates, however, that if a baby is breastfed during a painful procedure, such as a heel stick, that breastfeeding is "a potent analgesic" that essentially eliminates the symptoms of pain, such as crying and grimacing, and prevents a marked rise in heart rate (Gray 2002). Previous research has found that three components of a potent reliever [sic] for the newborn are: skin-to-skin contact, suckling, and a sweet taste (Gray 2000). Breastfeeding provides all three. <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/mohrbacher1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/mohrbacher1/" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the light of all this I think it is in order to include a carefully worded statement in the article on breastfeeding about the likely disruptive effect of circumcision on breastfeeding, and suggesting ways to ameliorate the situation. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 13:54, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're right, except that whole thread seemed to be a pack of red herrings, with far too much heat and not nearly enough light. What I was hoping to do was to find reasonably objective and balanced evidence and then write something reasonable, balanced and NPOV on the question that would be broadly acceptable to reasonable people, whatever their views on infant circumcision. Although this endeavour might appear to be quixotic, I have a feeling we might be able to bring it off. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 01:06, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Jay. Furthermore, the above is completely inappropriate for inclusion in the article as-is. Not only is it in a different form, but there are approx. <i>ten paragraphs</i> of it! This is way, way out of proportion.</dd>
<dd>Michael, we have actually discussed most, if not all, of this evidence already. I would suggest that if you want to reach an agreement, I would tentatively suggest that dismissing what has already been said and essentially repeating what was said in the first place might not be the best approach. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 09:10, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because of the adverse impact of infant circumcision on successful breastfeeding of boys circumcised in the hospital soon after birth a case can made that more than a passing reference to infant circumcision should be included in the section on breast refusal. I agree that ten paragraphs would be too much, but the passing reference in the article before the recent changes may have been too little. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 00:47, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dan, we have 1) a policy statement citing other evidence, 2) two letter-length opinion pieces, 3) a small study concluding that the anaesthesia used was inadequate and suggesting research with more appropriate anaesthesia, and 4) another opinion piece. This is inadequate for even asserting that such an adverse impact exists! At most, a passing reference is warranted, but nothing more. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 10:24, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Responding to your points: (1) The AAP policy statement on pain management does not cite evidence that disproves that infant circumcision may be a factor in breast refusal. (2) The two "letter-length opinion pieces" are letters from International Board Certified Lactation Consultants published in the <i>Journal of Human Lactation</i>. (4) It seems rather odd that you would refer to a quote from the <i>The Breastfeeding Answer Book</i> published by La Leche League International as "another opinion piece". <i>The Breastfeeding Answer Book</i> is a reference book in the field of breastfeeding. It is definitely not just "another opinion piece". -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 21:17, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) True enough. 2) I couldn't care less if the letters are stone tablets personally carved by God. They are still opinion pieces. Journals publish letters all the time, typically from professionals in their field. That does not make them absolute fact. 4) Just because it is a book does not magically stop it being an opinion. It is, specifically, Nancy Mohrbacher's opinion. I can't help noticing that it is not included in the references. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:35, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without wishing to spoil the bunfight over circumcision, I would like to get back to the effect of circumcision on the establishment of breastfeeding. I believe that something like the following could be inserted into the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is some evidence that if a baby is circumcised without pain relief before breastfeeding is firmly established, this can disrupt the breastfeeding process. <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> This may be ameliorated by delaying the circumcision until a week after the birth, as in a traditional Jewish circumcision <a href="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/pain/howard/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It should also be noted that breastfeeding can itself have a calming and analgesic effect on babies who are undergoing painful procedures <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/mohrbacher1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/mohrbacher1/" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that this statement is a fair summary of the evidence that I have seen. I would be interested in others' opinions about it. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 06:27, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two problems, Michael:
<ol>
<li>It interferes with the flow of the article, and the style is inconsistent with that already there. There are currently nine single sentences describing causes of failure. None have links. Introducing a whole link-heavy paragraph is inconsistent.</li>
<li>It is redundant. We already have "Pain or discomfort; for example, due to recent surgery or medical procedures" in the article. Circumcision clearly falls into these categories. Read my Pepsi scenario above. If any mention of circumcision is justified (which is frankly dubious), it should be as a short parenthetical example. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:11, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your feedback, Jake. Here are my responses:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Flow: Most of the article is written in paragraphs and only a few parts are written in dot points. I believe that the paragraph I proposed could be inserted without interrupting the flow of the article.</li>
<li>Style: If you have problems with the style of what I have written I would welcome your suggested amendments. However, I am puzzled that you should find its style a problem. Perhaps you could elaborate on this point.</li>
<li>Links: I agree that the rest of the article has very few links. However, I would see this as a defect to be remedied rather than a point of style to be copied. In any case, it is appropriate that any point made about circumcision should be very carefully documented because it is such a contentious area. Also, though it is heavily linked, it is done with numbers which shouldn't cause too much of a problem for the average reader. If, however, you believe that linked words would serve the article better, that would be fine with me. Please comment.</li>
<li>Redundancy: The reference to 'recent surgery or medical procedures' in the article is not clear. For instance, it wouldn't occur to me to think of circumcision when reading such a reference. This could be remedied by a passing reference to circumcision. However, this would generalise the criticism of circumcision to all such procedures when the evidence documents the disruptive effect of circumcision on those who were circumcised before breast feeding had been firmly established.</li>
<li>Lack of Necessity: I can understand that you may feel that a reference to circumcision is not necessary. However, as a husband and father I know from experience that a woman who is breastfeeding can need a great deal of support and understanding. Disruptions to the process of breastfeeding need to be minimised.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above were simply responses to what you have written. However, there are other points that should be made.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Critical comments on circumcisions done on babies before breastfeeding is properly established should not be taken as a criticism of circumcision as a whole. One of the links, remember, was of Linda Caplan, who had three sons ritually circumcised on the eighth day <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Her comments, critical though they were of the timing of hospital circumcisions, could hardly be construed as an attack on circumcision as a whole.</li>
<li>It is one thing to support circumcision and quite another to feel that one has to support every custom that surrounds this practice. Examples that spring to mind include circumcisions performed in unsanitary conditions, and dangerout traditional practices such as using the mouth to suck the blood from the circumcision wound.</li>
<li>All in all, Jake, I believe that the wording that I proposed can form the basis of a moderately worded comment on the disruptive effect circumcision can have when it takes place before breastfeeding has been firmly established. I believe that the evidence justifies such a reference. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:16, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why is there an AAP citation about medical procedures and not about infant colic (extremely common, very difficult to deal with), inebriation of the mother (sadly only too common), sore bottom from diarrhoea (not uncommon) and other things? I think that unless this becomes more balanced, the AAP cite doesn't actually add anything. It's blooming common sense that pain requires analgesia (although I still need to tell too many of my patients that their pain will not go away until they actually take their painkillers). I'd say it should stay out, actually. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:37, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<b>ELECTIVE SURGERY FOR YOU OR BABY</b> If you are going to be in the hospital anyway for the birth of your baby, you or your doctor may suggest that you have some other medical matter attended to. Examples of elective surgery for the mother include stripping the legs of varicose veins or typing the fallopian tubes (tubal ligation). As for the baby, it may be considered almost routine to circumcise boy babies when they are only a few hours or days old. But circumcision is elective surgery and you have a choice of whether or not to have your baby circumcised. You can also choose to wait a while before having this done. We bring these subjects up because, physically and emotionally, these procedures all take their toll on mother and child. Since they represent elective surgery, their appropriateness at this critical time must be questioned."</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Opinion Piece</span></h3>
<p>I am interested to note the use of the term <i>opinion piece</i>. It seems to be a very convenient way of branding, discounting and discarding invonvenient evidence. For instance, when two lactation consultants say that very early circumcision has a disruptive effect on the establishment of breast feeding <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, all you have to do is say <i>opinion piece!</i> press the delete button, and presto! there's an edit that claims to be as NPOV as can be.</p>
<p>In this case, I find the two word argument rather light on reason and logic. I would be grateful if those who have used this term would explain how the opinion of two lactation consultants can be discounted almost without argument.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Could it have anything to do with the fact that they are women?</li>
<li>Could it have anything to do with the fact that they question a common medical practice?</li>
<li>Do those who have argued in favour of this edit have any particular axe to grind on breastfeeding or circumcision?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would suggest that the letters of the two lactation consultants should be given some weight because:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>They are consistent with the AAP's statement: <i>Available research indicates that newborn circumcisions are a significant source of pain during the procedure and are associated with irritability and feeding disturbances during the days afterward.</i></li>
<li>Because both women are lactation consultants their opinion carries some weight.</li>
<li>As one of the women is Jewish, her opinion cannot be discounted as anti-circ prejudice.</li>
<li>As neither woman argued against circumcision it is hard to discount either opinion as anti-circ prejudice.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course it is possible that there are other factors that we should consider. If so, I would be interested to be informed of them. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 14:05, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael, are you familiar with the forms of evidence, and their relative merits?</dd>
<dd>Both of the letters are <i>anecdotal evidence</i>, which is the least valuable.</dd>
<dd>Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. Anecdotal evidence from a "lactation consultant" (I'm sorry; I couldn't keep a straight face using the term "urination consultant", either) is anecdotal evidence.</dd>
<dd>The AAP's statement is itself referenced and does not appear to need confirmation.</dd>
<dd>Primary sources are preferable to secondary sources. The AAP's statement (secondary) is a compromise, but is at least peer-reviewed. Please review <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.</dd>
<dd>The fact that they are women and have a POV is not relevant. Questioning the grinding of axes violates <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a>.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Jake, I take your point about anectdotal evidence being weaker than some other forms of evidence. However, this form of evidence has repeatedly led to previously unrecognised facts. In this case, the opinions of the women have some value because they are registered nurses who work in the field of human lactation. This isn't just a question of an appeal to authority. Indeed your reaction = of laughter = suggests that they have little authority, at least in your eyes. It is that their knowledge and expertise give their opinions some value.</p>
<p>There is a story, perhaps apocryphical = that Mohammed was once asked a question about the artificial insemination of date palms. His response was to immediately defer to the farmers, saying that they knew their business. Now date farmers mightn't know everything even about date palms. However, only a fool would discount their opinions altogether.</p>
<p>In the case in question, the women are both qualified nurses who work in the area of lactation. It strikes me as quite arrogant to airily dismiss their opinions as if they don't count.</p>
<p>Finally, we all have biases, prejudices and blind spots. It's part of the human condition. Drawing attention to this fact isn't to suggest bad faith on the part of others but to ask the others to consider whether the opinions of the two nurses have been too hastily cast aside. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 15:13, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael, please remember that this is an encyclopaedia. I do take your point about the possibility of leading to revealing information at a later time, but those working at the cutting edge of research have different information needs than the typical encyclopaedia user.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, you're mistaken in your interpretation. My amusement is at the pretentious title, rather than the work that these people do. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 17:18, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Jake, I have reviewed both letters and there is nothing in them to indicate the term <i>lactation consultant</i>. I'm sorry that I used a term that made you see them in a poor light. I think these points should be noted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The women are both registered nurses who work in the area of lactation.</li>
<li>The first of the women <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/lee1/" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> reports an <i>observation</i> that she has made about breastfeeding difficulties in boys.</li>
<li>Far from pushing any point of view on others she asks for <i>confirmation</i> from other observers.</li>
<li>She asks whether it would be desirable to delay the circumcision of boys who had suffered a traumatic birth until breastfeeding was well established and calls for comments of others.</li>
<li>The second woman <i>confirms</i> the observation that the first woman had made <a href="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cirp.org/library/birth/caplan1/" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.</li>
<li>She points out that her three sons were ritually circumcised on the 8th day, and because breastfeeding was well established it did not cause her difficulties in breastfeeding them.</li>
<li>She contrasts this with what she had <i>observed</i> "again and again" with hospital circumcisions.</li>
<li>The <i>observation</i> of both registered nurses is confirmed by the finding of the AAP, which was included in the article.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Therefore a careful reading of the letters confirms that both nurses <i>observed</i> something that is <i>confirmed</i> in the AAP policy document, that the pain of circumcision could disrupt breastfeeding. In fact, the only substantial difference that I could observe between the AAP policy document and the letters of the two nurses is in the <i>remedy</i> that both suggest. The AAP suggests using pain relief; the nurses suggest that circumcision be delayed until breastfeeding is well established. These different approaches, of course, are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Therefore I believe this exchange of views between us has established two things:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The letters recorded <i>observations</i>. I believe it is inaccurate and demeaning to label them as <i>opinion pieces</i>.</li>
<li>Referring to the nurses as <i>lactation consultants</i> is also demeaning, because of the negative connotations that this can have for readers.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I am not arguing that the nurses' observations are as rigorous as a double blind trial. Nevertheless, I believe that it is inappropriate and unfair to dismiss their observations as of no consequence. I believe that a short reference to their observations would be of interest to readers, as it confirms what the article already says but it suggests a different way of minimising the disruption to breastfeeding. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:01, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Michael, why are you so desperate to push these letters? They are anecdotal, far too weak to warrant inclusion. Think for a moment: how would you feel about inclusion of a letter (elsewhere, obviously) from a doctor stating that most of his heart disease patients were uncircumcised? Would you be so keen to include them? I think - I <i>hope</i> that you'd oppose it. I would, for the same reasons I've stated here. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 12:46, September 9, 2005 (UTC) As a further note, the AAP reviewed existing evidence, rather than finding new data. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 12:50, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now then, Jake. Remember your advice to me to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a>? I once again state that a reference to these letters serves a good purpose because it confirms something that is already in the article and it suggests that one solution could be to delay the circumcision of boys until breastfeeding was firmly established. I think your argument above is a "straw man". because heart disease and circumcision are, to the best of my knowledge, unrelated whereas the disruptive effect of circumcision on infant feeding is well accepted.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am puzzled by your reference to "new data" in relation to the nurses' observation.

<dd>Michael, firstly, any disruptive effect of circumcision is far from well accepted. Secondly, I neither accept the AAP nor reject the nurses'. My personal opinion doesn't come into it. I am simply arguing that it is inappropriate for an encyclopaedia to reference a letter giving anecdotal evidence. Yes, citing the AAP is indeed an appeal to authority, but it was intended as a compromise. I'm wondering if it might be better just to delete the lot. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 16:35, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

<p>BAB is considered an authoritative reference. Workshops and such produced by LLLI qualify for CME credits for doctors and nurses, so the organization carries weight in the medical community as well. This book is a compilation of over 46 years of evidence-based research and caring for breastfeeding mothers, and is overseen by a medical advisory board. When Jake breastfeeds a child of his own for at least nine months he can re-read the book (He HAS read it, right?) and decide how many inaccuracies it has or doesn't have. When he then goes on to log 5,000 patient contact hours under medical supervision, 45 hours of medical courses specific to human lactation and pass an hours-long board exam, he can continue to deride "lactation consultants" at his leisure. (Although I admit, these are only requirements for an IBCLC. There are complete morons out there who can complete only a two-day workshop on breastfeeding basics and are allowed to call themselves "lactation consultant." From what I have seen, these people are just about as useful as "urination consultants.")</p>

<p>Once upon a time a man had the temerity to claim that the world is round.</p>
<p>'Show us your evidence!' said his peers.</p>
<p>He replied, 'But everybody knows that the world is round!'</p>
<p>They retorted 'That's not evidence. That's only an opinion about an opinion. You have committed a <i>logical fallacy</i> '.</p>
<p>The man went away and thought about this. He then read a book or two, and they also said that the world was round. So, being a little more cautious this time, he took the biggest, oldest and most authoritative book he could find and showed it to his critics. 'See' he said, 'The world is indeed round.'</p>
<p>'Another logical fallacy!' replied his critics. This is an <i>appeal to authority</i>. You'll have to do a lot better than that!'</p>
<p>That stumped him. Then he realised that there would soon be an eclipse of the moon. He arranged for his critics to see the eclipse, where the shadow of the round earth covered the moon. However, when they saw the eclipse they said, 'Appearances can be deceptive. We need a photograph and a diagram.'</p>
<p>The man searched the internet and found a photo and a diagram and showed them to his critics. 'Ah, yes,' they said. 'This is an <i>American</i> internet site. You'll have to do better than that!'</p>
<p>He then found a British site and showed them that. 'Yes, <i>but</i> ' said his critics, 'This is still an English-speaking country. What about an Islamic website? What about a Russian website? What about a Christian website?'</p>
<p>He went away again and after much time and labour and expense came back with an Islamic website, a Russian website and a Christian website that all said that the world was round. He even had translations of the website to ensure that he had got it right.</p>
<p>'Aha!' said his critics. 'But are the translators accredited?'</p>
<p>At this point the man decided that he had better things to do with his time. So he decided to go to Wikipedia and do a little editing.</p>

<p>I find it unacceptable that circumcision is the only medical procedure mentioned specifically as a cause for breast refusal. Together with the CIRP link (why not put a full reference to the Howard article in the "reference" section?) is it an ugly scar on the article that there has been a war of words between circumcision activists. I do not deny that a freshly cut baby may be harder to feed or that they sometimes have hypotylenolaemia (it's up to y'all to decipher this one), but this just bears out that there are no other procedures newborns could undergo - <i>quod non</i>. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:04, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nor is Wikipedia a place where information should be suppressed simply because others disagree with it. Of course, propaganda is something that should not be a part of Wikipedia, but at least propaganda is upfront and in your face. A much more serious problem is the inadvertent or deliberate <i>suppression</i> of a point of view, just because some people find it confronting, offensive or wrong.</p>
<p>In this case there is some evidence that circumcision can disrupt the establishment of breastfeeding. Some people find <i>anything</i> that seems to criticise circumcision as too confronting, so they want to censor or suppress any mention of this issue. I believe that this is profoundly wrong. I believe that it is better for all of us to work together to get this information across in a fair and balanced way. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 10:50, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes. It tells me that some people don't mind mentioning recent surgery, as long as you don't mention circumcision. Now as circumcision is the most common surgery on infants, that's a bit like describing a room but ignoring the elephant in it.</p>
<p>Circumcision can disrupt breastfeeding. Because of this, it should be mentioned. Now I don't mind discussing how it can best be mentioned. However, it should not be censored out of the article altogether.

<p>Come on! There is a problem here, and it is only tangentially connected to the rights and wrongs of circumcision itself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The CIRP page on circumcision and breastfeeding</span></h2>
<p>I believe that this page is valuable because of the links it provides [ttp://cirp.org/library/birth/] I am sensitive to the concerns of those who feel it is biased. That is why I suggest we have a NPOV note to alert people to its point of view. Then those who find it unacceptable will have fair warning. Despite this the link has been removed. The reason given is:</p>
<p><i>non-encyclopedic</i> OK, but is any other link encyclopedic?</p>
<p><i>partisan source</i> This is a partisan way of describing a source of information that the writer objects to.</p>
<p><i>source only peripherally related to breastfeeding</i> Really? Let's look at some of the headings:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Circumcision's adverse impact on breastfeeding initiation</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Avoidance of circumcision plus breastfeeding may produce lowest childhood morbidity and mortality.</i></dd>

<dd><i>Breastfeeding Problems After Circumcision.</i> (La Leche League International)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Circumcision and Breastfeeding</i> (La Leche League International)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think I need to go on. Surely this shows that the charge of being <i>peripherally related to breastfeeding</i> simply cannot be sustained. So let's work on adding accurate and unbiased information, not deleting and censoring it. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:42, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, many other links are encyclopaedic (or suitable as a source for an encyclopaedia). For example, links to peer-reviewed studies (such as Howard's).</dd>

<p>Of course it has a strong point of view. Yes it does have its own agenda and, like all of us, it is perhaps not as willing to respond to cirticism as it should be. Nevertheless, the links are useful and the point of view is worth considering. That's why I think that a link from the article is in order.</p>
<p>What I find much more concerning is the determination of a couple of people to downplay or suppress information or links about circumcision and breastfeeding problems.

<dd>The point of view is expressed, if in more reasoned tones and with fewer sweeping generalisations, in some of the links it provides (indeed, as far as I can tell, many of them are based in some way or other on Howard's study).

<dd>It's not a question of suppressing information. The information is in the article already, in the form of the mention of surgery and the links to the AAP and Howard's study in the references.</dd>
<dd>If I might be so bold (not to mention arrogant) as to speak on behalf of those of us that you accuse, we (ok - give up - I) feel that the article a) does not need to explicitly mention circumcision explicitly, and b) would be less balanced with explicit mention.

<p>I find the denial of suppressing information to be disingenuous. I have tried my best to ensure that the article on breastfeeding has balanced and fair information on some possible effects of circumcision on breastfeeding. Virtually every attempt has been suppressed. Even links to articles have been routinely rejected on flimsy grounds. The one or two links that were finally let stand were placed in a list of references so long that it almost guarantees that they are overlooked. Despite the evidence that circumcision can disrupt breastfeeding, any direct reference to this is removed. Then the people who do this turn round and claim that they are protecting the article from bias! <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:38, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I respect Jake's intelligence and his ability to consider other people's arguments. However, I must object to the way he did the edit on the link to surgery. The link I provided was about the effect on breastfeeding of recent surgery, including circumcision. The replacement link said nothing about circumcision and nothing about breastfeeding, so it was quite irrelevant. The only reason I can see for doing this was to suppress a point of view that Jake objected to. If Jake had voiced some objection to the link that would have been fair. However, changing the link in a way that could be taken to imply that the same or similar information was elsewhere on Wikipedia is disappointing. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:38, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Now I see that Jake has replaced a bad link with a good link on breastfeeding and surgery. This is an asset to the article. However, as circumcision is the most common procedure on infant boys it deserves its own reference. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:01, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, Jake, is is covered, cloaked and concealed by the use of the word 'surgery'. I think it is disingenuous to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>Please look again at what I am aiming for: a short, simple statement that points out that circumcision can disrupt breastfeeding and a link to further information that would explain how to minimise this problem.</p>
<p>If we can come to some kind of consensus on other edits I believe we can do the same here. We already accept that surgery of any kind can disrupt the establishment of breastfeeding. We would both agree that circumcision is the most common form of surgery on newborn boys. Our only area of contention is in how to present the evidence fairly. It shouldn't take much more to bridge the gap. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 13:04, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

If both are evidence of activism, why have you chosen to support suppression and censorship? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 20:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia has a whole article explaining what <a href="../../../p/a/i/Pain.html" title="Pain">pain</a> is. Cirp is a site devoted anti-circumcision activitism, and presents a decidedly one-sided (and often edited and distorted) view on the subject. Attempts to turn a page about breastfeeding into an anti-circumcision page may well be acceptable (and expected) on Cirp, but not on Wikipedia. And when non-encyclopedic and inappropriate links are removed from articles, the first cry is always "suppression and censorship", it's as inevitable as the sun rising in the east. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that Jayig has made a great contribution to Wikipedia but I am disappointed at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">intemperate tone</a> of the comment above and his apparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">assumption of bad faith</a> on my part. However, I am most disappointed that an Administrator of Wikipedia should make a misleading description of his edit.</p>
<p>He said: <i>restore proper Wikipedia link, remove link to one-topic and biased activist site</i>. What he did was to <i>remove</i> a link. Therefore the first part of his description is demonstrably false. Now about the second part of his description. The link was to a <i>policy statement</i> of the <b>American Academy of Pediatrics</b> entitled <b>The Assessment and Management of Acute Pain in Infants, Children, and Adolescents</b>. It was a link to this article that Jayig chose to describe as a <i>link to one-topic and biased activist site</i> because it was published on the CIRP website. I leave it to the reader to decide if this was fair dealing.</p>
<p>I, for one, expect more of an Administrator of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:53, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Walabio, it is quite obvious from Jay's comment that he refers to CIRP, not the AAP. The <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b108/3/793" class="external text" title="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b108/3/793" rel="nofollow">original article</a> would be preferable (indeed I would argue that we should <i>always</i> prefer the original to a reprint). It would be preferable not only because of the risk of introducing errors during republication, but also because highlighting a few passages to make a point subtly alters the apparent meaning of a document.</p>
<p>Secondly, while the original is preferable, it is still not appropriate. That article discusses surgery and pain in general, but only mentions breastfeeding once, in passing. It is not even general information, since they only discuss this in connection with circumcision. As stated previously, there is no need to single out circumcision. If we want to link to general information on pain, we should prefer Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/a/i/Pain.html" title="Pain">article</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:10, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I would like to commend both Walabio and Jake for their measured comments. I especially appreciate the fact that Jake took the trouble to trace the original policy. I chose the link to the CIRP reprint because it was better set out and relevant parts were highlighted. The best way to judge the effect of the highlighted parts is to reprint the paragraphs with highlighting. The parts highlighted by CIRP are bolded. The conclusion is reproduced in full:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A major aim of pain treatment is to eliminate pain-associated suffering. Pain is an inherently subjective experience and should be assessed and treated as such. <b>Pain has sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components that are interrelated with environmental, developmental, sociocultural, and contextual factors. Suffering occurs when the pain leads the person to feel out of control, when the pain is overwhelming, when the source of the pain is unknown, when the meaning of the pain is perceived to be dire, and when the pain is chronic.2</b> The concepts of pain and suffering go well beyond that of a simple sensory experience.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Local anesthetics and strategies to soothe and minimize distress should be considered even for simple procedures, such as venipuncture. <b>Some common painful minor procedures, such as circumcision, do not always receive the warranted attention to comfort issues. Available research indicates that newborn circumcisions are a significant source of pain during the procedure and are associated with irritability and feeding disturbances during the days afterward.</b>9-11 Opportunities for alleviating pain exist before, during, and after the procedure, and many interventions are effective.12-17</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>CONCLUSION</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ample knowledge about pediatric pain exists to treat children humanely and effectively, but it is not universally applied.</b> Multiple sources of information are available, and it is important that pediatricians expand their knowledge base and advocate for the appropriate treatment of pain in children. This may include the institution of and adherence to educational requirements and quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of pediatric pain. Pediatricians are encouraged to advocate for and facilitate the use of services offered through child life programs that can have a dramatic effect in improving psychologic and physical comfort. In many treatment centers, pain is a continuous quality improvement measure and included as a fifth vital sign.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is need for more research to elucidate further the strategies for optimal pain management and the effect of the pain experience. <b>It is unacceptable that almost no potent analgesics have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in children.</b> Children deserve the benefit of systematic research on the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of such medications.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Treatment of children will improve as pain management education expands and as the issue of pediatric pain is brought into greater public awareness. Education of parents and others in the community who deal with children in pain is an important pediatric issue. When pediatricians consistently make comfort a priority for their patients and help others to treat pain more effectively, the treatment of pain in children will improve.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The effect of the highlighting is to stress those parts of the paper that are directly relevant to infant circumcision. By reprinting them in this way the reader can see that the policy does say that the pain has serious consequences, that the pain of circumcision does interfere with feeding, that knowledge of pain relief is not universally applied and that almost no powerful analgesics have received official approval. I appreciate the point that Jake made about subtle distortion. However, contrary to what Jake has suggested above, I think that these quotations demonstrate that the policy on pain does have something relevant to say about the pain of circumcision and its control. It is for this reason that the policy should be linked to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now Jake has stated that it would be better to link the article to the Wikipedia article on pain. I do not think this would serve any really useful purpose. The Wiki article has no standing whereas the AAP article speaks with real authority. The Wiki article says nothing about infant feeding or circumcision; the AAP article deals with both issues. Finally, whereas the AAP article is current until the next update, the Wiki article is inherently unstable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I prefer the article as published by CIRP because it is well set out and parts relevant to breastfeeding and pain are highlighted. However, if the article on the AAP website was linked, the same information on feeding and pain would still be there, even though the AAP's layout is not quite as clear and the parts relevant to breastfeeding and circumcision tend to get lost in the details of the policy as a whole. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 13:17, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The effect of the highlighting is to stress those parts of the paper that are directly relevant to infant circumcision.</i> The negative parts, anyway. This is part of the problem. The text of the link was 'pain', not 'circumcision'. The reader will thus rightly expect it to be about pain, not circumcision. If he or she clicks on it, it will be because he or she wishes to learn more about pain, much the same as those wanting to learn about infants will likely click on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant.html" title="Infant">infant</a> at the beginning of the article (and you may care to note that it links to Wikipedia's article, rather than elsewhere).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the link text were 'circumcision', you might have a better point, but since that is covered by the more general terms, and the only point to mentioning circumcision is to advance an activist agenda, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>, we should concentrate on general matters.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>and that almost no powerful analgesics have received official approval.</i> How exactly did you read the AAP's pain management committee's words that "Opportunities for alleviating pain exist before, during, and after the procedure, and <b>many interventions are effective.12-17</b>"? If that isn't official approval, what is?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You object to preferring Wikipedia articles to external sources, despite the fact that this is actually Wikipedia policy (as I remember), on the apparent grounds that you dislike the open source Wiki way. Your preferences are your own business, I suppose.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, one can only presume that if the parts relevant to breastfeeding and circumcision tend to get lost in the details, that is perhaps because the AAP's committee chose to let it be that way. One can only speculate why, but the possibility does occur that they wanted to write something serious and important on the subject of pain, and didn't feel that it was necessary to use this as an opportunity to push an anti-circumcision agenda. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 14:30, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You made some good points, Jake. However, before I want a reference to the CIRP reprint, I would prefer to have the following paragraph quoted in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some common painful minor procedures, such as circumcision, do not always receive the warranted attention to comfort issues. Available research indicates that newborn circumcisions are a significant source of pain during the procedure and are associated with irritability and feeding disturbances during the days afterward. Opportunities for alleviating pain exist before, during, and after the procedure, and many interventions are effective.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please note that I quoted more than CIRP highlighted, to give a more balanced picture of what the AAP wrote. Despite your charge of pushing an agenda, this is not my intention.</p>
<p>I agree that the article should be read as a whole because it is an important paper about the importance of managing pain in a humane manner. A short quotation in the text and a link to the AAP website would be ideal.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the spin you have put on what I wrote above. The AAP policy says <b>It is unacceptable that almost no potent analgesics have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in children.</b> My summary of this read <b>almost no powerful analgesics have received official approval.</b>I quoted both this and the other statement you alluded to,</p>
<p>A preference to using authoritative sources, where appropriate, is consistent with Wikipedia policy to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_sources" rel="nofollow">cite sources</a>. It is perverse to assert that this means I favour other sites over Wikipedia. They simply serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, the text of the link was pain, and that was what the whole article was about. Therefore the link was accurately described. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 15:26, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No. It's not explicit about circumcision. No explicit reference to the effect of circumcision on breastfeeding has been allowed to stand. In fact, your last edit to the article was to remove an explicit reference to the disruptive effect of circumcision on breastfeeding from the <i>list of references!</i> That is a measure of the length that you will go to remove <i>any</i> explicit reference to a well documented cause of problems in breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Why is there such resistance to including any such comment? Why?</p>
<p>i am not asking for a diatribe against circumcision. All I want to see is something short, factual, frank and moderate abnout this issue This statement would serve that purpose well.</p>

<p>The adverse affect of infant circumcision on breastfeeding is well documented by people familiar with problems of breast refusal. The determined effort by supporters of infant circumcision to remove any mention of circumcision from the article is a form of activism that is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia.

<p>True. I'll try another way to explain why it is important to mention circumcision explicitly in the article.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pain from surgery and other painful procedures can disrupt breastfeeding. <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b108/3/793" class="external autonumber" title="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b108/3/793" rel="nofollow">[48]</a></li>
<li><b>The American Academy of Pediatrics</b> specifically mentions pain from circumcision as affecting infant feeding.</li>
<li>If the AAP finds it appropriate to mention this, then attempts to censor, remove or even downplay this finding must be trreated as suspect.</li>
<li>If the AAP finds it appropriate to mention this, then attempts to censor, remove or downplay this finding must be regarded as POV pushing.</li>
<li>Most infants do not receive surgery. Male circumcision is the great exception. If it is done without pain relief or it is done so early that it disrupts the establishment of breastfeeding, then people have a right to know.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there are flow-on issues that also impinge on this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is evidence that the pain from circumcision can sensitise babies to later painful procedures <a href="http://phm.utoronto.ca/graduate/faculty/taddio.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://phm.utoronto.ca/graduate/faculty/taddio.jsp" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>.This is another reason for facing up to this issue and not shying away from it.</li>
<li>There is also evidence that proper pain relief can make a difference. Anna Taddio said:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hospitalized newborn infants undergo many painful procedures without the benefits of analgesia. In previous studies, my colleagues and I demonstrated safety and efficacy of pharmacologic interventions aimed at minimizing procedural pain in newborn infants.(1) We have also found that untreated newborn circumcision pain can alter sensitivity to pain 4 to 6 months after the procedure and that these changes can be minimized by using local anaesthesia to decrease pain from circumcision.(2) In addition, we have demonstrated that newborn infants exposed to repeated painful procedures can learn to anticipate pain.(3) Our current studies continue to investigate safety and efficacy of analgesics and the long-term effects of pain in this population. We have prepared position statements on the prevention and management of pain and stress in the newborn that have been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Canadian Paediatric Society, Fetus and Newborn Committee, and the International Group of Pain Researchers.(4,5)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Finally, a moderate and responsible position on the question of infant pain and its its prevention and relief is totally compatible with a neutral point of view on the rights and wrongs of infant circumcision. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 02:15, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Is already stated in the article.</li>
<li>The AAP specifically mentions this in an article on pain. Their <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496" class="external text" title="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496" rel="nofollow">article</a> on breastfeeding makes no mention of circumcision.</li>
<li>It is ludicrous to expect this article to cover the contents of policy statements on other topics.</li>
<li>Since the AAP's breastfeeding policy statement (link given above) does not mention circumcision, this is a poor argument.</li>
<li>We have already stated that surgery may cause difficulties.</li>
<li>Taddio is cited in the appropriate article. There is no indication that it is relevant to breastfeeding.</li>
<li>Finally, discussion of circumcision belongs in that constellation of articles, not here. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 10:39, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Jay's suggestion that Michael is "trying to focus this article about breastfeeding on circumcision" is absurd. One paragraph on the negative effect of infant circumcision on breastfeeding is reasonable and appropriate. One paragraph on the relationship between infant circumcision and breast refusal does not "focus" the article on circumcision. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBlackham_ea8d.html" title="User:DanBlackham">DanBlackham</a> 07:15, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Discussion of circumcision, including pain relief, certainly belongs in the appropriate article. This one, however, is on breastfeeding. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 10:29, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Jake is certainly right in stating that pain relief and circumcision should be discussed in the appropriate article. However, the effect of circumcision on the establishment of breastfeeding is obviously of relevance to articles on both circumcision and breastfeeding. It's absurd to suggest otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In point 2 (above) Jake states that the AAP mentions the impact of circumcision on breastfeeding in their article on pain but not in their article on breastfeeding. To imply that this means we can ignore the impact of circumcision on breastfeeding strikes me as an absurd piece of rationalisation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is ludicrous to expect us to ignore other policies of the AAP that have relevance to breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Of course, Taddio's findings apply to the article on circumcision, rather than breastfeeding. However, when circumcision affects breastfeeding, it is also relevant to the breastfeeding article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The AAP policy on breastfeeding says: <i>Delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed.</i> <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496" class="external autonumber" title="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> If even eye prophylaxis is to be postponed until after the baby's first feed, then this stresses the importance of a peaceful entry into the world to assist the establishment of breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Jake is quite right in his suggestion that the question of breastfeeding and circumcision should be discussed in the articles on circumcision. This is true, and I look forward to working with him to include more of such material in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_analysis_of_circumcision.html" title="Medical analysis of circumcision">Medical analysis of circumcision</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 12:56, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One link is to the pain of surgery. The other link is to pain in general, but specifically mentions the disruptive effect that circumcision can have on breastfeeding. A proper discussion of circumcision and breastfeeding would address the issue squarely and would mention the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circumcision can disrupt breastfeeding.</li>
<li>This can be mitigaged by proper pain relief.</li>
<li>This can be mitigated by ensuring that breastfeeding is properly established before the circumcision takes place.</li>

<dd>While other forms of pain and surgery shouldn't be ignored, I think we need to keep things in perspective. Generally speaking, especially with a baby surgery would only be carried out if there is something considered abnormal that needs fairly immediate correction. Pain would also usually be avoided whenever possible. Circumscion is somewhat unique in that it is primarily done for cultural and religious regions. While there may be some medical reasons, these are hotly disputed. In any case, circumscion is by and large not considered to be the equivalent of other surgeries that may need to be performed when something is considered abnormal that needs correction. Therefore, circumscion is unique in this regard and we cannot ignore it <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 04:55, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that makes sense. It would make sense for anesthesia to be used only when the negative effects of the pain would otherwise last longer and/or be stronger than the negative effects of the anesthesia itself. So the article will need a better wording that shows that while even minor pain (like needle sticks) can cause slight breastfeeding problems, anesthesia only helps with that in cases where the pain is worse and/or more prolongued, or otherwise worse than the effects of the anesthesia. This is a rather verbose way to put it, though.

<p>It seems to me that lactation should have its own article, rather than redirecting to breastfeeding.

The development of lactation was an important evolutionary innovation, shaping (in some sense, defining) the mammalian taxon.</p>
<p>The breastfeeding article is NOT the appropriate forum to treat these considerations; lactation and breastfeeding are not synonymous, nor do their respective denotations bear sufficient overlap to justify a redirect (especially at the expense of an important and informative entry for lactation).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">technical terms in lead, other problems</span></h2>
<p>The lead sentences of an article should really avoid specialised vocab. Neither "latch" nor "frenulum" are everday words, and so should be given with glossary if used so early in the piece - a link is not enough.</p>
<p>I'm kind of surprised this is still FA - the lead really has some problems. What does "Breast milk has been shown to be best for the child" mean? Best compared to what? The lead also makes no mention of the controversies surrounding breastfeeding, nor the difficulties encountered by the modern mother - which are exactly what the average reader would expect to find here. I'm almost tempted to add an NPOV tag (the article strongly takes a "everyone should breastfeed" stance) but will resist.</p>
<p>Actually there's technical vocab all the way through: "let-down reflex" - this needs explanation. "Afterpains"? "ductule system"? "alveoli"?</p>
<p>Poor formatting too - uses inline (ibid) references, double hyphens (--) instead of em-dashes, use of inline web references rather than &lt;ref&gt; links.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why breastfeeding rather than expressed milk?</span></h2>
<p>Are there specific reasons to prefer breastfeeding rather than bottle-feeding expressed milk? - This unsigned comment was made by <a href="../../../1/3/1/User_talk%7E131.107.0.89.html" title="User talk:131.107.0.89">131.107.0.89</a> on 17:08, May 23, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. Nursing provides skin-to-skin contact (which you can get by cuddling while bottle feeding, but isn't required). It also prevents the breakdown of the antibodies and complex proteins the mother passes to the child. These delicate components do not always survive the transition from breast to pump to bottle to baby, especially if there is freezing, refrigeration, or even just transportation of the milk. Finally, the act of sucking at the breast is much more difficult than bottle feeding, and helps to build jaw and mouth muscles for speech development. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek">MamaGeek Joy</a> 11:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But it's still significantly better than formula if you expect to be sharing feeding intimacy with many family members? Or does this breakdown of antibodies (is there a reference, by the way?) destroy most of the advantages of breast milk? I find I'm not too concerned about jaw development or skin-to-skin contact, as those seem more like side effects achievable other ways.131.107.0.89 23:42, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, no, expressed breast milk is still MUCH better than formula. That is why I pumped all mine for a year when my first child couldn't latch due to hypotonia. It's just that breastfeeding <i>does</i> have some advantages over expressed milk. The antibody breakdown may only apply to stored (refrigerated, frozen) milk, and not milk fed immediately after pumping, but I'm not sure. One other thing I thought of is that it's much more difficult to maintain a milk supply when pumping only than when nursing at least part of the time. Here are links for further reading:
