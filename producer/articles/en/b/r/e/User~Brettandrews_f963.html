	    <p>This Wiki has been created by Michelle, Erin and Brett.</p>
<p><br />
Well we finally sorted out our wiki issues and got it to work, so here is our wiki on WebCT and Video Conferencing</p>
<p>WEBCT</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>WebCT was created by Murray Goldberg at the University of British Colombia in 1995. It is a web-based course tool which can be used as a stand-alone course or as supplementary material to augment a direct contact course. It creates an environment for authoring and delivering educational material and is accessed via a WWW format.</p>
<p>There are two types of access for WebCT, which include Author (instructor) and Student (learner) that has different privileges of access. The Author has access to the designer menu and thus manipulation of the course content/delivery and accesses to student all students’ progress. Students have only access to their own accounts and may communicate with others via email or the conferencing pages.</p>
<p>WebCT allows provides: o The ability to design the look of the course pages (layout, colours, etc) o A set of educational tools that can be integrated into any course o A set of administrative tools to assist in course delivery</p>
<p>Some of the educational &amp; administrative tools that WebCT offers include: o Notes o Assignments o Interactive simulations &amp; Exercises o Student self-evaluation o Timed Quizzes delivered, graded and returned online o Email &amp; chat facilities o Conferencing facilities o Navigation Mechanisms o Page annotation mechanisms o Grade distribution o Student self-administered (password and progress and access)</p>
<p>BENEFITS:</p>
<p>“I personally find the discussion tool beneficial to use. Face to face discussions in a tutorial can lead to students dominating the discussion or on the other extreme shy and quite students often do not contribute to the discussion. Running an online discussion tends to overcome some of these problems. They allow students time to reflect on the discussion and reply after giving thought to the topic. Quiet and shy students don’t feel as intimidated as in a face to face discussion and often excel better when discussing online. The asynchronous nature of online discussion tends to work well from my experiences.”</p>
<p><br />
 Allows students and teachers to access information from anywhere at any time so long as they have access to internet.  Allows students to work at their own pace on tasks  Give students time to reflect before posting their responses.  Has a progress tracker allowing administrator (teacher) to monitor student usage and contributions.  Mark book; allows students to be well informed and up to date on their academic results and progress  Allows for easy and efficient marking of online quizzes.  Can post links to important websites  Can link and run web quests and similar programs from a WebCT central point.  Allows for communication between all students with a central list of names and contacts for class members  Easy porthole for assignment submission  WebCT tutorial guide on home page instructs students and staff alike how to use the software.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LIMITATIONS:</p>
<p>“When I stared using WebCT the initial limitations were that students didn’t think it was relevant to a face to face unit and there was hesitation to using WebCT. Now that WebCT has been used at Vic Uni for around 5 years this student perception has changed. I don’t have any major personal limitations to WebCT. This is because I think it is a great tool to use and provides many advantages to supplement teaching. The initial versions of WebCT were very clunky to use but the interface now has evolved a lot and this isn’t an issue any more. From my experience the main problems that most students have relate to technical issues. These typically are to do with Internet Browsers, pop up blockers, settings and software issues”</p>
<p>Roger Funk, School of HMRP Victoria University, Melbourne.</p>
<p> Cost; although schools may not have to spend as much as universities for back end equipment, the initial outlay may exceed the abilities of smaller schools.  Students without access to computers or the internet at home may be disadvantaged.  System outages or issues may mean the program cannot be used by staff and students.  Software problems, such as pop up blockers  Reliance on students for lecture notes from WebCT instead of attending lectures and obtaining all information.</p>
<p><br />
VIDEO CONFERENCING (VC)</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>-Using ISDN (Integrated services digital network) lines, VC enables schools in different areas-metro, rural, interstate, overseas-to correspond with each other, via high speed networks which are capable of carrying large amounts of text, voice and video data over existing telephone lines.</p>
<p>VC allows two or more people at different locations to see and hear each other at the same time. It also allows the two parties to share computer applications such as internet pages, library catalogues, documents or software.</p>
<p>VC allows the following possibilities to schools and colleges:</p>
<p>• Deliver lectures online (rural students could watch a lecture as it happens) • Other formal instruction (courses, lessons, tutoring) communicated • Connect with guest speakers and experts, without travelling to another location • Multi-school project collaboration • Conduct professional activities such as meetings and interviews &amp; community events.</p>
<p><br />
What you need for VC?</p>
<p>A VC system requires the following audiovisual equipment: • -Monitor • -Camera • -Microphone • -Receiver</p>
<p>A VC system also requires a means for transmitting info between two sites: • -Broadband satellite connection (excellent coverage, HUGE expense) • -Internet Protocols (IP) (shares or competes for bandwidth with other Internet data, which may cause audio delays) • -Digital Telephone Networks (e.g. ISDN). Most widely used, cheaper, but slower</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>2-way video stands out in a number of ways:</p>
<p>• -almost like being there! The visual connection &amp; interaction among participants enhances understanding and helps participants feel connected to each other. This goes a long way to build relationships in a way that e-mail, telephone, or online chat systems cannot’ supporting collaboration among traditionally isolated institutions.</p>
<p>• A videoconference can improve retention and appeal to a variety of learning styles by including diverse media such as video or audio clips, graphics, animations, computer applications</p>
<p>VC impacts learning in the following ways:</p>
<p>1.-Heightens motivation:</p>
<pre>
The excitement of new technology and interacting with other students or adults from different locations and countries increases student motivation. According to documentation of schools which use it, students have at times given up their recess or lunchtimes to continue the dialogue or viewing.  This is a novel activity for students and it shows with their increased engagement.
</pre>
<p>2. Increases connection with the outside world: • When a live visit is not possible, videoconferencing makes a face-to-face visit is possible and an ongoing relationship can take place. • Videoconferencing is usually easier than visiting so communication can be more frequent, saving time and resources. • Students have a greater opportunity to form meaningful relationships with children or others who may be very different from them. • The richness of the communication supports the formation of relationships between learners and mentors/role models. "By removing the need for either the content provider or the students to travel, yet still providing a two-way audio AND video link, you're providing educational opportunities for interactions that would not otherwise exist."</p>
<pre>
Bruce Betts, San Juan Capistrano Research Institute
</pre>
<p>3. Increases depth of learning: • Students learn to ask better questions • Learning is from a primary source rather than from a textbook • Students show more depth in understanding • Necessary planning contributes to better learning experiences. Videoconferencing lends itself to viewing multiple perspectives on an issue and it better addresses the needs of visual learners. Also, collaborative learning is practically automatic with videoconferencing. Videoconferencing helps set up authentic learning situations--students are working on a real-world problem or project and they are communicating with real people involved in the problem or project. This also supports the idea of authentic assessment--you must have your information pretty accurate before you connect with an "expert" and ask meaningful questions. Beth Bustamante, AT&amp;T Education Advocate</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>1. Can be expensive (equipment setup, broadband) 2. Communicating with other countries who speak different languages 3. Time-difference b/w countries 4. Holiday difference (e.g. Easter, school breaks) 5. Can be delays in reading body cues of other cultures (e.g. Japanese to English) due to different meaning of different body cues and extra time needed to interpret these. 6. Fast movements can cause difficulty for the camera to capture 7. Microphone need to be positioned well away from the main monitors speaker system (to avoid echo effect).</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>1. Inclusion:</p>
<p>• Inclusion of disaffected learners (e.g. educational specialists) &amp; augmenting transition phases from special to mainstream schooling. • Develop home-school partnerships (rural students especially) • Addressing social divisions (ICT literacy issues) • challenging stereotypes (different social backgrounds/race/religion can interact)</p>
<p>2. Curriculum enrichment:  Providing new methods to communicate with experts  Benefits non-verbal and verbal communication skills  Motivation to learn another language: Students become more enthused and put more work into learning another language (especially when it will help them communicate with another culture e.g. English to Japanese.) 3. Meeting specialist school aims  -partner schools and colleges  -contact with experts 4. Schools developing collaborative capacity 5. Share teacher expertise &amp; work on combined action research (Networking) 6. Celebrate/share regional diversity – cultural and/or environmental 7. Innovating CPD (teacher professional development): 8. Interest in culture (others and your own): In order to share your understanding of your own culture with others, you first have to understand it yourself. Interest in own culture becomes pride based, and students are eager to show other cultures about their own (increased motive to learn) 9. Drama, dance or music festival/workshops can provide good project of interaction (students love to share their talents in music and are eager to see how others perform).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>New Learning and the Classroom</p>
<p>Utilising Video Conferencing to interview experts from around the country and around the world will enable students to be at the forefront of discoveries in regards to their chosen disease and its effects at the cellular, tissue and body levels of humans. This technology may also allow students to correspond with students in another school or country and conduct their symposium debate on their elected disease between the schools.</p>
<p>The use of WebCT will bolster management of information for the teacher and the student assessment submission and grading. PowerPoint presentations will be submitted electronically prior to the due date, which will allow the teacher to grade the layout and design prior to the presentation. The chapter review questions may be typed and submitted on WebCT and the students will be able to undertake the online quiz on WebCT, which can be graded automatically. This will reduce the amount of paper used and allow the teacher to submit notes in folders on WebCT for students.</p>
<pre>
The Value of Wiki’s in the Learning Process
</pre>
<p>Wiki’s as with the WebCT discussion function allow fro reflective writing and for easily accessible sharing of information between a variety of people that have access to the Internet and ICT equipment. Wiki’s allow for a mass resource sharing which enables students to broaden their learning experience, sharing their discoveries with other students.</p>
<p>We personally found the use of Wiki’s to be good in theory, but true to all new forms of technology, we encountered technical difficulties which resulted in a loss of our Wiki, meaning that all of out information had to be re-collaborated, formatted and reposted. It would have been good, if as initially intended all new learning students had been able to post their Wiki entries on one central database. This would have created a great resource detailing different uses of ICT in the classroom for us as beginning teachers over the coming years.</p>
