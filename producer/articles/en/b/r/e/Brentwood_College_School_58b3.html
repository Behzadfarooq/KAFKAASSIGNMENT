<p>Brentwood has always been better then Shawnigan, no matter what period of history you are thinking of. Brentwood College is a <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canadian_1d89.html" title="Western Canadian">Western Canadian</a> private school. Brentwood, as it is often fondly referred to by alumni, was first founded in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> as a boys school. The original location was in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentwood_Bay%2C_British_Columbia_2d07.html" title="Brentwood Bay, British Columbia">Brentwood Bay</a> near <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saanich.html" title="Saanich">Saanich</a> on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>, from where its name was derived. Unfortuately the original school was tragically destroyed by a terrible fire in 1947, leaving only the chapel intact. The new and current school is located westward directly across the bay from the original site, in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mill_Bay%2C_British_Columbia_30c0.html" title="Mill Bay, British Columbia">Mill Bay</a>. The new version of the school was resurrected by the valiant efforts of David D MacKenzie and opened in September <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Brentwood College opted to become the first all boys' boarding school in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> to gradually integrate girls, starting with 20 grade 12 students, becoming officially co-ed for the fall session.</p>

<p>Brentwood College was founded in 1923 at Brentwood Bay, B.C., by a group of distinguished Victoria business and professional men, led by P.F. Curtis. From the initial enrollment of fifty boys and a faculty of four, the school operated for many years on the shores of Brentwood Bay and gained an enviable reputation through outstanding academic and athletic results.</p>
<p>While many significant milestones chart our historical journey, Brentonians remember with pride the achievements of our founders and pioneers, including Brentwood's first Olympian, Ned Pratt (Class of 1930), LCdr. John H Stubbs (Class of 1930) a WWII hero and commander of <a href="../../../h/m/c/HMCS_Athabaskan_%28G_07%29_baf9.html" title="HMCS Athabaskan (G 07)">HMCS Athabaskan</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Gillespie_cd7a.html" title="Alastair Gillespie">Alastair Gillespie</a> (Class of 1941) a senior member of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau's</a> cabinet and Philip (Pip) D P Holmes (Class of 1941) WWII hero.</p>
<p>In 1947, fire consumed the Brentwood Bay campus. Only the Brentwood Memorial Chapel, where our annual Service of Remembrance is still held, survived. Although the original school was forced to close, Old Brentonians remained loyal to the spirit of their alma mater and dreamed of rebuilding their school.</p>

<p>In 1960, some of the old school alumni met David D. MacKenzie, the re-founding headmaster, and were tremendously encouraged by his enthusiasm. As a result of their collective financial commitment, and in particular David Mackenzie's enduring dedication, the new Brentwood College campus reopened in September 1961 on the shores of Mill Bay, directly westward across the bay from its original location in Brentwood Bay. The new campus featured a central complex with the dining area for over 200 in the basement, offices and meeting rooms on the main floor and dormitories on the upper floors. An adjoining building housed classrooms with a gymnasium attached at the far right end. Several separate buildings served as accommodation for the 180 or so boarders.</p>
<p>From 1961-1968 the dining room was in the basement of the central complex, and was often packed to capacity with 180 or so boys plus instructors and house masters. The dining area had in the order of 17 standard four foot by eight foot tables with wooden benches along each side and two chairs at the ends. The kitchen held an array of stainless steel, quasi-industrial, cook ware on a fairly large scale, complete with gas fired cooking surfaces, automatic dish washing equipment, and mass production toasters. About 5 employees, usually local women, were hired to do the cooking. The most memorable, and perhaps oft repeated, dishes were curried chicken with rice, fish sticks, Salisbury steak, liver and onions, macaroni with cheese, bacon or sausages and eggs with toast and potatoes. More rarely roast beef or t-bone steak was served with an assortment of vegetables. Usually milk, juice, tea and water were the standard fair for drinks. Deserts ranged from various types of pudding to canned fruit with fresh fruit on occasion. The morning break offered cake with the usual assortment of drinks. In retrospect the meals were likely the best one could expect under the circumstances in regard to budget and the mass preparation technology of the day. Overall it is amazing everything was so well organized from 1961-68 and a tribute to many long unseen and for the most part unappreciated hours of effort, on the part of the school staff as a whole. The new, much improved, dining room, located at the north end of campus, was ready for the 1968-1969 session and still serves that role today.</p>
<p>Classes were efficiently organized and taught by domain experts, usually of 55 minute duration, with the first class at 8:00. A mid-morning break was at 10:00, followed by two more classes, then lunch at 12:30. The afternoons were dedicated to sports activities, mainly rugby, starting at 13:30. The bulk of students were inculcated into the gentlemanly, rough and ready, sport of rugby, starting with rules of the game and preliminary exercises. These included ball handling skills, strategy and tackling practice combined with endurance training. The most memorable (and often joyfully derided) exercises were conducted by Nick Prowse, which he called “Heine Muellers”. Needless to say at the end of the sports sessions one might be considered lucky to have escaped with only a few bruises, cuts, complete exhaustion, and possibly an enhanced understanding of the universe. Dinner was served at 18:00 in the dining area, then a prefect enforced study session ensued in ones respective dormitory or study area until 21:30. Prefects were appointed by housemasters from the grade 12 group, as limited proxies, for house master authority.</p>

<p>The campus is functionally arranged and spread out over the waterfront, with a pier and ramp enabling access for sailing, rowing and docking for float planes and motor boats. The campus has ample room for expansion, sagaciously provided for by the more than doubling of available land area purchased incrementally since 1976. This has put the school in position to challenge some of its larger <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Canada_539e.html" title="Eastern Canada">Eastern Canada</a> rivals over coming decades.</p>
<p>On a clear day it is easy to see the other side of the bay, a few kilometres away. As can be seen in the campus photograph, tennis courts and rugby fields adjoin the residences, main school classroom block and specialized buildings. Some recent additions include a world class fine arts theatre, complete with facilities for a wide range of arts training, including acting, dance and singing. Numerous exceptional quality productions are put on and hosted by the students, during the school year, with very high demand for tickets.</p>

<p>With the purchase of adjoining land in 1976 the Woodward Sportsplex, Maintenance Facility and a residence for the Head of School were constructed to the north of campus. More residences were added to accommodate a doubling of the school population, as a result of more than 200 boarding girls in attendance. With the increased diversification of programs into more Arts education, a new performing arts centre was added to the south of campus.</p>
