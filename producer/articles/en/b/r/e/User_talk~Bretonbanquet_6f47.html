<p>Hi. I'm doing a survey of Wikipedia editors as part of a class research project. It's quick, anonymous, and the data will be made available to the Wikipedia community later this month. Would you like to take part? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nonplus/survey" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nonplus/survey" rel="nofollow">More info here</a>.

<p>The F1 portal (in which I assume you have some degree of interest, as your name is listed on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One</a>) is intended to have a regular rotation of a 'featured article'. I've swapped a few in and out over the last couple of months, but I think it would be better if there were more of a community attempt at deciding this, proposals, votes, that kind of thing.

<p>I'd like to talk with the guy who insists on removing every reference to Britain or the UK that he sees, replacing it with "England". In case he's not aware, England is not an independent country, and people born in the UK are British. The nationality is British, these people are citizens of the UK.</p>
<p>He's not registered of course, so I'm asking him to register, be upfront and discuss it, rather than just reverting his crappy edits every single day.</p>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>I dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One</a> to ask for suggestions for selected articles on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal%7EFormula_One_d870.html" title="Portal:Formula One">portal:Formula One</a>. There was a pretty good response, both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested. <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Hill_de37.html" title="Damon Hill">Damon Hill</a> came out with the most support and was brought up to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> standard after a lot of work by <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkully_Collins_923e.html" title="User:Skully Collins">Skully Collins</a> before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured Article Candidates</a> as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?).</p>
<p>Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the Damon Hill article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal_talk%7EFormula_One_Management_of_selected_articles_36a5.html" title="Portal talk:Formula One/Management of selected articles">Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles</a> for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July).</p>
<p>You may also want to help with the article <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Villeneuve_0aff.html" title="Gilles Villeneuve">Gilles Villeneuve</a>, which was the next most popular after Damon Hill. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help! <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 15:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was changing "Personnel" to "Credits" because I was asked to do so <a href="../../../j/o/g/User_talk%7EJogers_AWB_5254.html#Personnel_.E2.86.92_Credits" title="User talk:Jogers/AWB">here</a>. It seems that it became a standard at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Albums_7646.html#Credits" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums">WikiProject Albums</a> after rather brief <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Albums_Archive_5_9166.html#.22Personnel.22" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums/Archive 5">discussion</a> some time ago. To be honest, I'm indifferent to the matter bacause I'm not a native English speaker and I don't really know which term is better. I didn't mean to do anything controversial with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">AWB</a> so I'm stopping to make this change for now. Please consider discussing this at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Albums_a2c7.html#Credits" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums">WikiProject Albums</a> because if the term "Personnel" is somehow more adequate it should be restored to the guideline.

I'm no expert on the matter, but I think the best places to look are <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> (a guide to when, where, how to cite) and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_templates_28d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation templates">Wikipedia:Citation templates</a> which gives a good guide for the usage of various templates available for citing things like books, websites, etc. For specific citations that would require footnotes (eg for a direct quote or exact figure for something), have a look at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite/Cite.php" class="extiw" title="m:Cite/Cite.php">m:Cite/Cite.php</a>, which is for the new footnote style (basically where you want the little number you put <code>&lt;ref&gt;(...citation...)&lt;/ref&gt;</code> and where you want the full list of references, you type <code>&lt;references/&gt;</code> and it is automatically generated). If you need a specific example, have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Webber&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Webber&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">source</a> of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Webber_e9d1.html" title="Mark Webber">Mark Webber</a> article.

<p>Hi, This is with regard to the portion of the AC/DC page dealing with their induction into the Hall of Fame.I'd included the quote from Steven Tyler, who inducted them and also the quote from Brian Johnson (part of the acceptance speech). Both or the latter one, keep getting removed due to one reason or the other. I have included both citations on the discussion page and also removed the portion referring to 'audience laughter', in the hope that the quotes would then merit inclusion.

<p>Please don't be offended - for what its worth I don't think the situation at present is ideal either and this isn't the way I would phrase things if I was writing this for myself. I completely sympathasie with your position but it would be a shame if this disuaded you from contributing to other Cornwall articles, many of which are in need of attention.

<p>Thanks for your message, I appreciate it. I also appreciate that my mood may have shown through in my comments somewhat - I don't mean to sound quite as stroppy as that. It does bother me though that I write an article, albeit a very minor one, which no-one else was interested in writing, and some unconnected busybody alters it to suit him/herself, despite being totally disinterested in the substance of the article itself. Still, you're right of course. I will check out the portal.

<p>Thanks for noticing my edits&#160;:) You've made quite a lot of great edits yourself. I've just been going along and changing things that I think improve the flow of various articles. Could you tell me which articles you think didn't need it? I'd be happy to discuss it with you. As for the years, I'm not sure if it's policy or not, but in articles relating to music just like to wikify the years to show, for example, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_music.html" title="2006 in music">2006 in music</a>. I've seen it done on countless other articles and I think it's useful showing what else happened in that year, music-wise. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51">HK51</a> 20:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, I see where I've been a bit of a nuisance! You don't sound like an a$$hole, far from it. I'm just a perfectionist by nature and can be a bit pedantic at times. Sorry for being annoying!

<p>I don't edit the AC/DC article very often but it pops up in my VandalProof window quite often so I check in to see what's happening from time to time. I had never noticed the "Moxy mention" before and when you pointed out that a ref was needed I thought I'd dig to see if one was available. There is a brief mention of the Bon-Buzz connection <a href="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/M/Moxy.html" class="external text" title="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/M/Moxy.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can use it if you want. I noticed after you tagged it, <a href="../../../n/o/-/User%7ENo-Bullet_ab70.html" title="User:No-Bullet">User:No-Bullet</a> rm'd it completely. It's not really that important but...since a cite was avilable...it adds some flesh to the paragraph. My own personal interest???...In the late 70's a very young Anger22 played in a band that opened shows for a long list of Canadian Hard rock bands including Triumph, April Wine, Frank Marino &amp; Mahogany Rush, Teaze, Goddo and also a few with Moxy. So seeing them ref'd into an AC/DC article was rather interesting.(to me anyways) Cheers <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnger22_483f.html" title="User:Anger22">Anger22</a> 23:57, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree hat "Born in London, he took part etc." is poor style. It could be changed to "He was born in London. He took part etc.".

<dd>I remember that somewhere was exactly explained that the place of birth was to be put otherwere than the initial lines, but frankly I can't find it anymore. Maybe it's been changed.

Further, I'm not planning to change all 900 F1 articles. I you check my contrib pages, you'll see I'm changing some random articles, mainly adding flags to GP articles; I change the style of some biographies of people I don't know the nationality while adding flags.

<dd>Hi. Just read your talk page. I know exactly what you mean regarding some editors, but I think (hope!) you will find that the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> article is improving steadily at the moment. I'm sure there will be problems again in the future, but with several of us working at it and administrators intervening to cool things down when appropriate it's coming along nicely.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that - the Schumacher article has certainly improved lately, and I am still watching it and all the other articles I worked on.

<p>No problem, I think the guy's fairly new so have been keeping a watch on the edits he's doing because he doesn't seem familiar with policies/customs here yet (it flagged up when he changed something in the 94 San Marino article as well as changing Tom Pryce to Welsh nationality from British and other F1 related stuff).

<p>He claims a large amount of the text (the stuff he deleted) was false, and well, I'm not sure whether it's best to go with what the sources say or whether to go with him (if he can prove he is actually Van Kriedt).

<dd>Yeh! This is quite exciting! I'll leave a comment on his talk page asking for proof of who he is. If he can prove he is Van Kriedt, you're right, an admin would need to be involved I think. We'll see where this goes though.

<p>Hi. I am Larry Van Kriedt. How would you like me to prove it to you. I'd be happy to. I am not sure how to do that on the net...</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>COULD YOU PLEASE STOP changing my father's name ALL THE TIME???? He is not born Pilette-Vlug, but Pilette. My grand-mother married Jan Vlug about 30 years after my father came into this world!</p>

<dd>What you have to understand is that this information came from an outside source, which is cited in the article. Changing it without even removing the cite, or using the discussion page, just looks like vandalism, hence I keep changing it back. If the information is wrong, change it properly and provide a source as confirmation, or put the information on the talk page so we can all understand who you are and why you are right. Apologies if it annoyed you, but I'm sure you accept that I was only relying on an otherwise reliable website for my information, and you never identified yourself before.

<dd>It was overdue. Good dedication/determination to articles related to a single topic is worth a little recognition. I really like seeing the info on the "Pre-Rumours" band that everyone forgets about. The band has an intersting history and your work on the topic is really seaming it all together. And try to leeway me a little on my "nasty with good intentioned critical commentaries"(they are rare on Wikipedia). After reverting 200-300 vandals per day...sometimes I just crack the lash to vent. But it usually has a "pro-encyclopedia" purpose to it. Really&#160;:) .

<p>Not sure if you're familiar with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Kath_09b1.html" title="Terry Kath">Terry Kath</a>? He was the original guitarist for the band <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28band%29.html" title="Chicago (band)">Chicago</a>. Many people can't stand the band's music....but Kath was a completely unique guitarist. A while ago I stumbled upon the guitarist's article and was shocked at what I found. It was the most poetic, uncited fancruft(understatement) I had ever read. I took some time to clean up the text and put a few {ref} tags on some of the more obvious text. Here-in lies my problem. An anon IP(range w. 1 user) had taken <b>EXTREME</b> <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> of the article and went on an edit war to keep re-adding all the crap. I had an admin intervene and the IP slowed somewhat. Earlier this week I thought the trouble was going to start over after the IP returned from Christmas break and immediately rv'd the article back to their own favourite version. Since then I have managed to begin some amount of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> dialogue with the editor about Wikipedia policy. You can read some of the IP's comments on my talk page. He strongly believes citations are messy and NOT required ...and that it should be written as a tribute for the enjoyment of the guitarist's fans. Sorry for the long-worded history but I wanted to give you the background. I know you're busy with your own Wikiprojects...but could you add the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Kath_09b1.html" title="Terry Kath">Terry Kath</a> article to your watchlist and monitor it for any "edit-gaffs". And, maybe if you have the time you could give it a read-over and maybe even a half decent copy-edit. By all means {fact} tag it where ever you see fit to tag it. I would appreciate anoither set of eyes watching it as I am in the middle of a whirlwind business trip and only able to pop in/out of Wiki. Thanks, cheers and take care! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnger22_483f.html" title="User:Anger22">Anger22</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAnger22_263b.html" title="User talk:Anger22">Talk 2 22</a>)</small> 01:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for adding it to your list. Actually, last night the fanboy took on such extreme attack across several articles to the point where I had to call in an admin favour and get the articles semi-protected. I expect the semi-P will be temporary. Once it's removed I can almost guarantee the IP range(128.100.X.X) will go straight into "let's make it a starry eyed teen magazine fanpage" mode&#160;:) .

<p>Hi. Yes, but saying he's not a reliable source <i>is</i> an opinion. Perhaps I misunderstood you and perhaps you read too much into my comments, I didn't intend to offend you. I just think getting into 'he's not a suitable source' is a slippery slope. Overall it's that issue and not the logic of the actual statement (which I agree is lacking) that bothered me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 21:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your generous comments, because despite my comments defending myself I thought I had maybe overstepped the line. I'm glad you realised there was no offence intended. And I agree with the current direction of the debate, i.e. Jordan's comments are an over-simplification.

<p>Hi Bretonbanquet. I notied that earlier today, you updated <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Brise_73d3.html" title="Tony Brise">Tony Brise</a> to include his place of birth and death in the opening sentence. Yesterday <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">User:Attilios</a> was changing a lot of driver articles to <i>remove</i> the place of birth and death from the opening sentence. I'm not sure which style (if either) if preferable according to the MOS, but you may care to discuss the matter with Attilios, otherwise you might find him undoing some of your edits.

<p>Hi Bretonbanquet. I've noticed that in the driver career summary tables you've updated recently, you've been making the contents of the WDC and Points columns bold. I think it looks good. Shall we adopt that as the standard? (The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_Tables_2df2.html#Driver_career_summary_table" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One/Tables">current standard for driver tables</a> says that the WDC and Points columns should only be bold if the driver finished in the top 3 in the WDC). BTW, you are are a career-summary-table updating machine! As you may (or may not) have noticed, I'm working my way methodically backwards through the alphabet, updating the "really old style" tables. Every so often I pause when I get to a "big one", but I'm forcing myself to do them in order, because I figure that if I just "hunt and peck", I'll just do all the small/easy ones and the big/hard ones will never get done! <a href="../../../d/h/8/User%7EDH85868993_9883.html" title="User:DH85868993">DH85868993</a> 23:51, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
