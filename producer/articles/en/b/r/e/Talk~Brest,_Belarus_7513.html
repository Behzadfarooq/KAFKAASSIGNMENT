	    <p>The following caught my attention: <i>It was renamed Brest-Litovsk in the 14th century and became the capital of the combined Polish and Lithuanian kingdom in 1569</i>.

<p>To 'add' to the deletion concerning the Ukrainian connection, it is surely worth stressing that Ukrainian nationalists were every bit as greedy (some maybe even still are - plus ca change) to get their hands on the city -and above all the vital railway junction - as the Poles, Russians, and so on and so forth. Details as to who made what claims and in what circumstances needn't be all that clear even now, because much of the documentation would still be inaccesible to mere mortal researchers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it is important to stress the fact that a small number of avidly opinion-at-ed debators have lost sight of what here is the most important subject; i.e. not national or political isues but above all else the specific urban question of this exceptionally unfortunate city (ispan.72).</p>

<p>The dispute is over the name lineup. The names were Byelorussian, Polish, Russian and Lithuanian. So guy came and removed Lithuanian name in name lineup, saying <i>that it is Lithuanian name removed as it is not used</i>, but somehow the Russian and polish names has “Литовск” and “Litewski” (means Lithuanian) . Also, city was annexed by Grand Duchy of Lithuania. So, in my opinion, there is enough foundation to leave Lithuanian name in name lineup too. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 14:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This guy expressed his oppinion in these words:"what is now called Lithuanian language was never widely used in the Grand Duchy - the Baltic name for the city was never used at all".

<dl>
<dd>It's a common known fact.
<dl>
<dd>I will tell you that is fact – Grand Duchy of Lithuania was founded by the <b>Baltic Lithuanian tribe</b>, which evolved several stages (like <i>Kingdom of Lithuania</i>), after annexation of Slavic lands (present day Belarus, Ukraine, parts of Russia) by Lithuanians, Slavic people played important role in state. And you comment – <i>dominated</i>- pure nationalistic statement.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not so simple. Firstly that you identified as <i>official language</i> had a different approach – <i>chancellery language</i> (ruthenian) of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Second point is - within chancellery other languages were used, and not fragmentary.</dd>

<dd>Documents clearly show the language dominating in the Grand Duchy. There was a famous case when the Republic of Lithuania started demanding medieval GDL archives that were brought by Russians to St.Petersburg and Moscow, from the USSR in 1920-ies. The Russians agreed to give to the RL all documents <i>written in Lithuanian</i> - and there was ardly a single of them found there.--<a href="../../../c/z/a/User%7ECzalex_99cc.html" title="User:Czalex">Czalex</a> 08:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In one point you are right – indeed documents clearly show the language spread in Grand Duchy of Lithuania Chandlery. Take for instance time frame – until XVIc. In XVc. documents, which were written in German language, were used more greatly in numbers then Ruthenian, not even counting written in Latin. And just for interest until mid XVI c. Volhynia/ Luck dialect was so notable in Garn Duchy of Lithuania chandlery that to call it as you did below as nowadays called Belarusian is illogical.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Stop, writing nonsense! There was no Belarusian language at all in chancellery! Polish language replaced Ruthenian language. Your pathetic statement - <i>was never used even as a chancellery language</i> – one more nationalism and only proving absence of your skills in this time period. “Interesting” you variation - <i>the language nowadays known as Lithuanian</i>- , - <i>Belarusian was replaced by Polish</i> –
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The language that was in the Middle Age referred to as <i>Ruthenian</i> on the lands of the Grand Duchy is nowadays called Belarusian. The linkage is direct. --<a href="../../../c/z/a/User%7ECzalex_99cc.html" title="User:Czalex">Czalex</a> 08:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hope there are no Ukrainians editors around, because they probably give you some hard words. First of all you confusing (not for first time) some points. Term Ruthenian (which applied if speaking about some Slavic languages/dialects) is scientist definition with contemporary base, definition includes Slavic dialects which were in present day Ukaraine, Belarus some parts of Russia and +- territory , and linked with dependence to Grand Duchy of Lithuania. So to place Ruthenian = <i>nowadays called Belarusian</i> is once again showing your absent skills.</dd>
<dd>BTW, contemporary Ruthenian was not applied only Middle Age …. Do you know Middle Age time frame in first place? <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 22:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was no such thing as "official language" status in the times of GDL. "Official language" is a modern day terminology. Very few people could write or even read back then. Reading and writing was important in Christian countries, where the word of God came from written sources of Bible. Lithuanians as pagans worshipped nature forces and didn't feel the need to get the messages from their gods through the written texts. So the best educated people who could read and write where Ruthenian orthodox priests and monks, who came together with the Ruthenian and Slav Christian wifes of Lithuanian dukes. These marriages between ruler families were important in keeping peace between Baltic and Slavonian regions. The claim that "Litvins" were actually Bielarussians and not the ancestors of modern Lithuanians is ungrounded. There are many facts against this claim, some of them are mentioned in comments by M.K.
<dl>
<dd>And saying that you do not see a Slavonic cultural and intellectual domination in the GDL?
<dl>
<dd>Second it should be noted that edicts, documents of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in XVc. had been issued in German language much more often then in Ruthenian…..</dd>
<dd>And yes western culture impact was the most dramatic beginning from castle building techniques ending in unique correspondence. And much much more statements to put down your -<i>intellectual domination</i>- <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a></dd>

<dd>No, I don't see. The Catholic church later dominated in GDL much more than Orthodox church. By the way, discussion about "domination" will lead to nowhere, especially "intellectual domination". Hitler also though that somebody is "intelectually" and "culturally" above all. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuraune_3bc3.html" title="User:Juraune">Juraune</a> 12:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An other mistake often made by historicians from the Republic of Lithuania is to 100% identify modern Belarusians and medieval Slavs. All Belarusian lands were historically inhabited by Baltic tribes that were later assimilated by Slavs and actually just took a Slavic language. Some of this assimilation took place even in the Middle Age, so culturally and mentally the Belarusians are actually almost a Baltic nation too (or ancestors of Baltic tribes). Just like <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish.html" title="Scottish">Scottish</a> people are ancestors of Celtic tribes despite their speaking a Germanic language.--Czalex <a href="../../../b/e/l/Image%7EBelarus_Coat_of_Arms%2C_1991.png_60d1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/26/Belarus_Coat_of_Arms%2C_1991.png/15px-Belarus_Coat_of_Arms%2C_1991.png" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/e/l/Image%7EBelarus_Coat_of_Arms%2C_1991.png_60d1.html" /></a> 20:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Super nationalistic theory! The main goal of this nationalistic theory which represents nationalist Czalex, is –people of present day Byelorussian territory assimilated with Slavs only in language level. Pure fantasy of course. While, nobody denies that Balts inhabited quite a bigger territory then today (parts of present day Poland, Russia, Byelorussia too) but statement - <i>actually just took a Slavic language</i> - is pathetic. The contradiction is in nationalist Czalex statements quite noticeable:- <i>dominated by Slavonic (Belarusian and Ukrainean) culture</i>-, - <i>Slavonic cultural and intellectual domination</i>- and - <b>so culturally and mentally the Belarusians are actually almost a Baltic nation too</b>- .</dd>

<dd>The name "Brest" can be explained not only as the Slavonian word for Elm, but by the common words to Slavonic and Baltic languages with Indo-European roots: "бродить", "перебираться" in Russian, "bristi", in Lithuanian, which means to go through something, to cross a river in a shalow place. "Brasta" is the word for a shallow place in the river in Lithuanian.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You could, if “old” Ruthenian language as such, was still a live language. Like Lithuanian language is still a live with minimal changes compared to other European languages during the centuries, that’s way to linguist Lithuanian language is a treasure chest… <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a></dd>

<dd>The name <i>Brest</i> is not original. It was deriven by Russian occupational administration from the Polish name <i>Brzesc</i>. That was the way Poles assimilated the ancient name <i>Bierascie</i> (or <i>Berestje</i>).

<p>Don't want to get too heavily involved. The name of the Belarusian city as its known today in English. Period. No Polish, no Russian , no Lithuanian, no Japanese. If there is a link in those languages, great. Then we can know what the name of the city in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan.html" title="Catalan">Catalan</a> is, if necessary, and there's a link to Catalan. If a former name is warranted in the history section of the article, it can be added without POV and the rest of the crap, that exasperates people of good will trying to present a balanced Wikipeda. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 02:26, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never tried to rename the main article name; I was arguing the secondary name lineup. Also I believe that possible solution could be as fallows – leave only the main name (Brest) without all these diff. languages and make link as this - see also <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html#B" title="Names of European cities in different languages">other historical names of the city</a>.

<dd>Well, the town was very important in Russian history and is commonly found in western sources on WWII under its Russian name. Hence that name should be mentioned somewhere. Also, for most of its existence it has been a part of Poland, which makes the Polish name relevant as well IMO. On the other hand I believe Czalex is right that the Lithuanian name was most probably never used widely enough, not even in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where Lithuanian language was used by but a minority of people for most of its existence. However, I do not feel very strongly about it. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 08:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree Russian is the official language of Belarus, that has actual preferance at present. If Minsk has a Russian heading Brest certainely cannot be an exception.
