Is there a reason for confusing the historical Brendan of Clonfert with the "Saint Brendan" of the <i>Navigatio</i> I have material for the <i>Voyage</i> but hesitate to post it and have it mangled. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If they are two different people, they do indeed deserve two different articles. I had understood that the semi-legendary Brendan the Navigator and the historical Brendan of Clonfert were essentially two different bodies of lore relating to the same person. Listing the two as duplicate articles did nothing to dispersuade me of that notion, and I tried to harmonize them while keeping the essential data from both articles here. If I was wrong, everything needs to be reverted. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Have you looked into translations of the <i>Navigatio?</i> The crystal column? the fallen angel-birds... 'Semi-legendary' would have to apply to the <i>Odyssey</i> too then. Or Sir John Mandeville. Or Prester John? But Brendan of Clonfert, canonized after his death-- that's a real person. (BTW, I enjoy your entries and editing <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have read the <i>Navigatio.</i> Now what I started doing was a basic article merge: you put all the text on one page, and then you go through and cut what's redundant from one to the other. I gather that you'd prefer a different approach, one that treats B of C and StB as two separate though related subjects?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I suspect that "semi-legendary" is about right about StB and Odysseus. I see no reason to deny that the Trojan War took place, that a leader named Odysseus fought in it, and that he took the long way home. The story got embellished in the re-telling, and that's my take on the <i>Navigatio</i> as well. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:43, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>There I go again.. After a few "minor" edits by Kenneth, the article now reads like this (after being Faroe islands for a while):</p>
<p><i>It is possible that Brendan may have encountered the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shetland_Islands_3fe5.html" title="Shetland Islands">Shetland Islands</a> on his journey, perhaps being their first historical coloniser, as the <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney_Islands_6d30.html" title="Orkney Islands">Orkney Islands</a> were recolonised by Christian missionaries about this time. The Orkneys had been heard of and commonly known to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monks</a> but Shetlands were not, representing the next step outwards from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> may have relied on the legends told of St Brendan as part of his argument that it was indeed possible to travel to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> by crossing the Atlantic.</i></p>
<p>This section now makes no sense. Why would Christopher Columbus have relied on these legends if Brendan discovered the Shetland islands? Do we have references in the literature about Brendan that theorize about him ending up on the Shetland islands? If so, I'm for keeping this in the article, but that doesn't change what I'm going to say in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>The section <i>used</i> to talk about the speculations that Brendan ended up i America on his voyages. These speculations are well known and is something an encyclopedia should report. If we want to report more, we should offer arguments for and against. Obviously Kenneth is in the 'against' camp. We should <i>not</i> be changing this to the Shetland islands! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_faassen_e460.html" title="User:Martijn faassen">Martijn faassen</a> 14:54, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Popular knowledge about traveling capabilities have proven that the Catholic emissaries were just landing upon the Orkneys later by a few decades. I think it highly absurd to postulate that Brendan would have made it to America when there isn't much mention of the Shetlands during his time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've actually found some references online (but where? I can't find it anymore) which place him on the Shetlands as *part* of the voyage, but them have him possibly go to the Americas later on. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_faassen_e460.html" title="User:Martijn faassen">Martijn faassen</a> 16:32, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Columbus fluffed his image to look descended professionally from people like Brendan. It certainly gained him enough money for his voyage. There was no proper understanding of America in those times, from Europe. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenneth_Alan_5c1f.html" title="User:Kenneth Alan">Lord Kenneð Alansson</a> 16:49, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the most, I'd concede he might have hit the Faroes, considering it had been long known as the "Sheep Isles", Norway being <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thule.html" title="Thule">Thule</a>. Sheep livestock raising is a key signature of Christian agriculture in the Isles. There had been no traces of European remains in the Americas before vikings. If you would have it that he hit "America", or likely they thought "Atlantis", then this is just too mythological and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantastic</a>. Oh, and he did not record such people as "Skraelings" or ice. Considering their technology, I'd say Atlantis wasn't any further west than the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Islands_dc3b.html" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/o/Azores.html" title="Azores">Azores</a> and I'd laugh if it were said to be <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Most people do not adhere to the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> story anyways, so why is the notion that he hit America so valid?? <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenneth_Alan_5c1f.html" title="User:Kenneth Alan">Lord Kenneð Alansson</a> 16:04, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not proposing he hit America. But it's a long standing theory that is talked about by many people. Removing this theory from the encyclopedia page about him would be unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_faassen_e460.html" title="User:Martijn faassen">Martijn faassen</a> 16:32, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we can talk about how people have speculated and dreamed of it, but providing it as definite, or the chief source of view doesn't scientifically uphold itself. It is laughable, sort of like the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a> practitioners pretending that they are the same as their ancestors, or that their amendments to include all cultures into their frame of reference for their occult nature when no such understanding of other cultures existed during ancient times. The 60s may have been good to help us analyse and idealise, but trying to change facts to fit those ideals of the present, doesn't work. That's looking at history backwards. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenneth_Alan_5c1f.html" title="User:Kenneth Alan">Lord Kenneð Alansson</a> 16:49, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have lots of opinions about stuff, but all I'm trying to point out in the role of dry encyclopedist is that we should put this view in the article. We can say it is considered unlikely. The voyages after all were recorded hundreds of years after the event. Just by putting in these things in the right order lets people draw their own conclusions. Omitting the America speculation is only making this encyclopedia less valuable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_faassen_e460.html" title="User:Martijn faassen">Martijn faassen</a> 18:50, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's the same newadvent.com I am thinking of, that would have been taken from the online Catholic Encyclopedia, a source from the early 1900s, and public domain.

Not sure that this text does, but if it does, all that has to be done is to add that bit in, and an appropriate notice will appear. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:39, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Speaking of the Canary Islands, aside from the known seven islands, the native people sometimes refer to the Isla de San Borondon, or Island of St. Brendan, as another island of the group. This is not really an island, but a bank of cloud that hangs to the north of Gran Canaria and Teneriffe and is visible during certain times of the year. Aside from the voyage to the Americas, perhaps the voyage to the Islands of Paradise was actually to the Canaries, and this legend is the last trace of this adventure, separate from the one reenacted by Tim Severin to North America, and subsecuently confused with it. 68.127.231.197 04:16, 26 December 2005 (UTC) Robert Waid</i></dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> — Smerdis has made a good case that this Brendan is the major use of the name unadorned (the others have other names). — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 21:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Even as a saint, I've primarily seen him referred to as "Brendan the Voyager", or "Brendan of Clonfort" in texts with a more formal tone. Indeed, I generally have only seen him referred to as "Saint" in religious texts, such as "Lives of the Saints" and on a Mass card I saw once. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">SigPig</a> 03:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I currently <b>oppose</b> moving the page. We do have a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Brendan (disambiguation)">Brendan (disambiguation)</a>; the Brendans disambiguated there all have last names, or are fictional characters. <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAMEPEOPLE_1870.html" title="WP:NAMEPEOPLE">WP:NAMEPEOPLE</a> suggests that titles like "saint" should only be used if they are the most effective way of disambiguating people; see also <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Western_clergy%29_2f12.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Western clergy)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Western clergy)</a>. St Brendan is the only Brendan who is just Brendan at the disambiguation page. I don't see that a move is strictly necessary, but if it is moved, it should be to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_of_Clonfort_fa30.html" title="Brendan of Clonfort">Brendan of Clonfort</a>, not <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Brendan_95c2.html" title="Saint Brendan">Saint Brendan</a>. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
