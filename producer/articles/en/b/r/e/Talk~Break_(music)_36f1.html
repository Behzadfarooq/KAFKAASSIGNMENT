<p>Originally the page said that Cash Crew were the first to sample the break from 'Take me to the Mardi Gras', but it was actually Rick Rubin in 'Peter Piper', a 1986 Run DMC track. Cash Crew did a re-construct of the beat on a drum machine, not the same thing at all.</p>

<p>I object to the redirection of "breakdown section", which is a separate and distinct terminology and the parent concept behind break as in breakdance. Breakdown Section is the highest and most proper terminology for this usage, and it has its own singular origin and usage. Start asking REAL DJs what the most appropriate term is before you take the entire language into your own hands and move things out of order. What about discussion on such matters? - tednor</p>
<dl>
<dd>I second that motion, mostly because the distinction between breaks and breakdowns in the current article gets very hazy, with multiple, overlapping definitions and usages jostling each other. There should be separate articles for "Break (music)" and "Breakdown (music)". <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInnocuousPseudonym_4e93.html" title="User:InnocuousPseudonym">InnocuousPseudonym</a> 08:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>furthermore, "the breakdown" is shorthand for "the breakdown section", so breakdown section needs to be the highest usage of the term. "Breakdown" itself is extremely vague: it can be a verb, it can refer to a nervous breakdown, an automotive crisis, etc... <b>"Breakdown Section" specifically refers to the location on a dance recording that follows the second chorus</b>, there is <b>no conflicting usage</b> for this exact term.--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETednor_7c93.html" title="User:Tednor">Tednor</a> 21:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Articles on similar yet different topics may be combined until those articles are no longer stubs. This keeps wikipedia from having dozens of one sentence articles on closely related subjects.

<dd><b>Breakdown Sections as Creative Fodder</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As pertains to hip-hop culture, the breakdowns of records were the points that early hip-hop DJ's would mix together to form extended periods of rhythm (over which MC's would soon be rapping). The breakdowns lasted for a minute or more in most cases, making it easy for the DJ's to manually "cut" between two copies of the same record (on two turntables using a mixer console) and keep the same rhythmic composition going indefinitely. This inevitably led to more material being composed on top of the raw rhythms. This first took place in the 1970's in the work of Walter Gibbons (in a disco context), and street DJ's such as Cool DJ Herc in hip-hop music, but would spread to all forms of electronic music as the 1980's progressed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are instances where a breakdown section has become a separate recording of its own, such as "<i>Love Sensation</i>" by <a href="../../../l/o/l/Loleatta_Holloway_1d80.html" title="Loleatta Holloway">Loleatta Holloway</a> which became "<i>Ride on Time</i>" by <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_7017.html" title="Black Box">Black Box</a>, and "<i>Good Times</i>" by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chic.html" title="Chic">Chic</a> which became "<i>Rapper's Delight</i>" by the <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugarhill_Gang_cf2e.html" title="Sugarhill Gang">Sugarhill Gang</a>. Please see <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapper%27s_Delight_c362.html" title="Rapper's Delight">Rapper's Delight</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salsoul.html" title="Salsoul">Salsoul</a> for supporting information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A breakdown is different from a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Break_%28music%29.html" title="Break (music)">break</a> as "breaks are for the drummer; breakdowns are for hands in the air" (ibid), a reference to the majority of breaks stripping away other instruments and leaving the drums or percussion. The current sub-genre of "breakbeat" is composed by DJs who loop recordings of drum breaks together into poly-rhythmic "breakbeat"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed the section above as it is about breaks, which are covered above in the article. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 01:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>...the reason this article appears to run on and diverge so much is exactly the reason I objected to the merger of Break and Breakdown section in the first place, and it's only going to get worse because (particularly in the area of Breakdown Section), there is an INCREDIBLE amount of elaboration yet to come.

<dl>
<dd>If breakdowns are used to transition between numbers, then they cannot precede the climax in a number and are not a break from anything except numbers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(note: <i>breakdown sections</i> are not used in this way ('between numbers'), they occur within a single composition exactly as described by myself and others who preceded me on this point (to precede and heighten the climax of a composition, as well as ease the mixing of two records and give the floor some righteous groove to dance to)--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETednor_7c93.html" title="User:Tednor">Tednor</a> 16:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>You are incorrect in assuming breakbeats originate from breaks. Prior to digital equipment, a LIVE dj had to cut between playing copies of the same recording, meaning a typical break gave him 20 seconds to align the rhythms of the two recordings. Amazingly, this was done by a few VERY talented DJ's (such as Walter Gibbons, who you removed...) but in reality it needed to be the Breakdown SECTIONS that were used to create hip hop in the broadest sense. "Breakbeats" as a GENRE itself followed the advent of inexpensice digital sampling equipment (one very notable exception is the group Coldcut, who spent hours splicing together sections of tape that sometimes consisted of 1/2 bars of drums, then ran the tape loop all over the room by sticking pencils into nooks and crannies to support the tape, then they had to manually control the feed through the reel to reel machine as they dubbed it into a larger section for more practical usage. They were probably the most exceptional group in the whole genre, and only issued a handful of tracks made this way because they simply didn't have time to produce lots of material in this fashion.--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETednor_7c93.html" title="User:Tednor">Tednor</a> 16:38, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I am incorrect, prove it with a quote or citation. However, breakbeats did not evolve from breaks. They are breaks. You may wish to consult Toop's<i>Rap Attack 2: African Rap To Global Hip Hop</i> (especially p.113-115). <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-85242-243-2</a>. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 23:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't what the guys is saying about this, but it looks like he's saying that taking a part from one record and using it to make another is not creative (?) I don't get it.</p>

<p>This accomplishment belongs firmly to Tom Moulton, the inventor of the dance remix, and not DJ Kool Herc. Furthermore, any mention of Kool Herc needs to firmly state the apocryphal nature of his existence. As someone who read the music weeklies religiously at the end of the 1980s, I will tell you flat-out that Herc went from being a myth to being re-constructed via second-hand accounts to slowly and magically evolving into a person that everybody seems to have known first hand. The chronology of the articles documenting Herc will verify this fact. At any rate, he was by no means the first person to string sections of rhythm together to make the record play longer. He was perhaps the most noted STREET dj to focus on breakdowns alone in his repertoire, a mention that I would not contest, provided it is accompanied by the fact that he is more aprocryphal than concrete. Furthermore, common sense tells us that plenty of Dj's were mixing between two copies of a record, that's what discoteques were all about with the birth of the remix and the possibilities it presented. To state such things as "the first to buy two copies of a record to mix between them" is pure hogwash!--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETednor_7c93.html" title="User:Tednor">Tednor</a> 21:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just cite a source which claims that Moulton was the first. Then we can describe the difference between what Toop says and what other sources say. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 23:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
