<p>Perhaps we should separate between "British breakfast foods" and "N.A. breakfast foods."

<p>I don't think that English 'dinner' or French dîner come from disjejunare; French (outside of France) uses déjeuner to mean breakfast. It seems unlikely that the same word would be used for breakfast and dinner. Also, the word déjeuner is transparent in meaning, much like English 'breakfast': jeûne means 'a fast'.<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 21:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That "déjeuner" would evolve to "lunch" seems unlikely, and needs references. "Lunch" comes from "luncheon", a word that seems to have no similarity to "déjeuner" whatsoever.</p>

<p>Quote: <i>Outside of Scandinavia, a continental Western European breakfast is scarcely more than a snack to tide one over until lunch.</i></p>
<p>Depends what you mean by "Continental Western European", I suppose, but the statement above is untrue even if you look no further than Benelux and Germany. What the British call a "Continental breakfast" is really a Mediterranean breakfast. A more substantial style of breakfast -- including eggs, meat, cheese, etc -- is taken all over northern continental Europe, not just in Scandinavia. -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 20:08, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know. When I started editing this, the geographical stuff that was here was insane, and I've tried to improve it, but it is still really frustrating me. Go look at what was here before. And it's not just Europe - I've been struggling with North and South America, and the absence of Australia and Africa, and as for Asia and the Middle East, argh. It's bizarre. A little less so now than before, but really - have at it. I didn't feel I should wipe out the whole thing and start from scratch (although I sort of did with what had been North America), but maybe it would have taken less time! --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 21:28, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

I share your frustration with the way this subject has been treated and applaud your attempts to insert a little more cool-headed analysis here. It's a very strange thing, isn't it, how many myths and halftruths circulate around what one would have thought the rather banal theme of "breakfast" -- see the "Irish/English breakfast" wars at <a href="../../../i/r/i/Talk%7EIrish_breakfast_2b8d.html" title="Talk:Irish breakfast">Talk:Irish breakfast</a>, the most ironic facet of which is that, with the possible exception of Sundays, the great majority of "traditional Irish/English" breakfasts eaten are, in any case, probably those served by the catering trade... very largely to tourists. -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 16:02, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, no. I was just venting, having been beating my head against my desk for a while with no one to talk to about that wretched "continental breakfast", et al.

<p>I have never known a Danish breakfast to include meats, but before I edit, I will investigate. As far as I know, "traditional" breakfasts would consist of eggs and lots of solid breads with well-aged cheeses. Sweet pastries are usually reserved for weekends or special occasions. "Modern" Danish breakfasts, as I know them, are often hot or cold cereals, or a bowl of yogurt (perhaps with a topping).</p>

<p>We have discussed the subject of meats at the Danish breakfast, and I have made a revision to the text from "ham and sausages" to "cold cuts" (with a list of specific cold cuts common). This way to avoid a misunderstanding that I refer to American-style breakfast "ham and sausages". Meats are not common to Danish breakfast, but "might" show up when a bigger more substantial spread is desired (for example, with guests, with a later breakfast, with a special occassion). But then breakfast traditions also vary from family to family. <a href="../../../s/f/d/User%7ESfdan_f912.html" title="User:Sfdan">Sfdan</a> 2 July 2005 04:23 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, that's a holdover from the somewhat weird first edition. However, I suppose if one worked the night shift, one might eat breakfast in the evening. Perhaps you could change it to something more along the lines of whenever one "breaks a fast". --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 30 June 2005 22:10 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmm... as a night time worker (1800–0600) I have always called my first meal of the <i>day</i> breakfast, although it may not contain the common breakfast ingredients. Employers (at least here in America) call your longest break, "Lunch", which would frequently be the second meal of the day. Dinner would round out the day at #3. Note I differentiate meal from snack... a meal normally is prepared/ordered with nutritional and portion needs addressed. A snack, would normally be a few bites of food, nutritional or not, to "hold one over" until the next meal. Are there any locations that have more than 3 meals per day? <b>…<a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_M_2232.html" title="User:Guy M"><font color="red">G</font><font color="orange">u</font><font color="#BBBB00">y</font>&#160;<font color="green">M</font></a>…</b>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../g/u/y/User_talk%7EGuy_M_158f.html" title="User talk:Guy M">soapbox</a>)</sup> 16:50, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are plenty of other defined meal times such as brunch, morning tea (<a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevenses.html" title="Elevenses">elevenses</a>), afternoon tea, supper. I notice that an accurate definition of each meal becomes more difficult as the years go by as we dilute traditional definitions through the globalisation of culture.

<p>Well, of course you can eat whatever you want in the morning, maybe this is becoming a trend, but I dont know if thats really an emerging traditon. I suppose those people eating their left-over pizza usually get up at brunch/lunch time so they could easily eat whatever is left-over and usually they have a mikro-wave, so how many studies are there that the pizza has to be cold&#160;?</p>

<p>I don't understand the "2 out of 3" business from the introduction. Certainly there is no "rule" in this sense, and if there is, a citation would be necessary.
