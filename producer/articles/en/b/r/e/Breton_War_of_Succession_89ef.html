<p>The <b>Breton War of Succession</b> was a conflict between the Houses of Blois and Montfort for control of the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Brittany_1603.html" title="Duchy of Brittany">Duchy of Brittany</a>. It was fought between <a href="../../../1/3/4/1341.html" title="1341">1341</a> and <a href="../../../1/3/6/1364.html" title="1364">1364</a>. It formed an integral part of the early <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years_War_ada8.html" title="Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</a> due to the involvement of the French and English governments in the conflict; the French supported Blois whilst the English backed Montfort and both sides expended considerable resources on this war. Although Montfort was ultimately successful following the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Auray_785e.html" title="Battle of Auray">battle of Auray</a> in <a href="../../../1/3/6/1364.html" title="1364">1364</a>, it was the French who were to gain the most from his victory.</p>

<p>In the middle of the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> was ruled by the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Dreux_fc9a.html" title="House of Dreux">House of Dreux</a>. The dukes had a historical connection to England and were also <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Richmond_4027.html" title="Earl of Richmond">Earls of Richmond</a> in Yorkshire. Duke <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_II%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_240e.html" title="Arthur II, Duke of Brittany">Arthur II of Dreux</a> married twice, first to Mary of Limoges (1260-1291), then to Yolande of Dreux, countess of Montfort (1263-1322) and widow of king <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_III_of_Scotland_ed9b.html" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III of Scotland</a>. From his first marriage he had three sons, including his heir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_III%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_28c5.html" title="John III, Duke of Brittany">John III</a> and Guy, count of Penthievre (d. 1331). From Yolande, Arthur had another John who became count of Montfort. (See <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukes_of_Brittany_family_tree_2843.html" title="Dukes of Brittany family tree">Dukes of Brittany family tree</a>.)</p>
<p>John III strongly disliked the children of his father’s second marriage. He spent the first years of his reign attempting to have this marriage annulled and his half-siblings bastardized. When this failed, he tried to ensure that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_IV%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_4f6b.html" title="John IV, Duke of Brittany">John of Montfort</a> would never inherit the duchy. Since John III was childless, his heir of choice became <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_of_Dreux_5c0b.html" title="Joanna of Dreux">Joanna of Dreux</a>, <i>la Boiteuse</i>, daughter of his younger brother Guy. In <a href="../../../1/3/3/1337.html" title="1337">1337</a> she married <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_4394.html" title="Charles, Duke of Brittany">Charles of Blois</a>, the second son of a powerful French noble house and sister-son of king <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_VI_of_France_1de8.html" title="Philip VI of France">Philip VI of France</a>. But in <a href="../../../1/3/4/1340.html" title="1340">1340</a>, John III reconciled himself with his half-brother, and made a will that appointed John of Montfort the heir of Brittany. <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_30.html" title="April 30">30 April</a> <a href="../../../1/3/4/1341.html" title="1341">1341</a> John III died. Uttered on his deathbed, his last words on the succession were, "For God’s sake leave me alone and do not trouble my spirit with such things."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breton_War_of_Succession_89ef.html" title="Edit section: The War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The War</span></h2>
<p>Most of the nobility supported Charles of Blois, so if John of Montfort was to have any chance, he was dependent upon swift action before organized resistance could be made. John quickly took possession of the ducal capital <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> and then seized the ducal treasury at <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges.html" title="Limoges">Limoges</a>. By the middle of August, John of Montfort was in possession of most of the duchy, including the three principal cities, Nantes, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rennes.html" title="Rennes">Rennes</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vannes.html" title="Vannes">Vannes</a>.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the succession crisis had been a purely internal affair. But to complicate things further, the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years%27_War_fd8c.html" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a> between <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> had broken out four years earlier, in <a href="../../../1/3/3/1337.html" title="1337">1337</a>. In 1341 there was truce between the two countries, but there was little doubt that hostilities would be renewed when the truce ended in June <a href="../../../1/3/4/1342.html" title="1342">1342</a>. Thus, when rumours reached <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_VI_of_France_1de8.html" title="Philip VI of France">Philip VI of France</a> that John of Montfort had received English agents, the French Crown naturally took a more direct interest in the situation. Charles of Blois became the official French candidate. Whatever had been his original intentions, John of Montfort was now forced to support <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_III_of_England_1878.html" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> as King of France.</p>
<p>Edward III was bound by the truce not to take any offensive action in France. Nothing in it hindered France from subduing rebellious vassals. In November, after a short siege and defeat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Champtoceaux_fab0.html" title="Battle of Champtoceaux">battle of Champtoceaux</a>, John of Montfort was forced to surrender at <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> by the citizens. He was offered safe conduct to negotiate a settlement with Charles of Blois, but when this led nowhere he was thrown in prison.</p>
<p>It now fell upon John’s wife, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_of_Flanders_0ec8.html" title="Joanna of Flanders">Joanna of Flanders</a> to lead the Montfortist cause. Deeming her possessions in the east undefendable, she set up headquarters at <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hennebont.html" title="Hennebont">Hennebont</a> in western Brittany but was driven into Brest and besieged, the siege being broken by the arrival of an English army under the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_de_Bohun%2C_1st_Earl_of_Northampton_d7c4.html" title="William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton">Earl of Northampton</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Brest_%281342%29_ff94.html" title="Battle of Brest (1342)">naval battle of Brest</a>. In Paris it was feared that Edward III would land at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a> once the truce ran out. The major part of the French army was therefore withdrawn, and Charles of Blois left to pursue his claim on his own. Charles soon proved himself as an able soldier, Rennes and Vannes were taken and many of Montfortist captains defected.</p>
<p>In late November, Edward III arrived with his army at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_France_092f.html" title="Brest, France">Brest</a>. He almost at once marched against Vannes. The siege dragged on and a French army was assembled to meet him, but <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">19 January</a> <a href="../../../1/3/4/1343.html" title="1343">1343</a>, before any major engagements could be fought, the two kings agreed upon a new truce. Vannes was taken into papal custody. With John of Montfort in prison, his son an infant, and his wife recently gone mad, the places under Montfortist control in practise to be administrated from London, with a large permanent English garrison at Brest.</p>
<p>The truce was to last until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="../../../1/3/4/1346.html" title="1346">1346</a> with the hopes that in the meantime the disputes between the two kingdoms could be permanently settled, but in Brittany it made little difference. The truce bound the two kings and their followers, but Charles of Blois claimed to be fighting his own separate war, and was therefore not bound by any truce. The brutal small scale fighting continued at the same pace.</p>
<p>In Paris John of Montfort was released from prison <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">1 September</a> <a href="../../../1/3/4/1343.html" title="1343">1343</a> in return for a huge bond and a promise to stay on his estates in the east. The English coastal garrisons held firm, but the Montfortist party continued to crumble. They had some successes, such as the expulsion of the papal custodians from Vannes, but with no unifying leadership, mostly they were reduced to pleading for men and money from London.</p>
<p>To hamper communication between Brest and Vannes, Charles of Blois laid siege to <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quimper.html" title="Quimper">Quimper</a> in early March <a href="../../../1/3/4/1344.html" title="1344">1344</a>. The city fell by assault <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a> and, as usual, this meant the slaughter of civilians in huge numbers, between 1400 and 2000. The English prisoners were held for ransom, but the Breton and Norman captives were dispatched to Paris where they were executed for treason. During the summer and autumn the Montfortist party fell apart. Even those who had been John of Montfort’s staunchest allies now considered it futile to continue the struggle. It therefore mattered little that in March <a href="../../../1/3/4/1345.html" title="1345">1345</a> John finally managed to escape to England. With no adherents of note of his own, he was now little more than a figurehead for English ambitions in Brittany.</p>
<p>Edward III decided to repudiate the truce already in summer 1345, a year before it was due to run out. As part of his larger strategy, a force was dispatched to Brittany under the joint leadership of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_de_Bohun%2C_1st_Earl_of_Northampton_d7c4.html" title="William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton">Earl of Northampton</a> and John of Montfort. Within a week of their landing in June, the English had their first victory when Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Dagworth_f2f9.html" title="Thomas Dagworth">Thomas Dagworth</a>, one of Northampton’s lieutenants, raided central Brittany and defeated Charles of Blois at Cadoret near <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josselin.html" title="Josselin">Josselin</a>.</p>
<p>The follow-up was less impressive. Further operations were delayed until July when Montfort attempted the recapture of Quimper. However news had reached the French government that Edward’s main campaign had been cancelled and they were able to send reinforcements from Normandy. With his strengthened army, Charles of Blois broke the siege. Routed, Montfort fled back to Hennebont where he fell ill and died <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">16 September</a>. The heir to the Montfortist cause was his 5-year-old son <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_V%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_9ed4.html" title="John V, Duke of Brittany">John</a>.</p>
<p>During the winter Northampton fought a long and hard winter campaign with apparent objective of seizing a harbour on the north side of the peninsula. Edward III had probably planned to land here with his main force during summer <a href="../../../1/3/4/1346.html" title="1346">1346</a>. However the English achieved very little for their efforts. Northern Brittany was Joanna of Dreux’ home region and resistance here was stiff. The only bright spot for the English was the capture of the small town of La Roche-Derrien, where a garrison was installed under Richard Totesham.</p>
<p>In the end, Edward decided upon Normandy as the landing spot for his -46 campaign. Northampton was recalled and Thomas Dagworth was appointed as deputy lieutenant. It was during a tour through the English strongholds that on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">9 June</a> Dagworth and his escort were trapped by Charles of Blois and his army near Saint-Pol de Léon. They dug in on a hill top and fought off all attacks until nightfall when Charles was forced to retreat leaving many of his wounded behind.</p>
