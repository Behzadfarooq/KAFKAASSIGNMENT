<p>The area that is now Brentwood was a cotton farm until the City annexed the Brentwood neighborhood and purchased the land next to Brentwood Elementary to establish the Brentwood neighborhood park. That same year, Brentwood Elementary opened its doors for the 1951-1952 school year.</p>
<p>Local traditions include the Violet Crown Festival each year on the lawn of the Brentwood Park, and the annual decoration of the canal along Arroyo Seco with holiday lights called luminarias.</p>

<p>Brentwood is divided by a wide median creek on which stand many large trees along Arroyo Seco. The trees were planted in February 1993, and partially paid for by the Planting for the Future Fund, a special fund of the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department.</p>

<p>Major thoroughfares include Koenig Lane, Lamar Blvd., Burnet Road, and Highway 183 to the North. Brentwood is also situated close to the Guadalupe main thoroughfare to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_at_Austin_7a6d.html" title="University of Texas at Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a></p>
<p>Only 5% of Brentwood residents work outside Travis County, the average drive-time to work for residents who work outside the home is 17.5 minutes, 10% of residents carpool, and 5% use public transportation. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Summary File 3)</p>
<p>Future goals include investigating a pedestrian and bike route along Arroyo Seco. Possible plans may include a route under Koenig to allow the Southern end of the Brentwood neighborhood access to Brentwood Park without having to cross Koenig Lane during heavy traffic periods. Other possible bike and pedestrian options may evaluate closing one side of Arroyo Seco. Since Arroyo Seco is wide enough to allow two lane traffic on one side, the other side of the street may be made into public open space including a hike and bike trail.</p>

<p>According to the 2000 <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>-year 86% of the Brentwood population was over the age of 18: "A large majority, 45% of the neighborhod's residents, are from 25 to 44 years of age." Only 14% of the Brentwood population are under the age of 17, while only 17% of the population is over the age of 65. Further, 50% of the homes occupied in Brentwood are one-person households.</p>
<p>Brentwood has remained a liberal, eclectic neighborhood. In general, the area strongly <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_%28United_States%29_eecc.html" title="Green Party (United States)">Green Party</a>, with the occasional <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_Party_%28United_States%29_808f.html" title="Libertarian Party (United States)">Libertarian</a>.</p>
<p>The median family income, according to the 2000 census was $42,616. Due to the rising costs of housing, averaging a 10% increase per year, the median family income is likely to double in the next census. The average household size as of the 2000 census is 1.9 in the Brentwood neighborhood.</p>
<p>Just over 20% of the neighborhood's total population are <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic_American_666c.html" title="Hispanic American">Hispanic American</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28United_States_Census%29_a07d.html" title="Race (United States Census)">Latino</a>, while 74% of Brentwood's population are <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28United_States_Census%29_a07d.html" title="Race (United States Census)">White</a>, 1.8% are <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28United_States_Census%29_a07d.html" title="Race (United States Census)">Asian</a>, and 2.3% are <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28United_States_Census%29_a07d.html" title="Race (United States Census)">Black</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28United_States_Census%29_a07d.html" title="Race (United States Census)">African American</a>.(U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Summary File 1, Matrix P8)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentwood%2C_Austin%2C_Texas_11b8.html" title="Edit section: Housing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Housing</span></h2>
<p>As of 2000, there were just over 4,275 housing units in Brentwood. Most Brentwood residents reside in single-family homes, many of which—while seemingly modest in style, square footage and lot size—would rarely sell for less than $220,000 due to the area's high housing costs. There are also large, modern apartment complexes and condominiums located on most of district's primary and secondary thoroughfares, many of which are home to young professionals and students attending nearby UT-Austin. The average monthly cost of a mortgaged home in Brentwood was $1,300/mo in the 2000 Census.</p>
<p>According to the Austin Central Texas Realty Information Service (ACTRIS), the average price of a single-family home in Brentwood as of 2003 was $171,084. Brentwood has seen a dramatic increase in housing prices since 2000, after the Austin-Bergstrom Airport was relocated, making Brentwood outside of the Austin International Airport's flightpath.</p>
<p>Brentwood saw a dramatic increase in housing prices in 2000, soon after jet flightpaths were rerouted away from the area when the new <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Bergstrom_International_Airport_1427.html" title="Austin Bergstrom International Airport">Austin Bergstrom International Airport</a> replaced nearby Robert Mueller Municipal Airport.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Brentwood housing prices have seen a dramatic yearly increase according to (ACTRIS):</p>
<p><b>2003</b>: 29% increase</p>
<p><b>2002</b>: 17% increase</p>
<p><b>2001</b>: 4% increase</p>
<p><i>July 2006 sample homes that sold:</i></p>
<p>Choquette, recent remodel, 2007 sqft, 3-2, $385,000 (MLS listed)</p>
<p>Karen, window units, 1008 sqft, 3-1, $189,000 (MLS listed)</p>
<p>A search of the MLS for Brentwood homes (partial MLS areas 2 and 1B), reveal house prices ranging from $385,000-$189,000. The lower end of the price range display homes needing some repair, investor deals, or containing window units rather than central air. This is according to an Austin Home Search for Brentwood homes conducted in July 2006.</p>

<p>Public open space includes Brentwood Park, spanning just over nine acres, with tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds and a playscape. Future plans for the neighborhood include researching locations to open a neighborhood dog park. Only 1% of the Brentwood neighborhood is public open space, much lower than the urban cores average 5% per neighborhood designated open space.</p>

<p>Brentwood is most famous for its native old-fashioned bars and hamburger joints dating back to the 1950's. The infamous "keep Austin Weird" slogan centers on the continuation of homegrown businesses in Austin.</p>

<p>In 2006, the hot topic for zoning was the curtailment of McMansions, and large three-storey duplexes with straight walls jetting 30 feet into the air facing the street. Outcries from area residents primarily in single-family one story homes caused the City to put a moratorium on building, and eventually led to new building restrictions. Duplexes must now only build one structure per lot and must share a common wall, rather than just a carport. Additional size criteria and impervious cover restrictions now in place will help to ensure the area remains populated with single-family residences focusing on livable spaces, rather than the most bang for the buck. The new building restrictions signal the end to buy-outs of homes to manufacture cheap three-storey units looming over adjacent one-storey 1950s homes. The style, feel, design, and aesthetics of this quaint, friendly community have prevailed.</p>
