<p>i would ask that you edit/shorten your additions to the crito page. some of your comments entertain certain interpretations of the text which i feel are wrong (for example, the equating of Socrates and his fictional character "the Laws"). at the very least, i believe you should stick to the basic facts of the text and avoid analysis. thank you.</p>

<p>You seem to be adding a lot of valuable stuff, but for Wikipedia to be truly useful as a reference we need to cite sources. It protects you against accusations of original research as well. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 01:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would echo Nareek's comment that you need to cite sources for your edits. A lot of what you're adding appears to be based on your own reading of the primary sources, which qualifies as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Wikipedia doesn't publish original thought, so everything you add needs to be attributable to published, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brenda, I saw your note on my user talk page. In addition to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (not to mention <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), you might want to take a look at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, which indicates how references should be cited. Basically, we want footnotes or parenthetical citations. Not all articles have inline citations, but the best do--take a look at <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> for a good example. Adding books to the "references" section isn't enough, because that doesn't tell the WP reader where to go to verify particular facts in the article. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 19:26, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are various ways to source WP articles--I'd like to make a pitch for the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; format, which strikes me as being both user friendly and elegant. The way I do it, anyway, is to have the individual footnotes be as brief as possible, with a fuller citation in a list of resources.</p>
<p>It's perfectly understandable that a newcomer would think that sourcing is not an important rule at Wikipedia, since it's neglected in I would say a large majority of articles. But I strongly believe that it's essential for making Wikipedia a useful reference work, because anonymous editors can never be treated as reliable sources on their own. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 20:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>): If you thinks the Greeks would not have understood the concept of child corruption, you must not have had a look at Plato's Phaedrus. Check 241c,d. Socrates himslef recognizes that a bad lover can ruin not just the body of a boy, but his mind and spirit. And what difference do you see in pedo-philia and ped-erasty? They refer to the same business - "love" of boys, making boys into "lovers" respectively. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> 15:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Brenda, the difference between <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">Pederasty in ancient Greece</a> is a matter of social constructs, not etymology. In the modern world, pedophilia is child abuse by definition; on the other hand, the Greeks usually saw pederasty in a positive light. If you write that the subject of the <i>Phaedrus</i> is pedophilia, you're basically saying it's about child abuse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your equation of pedophilia and pederasty seems to indicate that you aren't familiar with the literature on Greek pederasty (good sources are given in the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece_c8cb.html" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece">Pederasty in ancient Greece</a> article). This is exactly the sort of thing that makes other editors suspect you're relying on your personal reading of the dialogues in your edits, which is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>): Mr. Achilles - I am very familiar with the literature, but I confess to spending way more time studying the original material (with some knowledge of Greek) rather than reading the critics. (I have read Dover's book more than once.) I believe etymologies are helpful, actually, especially if you study the original contexts of the words without prejudice. The passage in the Phaedrus to which I directed you is a case in point. Socrates himself admits here ( and elsewhere) that having an old lover is not "necessarily " a blessing for the youngster. Europe fell into a funk for 2,000 years partly on account of the denial of observation of evidence, and worship of authority. I do not seee myself doing what you disparage as "original research" so much as pointing out what is actually IN these texts - so that we can see what is there, and quit finding stuff that is not there. I do think these discussions are useful, by the by. Brenda maverick 16:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mean to be rude, but several of the things you're saying indicate that you are engaging in original research, especially the idea that you're "pointing out what is actually IN these texts - so that we can see what is there, and quit finding stuff that is not there." This apparently means that most scholars are finding things that aren't there? Anyway, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> says that "Any interpretation of primary source material requires a secondary source", so even claims that you think are uncontroversial--like the idea that the <i>Phaedrus</i> is about "child corruption"--need to be based on a secondary source. The point here is that we rely on published, expert opinion, not the interpretations of individual WP editors. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 19:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>): I still do not see how looking at the evidence in the text constitutes "original research". As for this particular point about corruption of the young: in this speech, Socrates goes on and on about the miseries of the boy in the arms of an old ugly drunk, and the grief that comes to him from the old man's faithlessness, irritability, and jealousy. He says the old man has no goodwill towards the boy but is just satisfying his appetites (as the wolf "loves" - "agape" his food). Its after this that Socrates says that a boy in this situation is injured ("blaptw") in property, body and mind. So for you to say that the Greeks "did not/would not have understood the concept of child corruption" cannot possibly be right. Besides this, they were human beings, and very advanced people at that, so it is absurd from that point of view. Clearly, Socrates and his cronies were good with sex with boys, but so are some elements of our own culture - congress and the catholic church for examples. There is no monolith of opinion even today on the matter, and doubtless there was not then, either. So this business about concensus (for which you are praised on this talk page) inevitably misrepresents reality, then and now.</p>

<dd>Brenda, I strongly advise you to read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, because it's one of the basic policies guiding Wikipedia's content. While you may think your interpretation of the <i>Phaedrus</i> is straightforward, what you're saying is at odds with how the work is generally interpreted by experts. Obviously, part of the dialogue concerns the damage a bad lover can do, but this is not the major subject of the dialogue. Whatever your opinion about academic consensus, WP articles are supposed to be based on expert opinion. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 23:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Brenda, here are the sentences I removed from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>: "Two minor dialogues, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmides.html" title="Charmides">Charmides</a> and <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysis.html" title="Lysis">Lysis</a>, are explicitly paedophilic, and are linked to the death of Socrates by the theme of child corruption: Socrates is pictured as befriending children whose guardians are either complicit with or indifferent to the older man's attempts to be convivial with them."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This bit of text is problematic for several reasons--the equation of pederasty with pedophilia, the idea that Socrates' interest in "children" is pedophilic, and the implication that the dialogues show Socrates corrupting "children"--perhaps you don't realize it, but the passage seems to say that Socrates was attempting to sexually abuse his interlocutors. As I've already explained, there's a big difference between pederasty and pedophilia, and the failure to properly distinguish between the two already means most Platonic scholars would find the quoted passage incorrect. Furthermore, the notion that the <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmides.html" title="Charmides">Charmides</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysis.html" title="Lysis">Lysis</a></i> portray "child corruption" appear to be your interpretation of what's going on in those dialogues. That's original research. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 01:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>):Fine to leave it out, but not for the reason you give, that the idea of child sexual abuse (as we term it today) was foreign to the Greeks. Even if you don't think Socrates was guilty of it (and I personally think the historial facts concerning the life of Socrates are not only irrecoverable but also irrelevant to understanding Plato), the important thing is that Socrates himself explicitly discusses the problem. Do you deny even this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the notion of "child sexual abuse" or "child corruption" is at stake in these dialogues. The definition of "child" is vague, but "child sexual abuse" often refers to sexual contact between adults and pre-pubescent boys or girls. On the other hand, in ancient Greek pederasty, the <i>eromenos</i> was a young male between the arrival of puberty and the growth of the full beard. In the ancient world, puberty probably arrived later than in the modern world, because of poorer nutrition. The <i>eromenos</i> could be as young as 14, perhaps, and could be as old as his early 20s. So I don't think that "child sexual abuse" is right here--it implies that Greek pederasty was the same thing as pedophilia, which is inaccurate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, in most of the evidence we have, the ancient Greeks think of pederasty as a good thing. In the <i>Phaedrus</i>, Socrates is saying that a pederastic relationship that is exclusively sexual, with no regard for the intellectual and spiritual development of the beloved, is a bad thing. But he also thinks that a pederastic relationship that focuses on the boy's improvement is a good thing. Saying that Socrates is talking about the "corruption" of the <i>eromenos</i> is at best an incomplete description of the passage. It's entirely possible for us to regard a pederastic relationship as abusive, and the ancient Greeks might have regarded particular relationships as abusive or corrupt, but as an institution, pederasty was seen in a positive light--not abuse at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The notion that the <i>Charmides</i> and the <i>Lysis</i> depict Socrates as preying on young boys, which is what your text implied, is completely wrong. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 17:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>): In the Charmides, Socrates gets excited at the sight of the inwards of a child's cloak and quizzes him about sophrosne (self-control). Charmides is in the company of his "epitrophos" - a surrogate parent, caretaker (we'd say "childsitter")...</p>
<dl>
<dd>A young male remained under his father's control until the age of eighteen, at least, and could have a guardian with him until then (see Skinner, <i>Sexuality in Greek and Roman Culture</i>, p. 13). Of course, in this case, the guardian is Charmides' cousin, Critias--in a culture where your public reputation means everything, it's not surprising that a prominent young man would be under the watch of his relatives at all times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you have any evidence that Charmides is pre-pubescent, other than your own speculation? This, too, appears to be original research; and it's not true to the Greek text, which supplies many indications of Charmides' age. Note the following (155a): "But why not call the young man (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">τὸν νεανίαν</span>) here and show him to me? For surely, even if he were younger still (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">εἰ ἔτι ἐτύγχανε νεώτερος ὤν</span>), there could be no discredit in our having a talk with him before you, who are at once his guardian and his cousin." <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 19:24, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brenda, sorry for the misunderstanding.

I was actually trying to defend you!

<p>(copied from <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">User talk:Akhilleus</a>) How can you say that the Theaetetus is PLATO'S theory of knowledge? Isn't this like saying that Hamlet speaks Shakespeare's "theory" of the uselessness of living? What's the difference? Seems like sloppy thinking to paste the writer and his character together as if there were no difference between them.

<dd>Plato's authorship of this dialogue has never been seriously questioned, and Francis Cornford published a translation under the title of <i>Plato's Theory of Knowledge</i>. Something interesting is happening with Eucleides and the framing of the dialogue, but if the article is going to discuss that, it needs to be based on secondary scholarship, rather than the logical inferences of WP editors. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 17:14, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not doubt for one instant that Plato wrote the dialog. It bears all the marks of his brilliance. All I am saying is that Plato playfully disavows it (he writes here like Soren kierkegaard, under a kind of "pseudonymity"). My only point is that we ignore Plato's details at our peril. Is this OK with you? Brenda maverick 18:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, Brenda, but that didn't appear to be what you were saying.

<dd>Yes, of course; irony and playfulness are prominent features of the dialogues.

<p>Achilles, the article is not good. If you can improve on mine in specific ways, I do not object. But I think even you have to admit that as it stands, it is not particularly interesting or pleasant to read. There are not enough divisions either. I wish to make Plate seem as wonderful in English as he is in Greek, and to attract people to his work, and not turn them away from philosophy. Experts do not come to these pages, it is more newcomers, I imagine, and young people, for whom Plato should be presented in the best possible light.
