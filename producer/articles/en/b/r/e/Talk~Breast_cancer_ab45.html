<p>Does anyone have any idea why this particular cancer is so emphasised in the news?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably because, as well as being a very common cancer, it's a very <i>visible</i> cancer (or at least the surgical treatment - mastectomy - is). 81.156.18.164 23:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sexist comments aside, it's the most common cancer in females. Prostate cancer would also get this much publicity, if men were more comfortable talking about it. Unlike other diseases such as lung cancer etc, breast cancer occurs in anybody (well, almost any female) so there is no one to 'blame' and people see it as 'unfair'. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerrin_17ac.html" title="User:Serrin">Serrin</a> 00:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article badly needs a rewrite, and some of these "risk factors" seem really dodgy, at least the way they're explained.</p>
<dl>
<dd>They may sound dodgy, but those (early menarche, late menopause, late childbirth, late first child, hormone replacement) are well established factors that increase risk of developing breast cancer. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 07:21, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are just risk factors, they are associated, and they are not necessarily causally associated. They are dodgy if you think of causality in a risk factor, rather than a chain of causation and association. What country you live in, how many 1st degree relatives with breast cancer are strong risk factors, but are likely confounders (themselves associated) witht the unknown, underlying cause.

<p><i>"Overall, it has been estimated that women have about a 1 in 10 lifetime risk of developing breast cancer."</i></p>
<p>I do not understand this 1 in 10 lifetime risk. Does it not contradict these stats from http://www.breastcancer.org/cmn_who_indrisk.html</p>
<ul>
<li>From birth to age 39, 1 woman in 231 will get breast cancer (&lt;0.5% risk).</li>
<li>From ages 40?59, the chance is 1 in 25 (4% risk).</li>
<li>From ages 60?79, the chance is 1 in 15 (nearly 7%).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not very good with stats so I won't dare edit.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if you sum up those odds, you get a total of a bit more than 10% for the lifetime risk for a woman aged 79. That isn't too far from 10% given that not all women live to that age. Therefore, there is no contradiction. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 17:26, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope, I am sorry but you can not add percentages up. In fact you can intuitively see that the odds will never go above 7% on an average. The odds for someone 79 years old are already given: <b>7%</b>, they won't be more then that. In fact these stats make more sense with risk against age - Hence I EDIT. I add I am not good with stats but the change is more clarifying. <a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkur_0fc1.html" title="User:Ankur">ank</a> 06:12, 26 Jan 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you should go read up your mathematics book again. The same article you quote says - "<i>The chance of getting breast cancer over the course of an entire lifetime, assuming you live to age 90, is one in 8, with an overall lifetime risk of 12.5%.</i>" - which means, obviously, that the overall lifetime risk is 12.5%. How much more intuitive can you get than that? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 06:54, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also was surprised by the figure. What Alex.tan is saying is that the conditional probability of having had breast cancer, given a person lives to age 90, is 12.5%. Ankur's data would imply that the conditional probability of getting breast cancer if you live to 79 is a bit over 7% (7%+a little bit extra for the previous categories) and lower if you live to a lower age. Since I think average life expectancy is in the 70s this is consistent with an overall lifetime risk of some 6-8%, roughly. I poked a bit on the web and found a figure of 8% at <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/990101ap/99.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aafp.org/afp/990101ap/99.html" rel="nofollow">AAFP</a>. They also say the chance of dying of breast cancer is 3.6%.</p>
<p>I think this means the 1 in 10 figure currently in this article is perhaps a bit high, but not too much. I'll leave any other hunting of data and/or editing to regular contributors to this article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 20:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>- "More than 99% of cases occur in women, but men can also develop breast cancer (the relative risk of developing breast cancer in a female versus a male is more than 100" - isn't this just saying the same thing twice?</p>

<dl>
<dd>No, not exactly. It would be saying the same thing twice given the assumption that there are exactly equal numbers of males and females and that they both have the same life expectancies.

<p>The clinical TNM staging system is listed here. But operative treatment, adjuvant therapy and prognosis depend on the pathological tumor staging (pTNM). This differs from the clinical TNM system in the N (node) category.

<p>InvictaHOG has repeatedly removed an external link, and I have repeatedly added it back, to <a href="http://www.jbryant.org/bc/blog_bcnews/" class="external text" title="http://www.jbryant.org/bc/blog_bcnews/" rel="nofollow">Keeping Abreast: Dedicated to providing only the most interesting Breast Cancer News links and sumaries</a>. There is no good reason for removing it. This is a legitimate news blog and is quite helpful. It was very helpful to my wife, and many of the breast cancer patients and survivors she interacts with on her BC forums have commented on its quality and relevance.</p>
<p>InvictaHOG initially removed the link with the comment "First page of blog link has article about the mistletoe cure. I'd rather not have this here." That is not only terribly biased, it is reactionary. Yes, that article appeared as the most current post (top of the page) -- on Christmas Day, which added somewhat of a "cute" flavor to it -- but it linked to a legitimate news story, not to some website that offered weird alternative cures or something. Had InvictaHOG read the article, s/he would have seen that. And had InvictaHOG actually looked through a fair sampling of the other news items on the front page and in the archives, s/he would have seen that that article was not in any way common for this blog.</p>
<p>I am adding the link back now, and InvictaHOG will need to provide a reasoned explanation here to convince me not to do so again.</p>
<p>InvictaHOG, I do appreciate your vast contributions to Wikipedia. That is not somehing I can claim for myself.

<dd>I'm not doing this to be spiteful or mean. There are literally hundreds of breast cancer websites out there that people find helpful or interesting. Keeping Abreast is not particularly well-done or insightful. Yes, I did read through the article and I have seen many other popular press articles this holiday season touting mistletoe cures for many other diseases, none with evidence. I read other, better articles on the site but feel that as a whole it was not compelling. I am a relative inclusionist, but it not reactionary to see that not every blog or website needs or deserves to be linked here. This article would benefit from more attention, but not more links. A hundred more well-intentioned links (I know that your goal is to make the article better!) will not make this article more encyclopedic. I hope that you see my side of this! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 23:56, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I understand your concerns, InvictaHOG, and I understand the concerns about blogs in the discussion Andre73 pointed to. There certainly are hundreds of sites about Breast Cancer out there, and the article wouldn't benefit from links to all of them. To be honest, I'm waffling on this after reading both of your comments, but I still am leaning toward this blog's inclusion, and here is why:</p>
<p>Breast Cancer patients will turn to Wikipedia for information about Breast Cancer. The article itself is very useful and very well written as a beginning educational resource. However, there are a couple of other types of resources breast cancer patients look for, and they do not know where to find them, or even to look for them. For instance, many breast cancer patients would love to find local support groups where they can get together with other patients and survivors. To my knowledge, there is no online resource that attempts to pull info on such local support groups together. However, patients and survivors also benefit from active online forums -- my wife has benefited beyond description from interacting with her "breast friends" at <a href="http://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=14" class="external text" title="http://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=14" rel="nofollow"><i>Healing Well's</i> Breast Cancer forum</a>, for example.</p>
<p>And another type of resource sought after by both patients and survivors alike is news related to the disease. "News," of course, can mean a whole lot of things. Most of the sites that pull together breast cancer "news" articles are either very popular-level (with the effect that they can mislead a seeker), are extremely biased in what they report (with the effect that they exclude some important or relevant information because it doesn't promote their agenda), or overly scholarly (with the effect that they are too difficult or inaccessible to the average patient). Yet someone who is dealing with cancer will want to be able to keep up with the goings on in breast cancer oncology. They'll want to know about research that is being conducted, clinical trials that are available, new medicines and procedures that are or may soon be available, old methods that are being supplanted by new ones, and a broad range of other "news" items. The <a href="http://www.jbryant.org/bc/blog_bcnews" class="external text" title="http://www.jbryant.org/bc/blog_bcnews" rel="nofollow">Keeping Abreast</a> news blog seems to do just that. Better than any I've yet found, it links to articles that touch the typical patient where s/he is. It claims to link to the "most interesting" news items, which appears to mean most interesting to the patient. Not all of the links are medical in nature -- it occasionally reports on "social" issues such as the controversy over whether European governments would provide Herceptin to survivors. The blog does not attempt to report news, just alert those interested to new items available elsewhere in a timely fashion. Nor does the blog appear to link to commercial interests. Basically, I'm saying what I already said -- it seems to meet typical breast cancer <i><b>patients</b></i> at the right level and with the right topics. It certainly does not attempt to provide much useful to the clinician or scientist in the field.</p>
<p>Does this sort of think belong in Wikipedia? I believe so. The encyclopedia article portion is not the place to include cutting edge or controversial or societal or "news" issues. Rather, it is a place to provide long-established knowledge about Breast Cancer. But in my mind, Wikipedia as a resource benefits greatly from also providing carefully selected external links to other types or resources (such as news) that are tangential to its purpose. -- TaintedAzure</p>
<dl>
<dd>How about linking to a link directory like <a href="http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Breast/" class="external free" title="http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Breast/" rel="nofollow">http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Breast/</a> instead? It has lots of links to good websites, support organisations and also personal blogs. --<a href="../../../w/o/u/User%7EWouterstomp_b006.html" title="User:Wouterstomp">WS</a> 15:22, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current section for Adjuvant treatment seems to be a bit dificult to follow. The section almost reads as if some of the treatments (chemo and hormonal) are mutually exclusive. The second statement almost seems to imply that chemo isn't waranted in cases where lymph nodes weren't positive, however my understanding is that chemo depends on the size of the tumor as well as lymph node status. As I am not a doctor I'd like some input before editing this section. A possible rearrangement might include the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the section from Adjuvant treatment to Systemic treatments. Reason: Chemotherapy can be given as both neo-adjuvant to shrink a tumor and adjuvant to lower the risk of recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add 3 subsections for Hormonal (to discuss tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors), immune system treatments (Herceptin), and Chemotherapy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Put a statement at the top of the reorganized section stating that any combination of these can be used in treating breast cancer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Move the first paragraph "At present, the treatment recommendations after surgery (adjuvant therapy) follow a pattern. This pattern may be adapted as every two years a worldwide conference takes place in St. Gallen, Switzerland to discuss the actual results of worldwide multi-center studies. Depending on clinical criteria (age, type of cancer, size, metastasis) patients are roughly divided to high risk and low risk cases which follow different rules for therapy." to the start of the treatment section since it appears to refer to all types of treatment.</li>

<dd>That is a entirely insufficient mention of the issue; and just so you know I've personally sent e-mails to organizations on the matter of their webpages being out of date and/or mischaracterizing the ABC issue. At least one I know of updated their page eventually (removing mention of Daling, as I mentioned her section was out of date) <a href="http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/abcancer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/abcancer.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/abcancer.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/abcancer.htm" rel="nofollow">history</a>; poorly I might add as the "Sedish" was put in; but that cohort study only contains 65 breast cancer cases... but hey 49,000 sounds way more impressive doesn't it?</dd>
<dd>What I am getting at here is those webpages and sometimes associations have <b>no</b> transparency (the NCI workshop did not release the data/studies/and discussion of their workshop); can be partisan and only a handful of people have editorial control over those pages. They are often out of date and inaccurate; I and Wikipedia aspire for a higher standard. Don't get me wrong, your ACS link is good (that's why they are in External links in ABC article); but a "false alarm" is not mutually exclusive to there being an Abortion correlation. Meaning while it could be maintained anti-abortionist are raising a "false alarm" regarding the ABC issue and risks for the vast majority of women that have normal abortions (prior to 12 weeks); at the same time there could still be a minor link between abortion and breast cancer for a minority of women. Science but especially epidemiology and biology is not an all or nothing proposition. And although orginizations have to take firm stands on issues for <b>political</b> purposes and perceived (and real) threats; the science is not so firm and straight forward. It is that scientific ambiguity that is important for Wikipedia to cover.</dd>
<dd>I spent weeks looking over the <b>primary research</b>; I became uninterested in hearing what organizations opinions on the matter were. I found time and again research that was being ignored by the media (positive results); had very vague and unsubstantiated objections levelled against them by scientists... whereas studies that showed no link or attempted to validate those objections (eg. response bias) were touted by the media and had few objections raised. Despite some of them having <b>serious flaws</b> in their analysis and conclusions. This subject of course is frought with political interferance; but when you dig deep enough you are forced to realize that cuts <b>both ways</b>. Now you want to come along after doing a few Google searches with websites that essentially regurgitate unsubstantiated memes on the issue. Perhaps you can understand how I may not take kindly to that; and at some point you may have to acknowledge I actually know quite a bit about the ABC issue. I could teach you about it, but most of it is already in the ABC article if you read it carefully; and frankly I'm a firm believer in independant learning... so long as the person actually wants to learn about a subject; rather than reinforce their original position.</dd>
<dd>I would also like to say I <b>really appreciate</b> you ignored my barb; and took the high ground and argued for your case. And when you did bring up policy; you specified it "seems consistent"; a softened position that did not go unnoticed by me. I am happy you seem to appreciate policy isn't always exactly applicable as you see it. In this instance; despite the latest link(s) you've found; it does not change the reality abortion is an alleged factor with a significant amount of conflicting epidemiological research examining the issue. That simply cannot be ignored or thought "irrelevant" because a partisan website did poor job of researching the issue and/or updating their website. I am very confident a one sentence mention of the ABC issue is not "undue weight". Writing an entire paragraph or section would be, but mentioning the issue is actually required make the article more comprehensive and neutral (since not mentioning it implies "Wikipedia" considers there to be no ABC issue whatsoever... almost like it doesn't exist; but of course it does); being comprehensive and up-to-date is something we always strive for at Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:37, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hiya Andrew73. Thanks for your edits there, but I don't agree with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, to promote one source as <b>robust</b> is a little POV. I understand it has been present as such by some organizations; but to examine its robustness is an issue that should be handled in the ABC article rather than a one sided mention here. Moreover what you unintentionally did was promote a study over others. Unless it is the most important and highly regarded study (that would be the Melbye (Denmark) study in 1997) we shouldn't be referring to it outside the ABC article. But even then that would require a back and forth analysis that would bloat the ABC mention; and repeat material already in the ABC article.</li>
<li>As to "medical community in general feels abortion link not robust"; I entirely agree... but that is why I described it as "unestablished and controversial" and we could go a step further and expand the name of the article. (that way "hypothesis" would be seen right away by the reader, I see you put hypothesized in the article, that's good too)</li>
<li>"Based on the observation that early full-term pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer"... that implies the ABC hypothesis is an increased risk in relation to having children. The increased risk in scientific studies is almost always relative to women of same parity (child bearing). So that is misleading and likely factually incorrect on how the ABC issue was first hypothesized; and it is certainly incorrect on how it is currently presented.</li>
<li>"subsequently"... subsequently to what? That is confusing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also expanding the ABC mention itself in this article; makes it seem more important than it currently is. If we go back to my version, it is a minor side note. Maybe changing unestablished to hypothesized would be best. Is that alright with you? - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 03:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reference provided in support of the claim that recent large studies support an association between breast cancer and abortion says exactly the opposite: "Several studies have provided very strong data that induced abortions have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. Also, there is no evidence of a direct relationship between breast cancer and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in most of the studies that have been published. Scientists invited to participate in a conference on abortion and breast cancer by the National Cancer Institute (February 2003) concluded that there was <b>no relationship</b>. A recent report of 83,000 women with breast cancer found no link to a previous abortion, either spontaneous (stillbirth) or induced." Perhaps the original text was a typo - I've amended it.

<dd>It is a speculative theory, the proposed mechanism is that artificial lights confuse the body clock and alter the hormonal balance. Increased artificial light might also be correlated with other behaviors, such as LESS exposure to sunlight. There is also a theory that the potent vitamin D from sunlight is particularly good a preventing cancer. The proponents of this theory argue that while sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer, that increase is far outweighed by all the other cancer mortality it prevents.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnicaltechy_56e1.html" title="User:Technicaltechy">Technicaltechy</a> 17:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everything in Wikipedia is "regurgitated from other, more professional resources anyway and hence secondary." No one is posting original research on Wikipedia. Respectable, responsible blogs and other websites can pull together disparate resources (such as news) in a single location. I believe the usefulness of the article decreases if such resources aren't included as an appendix. -- TaintedAzure</dd>

Yesterday I putted a "unreferenced" tag which was immediately deleted. So, this is supposed to be a scientific article addressing a wide audience. We certainly need references for <b>statistics</b> and for almost everything. Since I'm sure pretty much of the editors here have a scientific background, this shouldn't be too difficult to provide. And it would make the article something on which we could rely on. If references are not introduced, than just any crack-head can put whatever he want, and we will just have to trust other editors struggles against silly or outlandish claims. I don't trust Wikipedia on sight, so I do think this article is totally unreferenced. Furthermore, without moving the passage here, I find this quite strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a> have a higher risk of developing breast cancer - notably, women of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">African</a> descent have been noted to have a higher rate of breast cancer than women of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asian</a> origin <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. However, these apparent <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">racial</a> differences diminish when geography is altered, as Asian women migrating to the western world, gradually acquire risk approaching that of western women."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that this means that it is wrong than Asian ethnic groups have a higher risk of cancer! So why put it in the first place? Isn't it rather about food diet and such different mores, that are lost when they live in an Western environment? Then we could write this. Sorry for asking for sources, but if you look at political articles or even things like the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl_disaster.html" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, you will see how sources are provided. I remind you that if no sources is provided, any editor, including me, has the right under Wikipedia policy to delete it on sight. Why should I believe things on race, alcohol, or percentages that come out of thin air? Unreferenced statistics is just... too much! <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 17:39, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lapaz, if you look at {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, it is quite clear this template should be either at the bottom of the article or on the talkpage (<i>There is currently no consensus about where to place this template; most suggest either the bottom of the article page (in an empty 'References' section), or on the article's talk page</i>). This is why I removed it.</p>
<p>I totally agree that this article needs sources. Google is your friend. Unreferenced statistics are indeed absolute evil&amp;tm;. I would not disagree with their targeted removal. Alternatively, you can put {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} behind the more outrageous claims, so readers will understand that no source has yet been made available for them. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 23:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the citation tag to the fact that it was backing up, and therefore put this strange and contradictory passage here, till source provide back-up and explanation (see also comments on section immediately above):</p>

<p>This means that it is wrong than Asian ethnic groups have a higher risk of cancer! isn't it rather about food diet and such different mores, that are lost when they live in an Western environment?

<p>I was looking for some history remarks on the diagnosis, treatment, and discoveries for breast cancer. For example, the earliest known cases of breast cancer I know of is from the Etruscans who used votives to ask the gods for mercy on health issues. They formed body parts from terracotta illustrating the health problem, and many breasts, complete with visible tumors, were found in votive pits (I saw these at the Allard Pearson Museum in Amsterdam) <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJane023_325d.html" title="User:Jane023">Jane</a> 20:22, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This statistic seems like one make to try to confuse and distort the truth.

<p>Under 'Screening' I read (emph. mine):</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to detect cancers that are not visible on mammograms, but it has several disadvantages.

<p>I'm pretty sure that's Vandalism! I've been thinking about what the original text was but I was actually coming to this page to look for info, so I have no idea! Anybody know? Also, who put that in there - Wikibot hasn't spot it?</p>
