<p><b>Brett Bodine Racing</b> was a <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_bd9d.html" title="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> racing team from 1996 until 2003. It was owned by former Nascar driver <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Bodine_cf72.html" title="Brett Bodine">Brett Bodine</a> and his wife of 23 years Diane Bodine (they divorced in 2003). The Bodine's purchased the team Brett had driven for in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_NASCAR_0298.html" title="1995 in NASCAR">1995</a> following that season from <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Johnson_b734.html" title="Junior Johnson">Junior Johnson</a>. The team always struggled with the on-going battle to secure consistent sponsorship until 2003 until a lack of funding forced the team to close following the season.</p>

<p>Brett Bodine drove the 11 car for Junior Johnson in 1995 with <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowe%27s.html" title="Lowe's">Lowe's</a> sponsorship and drove the car again with Lowes sponsorship in 1996 as an owner/driver. Brett's team struggled with consistency that season but they did manage to finish 24th in the points standings, with one top ten. However, at the conclusion of the season Lowe's chose not to return and instead moved to sponsor the new #31 car at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Childress_Racing_54fa.html" title="Richard Childress Racing">Richard Childress Racing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_NASCAR_83c1.html" title="1997 in NASCAR">1997</a> saw Brett sign a long term sponsorship deal that would put Close Call Phone Cards on the car. The season started off well with Bodine consistently running competitively, including two top ten finishes in the first 9 races. However, just half-way into the season Close-Call stopped paying its sponsorship bills and Brett was forced to strip the decals off of his car. The car ran unsponsored for the remainder of the season and the sudden financial crunch was easily visible in the car's performance, and Bodine was forced to sell part of the team to Andy Evans, although he later re-acquired full interest. Bodine later accused Evans of trying to steal his team.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_NASCAR_12ae.html" title="1998 in NASCAR">1998</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_NASCAR_5d8b.html" title="1999 in NASCAR">1999</a> found Bodine with reliable sponsorship from <a href="../../../p/a/y/Paychex.html" title="Paychex">Paychex</a> on his new <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Taurus_17f2.html" title="Ford Taurus">Ford Taurus</a>. He found modest success in 1998 finishing 25th overall in points, despite failing to finish in the top ten all season. He did, however, manage to finish in the top 20 on eleven occasions.</p>
<p>After 1998, Bodine struggled in 1999. He was only able to muster a 35th place effort in the final standing again with no top tens, but this time, only four top 20s. The #11 team also failed to qualify for 2 events and Paychex chose not to return at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Without a sponsor having been found Brett sold half-interest in his team once again, this time to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hilton_63c2.html" title="Richard Hilton">Richard Hilton</a>. As part of the deal <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralphs.html" title="Ralphs">Ralphs</a> would come on as the primary sponsor. Although the sale of the team fell through Brett was able to retain the Ralphs sponsorship. However, all of the late deal making left Brett Bodine racing behind. This showed of they again struggled to 35th place in the final points standings with no top tens and just 5 top twenties while failing to qualify for five races.</p>
<p>Even with their struggles Ralphs came back to the team in 2001 as the primary sponsor and Brett signed RedCell Batteries as an associate, and the team received engines from <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Yates_Racing_4f28.html" title="Robert Yates Racing">Robert Yates Racing</a>. But another blow to the organization RedCell stopped paying its dues midseason, and the team once again was forced to go without strong backing. They were able to work through these troubles and had a very successful season that looked to move them in a very positive direction. They made every race, finished in the top ten twice, the top twenty nine times, and moved up five spots to 30th in the owner's standings.</p>
<p>Despite the team's success in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_NASCAR_cf40.html" title="2001 in NASCAR">2001</a> a primary sponsor was not forthcomming for 2002. Brett entered the season with just the associates Timberland Pro and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wells_Fargo_b288.html" title="Wells Fargo">Wells Fargo Financial</a>. Dura Lube came on to help out early in the season until Brett picked up <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooters.html" title="Hooters">Hooters</a> sponsorship for the 4th race of the season. Still, the team was in an all too familiar situation at the start of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_NASCAR_0f76.html" title="2002 in NASCAR">2002</a> season; they were way behind in all aspects due to securing sponsorship so late in the season. Brett mandged no top tens, only 4 top 20s, and 36th in the final standings while missing four races.</p>
<p>Hooters came back in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_NASCAR_708f.html" title="2003 in NASCAR">2003</a>, but with far less money. The team scaled back to only a limited schedule. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Bodine_8765.html" title="Geoffrey Bodine">Geoffrey Bodine</a> drove the car in the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Shootout_ce66.html" title="Bud Shootout">Bud Shootout</a> at Daytona and Brett ran 5 early season races before Hooters pulled the plug, leaving the team with no sponsor. To compound problems, that same weekend in practice Brett was involved in a horrifying crash that sidelined him for several weeks. His brother Geoffery drove the #11 Brett Bodine Racing Ford, for his injured brother, in its final race finishing 39th. With no major sponsorship for his team and most of his employees laid off, Brett attempted to run at Indy in a fan sponsored "Brick Car" where, for $500, fans would get their name on the car. The program was a success, but Brett failed to qualify for the race by .001 seconds. Rumors of a sponsor for 2004 and beyond surfaced, but nothing panned out and the team was sold.</p>

<p>2001 saw Brett Bodine Racing expand to a two car team for two races. Driven by the #11s car success Brett was able to field a second car, driven by brother Geoffrey, at both <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Motor_Speedway_a3e4.html" title="Bristol Motor Speedway">Bristol</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead-Miami_Speedway_023d.html" title="Homestead-Miami Speedway">Homestead</a> with sponsorship from <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smirnoff_Ice_f6d2.html" title="Smirnoff Ice">Smirnoff Ice</a> and Miccosukee Casino, respectively. Bodine finished 27th at Bristol and 37th at Homestead. The team was to continue to run a limited schedule in 2002 but was never able to find a primary sponsor. The #09 Brett Bodine Racing Fords never returned to the track.</p>

<p>In 2002 <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooters.html" title="Hooters">Hooters</a> had a small sponsorship deal with independent driver <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Shelmerdine_0df3.html" title="Kirk Shelmerdine">Kirk Shelmerdine</a>. When Hooters signed on to sponsor the Brett Bodine Racing team, part of the deal involved Brett was to run Kirk in a couple of races in the #27 sponsored by Naturally Fresh Foods. However, this quickly came to end when Kirk was unable to make a race, and the drivers went their own ways.</p>

<p>This car made its debut at Richmond in 2001 with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Richeson_99ee.html" title="Josh Richeson">Josh Richeson</a>, a relative of Brett's, behind the wheel. The cars number was 06. In 2002 the cars number was changed to 11 and Brett was able to field Josh in seven races. The car was unsponsored in two events, sponsored by <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuckers.html" title="Smuckers">Smuckers</a> in one event and by one of Brett's cup sponsors, Timberland Pro, in the other 4 events. 28th was the best ever finish by this car, achieved in its final start at Richmond in 2002. The team did not have the financial means to run a Busch Series operation in 2003.</p>
