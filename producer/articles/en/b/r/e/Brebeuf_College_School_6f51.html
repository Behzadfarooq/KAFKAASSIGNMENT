<p><b>Brebeuf College School</b> is a Catholic boys' school founded by the Jesuits (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>) in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> and located in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto%2C_Ontario%2C_Canada_2b17.html" title="Toronto, Ontario, Canada">Toronto, Ontario, Canada</a>. Brebeuf College has a tradition of devotion to Christian values and academic excellence, which prepare students for university and to be "men for others".</p>
<p>Students participate in a wide spectrum of activities, including music, and drama productions, as well as a variety of athletic programs at both the intramural and extramural levels. Extended French, Gifted, ESL, and Co-operative Education programs are available for students with appropriate qualifications. As well, Brebeuf offers an Advanced Placement program that allows students to study enriched materials and to develop university level skills. In many cases they may also earn advanced placement (credit) for university, while still in high school. Students in this 4 year program will study an enriched curriculum in areas such as English, Mathematics, Science and History.</p>
<p>The school uniform is a distinctive black blazer, black fleece polo top, crested black v-neck sweater, or black vest, and grey pants. Black or white golf shirts may also be worn in the appropriate seasons. The school tie is red with black and white stripes, and is replaced with the black grad tie when students are in their final year. The school crest, in the school colours of red and white, bears the motto, “Studio Gradum Faciant.” The school operates on the semester system and has an enrolment of approximately 900 students.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brebeuf_College_School_6f51.html" title="Edit section: St. Jean de Brébeuf">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St. Jean de Brébeuf</span></h3>
<p>The name Brebeuf was chosen for the new Toronto Catholic high school that opened its doors to the first students in 1963 for three reasons. One of Ontario's most illustrious and heroic pioneers was <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Jean_de_Br%C3%A9beuf_7ff1.html" title="St. Jean de Brébeuf">St. Jean de Brébeuf</a> who first came to Canada in 1625, only 17 years after the founding of this country by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_de_Champlain_cdf9.html" title="Samuel de Champlain">Champlain</a>'s French colonists in 1608. Brebeuf journeyed to the area around the present-day <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland%2C_Ontario_7709.html" title="Midland, Ontario">Midland, Ontario</a> and introduced Christian values to the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Huron.html" title="Huron">Huron</a> Indians of that area.</p>
<p>A second reason for selecting the name Brebeuf was that Jean de Brebeuf was a French Jesuit priest and the priests who founded Brebeuf College School in 1963 were the Jesuits of the Upper Canada Province. Brebeuf High School's first principal was Father Robert Meagher, S.J., a native of Montreal and a follower of the Loyola tradition in that city. Brebeuf's first staff consisted of 8 Jesuit priests, 1 Jesuit brother and 6 laymen.</p>
<p>The third reason the name Brebeuf was chosen for this high school was to provide each student and staff member with a person to emulate in his daily life. As is well known, Jean de Brebeuf was a giant among men, not only physically with his six-foot plus posture, but also academically with his exceptional linguistic skills, and more so spiritually with his dedication, zeal and courage. In 1649 Brebeuf was martyred after serving for 16 years among the Hurons.</p>
<p>Jean de Brebeuf died at the age of 56 years for the faith he hoped to implant in the hearts, minds, and the souls of his Huron brothers. In 1956 his grave was discovered by Father Denis Hegarty, S.J. at the present site of Ste.-Marie-among the Hurons, near Midland, and a simple, hand-etched lead plaque told the story of this heroic life:</p>

<p>This school named after the Jesuit missionary, Jean de Brebeuf, opened with one hundred Grades 9 &amp; 10 students in September, 1963. Their Excellencies, Bishops Philip F. Pocock and Francis A. Marrocco presided at the official opening and solemn blessings on January 5, 1964. Brebeuf's first graduation class in 1966 consisted of 30 students, among them Mr. Michael Daoust presently the head of mathematics at Brebeuf. The 1967 year had 74 graduates, one of whom was Mr. Robert Lato formerly the head of guidance at Brebeuf.</p>
<p>Father Jean de Brebeuf who spent three periods of his life in Huronia in the 17th century (1626-29, 1634-42, and 1644-49), less than 150 miles from the present site of Brebeuf College School, is now honoured permanently as patron of Brebeuf College School.</p>
<p>In May, 1983, Father William Ryan, the Provincial of the Jesuits, announced that the Jesuits were going to give up responsibilities for the operation of Brebeuf College School by June, 1984. This decision was made necessary by the steady decline of available manpower. Immediately, Cardinal Gerald Emmett Carter and the staff of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Toronto_fac0.html" title="Archdiocese of Toronto">Archdiocese of Toronto</a> began to explore the possibilities to ensure the continuing operation of Brebeuf. In February, 1984, Cardinal Carter's office announced that the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presentation_Brothers_0c88.html" title="Presentation Brothers">Presentation Brothers</a> were willing to assume responsibility for Brebeuf College, and would officially take over on July 31, 1984. Brother Lawrence Maher FPM was the new Principal. Thus the school is now operated by the Presentation Brothers.</p>

<p>The Presentation Brothers of Mary is a religious congregation founded with a single intention -- to work for the Christian education and the formation of youth. The Order was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1802.html" title="1802">1802</a> in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> by Blessed <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Ignatius_Rice_e150.html" title="Edmund Ignatius Rice">Edmund Ignatius Rice</a>, a wealthy and well-educated businessman in the city of <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford.html" title="Waterford">Waterford</a>. By the age of forty, Edmund Rice was noted as a generous alyman, particularly concerned with the plight of the poor. After entering a monastery in Europe, he realized that his real vocation lay with the uneducated and poverty-stricken youth of Waterford.</p>
<p>It was in 1802 that Edmund Rice gave up his personal wealth and by 1822 he had become the founder of the Presentation Brothers and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers_037b.html" title="Congregation of Christian Brothers">Congregation of Christian Brothers</a>. Brother Edmund Rice died in 1844 but the work he began continued throughout the world.</p>
<p>Today the Presentation Brothers operate elementary and secondary schools in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Catholic_District_School_Board_26be.html" title="Toronto Catholic District School Board">Toronto Catholic District School Board</a> announced funding for a new building to replace Brebeuf's outdated facilities. Under Principal Michael Pautler '76, the Brebeuf community was temporarily housed in the former Bathurst Heights Collegiate while the new building was being constructed. On January 5, 2004, exactly 40 years after Bishop Pocock presided over Brebeuf College School's Solemn Blessing, staff and students began classes in the new state-of-the-art facility at the old campus.</p>

<p>The Brebeuf Crest was designed by Father Robert Meagher S.J., Brebeuf's founding Principal. It symbolizes the rich heritage and history of Brebeuf.</p>
<p>The black bull is taken from the family coat-of-arms of St. Jean de Brebeuf.</p>
<p>The cross of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_84d1.html" title="St. George">St. George</a> and maple leaves are taken from the arms of the Province of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>.</p>
<p>The blazing sun forms the arms of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> who founded the school, and of which Brebeuf was a member. The flames on the circle symbolize the infinite love of Christ, and the little cross, the pinnacle of that love. The Greek letters "iota", "eta," and "sigma" are the first three letters of Jesus' name.</p>
<p>The angel's wings behind the large cross are those of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Michael_2d56.html" title="St. Michael">St. Michael</a>, the patron saint of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Toronto_fac0.html" title="Archdiocese of Toronto">Archdiocese of Toronto</a>.
