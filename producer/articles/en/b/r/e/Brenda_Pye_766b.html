<p>She was born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">29 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, and died in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> at the age of 97 on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">26 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>She was the youngest child of a barrister called Walter Capron who was himself the youngest son of a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landed_gentry.html" title="Landed gentry">landed gentry</a> family seated at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwick.html" title="Southwick">Southwick</a> Hall in Northamptonshire. Her motherâ€™s maiden name was Whistler, and through her she was a distant cousin of the English artist <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Whistler_e723.html" title="Rex Whistler">Rex Whistler</a> and his brother the glass engraver Sir <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Whistler_4dcf.html" title="Laurence Whistler">Laurence Whistler</a>; she was also more distantly related to the Anglo-American artist <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_McNeill_Whistler_7f3d.html" title="James McNeill Whistler">James McNeill Whistler</a>.</p>
<p>Her earliest years were spent at her birthplace: Shortwood House, Litton, in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, to which her father had retired from his London practice. A three-quarter length portrait of her in the gardens of Shortwood House in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, was painted by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Strachey_%28artist%29_84ea.html" title="Henry Strachey (artist)">Henry Strachey</a>, at that time the art critic of the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectator.html" title="Spectator">Spectator</a>, who lived nearby.

<p>She was educated privately and at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastbourne.html" title="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> Ladies College, Sussex, before taking up a scholarship to study at Eastbourne College of Art. At Eastbourne College of Art she was gold medallist. This entitled her to a further scholarship at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_School_of_Art_e102.html" title="Chelsea School of Art">Chelsea School of Art</a> in London where she continued her studies as a pupil of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Sutherland_4f88.html" title="Graham Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Ravilious_100c.html" title="Eric Ravilious">Eric Ravilious</a>.

<p>Her paintings at this time were mainly figure paintings in oil on canvas, but she also excelled in pencil portraits and studies, and a pencil nude was her first major exhibited work, at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academy_summer_exhibition_469b.html" title="Royal Academy summer exhibition">Royal Academy summer exhibition</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, when she was 24. She had by then married her first husband, E A R Landon, and is therefore listed in the published volumes of <i>Royal Academy Exhibitors 1905-1970</i> (1973-82), and in <i>The Dictionary of British Artists</i> 1880-1940 (1976)), under her married then name of Brenda Landon. The marriage ended in divorce during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. As a wartime resident of <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewes.html" title="Lewes">Lewes</a>, she helped Mrs Byng-Stamper in the well-known art gallery she and her sister set up during the War in the stables of their house at Millers, in Lewes, and through her came across <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_Grant_c707.html" title="Duncan Grant">Duncan Grant</a>, and sat for his life class as a model.</p>
<p>After the war, she was art mistress at Fairdene School for Girls, where she set up a pottery. Later, she established and ran the pottery at <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glynde.html" title="Glynde">Glynde</a> Place (near <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glyndebourne.html" title="Glyndebourne">Glyndebourne</a>). Most of her pottery is from this period.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, she married again. Her second husband, with whom she was to live for the next 33 years, until he died in 1994, was Cecil Pye, the step father of the playwright Sir <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Ayckbourn_0492.html" title="Alan Ayckbourn">Alan Ayckbourn</a> and nephew of the founder of the <a href="../../../p/y/e/Pye.html" title="Pye">Pye</a> radio and television manufacturing business. He had a studio built for her in the grounds of his Jacobean farmhouse in <a href="../../../b/u/x/Buxted.html" title="Buxted">Buxted</a>, Sussex, and Brenda Pye (as she now was), entered her most prolific period as an artist.</p>
<p>She was commissioned to paint many portraits, including the journalist and broadcaster Fyfe Robertson and the Headmaster of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Oratory_School_3193.html" title="London Oratory School">London Oratory School</a> John McIntosh OBE. Her portraits were exhibited in London at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_of_Portrait_Painters_4a8e.html" title="Royal Society of Portrait Painters">Royal Society of Portrait Painters</a> and in Paris at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Salon_0fc3.html" title="Paris Salon">Paris Salon</a>.</p>
<p>However, most of her work was now landscape painting in oil on canvas (sometimes, however, with palette knife or on wood), and she particularly loved <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashdown_Forest_a12a.html" title="Ashdown Forest">Ashdown Forest</a>, which painted over and over again. She also painted during travels with her husband in Scotland and France, and to a lesser extent in Wales, Portugal, Italy and South Africa.</p>
<p>Her style became softer and more impressionistic than her work during and before the war, but it was only occasionally purely abstract. Her favoured medium was always oil on canvas, but she also painted on board or wood (mainly flowers), and (especially in the later <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>) in watercolour. After her second marriage, she favoured brighter colours and a softer, less precise draughtsmanship than before the War and she was a very rapid worker, whether painting portraits or landscape. She always painted directly from life: never from photographs and usually without preparatory drawings.</p>
<p>Her landscapes and flower paintings were exhibited at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Salon_0fc3.html" title="Paris Salon">Paris Salon</a>, and in London by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_of_British_Artists_d009.html" title="Royal Society of British Artists">Royal Society of British Artists</a> and the Association of Women Artists. She also had one-woman exhibitions of her work in Sussex.</p>

<p>Her last full scale portrait, of a young <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrister.html" title="Barrister">barrister</a> in wig and gown, was painted in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. After that, she was affected by cataracts in both eyes which, with some physical frailty, forced her to stop painting from life. However, she continued to paint abstract designs in watercolour.</p>
