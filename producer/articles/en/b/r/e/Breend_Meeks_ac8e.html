<p>By <i>Scary Movie</i>, Brenda is in High School with a small group of friends. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, during their second last year of High School, she, Cindy, Ray, Buffy and Greg accidentally killed somebody in a hit-and-run accident (the man actually survived being hit by the car, however they accidentally killed him afterwards).</p>
<p>After Drew Decker was murdered the killer strts to murder the gang. Starting with Greg, who was stabbed in front of his girlfriend's eyes. Buffy dies next, who plays along with the killer even breaking her own leg. Even after the exasperated killer cuts off her head she doesn't finish babbling, so he dumps her into a "Lost and Found" bin.</p>
<p>When Brenda and Ray go visit a movie theatre, Ray is killed in the bathroom. The killer attempts to kill Brenda, who thinks he is Ray, but since Brenda proves to be very obnoxious, the audience takes the job out of his hands. As the people in the theatre attack Brenda she walks up on stage where she dies.</p>
<p>Brenda was killed 3/4 into the movie, which makes her the killers 6th victim.</p>

<p>One year after the murders at B.A. Corpse High School, Brenda is a full time college student. She, Cindy, Ray and Shorty have all apparently survived their "deaths" in the previous movie.One of the college professors, Professor Oldman (Tim Curry), and his assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross) started setting up an experiment about ghosts in a haunted house, and decided to use the teens as bait. Cindy, Brenda, Shorty and Ray all went to the haunted house, along with Alex (Tori Spelling), a possessive new friend of Cindy and Brenda's, Buddy (Christopher Masterson), Ray's roommate, and Theo (Kathleen Robertson).</p>
<p>After there arivall at the mansion, strange events occur through the night(Cindy got beaten up by a cat, Alex had sex with a mysterious ghost, Ray rapes a possessed doll and Shorty almost got smoked by a giant Weed plant). The teens discovered the plan set by the Professor but before they can do anything the Professor and Alex were killed by a mysterious ghost. Soon they discover that Hanson (Chris Elliot), the house servant, was actually possessed by the evil Ghost, and was after Cindy because she looked like his wife. Soon the remaining teens defeated both Hanson and the Ghost spirit.</p>
<p>This was the first Scary Movie where Brenda didn't die, not counting the alternate ending.</p>

<p>Having graduated from college by 2003, Brenda is an elementary school teacher. She teaches Cody, Cindy's nephew. After she and Cindy go to a rap battle where George gets thrown out, they go back to her house. There she talks to Cindy about the tape and then starts to have fake deaths to scare Cindy. When the little girl from the tape appears Brenda tries to hold her off and actually does a pretty good job, until she fall behind the couch and is murdered.</p>
<p>This is the most brutal murder of Brenda so far and is fairly early in the movie.</p>

<p>Travelling across the country, Cindy ran into Brenda both where happy to she each other. It is unkown how Brenda survived her death from the privoius movie (when asked she simply replied 'Oh I thought you were dead too').</p>
<p>After driving for a while, they found the isolated village, where the leader, Henry Hale (Bill Pullman), revealed to her that he was the father of the ghostly boy (it is later revealed that he was only the step-father), and that the boy was killed in the boxing match. At this point, the village was attacked by the Tri-Pods, and Cindy and Brenda were sucked into its core, where Tom Ryan and his daughter Rachel (Conchita Campbell) were also trapped. Cindy, Brenda, Tom and Rachel were taken into the middle of the Tri-Pod, which resembles a bathroom, where Tom's son Robbie (Beau Mirchoff) was also trapped. As they all faced certain death, Cindy found out that one of the aliens, was actually the ghostly boy's father, and entire invasion was out of anger for his son's death. Cindy and Tom managed to talk him out of killing them and to call off the invasion.</p>
<p>Brenda is last seen giving birth too a baby, which looks just like the jigsaw pupet.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breend_Meeks_ac8e.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Brenda and Cindy are the only characters to appear in all four Scary Movies.</li>
<li>Despite being a main character Brenda only appears on the poster for <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scary_Movie_4_614b.html" title="Scary Movie 4">Scary Movie 4</a>. The rules she holds up on the poster read:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>I</b>: Let the scary movies be seen, we will mock them.</dd>
<dd><b>II</b>: Let the weepy dramas be seen, we will give them something to cry about.</dd>
<dd><b>III</b>: Let the romantic comedies beware, for we are coming.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There is an alternate ending in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scary_Movie_2_a1d3.html" title="Scary Movie 2">Scary Movie 2</a> where Cindy finds out that all her friends are dead. Similarly, in an alternate ending for <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scary_Movie_4_614b.html" title="Scary Movie 4">Scary Movie 4</a> where Brenda is crushed by a crate. If these two ending count as part of the episodes than Brenda has died in every movie.</li>
</ul>
