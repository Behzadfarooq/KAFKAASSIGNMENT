<p>I'll take off the merge tag, since the question seemed to be decided a couple of years ago (with no new comments). AS of this date, I would vote KEEP, but the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretton_Woods_System_36d9.html" title="Bretton Woods System">Bretton Woods Systemis</a> certainly duplicative as it stands. I'll suggest that the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretton_Woods_Conference_4426.html" title="Bretton Woods Conference">Bretton Woods Conference</a> pretty much stick to the conference (i.e. the start of the system) and the system pretty much stick to the next 20+ years that the system operated.

<p>This sentence in the Cold War section is challengeable: "The rise of the postwar United States as the world's leading industrial, monetary, and military power was <i>rooted in the impact of the U.S. military victory</i>..." on several grounds; (1) military power is created to defend economic power (as military blocs are created to defend trading blocs), so the premise is in reverse. The United States built a large armed force from 1941 onwards to defend its economic interests. Its economic interests were not dictated by its strategic military interests as the sentence suggests. Needs to be rewritten. (2) Further, claiming "its victory" is somewhat disputable since World War II ultimately was a war betrween the Soviet Union &amp; Germany, with the fighting inside the Soviet Union for 4 years and 40 million plus dead (45% of all German casualties were in the Soviet Union). The United States "victory" cost 172,000 casualties (including the Pacific theatre) and European ground actions about 11 months, although there was much inaction in the winter months. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">Nobs</a> 02:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps more detail can be added on the relative decline U.S. economic dominance given the reemergence of Japan and Germany and the emergence of the newly industrialized countries in the section on U.S. Balance of Payments Crisis 1958-1968, as this underpins the trends described in this section. As their economies rebuilt and became modernized, as their commercial trade picked up, their currencies became stronger, their account balances improved, and their positions next to the U.S. improved. Also perhaps more can be added on the increasing calls from the Third World to modify the balance of power in the BWIs, such as the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and UNCTAD. I'll do this eventually if no one else is interested. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 17:41, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think what this article needs is a large compression and reorganization - the same points are repeated because there is less internal unity than there needs to be, and the system of revanches is not well explained. This will make it easier to explain the wide varieties of reaction to Bretton Woods, and the post-Bretton woods existence of many institutions (such as the IMF etc) and the floating currency regime <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 19:11, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You added some content to the section on the dollar shortage and the Marshall Plan that was already established in the section on the origins of the Bretton Woods system, but I don't know if this necessitates a new outline. Currently the organization is 1) origins 2) design 3) readjustment 4) and collapse of the Bretton Woods system. (This design was intended to reconcile historical, IR, and economic perspectives and to make the article accessible to non-expert readers.) If you have an alternative outline in mind, please post it, as I'll be interested in considering it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 19:38, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the outline is fine, but it needs to have a stronger chronology. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a></p>

<p>The remark that the "As world trade increased rapidly through the 1950s, the size of the gold base increased by only a few percent" is peculiar. According to the IMF's International Financial Statistics U.S holdings of gold in 1950 was 652 million fine troy ounces. The same series reports that in 1960 the U.S held 508.690 million ounces. This is hardly, under any stretch of the imagination, an "increase" least of all an increase of "only a few percent". Admittedly, U.S holdings reached 653 million ounces in 1957 (after falling to 621 million ounces in 1955), but this was followed by continuous and substantial decline to 311.2 million ounces in 1968. An increase to 338.38 million ounces in 1969 resumed the outflow of gold leading up to the Nixon Shock.</p>
<p>I would have expected a little more attention to detail and a committment not to distort such easily verifable economic reality in this article.</p>

<p>Oh man, was I the only one heartbroken to get to the last sections' missing headers!? I was getting really, really into the story, wonder how will it all pan out, when will the US go off the gold standard, and hey what about these WTO protests lately and whatnot, then BANG! the article end.</p>

<p>Hopefully in order to make the text more accessible to general readers, I added some backgrounding on the structural changes in the 1960 and 1970s undermining international monetary management toward the end of the article. More work is still needed. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 19:17, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. And the FC article is essentially a stub. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 19:35, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, that is quite an important article to leave as a stub. Perhaps we can come up with a draft outline for that article and divvy up the work? When we're done, perhaps we can also create a historical series along with the gold standard article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 20:55, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

Text reads "running not just a balance of payments deficit but also a trade deficit"; this is somewhat confusing because it is the actual <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_deficit.html" title="Trade deficit">trade deficit</a> that leads to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_of_payments.html" title="Balance of payments">balance of payments</a> deficit, unless one is trading on credit or late in paying bills. Should read "running not just a trade deficit but also a balance payments deficit", i.e. late in paying bills.

<dd>The article looks very good. I would like to work with you on it and will make suggestions here rather than butcher your work. I notice there is no definition of reserve asset in wiki which is needed for the IMF article; there was an edit on this page sometime ago that deleted a referance to the pound being used as a "reserve, transaction and currency asset". Perhaps we work together to create a good definition for both pages.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">Nobs</a> 19:14, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>CORRECTION: Until 1991 there were no hegemony in the world economy. In the western hemisphere one can say in the article that there was a hegemony. I urge someone to correct "hegemony" quoted just before 2. "The design of the Bretton Woods system".</p>
<p>CORRECTION:</p>
<p>3.2 Bretton Woods and the Cold War: "United States as the world's leading industrial, monetary, and MILITARY power was rooted in the impact of the U.S. military victory, in the instability of the national states in postwar Europe, and the wartime devastation of the Soviet economy."</p>
<p>US was not the leading military power a short while after the WWII.</p>

<p>Anonymous 192.68.228.4: I hope you can withstand criticism, may I suggest "security umbrella" is a better term than the obscure "security-related umbrella" whatever that is.</p>
<p>Also, these two phrases make no sense: <i>"urge for the U.S. political and"</i> and <i>"supposed security threat from USSR diminished"</i> (I know, I know, they were there before your edits). How does a "supposed threat" diminish? How does something that may or may not exist categorically reduce in size or quanity, unless it either diminishes is size either in the minds of the people imagining it, or the writer observing their hallucinations. Either way, it doesn't make anysense.</p>
<p>Incidently, what is "bipolar oblivion"? Can anyone explain? Thx <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">Nobs</a> 15:06, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>on Hegemony: "But as the nineteenth century had been economically dominated by Britain, the second half of the twentieth was to be one of U.S. hegemony."</p>
<p>This sentence is I believe unnecessary, as it tends to increase the subjectivity of the article. that this may be true is irrelevant, the content of this article should be objective.</p>

<p>I was just reviewing for a test by looking over some Wikipedia articles. I noticed that, at least in the "Decline of the Dollar" subsection, the text is extremely similar to that by Joan Spero in _The Politics of International Economic Relations_, fourth edition, chapter 2- required reading for my class. It seems to be just rephrased from Spero's text, which is not listed as a reference. Am I missing its listing? 82.201.227.242 20:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)Anne</p>

<p>The article seems great, but I had one idea: what about making a new section under "2 The design of the Bretton Woods system" or under one of its subsections, called "Keynes' Alternative Vision" or something like that. I have only read a bit on this from a secondary source, but it seems like Keynes alternative scheme for the post-war economic order was pretty interesting (some of which is mentioned in the article, like the "bancor"). He proposed an international debt clearning house and a system which would allow debtor nations to develop. The overview I read of this was in George Monbiot's <i>Manifesto for a New World Order</i>. I don't know the material well enough to write it myself, but I think it might make a really informative and thought-provoking addition to the article.

<p>I added a bit about him in a notably awkward way. I think he was pretty important--predicting the downfall with pretty exact reasons as to why the system failed--and should be noted as such. As far as I know, he's the most noted economist to predict the contradiction between liquidity and confidence in the growing Bretton Woods system. Right?

<p>This article is extremely vague on what happened <i>after</i> the collapse of Bretton Woods. At the very least it should treat the effects of the collapse as part of this article. I believe there is probably a good argument for having an article titled <b>Bretton Woods II</b> or <b>Post Bretton Woods</b> (I don't think that <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary_hegemony.html" title="Monetary hegemony">Monetary hegemony</a> really describes this properly as it's more or less one point of view). But this article goes into such detail about the 1945-1971 financial regime, but to my knowledge Wikipedia has no specific article treating the 1971-present history of global finance. (If I'm mistaken I'll be happily redirected.) I do recognize that there is no "system" in the sense of an agreed framework. To the extent that there is no longer a <i>need</i> for a system is another aspect that could be elucidated.</p>
<p>This is an excellent article (I have my quibbles but a) I'm no economist and b) I'm speaking generally in Wikipedia terms). Not having any treatment of the details of the end or the system or quasi-system which followed or the transition or the effects of the end/loss of Bretton Woods is a serious omission, though. Global finance didn't "end" in 1971. I would like to write such an article, but I really dare not. Any ideas on how to resolve this? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:02, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I quote;</p>
<p>Bretton Woods, then, created a system of triangular trade: the United States would use the convertible financial system to trade at a tremendous profit with developing nations, expanding industry and acquiring raw materials. It would use this surplus to send dollars to Europe, which would then be used to rebuild their economies, and make the United States the market for their products. This would allow the other industrialized nations to purchase products from the Third World, which reinforced the American role as the guarantor of stability. When this triangle became destabilized, Bretton Woods entered a period of crisis which lead ultimately to its collapse.</p>

<p>(Putting this back in because the previous user accidently deleted it) I would like to point out that there are some significant similarities between portions of the text in this document and LaFeber's "America, Russia, and the Cold War 1945-1996", 8th Edition. For example, this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, U.S. officials were determined to break open the empire. Combined, British and U.S. trade accounted for well over half the world's exchange of goods. If the British bloc could be split apart, the U.S. would be well on its way to opening the entire global marketplace. ... A devastated Britain had little choice. Two world wars had destroyed the country's principal industries that paid for the importation of half the nation's food and nearly all its raw materials except coal. The British had no choice but to ask for aid. In 1945, the U.S. agreed to a loan of $3.8 billion. In return, weary British officials promised to negotiate the agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In LaFeber pg10, it appears almost exactly the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet American officials were determined to break open the empire. Combined, British and U.S. trade accounted for more than half the world's exchange of goods. If the British bloc could be split apart, the United States would be well on the way to opening the entire global marketplace. A devastated England had no choice. Two wars had destroyed its principle industries that paid for the importation of half the nation's food and nearly all its raw materials except coal. The British asked for help. In 1945 the United States agreed to loan $3.8 billion. In return, weary London officials promised to dismantle much of their imperial trading bloc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another case is this portion of the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financier and self-appointed adviser to presidents and congressmen, Bernard Baruch, summed up the spirit of Bretton Woods in early 1945: if we can "stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets," as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines, "oh boy, oh boy, what long term prosperity we will have."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In LaFeber pg 9-10, it is again almost identical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financier and self-appointed adviser to Presidents and congressmen, Bernard Baruch, caught the spirit in early 1945: if we can "stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets," as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines, "oh boy, oh boy, what long term prosperity we will have."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realise the last example does reference LaFeber as the source, however in both cases there are no quotes to denote *which* segments are being referenced directly from LaFeber. Myself, I'm pretty much a newbie, and have no idea what process should be followed, but I figured this should be brought to your attention. krou 19:48, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not an experienced Wikipedia user, but I'm a little concerned with a line under "The Great Depression" under "Origins."
