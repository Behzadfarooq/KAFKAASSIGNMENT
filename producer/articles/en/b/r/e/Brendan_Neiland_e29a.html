<p><b>From Artist's own website:</b></p>
<p>Brendan Neiland is one of Britain's foremost and contemporary painters and printmakers represented in major museums and galleries worldwide including, in Britain, The Victoria and Albert Museum, The Tate Gallery London, The Collections of the British Council and the Arts Council of Great Britain.</p>
<p>He has created some of the most memorable images of modern metropolitan existence. His work has been commissioned by leading commercial companies, public service institutions and education establishments and has been the subject of several television documentaries and video programmes.</p>
<p>Informed by the practice of photography yet influenced by a sense of the poetics of lights and pictorial structure which can be related to the work of Braque or Magritte, Corot or Vermeer, the art of Brendan Neiland is eloquent of the enigma of existence as it has been manifest in the modern era.</p>
<p>At once intimate and grand, celebratory and melancholy, his work often features the soaring glass and steel structures typical of the era’s corporate architecture. At the same time, the work embraces a range of spiritual matters. Able to convey the depths of longing contained within a moments reflection – in the mystery of mirrored light, held in creative equipose between worlds of culture and nature, technology and spirit – Brendan Neiland is an artist whose work appeals to both the public and private realm.</p>
<p><b>Expulsion from the RA</b></p>
<p>Professor Neiland told members that the money was raised and spent by him and his staff to avoid budget restrictions that they felt were unfair on the RA Schools. Fearing a scandal the Royal Academy took a cautious approach, hiring Ernst and Young to investigate.</p>
<p>The official public response to the scandal from the RA was to publish a statement saying the money was raised from Neiland's consulting work and through the sale of artwork, and that transactions had occurred outside the Academy's accounting systems and without the knowledge of the finance department. It promised its donors it would recover any misspent funds.</p>
<p>In May 2005 the artist Peter Blake resigned from the RA when Professor Neiland was expelled as a member by a vote of 37 to 29 of the 102 Academicians. This vote followed a private report from the high court judge Sir Alan Moses. Acting as a "friend" of the RA, Sir Alan advised the membership that Neiland had behaved improperly and had put the RA at legal risk. Despite concuring that Professor Neiland had earned much of the money through his own consultancy work, and that the account showed a surplus of £20,000 when it was closed, and that the Finance Director knew about the account four years earlier, the report concentrated on damning Professor Neiland's disregard for accounting responsibilities and recommended expulsion. (Sir Alan Moses is the son-in-law of the late Hugh Casson, President of the RA from 1976 to 1984.)</p>
<p>Peter Blake said he believed that Professor Neiland had been treated unfairly and that innuendos of fraud were grossly unfair. He also said he felt the judge should have taken evidence from Professor Neiland before writing his report. Despite announcing his resignation to the press, the RA continues to recognise Blake as a member.</p>
<p>The Royal Academy has now decided it will not be seeking to recover funds from Professor Neiland, and refuses to comment on the episode. As yet it has not disclosed the Ernst and Young report to the charity commission, the membership in General Assembly or the public.</p>
<p>However the RA's director of development, John Nickson, told Radio Four that the money was raised by Professor Neiland's own consultancy work and from the sale of artwork not belonging to the RA. Professor Neiland maintained he had served the interest of the schools at all times but admitted his handling of the funds had been unworldly and cavalier and issued an apology to the membership. A charity commission file remains open on the case.</p>
<p>Many commentators felt the scandal was best understood as a continuation of a power struggle within the governance of the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Neiland’s resignation was followed by that of the President, Phillip King RA and the Secretary, Lawton Fitt, in November 2004. Phillip King cited ill health, and Lawton Fitt gave an interview to the Independent newspaper saying "I have been repeatedly frustrated in my efforts to make changes, to do some things I think the academy would benefit from, and finally that frustration has told."</p>
