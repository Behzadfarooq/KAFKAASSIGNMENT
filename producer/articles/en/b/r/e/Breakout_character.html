Diminutive dwarf actor Coleman played the wisecracking young African-American who was adopted along with his older brother Willis (<a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Bridges_78d9.html" title="Todd Bridges">Todd Bridges</a>) by an older rich white man Phillip Drummond (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_Bain_7c73.html" title="Conrad Bain">Conrad Bain</a>) and his teen daughter Kimberly (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Plato_0712.html" title="Dana Plato">Dana Plato</a>). The adorable actor quickly dominated the series, with his memorable <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_phrase.html" title="Catch phrase">catch phrase</a>: scrunching up his face and remarking in disbelief, "Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, (character name, usually Willis or Mr. Drummond)?!" Arnold would appear on other related series, such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Facts_of_Life_a07d.html" title="The Facts of Life">The Facts of Life</a></i>. When Coleman's popularity waned, the show's producers introduced another cute young kid, a naive white boy named Sam (<i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Cooksey_cb59.html" title="Danny Cooksey">Danny Cooksey</a></i>). Coleman's character inspired Webster Long (<a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_Lewis_9583.html" title="Emmanuel Lewis">Emmanuel Lewis</a>) in the competing series <i><a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster_%28TV_series%29_103b.html" title="Webster (TV series)">Webster</a></i>.</li>

The character of Fonzie started out as a fringe character but quickly evolved into the focal point of the series. His character became best friend to the main character, Richie Cunningham, displacing the character originally intended for that relationship. Winkler's billing in the credits rose all the way to second (he refused to go before <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Howard_07f5.html" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a>, the star) and then first after Howard left the show to pursue directing.

However, his popularity soon rose and he was added to the main cast in the second season.
