<p>You're after my robot bee! O_O</p>
<p><br />
I♥UltraDave Why not?</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I believe in being your own person but I do follow certain fads, not because they are cool but because I like them. I don’t believe in love forever but I do believe in a very long time. I chew my pudding. I’m nice but I can be very mean. I’m shallow. I’m a hypocrite. I want everyone to like me but not everyone does. I’m scared of rejection. I don’t like to be alone, ever I know I’m pretty.I like pretty things. I’m a little conceded. I don't think people should get worked up over things like who said what or little things like tests. I laugh at my own jokes. I'm quite lame. People DO judge other people on how they look so looks do matter. I know this will make some people not like me and I don’t like that because this is who I am even though I don’t like some people for who they are. All I really, really want in life is to grow up, get married and be a mom. My emotions have extremes. I lie a lot but never about anything that could really hurt somebody. I like who I am most of the time even if I’m not the best person in the world, then again, no one is.</p>

<p>The Tide- The Spill Canvas</p>
<p>And there's three, count 'em three Children playing on the beach They were eager to learn, To be taught and to teach</p>
<p>There's Veronica She's biting her lip As she watches the waves turn white at the tip And there's Vada Radiating with joy And luckily she still can't stand the sight of a boy And lastly there's Dave His hair dances in the wind And he's wondering what love is And why it has to end</p>
<p>And he can't understand How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends His mother whispers quietly... Heaven's not a place that you go when you die It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive So live for the moment And take this advice, live by every word Love is just a hoax so forget anything that you have heard And live for the moment now</p>
<p>And there's three, count 'em three Children growing on the beach They were eager to learn, To be taught and to teach</p>
<p>There's Veronica She's licking her lips As she waits for her real, first passionate kiss And there's Vada She can't admit her jealousy Of her sister Veronica, and how she's so pretty, and how she's so pretty. And lastly there's Dave Still sitting on the dock Ponders his life, and he skips his rocks And he wonders when his father will return But he's not coming back</p>
<p>And he can't understand How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends His mother whispers quietly... Heaven's not a place that you go when you die It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive So live for the moment And take this advice, live by every word Love is just a hoax so forget everything that you have heard</p>
<p>Forget everything.</p>
<p>And there's three, count 'em three Children missing from the beach They were eager to learn, To be taught and to teach</p>
<p>But the sad thing Is that they never lived passed the age of fifteen Due to neglect from their mother Who was bed ridden by her ex-lover, their father And she didn't even notice, or pay much attention As the tide came in and swept her three into the ocean Now all her advice, it seems useless</p>
<p>No, heaven's not a place that you go when you die It's that moment in life when you touch her and you feel alive So live for the moment And take this advice, live by every word Love's completely real, so forget anything that you have heard And live for the moment now.</p>
