<p>In DJ parlance, a break is where all elements of a song (e.g., pads, basslines, vocals), <i>except for percussion</i>, disappear for a time. In hip hop and electronica, a short break is also known as "the drop", and is sometimes accented by cutting off everything, even the percussion. This is distinguished from a <b>breakdown</b>, a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_%28music%29.html" title="Section (music)">section</a> where the composition is deliberately deconstructed to minimal elements (usually the percussion or rhythm section with the vocal re-introduced over the minimal backing), all other parts having been gradually or suddenly cut out: "Breaks are for the drummer; breakdowns are for hands in the air" (Brewster and Broughton 2003, p.79).</p>

<p>A break may be described as when the song takes a "breather, drops down to some exciting percussion, and then comes storming back again" and compared to a fake ending. Most songs have a break at two-thirds to three-quarters of their length and the break is usually visible on a record as a dark ring. (Brewster and Broughton 2003, p.79)</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_van_der_Merwe_0660.html" title="Peter van der Merwe">Peter van der Merwe</a> (1989, p.283) a break "occurs when the voice stops at the end of a phrase and is answered by a snatch of accompaniment," and originated from the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_run.html" title="Bass run">bass runs</a> of marches of the "Sousa school". In this case it would be a "break" from the vocal part.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Toop_a9f3.html" title="David Toop">David Toop</a> (1991), "the word <i>break</i> or <i>breaking</i> is a music and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">dance</a> term (as well as a proverb) that goes back a long way. Some tunes, like 'Buck Dancer's Lament' from early this century, featured a two-bar silence in every eight bars for the break--a quick showcase of improvised dance steps. Others used the same device for a solo instrumental break: one of the most fetishized fragments of recorded music is a famous four-bar break taken by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> in <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy_Gillespie_1696.html" title="Dizzy Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a>'s tune '<a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_in_Tunisia_8a92.html" title="Night in Tunisia">Night in Tunisia</a>'."</p>
<p>However, in Hip Hop, "today the term <i>break</i> refers to <i>any</i> segment of music (usually four measures or less) that could be <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_%28music%29.html" title="Sampling (music)">sampled</a> and repeated [see <a href="../../../b/r/e/Break_%28music%29.html#break_beat" title="Break (music)">break beat</a> below]....A break is any expanse of music that is <i>thought of as a break</i> by a producer." In the words of <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Jazzy_Jay_8154.html" title="DJ Jazzy Jay">DJ Jazzy Jay</a> (Leland and Stein 1987: 26, cited in Schloss 2004), "Maybe those records [whose breaks are sampled] were ahead of their time. Maybe they were made specifically for the rap era; these people didn't know what they were making at that time. They thought, 'Oh, we want to make a jazz record'". (Schloss 2004, p.36-37)</p>

More recently electronic artists have created "break beats" from other electronic music. Compare with "breakbeat" below.</p>
<p>Although DJ Kool Herc is usually credited with being the first to cut between two copies of a record, it is likely that there were a number of like-minded DJ's developing the technique at the same time. For example, Walter Gibbons was noted in first-hand accounts by his peers for cutting two copies of the same record in his Discoteque gigs of the mid 1970s<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakbeat.html" title="Breakbeat">Breakbeat</a> as a genre would not appear in any commercial sense until well after the advent of inexpensive digital sampling equipment. The genre itself (outside of a hip-hop usage for this style) can be traced commercially to the group Coldcut in Great Britain, who started by looping very small sections of analogue tape to form such records as "Beats and Pieces" and "That Greedy Beat". They were inspired by a number of New York hip-hop DJ's, but did not release their recordings in a broader context of Rap music. Coldcut's efforts were equally aligned with house music and dub reggae, as well as being self-standing compositions "sans MC". Aside from the remix of Eric B. and Rakim's "Paid in Full", Coldcut would not align with a rapper until U.S. label Tommy Boy foisted Queen Latifah on the group's "Smoke This One" (originally released as an instrumental composition).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Break_%28music%29.html" title="Edit section: Breakdown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Breakdown</span></h2>
<p>Disco mixer and remixer <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Moulton_7e7d.html" title="Tom Moulton">Tom Moulton</a> invented the "disco break" or breakdown section in the early 1970's. Moulton had been remixing a dance record and found that the performance had "immaculated" (gone up in pitch as live performances are prone to doing), and this fact would be noticed unless he separated two sections of the recording with non-tonal information. <a href="http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/tom.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/tom.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He edited in a section of drums, and the aesthetic effect was immediately found to be pleasing to dancers. The placement was also useful for club DJ's, providing a rhythm-only section of the recording over which to begin mixing in the next record to be played. Mr. Moulton has maintained that his innovation was an accident (ibid). The placement followed the patterning of a traditional pop recording: it replaced the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge_%28music%29.html" title="Bridge (music)">bridge</a> typically found in such a record after the second chorus. A clear example is the breakdown in "My Lovin' (Never Gonna' Get It)" by En Vogue: a sampled male voice can be heard introducing this part of the record with the sentence "and now it's time for a breakdown". Longer tracks often have two, three or more breakdowns.</p>
<p>Initially the transition to the breakdown was an abrupt absence of most of the arrangement in a disco record as described above. HiNRG records would typically use a pronounced percussive element, such as a drum fill, to cover the transition, and later genres reach the breakdown section by a gradual reduction of elements. In all genres the stripping away of other instruments and vocals ("breaking-down" the <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrangement.html" title="Arrangement">arrangement</a>) helps create intense contrast, with breakdowns usually preceding or following heightened musical climaxes. In many <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">dance</a> records, the breakdown often consists of a stripping away of the pitched elements (most instruments) - and often the percussion is cut too - but an adding of an unpitched <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise.html" title="Noise">noise</a> <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_effect.html" title="Sound effect">sound effect</a>. This is often treated with a lot of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverb.html" title="Reverb">reverb</a> and rises in tone to create an exciting climax. This noise then cuts to a beat of silence before returning to the musical part of the record. Examples of the elements left during a breakdown include "a single string note, a German woman having an orgasm, or the voice of God telling you to take drugs" (Brewster and Broughton 2003, p.79).</p>

<p>The <b>breakdown</b> in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a> and certain other <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">metal</a> genres, originally referred to as a "down beat", is where a band will usually play in half time, giving the feeling of a slower tempo. It is considered to some an important element in many songs of these genres and central to many bands, quite a few of which eschew traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting. When played live, breakdowns are usually responded to by the audience by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_dancing.html" title="Hardcore dancing">hardcore dancing</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosh.html" title="Mosh">moshing</a>. Vocalists also tend to throw in a single, repeated statement throughout the breakdown, giving those who are not dancing or moshing an opportunity to sing along. Many <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore.html" title="Hardcore">hardcore</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">metal</a> bands rely on having memorable breakdowns rather than memorable choruses and critics often accuse bands of placing too many breakdowns in one song, claiming the intensity of the breakdown is lost when it is overused.</p>
<p>The drums are usually simple with several cymbals and snare on the third beat. The cymbals are ussually a china or fast crash with fourths or more common, eighths. In metalcore, the guitars play a set of rhythmically oriented riffs, usually on open strings so as to achieve the lowest sound for which the guitars are tuned. Sometimes, these are contrasted with either dissonant chords or <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinch_harmonics.html" title="Pinch harmonics">pinch harmonics</a>. These riffs are often accented by the drummer with <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_drums.html" title="Bass drums">double kick bass drums</a> that follow the pattern of the guitars.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a>, breakdowns tend to be more upbeat, using the floor toms and snares to create a faster, 'rolling' rhythm. This provides audience members with an opportunity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skank_%28dance%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skank_%28dance%29" rel="nofollow">skank</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosh.html" title="Mosh">mosh</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_pit.html" title="Circle pit">circle pit</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally, elements of a "breakdown", such as the open-stringed <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> riff complimented by <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_drums.html" title="Bass drums">double kick bass drums</a>, can be used as the intro for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore.html" title="Hardcore">Hardcore</a> rock songs.</p>
