<p>The photo on this page identifies Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser as "The Head" of Breslov Hasidism. This is not correct. First of all, he is now deceased (died 1994). Second, there is no one "head" of Breslov Hasidism. There are several different groups of Breslov Hasidim today, with many leaders whom different Breslovers look up to for advice. This caption would better read something like, "Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser, a respected leader (but not the Rebbe) within Breslov Hasidism. Died 1994." I would have changed it myself but I don't know how to do captions yet. Please do so. (Posted by Rabbi Yonassan Gershom, webmaster at Hasidism.info, and a Breslover Hasid.)</p>
<p>Update: I figured out how to change the caption. (Rooster613 is Rabbi Gershom's ID here)</p>

I am putting this here rather than on the page itself (where I did add the source and page ref.) because I feel it would clutter up the article to put it all there.</p>
<p>Nathan of Nemirov (Rebbe Nachman's personal secretary) wrote in <i>Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom</i>: "The Rebbe (i.e., Nachman) spoke out very strongly against those who thought that the main reason for a Tzaddik's great attainments was the high level of his soul. He insisted that this was not true, maintaining that it depends completely on good deeds (mitzvot)and effort. He was very specific in emphasizing this. He said, 'Every person can attain the highest level. It depends on nothing but your own free choice... For everything depends upon a multitude of deeds.'" (page 29) On the same page Rabbi Nathan also quotes Rebbe Nachman as saying that he was not automatically a Tzaddik because of his family background (as great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov), but only through his own efforts and "Devoting his entire being to the service of God." <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">User:Rooster613</a></p>

<p>Excellent idea! I will gladly do it (unless somebody else does first) but probably not until after Pesach. Maybe we should also have a separate page on Rabbi Odesser (who introduced the Na-Nach-Nachma-Nachman-m'Uman chant.)

<p>The photo that was added on 21 Sept is not how the grave looks today. This picture was probably taken before 1999. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 19:51, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The former caption read that this was how the grave looked "for over 50 years." That is also not accurate. At one time, there was a small white building for the pilgrims to pray in. This was later destroyed (by the Nazis?) The <a href="http://www.breslov.com" class="external text" title="http://www.breslov.com" rel="nofollow">Breslov on the Internet</a> site has a colorized photo of this building circa 1922. During the Communist regime, there was nothing so overt on the grave -- simply a flat, ground-level cement slab to mark where it was, and a rickety old wooden bench to sit on. This gave it the appearance of garden landscaping, to mark where the grave was. (It had been located after the Nazis destroyed the cemetery by finding the remains of the foundation of the building mentioned above, and preserved by the family whose house was later built on that land.) I have some old books and pamphlets with photos of this slab and bench. (Unfortunately, the pics are not in the common domain.) The lovely gravestone and embroidered covering was probably not added until after the fall of Communism in 1989. (Anybody know for sure?) It did look like this pic when I was there in 1997, so let's say "around 1997" for this pic caption, OK? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 12:24, 29 September 2005 (UTC)Rooster613
<dl>
<dd>Based on a book that is about to be published by Breslov Research Institute, the grave remained a slab of cement on the ground until 1991, when a low concrete monument was placed over it. In 1992, with the help of Reb <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Dorfman_01ed.html" title="Michel Dorfman">Michel Dorfman</a>, this monument was replaced by a marble one. The whole house was redesigned to incorporate the grave in 1999. So let's say this is how the grave looked in the 1990's. I hope to add significant detail about the grave, the house, and the whole story of how Rebbe Nachman's grave was rediscovered in the article about <a href="../../../u/m/a/Uman%2C_Ukraine_30e1.html" title="Uman, Ukraine">Uman, Ukraine</a>. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 14:07, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article begans with the rather emphatic declaration that "Breslov is not Breslau or Bratzlav or Bratislava." However, someone is making redirects in other articles about Breslov personalities, to the effect that any mention of the town of "Breslov" redirects to "Bratslav." On the Bratslav page it says specifically that this is the town in which Rebbe Nachman lived and taught. Could someone please clear this up? If Breslov is not Bratslav, what is it? Remember that towns in Ukraine didn't have Jewish names to start with. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 11:21, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just found this entry on the breslov.org (Breslov Research Institute) FAQ page: "Breslov is sometimes transliterated as Bratzlav or Braclav, and should not be confused with Bratislava in Czechoslovakia or Breslau in Germany"<a href="http://www.breslov.org/quest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.breslov.org/quest.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Until now, everyone's been writing "Breslov" whether they're referring to the hasidic dynasty or to the town. I just went through all the links to this page and make sure everything links to [Breslov (Hasidic Dynasty)]. All references to the city should read: [Bratslav|Breslov].

<li>That's appropriate, but keep in mind that many Hasidim do use "Breslov" for both the movement and the town itself. Also, it was primarily Martin Buber, writing in German, who made the mistake of calling him "Nachman von Bratzlaw" (W=V sound in German) confusing the German city with the Ukrainian one. (I ran into this while speaking in Germany.) From there it became "Nachman of Bratslav" or "Bratslau" (mistaking the German -aw for the "OW" sound in English?) in academic works based on Buber, etc. In academe "Bratslav" is still used for both the movement and the town. However, since the Hasidim cal themselves "Breslov" I think that should be the main usage for the movement. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 00:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)Rooster613</li>

<p>The purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide factual information in a neutral, journalistic approach that we call N-POV (<a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_Point_of_View_1bc9.html" title="Neutral Point of View">Neutral Point of View</a>). This does not mean we must list every single Breslov site on the Web. Sites that are simply promoting a particular yeshiva, radio station, book, rabbi, collections of sermons, or whatever without giving much factual info that would be useful in research ABOUT Breslov seem inappropriate to me. Some of the links added recently, such as Radio Breslov, are already linked on the link launcher, "Breslov on the Internet," hence redundant. (However, that site DOES want to list everything on the Net, so if you get listed there, your group is indirectly linked anyway.) And I do not think that sites primarily in Hebrew are useful to an English encyclopedia. I went through every outside link today and removed those that seemed inappropriate. Granted, this is my personal call, but I have put in a lot of effort trying to keep this and other Breslov pages reasonably N-POV. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 00:17, 27 February 2006 (UTC)Rooster613</p>

<p>"The well-known tune to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Ani_Maamin_f453.html" title="Ani Maamin">Ani Maamin</a> ("I believe") is attributed to Breslover Hasidim who sang it on their way to the gas chambers."

<p>Thank you for the info. Regarding "Ani Ma'amin," I have heard form several Holocaust survivors that Breslovers popularized it in the camps.

<p>What is the difference? is the real name of the movement is breslev, don't care if i'm log in or not.</p>
<p>Logging in gives you some credibility as to who you are and what your sources of info are. Now, it is true that the spelling "Breslev" is used by at least one group in Israel, so perhaps this should be mentioned as an alternative spelling and disambiguated. However, In the English language, the spelling "Breslov" is the one most commonly used by Breslover Hasidim. (The difference may well be one of regional accents -- Ashkenazi vs Sephardic or some such, since only one vowel change is in dispute.) Breslov is also the spelling used by the Breslov Research Institute (for which, perhaps, we should have a page?) -- a major publisher of Breslov materials in English. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 18:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Famous curse: there is a story that when Joseph Kennedy just before WWII used his influence as the U.S. Ambassador to the UK to prevent Jews in German held territories being granted visas (and safety) to the US, the Rebbe cursed him and his entire family for his actions - many believe that the problems of the family (down to the drunk driving accident of Patrick Kennedy) all date to that curse - does anyone want to place that in the story?Incorrect</p>

<dd>Are you sure you're not mixing up rebbes? Rebbe Nachman died in 1810, and Breslov hasn't had another since. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 22:38, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>whoops, your're correct, I just checked, the story involves the Belz'e Rebbe, I've posted the above there. Thanks.Incorrect 02:04, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
