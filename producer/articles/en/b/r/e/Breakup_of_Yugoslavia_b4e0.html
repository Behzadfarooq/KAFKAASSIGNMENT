<p><a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> was a south-eastern European country in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, a region with a long history of sectarian and ethnic conflict. It was a conglomeration of six regional republics and two autonomous provinces that roughly divided on ethnic lines which split up in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> into five independent countries. These eight federal units were the six republics: <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, and two autonomous provinces within Serbia: <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a>. The most important elements which fostered the hatred that split into the civil war are the formation of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Yugoslavia_639d.html" title="First Yugoslavia">first Yugoslavia</a>, the civil war during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, the overreaching idea of "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a>" and the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan.html" title="Balkan">Balkan</a> adaptations of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Slavism_6613.html" title="Pan-Slavism">Pan-Slavism</a>. The borders dividing the republics were the product of old treaties signed by the great European powers. Among the republics created was ethnically mixed <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia-Herzegovina_8124.html" title="Bosnia-Herzegovina">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a>. Bosnia had never been a modern state, moreover, it did not have a clear ethnic majority with “44% Muslims, 33% Serbs, and the remaining population consisting of Croats and other minorities.” This left "Greater Serbia" open to interpretation, with large tracks of Bosnia and Croatia under dispute as to its proper ownership.</p>

The death of Tito removed what many Yugoslavs and Westerners saw as the country’s main unifying force. The legacy of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_a697.html" title="Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Constitution of 1974</a> was used to throw the system of decision-making into a state of paralysis, all the more hopeless as the conflict of interests had become irreconcilable. The constitutional crisis that inevitably followed resulted in rise of nationalism in all republics and provinces: Slovenia and Croatia made demands for looser ties within the Federation, Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic, Serbia sought to achieve control over Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>In 1986, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Arts_395b.html" title="Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts">Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts</a> contributed significantly to the rise of nationalism in Serbia, as it drafted a memorandum addressing some burning issues concerning the position of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> as the most numerous people in Yugoslavia. The largest Yugoslav republic in territory and population, Serbia's influence over the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina was reduced by the Constitution of 1974, which gave them long demanded autonomy. The government of the Socialist republic of Serbia was restricted in making and carrying out decisions that would apply to the provinces. The provinces had a vote in the Federal Presidency Council (an eight member council composed of representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces), which was not always caste in favor of Serbia proper.</p>

<p>Serbian <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> leader <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a> sought to restore pre-1974 Serbian powers. Other republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, denounced this move as a revival of Serbian <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html" title="Hegemony">hegemonism</a> (see <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Serbia_f89a.html" title="Great Serbia">Great Serbia</a>). Milošević succeded in reducing the autonomy of <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> and of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo and Metohija</a>, and could now himself install representatives of the provinces in the Yugoslav Presidency Council. The very instrument that reduced Serbian influence before was now used to increase it: in the eight member Council, Serbia could count on four votes minimum - Serbia proper, then-loyal Montenegro, and now even Vojvodina and Kosovo.</p>
<p>As a result of these events, the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">ethnic Albanian</a> miners in <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> organized strikes, demanding the reinstatement of their autonomy. This contributed to ethnic conflict between the Albanians and the Serb population of the province. At 77% of the population of Kosovo in the 1980s,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> ethnic-Albanians were the majority. The number of Serbs in Kosovo was falling throughout the entire century as a result of ethnic cleansing by Albanians during second world war and subsequent harrasment by Albanian authorities and population<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The ever increasing ethnic tensions increased this trend, and by <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Serbs formed as little as 10% of the total population.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, under the presidency of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Ku%C4%8Dan_ab4b.html" title="Milan Kučan">Milan Kučan</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, supported Albanian miners and their struggle for recognition [citation needed]. Initial strikes turned into widespread demonstrations calling for Kosovo to be made the seventh republic. This angered Serbia's leadership which proceeded to use police force, and later even the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_People%27s_Army_55be.html" title="Yugoslav People's Army">Federal Army</a> was sent to the province by the order of the Serbia-held majority in the Yugoslav Presidency Council.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia_b4e0.html" title="Edit section: 1990s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990s</span></h3>
<p>In January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Communists_of_Yugoslavia_4079.html" title="League of Communists of Yugoslavia">League of Communists of Yugoslavia</a> was convened. For most of the time, the Slovenian and Serbian delegations were arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. The Serbian delegation, led by Milošević, insisted on a policy of "one person, one vote", which would empower the majority population, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>. In turn, the Slovenians, supported by Croatians, sought to reform Yugoslavia by devolving even more power to republics, but were voted down. As a result, the Slovenian, and eventually Croatian delegation left the Congress, and the all-Yugoslav Communist party was dissolved.</p>
<p>Following the fall of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> in the rest of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, each of the republics held multi-party elections in 1990. The unresolved issues remained. In particular, Slovenia and Croatia elected governments oriented towards independence (under <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Ku%C4%8Dan_ab4b.html" title="Milan Kučan">Milan Kučan</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tu%C4%91man_b3e8.html" title="Franjo Tuđman">Franjo Tuđman</a>, respectively), while <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> elected candidates who favoured Yugoslav unity. In Croatia there was growing advocacy for "<i>Croatian state and historical rights</i>" which resulted in Serbs being stripped of their <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">national</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitutional</a> rights and thus being demoted from a constituent nation of Croatia to a national minority. Following this, the Serbs proclaimed the emergence of Serbian Autonomous Areas (known later as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Serb_Krajina_b0e3.html" title="Republic of Serb Krajina">Republic of Serb Krajina</a>) in Croatia. Croatia embarked upon the illegal importation of arms, mainly from <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, which was made public when Yugoslav Counter Intelligence (<i>KOS, Kontra-obavještajna Služba</i>) showed a <a href="../../../%C5%A1/p/e/%C5%A0pegelj_Tapes_e0e6.html" title="Špegelj Tapes">video of a secret meeting</a> between Croatian Defence Minister Martin Špegelj and two men. Špegelj announced that they were at war with the army and gave instructions about arms smuggling as well as methods of dealing with the Yugoslav Army's officers stationed in Croatian cities.</p>
<p>In March 1990, during the demonstrations in <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split.html" title="Split">Split</a> (Croatia), a young Yugoslav Army conscript was strangled on the tank, after driving around demonstrators.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Also guns were fired from army bases through Croatia. Elsewhere, tensions were running high.</p>
<p>In the same month, the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_People%27s_Army_55be.html" title="Yugoslav People's Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (<i>Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, JNA</i>) met with the Yugoslav Presidency Council in an attempt to convince them to declare a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_emergency.html" title="State of emergency">state of emergency</a> which would allow for the army to take control of the country. The representatives of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_and_Metohija_3b61.html" title="Kosovo and Metohija">Kosovo and Metohija</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> voted for the proposition, while all other republics, Croatia (<a href="../../../s/t/j/Stjepan_Mesi%C4%87_7a82.html" title="Stjepan Mesić">Stipe Mesić</a>), Slovenia (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Janez_Drnov%C5%A1ek_e6dc.html" title="Janez Drnovšek">Janez Drnovšek</a>), Macedonia (<a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasil_Tupurkovski_4e12.html" title="Vasil Tupurkovski">Vasil Tupurkovski</a>) and Bosnia and Hercegovina (Bogić Bogićević), voted against. The tie delayed an escalation of conflicts, but not for long.</p>
<p>Following the first multi-party election results, the republics of Slovenia and Croatia proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederation.html" title="Confederation">confederation</a> of six republics in the autumn of 1990, however <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87.html" title="Milošević">Milošević</a> rejected all such proposals, arguing that like Slovenians and Croats, the Serbs should also have a right to self-determination.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> demonstrations were held against Slobodan Milošević in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, but the police and the military were deployed in the streets to restore order, killing two people. In late March 1991, the <a href="../../../p/l/i/Plitvice_Lakes_incident_38b5.html" title="Plitvice Lakes incident">Plitvice Lakes incident</a> was one of the first sparks of open war in Croatia. The <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_People%27s_Army_55be.html" title="Yugoslav People's Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA), whose superior officers were predominantly of Serbian ethnicity, maintained an impression of being neutral, but as time went on, they got more and more involved in the state politics.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Slovenia and Croatia became the first republics to declare <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> from Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, Slovenian Teritorial defence (<i>Teritorialna obramba</i>, a paramilitary organization established by the constitution of 1974) seized the Yugoslav border posts with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, taking down the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_27ec.html" title="Flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Yugoslav</a> and raising the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Slovenia_70a2.html" title="Flag of Slovenia">Slovenian flag</a>. The following day (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a>), the Federal Executive Council specifically ordered the army to take control of the internationally recognized borders.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_People%27s_Army_55be.html" title="Yugoslav People's Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> forces, based in barracks in Slovenia and Croatia, attempted to carry out the task within next 48 hours. However, due to the misinformation given to the their own conscripts, and the fact that the majority of them did not wish to engage in a war on their home soil, the Slovenian Territorial Defence forces retook most of the posts within several days with only minimal loss of life on both sides. There was an incident of a suspected war crime near Holmec, as the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> <a href="../../../o/r/f/ORF_%28broadcaster%29_7f8d.html" title="ORF (broadcaster)">ORF TV station</a> showed <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten-Day_War_40e2.html#Holmec_Incident" title="Ten-Day War">footage</a> of three Yugoslav Army soldiers surrendering to the Territorial Defence, before gunfire was heard and the troops were seen falling down. However, none were killed in the incident. Ceasefire was agreed upon. According to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brioni_Agreement_87c0.html" title="Brioni Agreement">Brioni Agreement</a>, recognized by representatives of all republics, the international community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month moratorium on their independence. During these three months, the Yugoslav Army completed its pull-out from Slovenia, but in Croatia, a bloody <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Croatia_c297.html" title="War in Croatia">war</a> broke out in the autumn of 1991. Ethnic <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>, who had created their own state <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina_3cf3.html" title="Republic of Serbian Krajina">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a> in heavily Serb-populated regions resisted the forces of the Republic of Croatia who were trying to bring that breakaway region back under Croatian jurisdiction. In some places, the Yugoslav Army acted as a buffer zone, in others it was aiding Serbs in their confrontation with the new Croatian army and their police force.</p>

<p>In September 1991, the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> also declared independence, becoming the only former republic to gain sovereignty without resistance from the Belgrade-based Yugoslav authorities and Army. Five hundred U.S. soldiers were then deployed under the U.N. banner to monitor Macedonia's northern borders with the Republic of Serbia, Yugoslavia. Macedonia's first president, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiro_Gligorov_1edf.html" title="Kiro Gligorov">Kiro Gligorov</a>, maintained good relations with Belgrade and the other former republics and there have to date been no problems between Macedonian and Serbian border police, even though small pockets of Kosovo and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre%C5%A1evo.html" title="Preševo">Preševo</a> valley complete the northern reaches of the historical region known as Macedonia, which would otherwise create a border dispute (see also <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization_549c.html" title="Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization">IMORO</a>).</p>
<p>As a result of the conflict, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Security_Council_459a.html" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 721 on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, which paved the way to the establishment of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacekeeping.html" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> operations in Yugoslavia.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> in November 1991, the Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of staying in a common state with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> the Bosnian Serb assembly proclaimed a separate "Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina". The referendum and creation of SARs were proclaimed <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutionality.html" title="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a> by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and declared illegal and invalid. However, in February-March 1992 the government held a national referendum on Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the BiH and Federal constitution by the federal Constitution court and the newly established Bosnian Serb government; it was largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. The turnout was somewhere between 64-67% and 98% of the voters voted for independence. It was unclear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The republic's government declared its independence on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">5 April</a>, and the Serbs immediately declared the independence of Republika Srpska.

<p>Milošević's rejection of claims of a first-round opposition victory in new elections for the Federal presidency in September 2000 led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on October 5 and the collapse of the regime's authority. The opposition's candidate, <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojislav_Ko%C5%A1tunica_ce17.html" title="Vojislav Koštunica">Vojislav Koštunica</a> took office as Yugoslav president on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">October 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>.

On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a> he was driven to the Yugoslav-Bosnian border where shortly after he was placed in the custody of <a href="../../../s/f/o/SFOR_51b7.html" title="SFOR">SFOR</a> officials, soon to be extradited to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_Former_Yugoslavia_9b11.html" title="International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a>.

<p>Tito’s Yugoslavia was characterised by constant reforms which failed to resolve key national problems. Moreover, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_system.html" title="Federal system">federal system</a>, due to increasing national tensions, and the communist party’s wish to support "national self determination" began to loosen its control. This resulted in the creation of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, an autonomous region of Serbia, legislated by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_a697.html" title="Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">1974 constitution</a>. This constitution broke down powers between the capital and the newly created autonomous regions in <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> (an area of Yugoslavia with a large number of ethnic minorities) and Kosovo (with a large <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanian</a> population). This not only exacerbated Serbian fears of a "weak Serbia, for a strong Yugoslavia" but also hit at the heart of Serbian national sentiment. A majority of Serbs see Kosovo as the "cradle of the nation," and would not accept the possibility of losing it to the majority Albanian population. Albanians were especially feared because they were both <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> and non-<a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slavs</a>.</p>
<p>Kosovo's special significance was due to the defeat of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Lazar_4445.html" title="Prince Lazar">Prince Lazar</a>, the last <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Serbia_38ff.html" title="King of Serbia">King of Serbia</a>. It was said that he was betrayed at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kosovo_Polje_428a.html" title="Battle of Kosovo Polje">Battle of Kosovo Polje</a> against the invading Ottoman Turks. The devastating defeat was the end of the Serbian kingdom and the beginning of 400 years of subjugation under the Ottomans. However, the first records of the battle weren’t created till 100 years after the battle, and then in the form of a poem. The romantic spin given to this episode of history contributed to the sacred and hallowed nature of the region of Kosovo. The significance of Kosovo in the Serbian mindset was so strong that Serbian children were christened as “little avengers of Kosovo.” This emotional attachment to Kosovo was a major reason for the Kosovo War that broke out in 1999.</p>
<p>This loosened version of the federation, essentially made Yugoslavia a de facto <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederation.html" title="Confederation">confederacy</a>, placing pressure upon the legitimacy of the regime and engendered resentment in the richer republics. Slovenia and Croatia, the most developed republics were continually frustrated by their inability to further lift their standard of living as they had to <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidize.html" title="Subsidize">subsidize</a> the development of the poor republics in what they described as an "economic black hole." It highlighted the vast differences in the quality of life in the different republics. Tito’s death created further problems, in an effort to ensure his legacy, Tito’s 1974 constitution established a system of year long presidencies, on a rotation basis out of the eight leaders of the republics. Such short terms were highly ineffective. Essentially it left a power vacuum which was left open for most of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, with only <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a> taking the reigns in 1987.</p>

<p>Along with internal structural problems, Yugoslavia was further undermined by economic factors. Yugoslavia’s <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Aligned_Movement_59a4.html" title="Non-Aligned Movement">non-aligned</a> stance had resulted in access to loans from both <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> blocs. This contact with the West opened up Yugoslavia’s markets sooner than the rest of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Europe_1cd5.html" title="Central Europe">Central</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_oil_crisis.html" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> coupled with Western trade barriers, dramatically hindered her thirty years of breakneck economic growth. In order to maintain this, Yugoslavia took on a number of <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Monetary_Fund_2655.html" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) loans and subsequently fell into heavy IMF debt. As a condition of receiving loans, the IMF demands certain "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_liberalism.html" title="Market liberalism">liberalisation</a>" of a country’s market place. During this time Yugoslavia incurred $19.9 billion in foreign debt by 1981. This problem was compounded by the general "unproductiveness of the South," which not only added to Yugoslavia’s economic woes, but also irritated Slovenia and Croatia further. However of real concern was the unemployment rate, at 1 million by 1980. The recession lowered the number of consumer products available, which had always been higher in Yugoslavia than in other socialist states. It illustrated to the general public the incompetence of the communist party to run the system. A decade of tightening belts resulted in growing frustration and resentment against the both Serbian ‘ruling class,’ and the minorities who were seen to benefit from government legislation.</p>

<p>Yugoslavia was a unique state, straddling both the East and West. Moreover, Tito was fundamental maker of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_world.html" title="Third world">third world</a> or "<a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_of_77.html" title="Group of 77">group of 77</a>" which acted as an alternative to the superpowers.

The external status quo, which the Communist Party had depended upon to remain viable was beginning to disappear. Furthermore, the failure of socialism all over Central and Eastern Europe once again brought Yugoslavia’s inner contradictions, inefficiencies and ethno-religious tensions to the surface.</p>

<p>The perceived disadvantage on the part of the Slovenes and Croatians, the inefficacies of the state, and the "disproportionate" majority of Serbs in the state apparatus allowed nationalist leaders such as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tudjman_0e33.html" title="Franjo Tudjman">Franjo Tudjman</a> of Croatia to whip up nationalistic sentiment in order to demand independence. Tudjman’s reinstatement of the Checkerboard as the symbol of Croat independence ignited fears of a return to the fascist <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia_during_World_War_II_2747.html" title="Croatia during World War II">World War II-era</a> <a href="../../../u/s/t/Usta%C5%A1e.html" title="Ustaše">Ustaše</a> state, which was compounded further by circulation of a new currency also named after its Ustaše counterpart. Tudjman’s government-controlled press portrayed the Serb population within Croatia as subversive and imperialistic.</p>
<p>Slobodan Milošević was a master demagogue. In 1989, the 600th anniversary of Serbia’s historic defeat at Kosovo Polje, Milošević gave a highly provocative speech to one million Serbs, which made reference to the nation's great historic past. Milošević’s answer to the incompetence of the federal system was to centralize the government. Considering Slovenia and were looking farther ahead to independence, this was considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>At the Yugoslav conference in late 1989 talks broke down. The leaders could not come to an agreement on how to deal with the rotating presidency. Moreover many members were no longer willing to rescue what they saw as a sunken ship. <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten-Day_War_40e2.html" title="Ten-Day War">War</a> soon broke out in Slovenia in 1990. After a week, the Slovenes were victorious and the break up of Yugoslavia had begun.</p>
