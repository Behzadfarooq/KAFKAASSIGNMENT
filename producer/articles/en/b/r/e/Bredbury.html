<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: Roman Occupation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roman Occupation</span></h3>
<p>The Romans surveyed and constructed a road between the forts of <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamucium.html" title="Mamucium">Mamucium</a> (Manchester) and <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardotalia.html" title="Ardotalia">Ardotalia</a> (Melandra Castle at <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamesley.html" title="Gamesley">Gamesley</a>) over this ancient track and this is turn became an 18th-century <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnpike.html" title="Turnpike">turnpike</a> road and the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skegness.html" title="Skegness">Skegness</a> <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trunk_road.html" title="Trunk road">trunk road</a>, the A560.</p>
<p>Some years ago a Roman coin was dug up on the edge of the road between <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury_railway_station.html" title="Bredbury railway station">Bredbury Station</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mark%27s_Church_05b3.html" title="St Mark's Church">St Mark's Church</a>. The coin long antedates any Roman occupation of this part of the country, and may either have been lost when held as a souvenir or have been brought over from the continent in the course of trade.</p>
<p>As with the majority of hills, rivers and other natural features in this area, the names of the River Tame and <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werneth_Low_d308.html" title="Werneth Low">Werneth Low</a> are of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celtic</a> origin. The name Bredbury is <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_language_d46d.html" title="Anglo-Saxon language">Anglo-Saxon</a> and probably dates from the first permanent settlement. Names found in nearby villages suggest that <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Norse</a> invaders found their way into the district, probably during the 10th century.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: Middle Ages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>Bredbury comprised farm land bought by Lord Danton in 1014. There is no mention of Lord Danton's manor, but the 'lord' of Bredbury was the pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thegn.html" title="Thegn">thane</a>, <a href="../../../w/u/l/Wulfric.html" title="Wulfric">Wulfric</a>. It is likely that <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>'s army, on its march from <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> to subdue the rebellion at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester.html" title="Chester">Chester</a>, followed the main highway. Virtually all the townships on the way were systematically looted, part of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrying_of_the_North_073d.html" title="Harrying of the North">Harrying of the North</a>. Bredbury seems to have been an exception, for reasons which are not clear, but the army apparently crossed the hill into <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romiley.html" title="Romiley">Romiley</a>, which although not on the direct route, is duly described as 'waste' in the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domesday_Book_b82d.html" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086. Bredbury itself was mentioned briefly in the Domesday Book as being several hundred acres of land. The only occupants listed were duck and a sheep. Its value was placed at three pounds.</p>
<p>Bredbury passed from the hands of Sir Richard de Vernon to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masci.html" title="Masci">Mascis</a> of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunham.html" title="Dunham">Dunham</a>, under whom it was held by the Fitz-Waltheofs of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockport.html" title="Stockport">Stockport</a>. A <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter.html" title="Charter">charter</a> granted by the third Hamon de Masci, lord of Dunham, who died about the end of the reign of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_England_14d6.html" title="John of England">King John</a>, confirms the ownership of lands in Bredbury to the Fitz-Waltheofs, and is of special interest because it affords an insight into the working of the <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal_system.html" title="Feudal system">feudal system</a> of the period. A translation of the charter runs as follows:</p>
<p>"And I, Hamo, regrant to Robert, the son of Waltheof, Bredbury and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brinnington.html" title="Brinnington">Brinnington</a>, with their appurtenances, as his inheritance, to him and his heirs, to hold of me and my heirs, by the service of carrying my bed, my arms or my clothing, whenever the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Chester_2397.html" title="Earl of Chester">Earl of Chester</a> in his own proper person shall go to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. And I, Hamo, will fully furnish Robert, the sone of Waltheof, and his heirs, with a sumpter beast and a man and a sack, and we will find estovers (sufficient food) whilst he is with us in the field, until he shall be returned, to the said Robert or his heirs. And Robert, the son of Waltheof, shall pay to ransom my body from captivity and detention, and to make my eldest son a knight, and to give my eldest daughter a marriage portion, in consideration of which Robert has given me a gold ring."</p>
<p>The conditions laid down in this charter were usual under the feudal system, when military expediations into Wales were no uncommon tasks for the Earl of Chester and his underlords.</p>
<p>By a general inquisition of tenures, taken 10 May 1288, to determine the services due to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Wars_58af.html" title="Welsh Wars">Welsh Wars</a>, it was found that "Richard de Stokeport holds Bredbury of Hamo de Masci" and "makes service to our Lord the King with one uncaparisoned horse".</p>
<p>Some time during the 14th century the manor of Bredbury was sub-divided into two portions, the larger of which was held by the Bredburys, and passed from them, by marriage with an heiress, to the Ardernes. The remaining portion ultimately came into the possession of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport.html" title="Davenport">Davenports</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henbury%2C_Cheshire_429a.html" title="Henbury, Cheshire">Henbury</a>.</p>
<p>It would appear, however, that the manor of Bredbury was still held by the Stokeports, for in the inquisition post mortem of Isabel, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard de Stokeport, taken in 1370, it was found that the manor of Bredbury, with its appurtenances, was held from Roger Lestrange, lord of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunham_Massey_49d1.html" title="Dunham Massey">Dunham Massey</a>, by knight's service, and that it was worth 100 shillings per annum.</p>
<p>In the same year, another inquisition was taken on the death of Hugh de Davenport, which records that he died "seised of two parts of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manorialism.html" title="Manorialism">manor</a> of Bredbury, and of land in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romiley.html" title="Romiley">Romiley</a> and Werneth" and that Thomas de Davenport was his son and heir, aged 12 years. These lands remained in the possession of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport.html" title="Davenport">Davenports</a> for several generations The manor house of the Davenports in Bredbury was Goyt Hall on the banks of the River Goyt.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages the wealth of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> arose largely from the export of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wool.html" title="Wool">wool</a> to the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and the district had no share in this prosperity. By <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_period.html" title="Tudor period">Tudor</a> times, however, conditions had changed. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">Continental</a> trade had been ruined by the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_War_of_Independence_3dfd.html" title="Dutch War of Independence">Dutch War of Independence</a> and home production of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloth.html" title="Cloth">cloth</a> was encouraged. By this time too, the <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf.html" title="Wolf">wolves</a> of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longdendale.html" title="Longdendale">Longdendale</a> had been exterminated. Great <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flock.html" title="Flock">flocks</a> of sheep grazed on the moors and hillsides of the district, sheep farmers and <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weaving.html" title="Weaving">weavers</a> prospered, and established families such as the Ardernes and, at nearby Marple, the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bradshaw_%28judge%29_1626.html" title="John Bradshaw (judge)">Bradshaws</a> became wealthy and influential. The local industries based on thesheep farming, in the absence of ready <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_wheel.html" title="Water wheel">water power</a>, remained <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home.html" title="Home">domestic</a> - mainly <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loom.html" title="Loom">handloom</a> weaving and the making of <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felt_hats.html" title="Felt hats">felt hats</a>.</p>

<p>A schedule of owners of lands in the township shows that two lords of the manor in 1661 were Sir Fulke Lucy of Henbury and John Arderne, and that in 1672 Sir John Arderne owned Arden Hall, whilst Sir Fulke Lucy owned Goyt Hall. Shortly after this date the Davenports' portion of the manor of Bredbury appears to have been purchased by Sir John Arderne of Arden Hall, who thus acquired the whole manor.</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the 19th century, a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_Baron_c23e.html" title="Court Baron">Court Baron</a> was held for the lordship under the title of the Court of the Manor of Bredbury cum Goyt.</p>
<p>The main road continued to be of importance, particularly for the transport of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edible_salt.html" title="Edible salt">salt</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, throughout <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times. In the 17th century there were as many as twelve <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forge.html" title="Forge">smithies</a> in Bredbury. Since one <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacksmith.html" title="Blacksmith">smith</a> usually satisfied the needs of any one township, it may be that so great a number of craftsmen was needed to shoe the packhorses which moved in long processions along the important highway.</p>
<p>In 1754, the population of Bredbury is recorded as being 597. The district was until quite late in the 19th century little more than a group of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet_%28place%29.html" title="Hamlet (place)">hamlets</a>, including Barrack Hill, Harrytown and Hatherlow, but the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> brought a number of <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_mill.html" title="Cotton mill">mills</a>, some of which depended on the water power provided by the head-streams of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Mersey_4a48.html" title="River Mersey">River Mersey</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Forest_Canal_1a62.html" title="Peak Forest Canal">Peak Forest Canal</a> along which more <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_mill.html" title="Cotton mill">mills</a> were built.</p>
<p>The days of the great local <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landowner.html" title="Landowner">landowners</a> ended in the early 19th century. William Arden, 2nd Lord Alvanley, succeeded to the Arden <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estates</a> on the death of his uncle, John Arden, in July 1823. He was a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor.html" title="Bachelor">bachelor</a> who had spent a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> life in the circle of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Regent_ff80.html" title="Prince Regent">Prince Regent</a>, building up heavy debts in expectation of his inheritance, and meriting some brief but not unsympathetic appearances in the memoirs of the notorious <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriette_Wilson_76ed.html" title="Harriette Wilson">Harriette Wilson</a>. Within a month of getting the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estates</a> he had sold Underbank Hall in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockport.html" title="Stockport">Stockport</a>, and in 1825 most of the Bredbury lands were sold in lots, realising in three days nearly £154,000. There was a final sale, including the mansion of Arden Hall in 1833. William was succeeded by his brother Richard Arden, on whose death in 1857 the barony became extinct. The long connection of the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arden.html" title="Arden">Arden</a> family had been broken, and for a century or more most of the old manor lands were held by a small number of families, such as the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsfield.html" title="Horsfield">Horsfields</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson.html" title="Hudson">Hudsons</a> and Vaudreys, until it became profitable to sell in turn to the building developers.</p>
<p>At the sale of the Bredbury estate, an area lying along the River Goyt was purchased by a Mr Marsden, who built a weir at Otterspool and planned to use <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_wheel.html" title="Water wheel">water power</a> to develop the valley from there to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Bridge_b8ad.html" title="New Bridge">New Bridge</a> as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_estate.html" title="Industrial estate">industrial estate</a>. However, he failed to secure the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_rights.html" title="Water rights">water rights</a>. and by the time the lengthy litigation was over <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_wheel.html" title="Water wheel">water power</a> had been effectively superseded by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_power.html" title="Steam power">steam</a>.</p>

<p>The construction of the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Forest_Canal_1a62.html" title="Peak Forest Canal">Peak Forest Canal</a> by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Oldknow_f5a7.html" title="Samuel Oldknow">Samuel Oldknow</a>, under the direction of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Outram_4b4d.html" title="Benjamin Outram">Benjamin Outram</a>, opened in sections in the 1790s and 1800s, had a striking effect on the village. On the one hand it provided a water supply and the transport of raw materials, fuel and finished products for the new <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_mill.html" title="Cotton mill">mills</a>. On the other hand it made possible the importing of <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_lime.html" title="Agricultural lime">lime</a> from <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire.html" title="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> for agricultural improvement. The green fields and rich crops of the local farms were remarked upon by visitors, and with easy transport to the growing markets of Manchester and Stockport local agriculture was prosperous in the period following the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> when elsewhere in the country there was rural <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">depression</a>.</p>
<p>The coming of the railways led to further industrial development, a steady growth of population and the fusing of the separate settlements into the village of Bredbury. The first line was the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester%2C_Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Railway_aa07.html" title="Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway">Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway</a> branch from <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_North_railway_station_d1d0.html" title="Hyde North railway station">Hyde Junction</a>, which was opened to <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Central_railway_station_0873.html" title="Hyde Central railway station">Hyde</a> in 1858 and extended to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marple_railway_station.html" title="Marple railway station">Marple</a> on 5 August 1862. The <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockport.html" title="Stockport">Stockport</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodley_railway_station.html" title="Woodley railway station">Woodley Junction</a> line, opened on 12 January 1863, was amalgamated into the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire_Lines_Committee_6a19.html" title="Cheshire Lines Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee</a> on 5 July 1865. The lines from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romiley_railway_station.html" title="Romiley railway station">Romiley Junction</a> to Bredbury Junction and <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashburys_railway_station.html" title="Ashburys railway station">Ashburys</a> were opened on 1 April 1875 and 2 August 1875, respectively, and on the latter date the branch from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brinnington_railway_station.html" title="Brinnington railway station">Brinnington</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reddish.html" title="Reddish">Reddish Junction</a> was opened. On 1 February 1867, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Railway_df7c.html" title="Midland Railway">Midland Railway</a> trains began to run through the village, as part of the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_and_Midland_Railway_Companies%27_Committee_a630.html" title="Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee">Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee</a>, to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Piccadilly_railway_station_0b39.html" title="Manchester Piccadilly railway station">Manchester London Road</a>, at first via <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_North_railway_station_d1d0.html" title="Hyde North railway station">Hyde</a> and later via <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reddish_North_railway_station_2144.html" title="Reddish North railway station">Reddish</a>. The terminus was transferred to <a href="../../../g/-/m/G-Mex_4588.html#History" title="G-Mex">Manchester Central</a> in 1880, trains running via Stockport Tiviot Dale.</p>
<p>There are now few traces of the coal mining that went back to the 17th century at least and in the 19th century was one of the bases of life in the village. The last <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colliery.html" title="Colliery">colliery</a> closed in 1926 and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoil_heap.html" title="Spoil heap">spoil heaps</a> were levelled at Ashton Road and Stockport Road East in the 1960s to make way for new industrial development. Brick-making too was carried on in the village, with Jacksons Brickworks at Ashton Road surviving into the 1970s, and there were several large het works, but the last of these closed in 1958.</p>
<p>Exors of James Mills were manufacturers of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing from a small building employing two men to the large Bredbury <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steelworks.html" title="Steelworks">Steelworks</a> on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In the early part of the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Other products were added from time to time, including <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotter_pin.html" title="Cotter pin">cotters</a> for locomotives and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_stock.html" title="Rolling stock">rolling stock</a>, engineer's keys, <a href="../../../t/a/p/Taper_pin.html" title="Taper pin">taper pins</a>, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_way.html" title="Permanent way">permanent way</a> fastenings, rail <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubricator.html" title="Lubricator">lubricators</a> and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to Britain, and in the 1960s developed free machining steels containing <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tellurium.html" title="Tellurium">tellurium</a> and an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloy</a> replacement steel. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.</p>
<p>The firm of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightbown_Aspinall_d456.html" title="Lightbown Aspinall">Lightbown Aspinall</a> started making wallpaper in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pendleton%2C_Greater_Manchester_f09c.html" title="Pendleton, Greater Manchester">Pendleton</a>, and in 1899, became part of the newly formed Wall Paper Manufacturers. In 1929, the plant was transferred to Brookfield Avenue, where the company produced Crown and Scene wallpapers and Crown Vinyl wall covering, employing 450 people. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.</p>
<p>Pear New Mill was owned by Combined English Mills and were spinners of superfine white <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hosiery.html" title="Hosiery">hosiery</a> <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarn.html" title="Yarn">yarn</a>, employing over 400 people. The building has since been subdivided into industrial units.</p>
<p>William Crosland, an engineer and <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundry.html" title="Foundry">ironfounder</a>, started business in 1855 in an upstairs room at Miller Street in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>. He was later joined by his four sons, and the company moved to Stockport Road West in 1894, manufacturing machines and <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutting_tool.html" title="Cutting tool">cutting tools</a> for the packaging industry and specialised <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_tool.html" title="Machine tool">tooling</a> for the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheet_metal.html" title="Sheet metal">sheet metal</a> trade.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: 20th Century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">20th Century</span></h3>
<p>In the 1930s, and after the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, the growth rate accelerated with the coming of new industries, including engineering, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_industry.html" title="Chemical industry">chemicals</a>, clothing, and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textile.html" title="Textile">textiles</a>, whilst the village became an important residential area on the periphery of the Greater Manchester conurbation. A large bakery was erected on Ashton Road in 1951.</p>
<p>Comprehensive sewerage and sewage disposal services were completed and put into operation in 1938.</p>
<p>In 1948, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tram.html" title="Tram">tramway</a> along the A560 from Stockport to Hyde and beyond was abandoned after less than 50 years use. The section through Bredbury had been opened in August 1901.</p>
<p>After considerable pressure by the Government and the Mersey River Board, the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_District_98a9.html" title="Urban District">Urban District</a> Council agreed in 1966 to a joint scheme with Stockport County Borough, abandoning the <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewage_treatment.html" title="Sewage treatment">treatment works</a> at Welkin Road and the sludge beds at Brinnington, to provide for the rapidly growing population and the additional industry.</p>
<p>Bredbury has since thrown the shackles of the industrial <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_mill.html" title="Cotton mill">mill</a> into the River Goyt, and moved into the 21st Century. 12% of the local businesses are now powered by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_fuel.html" title="Green fuel">green fuel</a>, a scheme developed by the local council to clean the air of Bredbury.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: Local government">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Local government</span></h3>
<p>The Bredbury parish of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> was included in <i>Bredbury and Romiley Local Board</i>, constituted in 1865, and in 1880 the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_parish.html" title="Civil parish">civil parish</a> was amalgamated with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romiley.html" title="Romiley">Romiley</a>. The <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_district.html" title="Urban district">urban district</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury_and_Romiley_6824.html" title="Bredbury and Romiley">Bredbury and Romiley</a> was created in 1894, and was extended to incorporate the former area of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compstall.html" title="Compstall">Compstall</a> <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_district.html" title="Urban district">urban district</a> in 1936.</p>
<p>Until 1953 Bredbury Ward returned twelve councillors to the urban district council, with Romiley Ward returning six and Compstall Ward returning a single member. In that year, Bredbury Ward was divided into Bredbury North and Bredbury South wards, and in 1959, there was a redivision of the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_District_98a9.html" title="Urban District">Urban District</a> into seven wards, with Compstall continuing to return a single councillor, and each of the others electing three. Romiley received three wards and a new <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodley%2C_Greater_Manchester_416a.html" title="Woodley, Greater Manchester">Woodley</a> ward was created out of Bredbury, the first time that the village of Woodley had been officially recognised. The remainder of Bredbury was divided into Bredbury North, Bredbury South and Bredbury West. There were further electoral changes in 1970 when the altered Bredbury North ward was renamed Bredbury Central.</p>
<p>Up to 1958, the urban district formed one electoral division on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> County Council, but in that year it was divided into Bredbury Tame and Bredbury Goyt divisions.</p>
<p>The council offices were in Bredbury Old School on School Brow until 1919, when Bank House on George Lane was acquired and converted for this purpose. There were extensions in 1927, and in 1934 a new council chamber was opened. More substantial extensions were opened in 1962, replacing temporary buildings erected before the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. The site has since been redeveloped for housing. The urban district council's first acquisition of houses was at Vernon View, a terrace of which the construction was delayed by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>, bought on completion in 1922. In the same year the first Council estate was commenced at George Lane.</p>
<p>The council subsequently owned over 2,000 homes, including several schemes for old people's accommodation incorporating welfare features. Of these, Royley Carr on Wild Street, a block of 23 single room flatlets with warden's house, lounge, laundry and guest rooms was opened in 1962. Later a warden scheme for the elderly on land sold by the Council was developed at Highfield Avenue by Help the Aged Housing Association. In 1952, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brinnington.html" title="Brinnington">Brinnington</a> township was transferred to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockport.html" title="Stockport">Stockport</a> <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_borough.html" title="County borough">county borough</a> to enable a large residential <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overspill.html" title="Overspill">overspill</a> estate to be built.</p>
<p>In 1959, the urban district council intervened over <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> City Council's application for a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compulsory_purchase_order.html" title="Compulsory purchase order">compulsory purchase order</a> for the construction of an <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overspill.html" title="Overspill">overspill</a> estate on 60 acres of land at Bredbury Green, offering two other sites in substitution. The confirmed area was reduced to 24 acres. The City Council subsequently completed several relatively small overspill estates, which resulted in more successful imtegration than in some nearby areas. The council was for many years in the forefront of a campaign for the preservation and restoration to full use of the Lower <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Forest_Canal_1a62.html" title="Peak Forest Canal">Peak Forest Canal</a> and the connecting waterways of the Cheshire Ring. The canal reopened in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1974, the urban district was abolished. Its former area was transferred to Greater Manchester to be combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. It formed part of two wards, Bredbury and Romiley, each returning three members. The ward boundaries were subsequently adjusted, and in 2005 the wards were renamed Bredbury and Woodley and Bredbury Green and Romiley.</p>
<p>Although the area had traditionally elected <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> politicians, with occasional victories for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, by 2006 all elected positions were held by the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p>

The first move towards the establishment of a local church and parish, as distict from that of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mary_a04d.html" title="St Mary">St Mary</a>'s in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockport.html" title="Stockport">Stockport</a>, was made in 1846, when an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_in_Council_8212.html" title="Order in Council">Order in Council</a> marked out the boundaries of the "District of St Mark, Bredbury".</p>
<p>It was not long before a site for the church was secured through the generosity of John Sidebotham of Kingston in <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde%2C_Greater_Manchester_062b.html" title="Hyde, Greater Manchester">Hyde</a>, and in 1847 the foundation stone of the new church was laid by the donor of the site. The church was consecrated on 17 January 1849, and the church school was opened in 1850.</p>
<p>Built of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestone.html" title="Freestone">freestone</a> in the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_English_Period_3465.html" title="Early English Period">Early English</a> style, the church consists of a square tower having four pinnacles, a nave and aisles, and a chancel with a vestry on the north side. The tower is 70 feet high, occupying a commanding position, a contains a clock and a peal of bells. The windows consist of two lights each, the chancel window of three lights being filled with painted glass illustrating the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifiction.html" title="Crucifiction">Crucifiction</a>, erected by William Collier Vaudrey in 1875, to the memory of his wife and her sister.</p>
<p>The Church School (now rebuilt), is on the opposite side of Redhouse Lane.</p>

<p>In 1942 Bredbury Hall, with its 11 acres of land, was purchased by the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Chester_5474.html" title="Diocese of Chester">Diocese of Chester</a> to be used as a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_Church_e538.html" title="Mission Church">Mission Church</a> and social centre for Lower Bredbury.

<p>Hatherlow Church traces its history back to 1645, services then being held in Chadkirk Chapel, and it was the oldest <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregational</a> body in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>. The first independent minister at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadkirk.html" title="Chadkirk">Chadkirk</a> was Gamallel Jones, who settled there in 1688 or 1689. In the latter year the "Meeting Place" at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadkirk.html" title="Chadkirk">Chadkirk</a> was certified as a licensed place for religious worship shortly after the passing of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Toleration_9689.html" title="Act of Toleration">Toleration Act</a>. When they were finally ejected in the reign of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a>, a new building was erected in 1706 on the site now occupied by Hatherlow Sunday School.</p>
<p>It is recorded in a statistical table of the dissenting chapels in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, begun about 1715, that the congregation at Hatherlow numbered about 300 hearers, including 10 gentlemen, 39 tradesmen, 26 yeomen and 8 labourers. These would be drawn from a very wide area.</p>
<p>The present church was opened as Hatherlow Congregational Church in 1845, although the burial ground surrounding it goes back to 1793. A <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_school.html" title="Day school">day school</a> was established in 1780 at Bredbury Old School on School Brow, and the building known as Top School on Gorsey Brow, now partially demolished, was built in 1830 as an overflow. The <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_school.html" title="Day school">day school</a> continued until it was succeeded by the Council school at Barrack Hill in 1909.</p>
<p>Hatherlow Sunday School was established in May 1817, and was held first at School Brow and then at the Top School. The present Sunday School was built in 1911.</p>
<p>The church has always been the centre of cultural activity in the district, and was the home of the former Bredbury Amicable Subscription Library, founded in 1822, and later of Hatherlow Botanical Society.</p>

Arden Hall, (Aiken, 1795)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most famous of the halls of Bredbury, Arden Hall, erected in 1597, is now a ruin standing in a commanding position above the valley of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Tame%2C_Greater_Manchester_c4b0.html" title="River Tame, Greater Manchester">River Tame</a>. For over two centuries it was owned by the Ardernes, who had other possessions in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and were a junior branch of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Arden_5d7c.html" title="Mary Arden">Arden</a> family of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, of whom <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s mother was a member.</p>
<p>The building was at one time "a tall building, narrow in proportion to its height and length, built of flat stones or parpoints, and having a sturdy watchtower at the back, looking over the valley of the River Tame. It was surrounded by a wide and deep moat. On the front were three gables, two of them projecting from the face of the hall, the third being flush with it. The entrance doorway was in the side of the central gable, and was approached from the courtyard by a flight of steps. Passing through the doorway a heavy oak door on the right side opened at once into the Great Hall, and in the tower exactly opposite was a wide oak staircase, which led to the upper part of the house. The Great Hall occupied the whole of the ground floor of this portion of the building, and was about 33 feet long by 24 feet wide. At the end was a raised platform where the high table was situated, lighted by two loft bay windows, one at each end. The year in which some portion of the hall, if indeed not the whole of it, was erected, is fixed from the date 1597 on the spout above the entrance, and the initials and date R A 1597 on the right hand gable."</p>
<p>In the particulars of sale of 1825, it states that "the ancient mansion house of Arden Hall has been in part converted into a commodious farm house, with every requisite convenience", and it had already been let as such.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> stayed at the hall and that there was a skirmish nearby between <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers_%28royalists%29.html" title="Cavaliers (royalists)">Cavaliers</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundheads.html" title="Roundheads">Roundheads</a>, but there is no firm evidence, although the access to the hall is called Battle Lane. However, Ralph Arderne, like most other local gentry, espoused the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliamentarian</a> cause, and saw action in several engagements.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: Bredbury Hall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bredbury Hall</span></h3>
<p>Bredbury Hall, approached from Dark Lane, has been so altered as to have lost every vestige of its former appearance. it was probably built upon the site of a former homestead, as some branch of the Bredburys is supposed to have settled here in early times.</p>
<p>In 1638, the hall was occupied by a branch of the Davenports, a connection of the Bredburys. In later times, the venerable building degenerated into an ordinary farmstead.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, it was rebuilt, and converted into a fine family residence in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_architecture.html" title="Georgian architecture">Georgian</a> style.</p>
<p>For some years prior to the erection of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Barnabas_ba3d.html" title="St Barnabas">St Barnabas</a> Church, services were held here. The hall, outbuildings and grounds are now used as a hotel and country club, and the buildings have been much modified to suit that purpose.</p>
<p>The great barn, 42 yards long of cruck framed construction, is medieval in origin although the original framing timbers have been overlaid by brick.</p>
<p>Now owned by the Flood family, Bredbury Hall is now a recognised Hotel and Country Club with an array of famous faces entering the doors every week from Worldwide darts personalities to the elite from the snooker world.</p>
<p>The great barn is now renovated into a large nightclub which has 6 bars, 2 floors, pool, darts and a large dance floor.</p>
<p>Bredbury Hall is now known as a popular hotel, and many of its stories are now lost or just unknown. It is however said that the ghosts of the old manor that stood here previously still roam the hallways at night, and there have been many sightings and hearings of this.</p>

<p>The original library on George Lane opened in 1937, and the capacity was doubled by extensions in 1962, comprising a children's room and reference room.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury.html" title="Edit section: Bredbury Old School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bredbury Old School</span></h3>
<p>Erected at School Brow in 1780 by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Arden_8447.html" title="John Arden">John Arden</a>, Lord of the Manor, and the freeholders of the township of Bredbury, on land enclosed from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commons.html" title="Commons">Common</a> of Barrack Hill, Bredbury Old School was vested in trustees who were to "appoint a proper and sufficient person to be Schoolmaster". The appointee was to enter into a bond with the trustees "in the penal sum of £200 at the least conditioned for the due observance of the several rules and conditions" set out in the trust deed, including that he "shall duly and properly teach and instruct children to read, write and cast accompts and that his wife or some sufficient person to be by him provided shall teach girls to knit and sew".</p>
<p>The building of larger schools and the passing of the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_Act_0dc5.html" title="Education Act">Education Acts</a> rendered the building obsolete, and by an order of the Charity Commissioners in 1889 the trustees, some appointed by the local authority, some co-opted, were instructed to "apply the trust income either in making payments by way of rewards or prizes to children attending public elementary schools in the townships of Bredbury and Romiley for good conduct, regularity in attendance and proficiency during a period of three years next preceding the award, or in the payment of exhibitions tenable at places of higher education." Later changes to the grant system made the second power ineffectual but awards of cash continue to be made to local schoolchildren a few days before Christmas, together with a traditional form of certificate.</p>
<p>The building has, since its closing as a school, been used for a variety of purposes, including use as offices of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bredbury_and_Romiley_6824.html" title="Bredbury and Romiley">Bredbury and Romiley</a> Urban District Council. By the 1950s, it had fallen into serious disrepair. Its re-roofing with asbestos cement sheets and the rendering of the walls modified the external appearance very seriously, but inside the original floors and timbers were still visible. After the repairs it was leased to Romiley Little Theatre as their club-house, and the surrounding land was let as allotments.</p>

<p>Goyt Hall, which stands in the valley of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Goyt_6d64.html" title="River Goyt">River Goyt</a>, midway between Otterspool Bridge and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Bridge_b8ad.html" title="New Bridge">New Bridge</a>, is a picture in black and white, and this not withstanding that the rebuilding of one of the wings has destroyed much of its old architectural effect. It is a half-timbered building erected by Randal Davenport about the year 1570, although William Davenport of Goyt Hall, who appears as witnessing a mortgage, died in 1542.</p>
<p>The marriage of the last of the Davenports to Sir Fulke Lucy in 1664 brought it for a time into the possession of that near kinsman of Sir Thomas Lucy, who features in the story of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s youth.
