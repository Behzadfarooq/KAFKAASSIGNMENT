<p>Stbalbach's hasty claim about lack of veracity of this article is ungrounded. Brexgata University Academy's website indicates that it will offer details about validated historical information on the internet (e.g. in the public domain) as soon as it is legally permitted to do so.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can find no sources, other than the Academy its self, that backs up the claim that this medieval academy ever existed. On the Academy home web site, the history page, was last updated Jan 2003 .. almost 2 YEARS ago .. saying it would release the information soon. I have searched Google, the A9 database and I have a fairly decent background in medieval history. I can find no refrence to this medieval Academy ever existing. Please provide additional source material. Books are fine. Magazine articles are fine. Until then restoring disputed tag. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 00:44, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stbalbach's comments are evidently based on superficial research. They are based on incomplete information, by his using the internet as his sole research tool, while assuming it is a reliable tool (whilst it is known not to be so). Moreover, the history webpage of Brexgata University Academy is one of an informational nature, highlighting a work in progress, stretching over several years, and aimed at the general public (e.g. it is, as of yet, not a documentational one that would be aimed at historians).</p>
<p>As of January 2005, and thanks to a special funding by a partnership with, among others, UNESC0, eight experts will start consolidating the historical findings accumulated during the past 5 years. Also of importance is the fact that at this moment 24 persons and organizations are involved in the intricate process of (mutually) agreeing on the release of the details and the access to a series of source-documents. It is expected that this process be completed by the end of 2005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the source-documents are obviously not in English language, and unless Stbalbach demonstrates that he is a qualified linguist as well, he is unqualified to assess the content of the source-documents (were they to be made available to him at this point in time.) We take this opportunity to indicate to Stbalbach that in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_university.html" title="Medieval university">Medieval university</a> article (of which he apparently is the author), he has omitted to do research on the university that effectively was Bologna's ancestor, namely the one founded in the year 425, in Constantinople, by Theodose II.</p>
<p>Whether in this Wikipedia article (and the related ones) Stbalbach maintains his "dispute" or not, is no longer of relevance to us, for history will demonstrate him to have been incorrrect in this present matter.</p>

<dd>There is no press release anywhere? No general interest magazine article from an impartial reporter? No UNESCO press release? There has to be somthing somewhere from someone besides what is found on the Academy web page.</dd>

<dd>Also your attempt to discredit me personally is interesting. I am just one of many thousands of Wikipedians who edit and watch for factual accuracy. If needed this can be brought up for peer review from a body of Wikipedians to judge. There are people here with Latin backgrounds who can verify, if that is what is needed. You produce your sources, and the Wikipedia community will draw on the resources needed to verify the claim. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 18:44, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that at Wikipedia one needs to have one's sources verified by (one) Wikipedia member(s), without being able to assess whether that member is really qualified to do so. I presume Stbalbach is, but have no certainty.</p>
<p>I would however like to remind Stbalbach that he corrected (on 3 Dec 2004 at 23:11) the first version/entry of our article, the text after his corrections being quoted here:</p>
<p>Leadership school refers to an academy started in 798 by a handful of Carolingian leaders in Aachen.</p>
<p>The academies mission was the "Instruction in the Good Conduct of States" and was designed to teach the children of aristocrats for leadership roles. For unknown reasons the academy disapeared in the 11th century and was lost to history and rediscovered in ancient manuscripts in the 21st century. It has since started again as a new academy called Brexgata University Academy.</p>
<p>My comments are as follows&#160;:</p>
<p>(1) Stbalbach replaced Artois by Aachen. Where did he get this information from&#160;? Stbalbach should know that (a) the school in Aachen is Charlemagne's palace (palatine) school, not the academy, and (2) the palace school was not founded in 798. Issue here is: FALSE INTERPRETATION.</p>
<p>(2) Stbalbach states that the academy's ('academies') was designed to teach the children of aristocrats. Where did he get that information from&#160;? Not from the academy's website obviously. Educated guess then&#160;? Or, where are -his- sources then&#160;? Issue here is: UNGROUNDED ASSUMPTION</p>
<p>(3) Stbalbach refers to manuscripts rediscovered in the 21st century. Where did he get that information from, or did he forget the 20th century&#160;? Issue here is: INCOMPLETENESS.</p>
<p>I concede the information on the academy's website is perhaps 'rudimentary', but clear enough to avoid misinterpretations.</p>
<p>It all boils down to the conclusion that Stbalbach creates his own breach of credibility, and over an issue he wanted to prove the lack of credibility of in the first place.</p>
<p>As to his other questions. Does Stbalbach presume knowledge of Latin suffices to read the source-documents&#160;? Does he presume UNESC0 make press releases for everything&#160;?..</p>
<p>Enough of this time-consuming discussion. The future will prove the past.</p>
