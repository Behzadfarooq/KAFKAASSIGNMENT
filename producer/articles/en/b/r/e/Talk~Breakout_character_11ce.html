<p>Do we have to limit ourselves only to references in which the actual term "breakout character" is used, or can we go with one where it says "X was intended to be the main character of the show, but Y took over it after audiences clamored for more of the character."? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found a source characterizing Spike as a breakout character, and Klinger I'll keep since it refers to his being added as a regular and is consistent with similar (unsourced, I know) info in the main Klinger article (and I'm not really sure how you cite that). But Miss Piggy I have tagged as it is sourced neither here nor in the main article. It sounds like it would have to refer to some interviews with the show's producers, and I can't find it online.</p>
<p>If it is not sourced in a week, I'm parking it here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not sure how to reference it correctly, but the history of Miss Piggy can be seen in the Season 1 DVD set of The Muppet Show. The text commentary points out her appearence (as just another female pig) and points out where her first karate chop was, etc. ColinBlair 21:42, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I see what you mean. I've had things from DVD commentary that I've thought of adding, too.</dd>

<p>I love The Simpsons and The West Wing (and woe be unto the executive who decided the last season of the latter needed to compete with the former), but Homer and Donna? Dan (Homer's voice) is the first person credited. If anything, it would be correct to say that Bart was the breakout character that eventually settled into his current role as non-breakout. And Donna, while originally a minor role, was never dominant in or identified with the series. Again, there's a much stronger case to be made for President Bartlet, who was originally supposed to be an occasional character, but eventually became the best-known character in the show. However, perhaps it would be best to just leave the two Barts out of the article and focus on obvious breakouts like Urkel and The Fonz. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 21:24, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>have</i> tagged that as needing a source, though on the whole I agree with the interpretation. In the Ullman Show shorts and the first episodes, Homer was a much more genuinely paternal character and Castellanata (who comes first in the credits only because they're in alphabetical order) even used a deeper voice. He was originally supposed to be the classic sitcom dad and more of a supporting character. The idea of turning him into a scheming boob/drunken fool came later. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 23:28, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first short, "Good Night" would seem to undermine this assertion. There he is dumb and he is the most-seen character. As I said, calling him a "break-out" is a stretch; Homer was no Urkel or Fonz. And, if I'm not mistaken, the credits are <i>not</i> alphabetical, but in order of characters' age (for the four Simpsons voices), then alphabetical (for the two remaining main voices). Cartwright (Bart, who you argue as being the main character) and Azaria are both credited after Castellaneta (Homer). If Homer was supposed to be a supporting character, there's no way Castellaneta would have first credit. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 23:56, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't directly claim Bart was the main character, although I shouldn't have used "supporting character" (Of course, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Simpson_8936.html" title="Homer Simpson">our own article</a> says "He is, alongside his son, Bart, arguably the show's biggest star and most well known character"). What <i>I</i> recall was that early episodes were built around, or intended to be built around, the Simpson family as a <i>group</i>. No one character was intended to stand out.</dd>

<dd>Of course, Bart did first and dominated the show for a few seasons, then Homer started getting in on the act (to the point that fans began to complain). So he may be sort of a secondary breakout character. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not that some of those changes might not be valid, but they were sweeping enough that I think they should be discussed here.</p>

<li>However you feel about the use of the term "jumping the shark", I don't feel that's sufficient grounds to pull it from the article, not least when that is frequently cited as a reason TV shows jump the shark.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Klinger isn't a breakout character? It's true he wasn't in the movie. But my understanding of the show's history is that he was supposed to be a one-note drag joke but he became a fully fleshed-out character.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may have removed that Snoopy reference because it was to a blog comment. Fine. But it was the only one I could find that described Snoopy as a breakout character. I am trying to keep everything in this article sourced (not perfectly, I admit) so it doesn't get crufty. I would really prefer to have the source even for such "everybody knows this" things as Snoopy. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 22:32, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Mary Jane Watson was introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man as a flighty rival of Gwen Stacy for the affections of Peter Parker. However, Mary Jane's energetic and confident personality drew considerably more reader interest than expected and she evolved into one of the central supporting characters of Spider-Man." I don't believe MJ is a breakout character. There are SO many "others" that have not been noted - why MJ? Only thing I can think of is a Todd fan. Not being a troll. Just don't think she is not a breakout character. She was never featured in her "own" comic. I remember a couple Spider-Man comics which she was featured in but I don't think her name was selling the comic. She is NOT synonymous with Spider-Man. I love her, too. But she's not a breakout character. Not sure about this tilde stuff but i'll try Dathanandstuff 04:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC) dathan</p>
<p>While she's not a breakout character in the strictest sense, her role was expanded because her popularity with the fans. And she has become an important character in the Spider-man Mythos, so for that, I would leave her on the list. 4.235.156.82 17:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
