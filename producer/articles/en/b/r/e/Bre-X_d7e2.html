<p><b>Bre-X Minerals Ltd.</b>, a member of the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bre-X_group_of_companies_faae.html" title="Bre-X group of companies">Bre-X group of companies</a>, was a junior <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> mining company that was once reported to be sitting on an enormous <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> deposit at Busang, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Borneo</a>). Bre-X bought the Busang site in March <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and in October <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> announced significant amounts of gold had been discovered, sending its stock price soaring. Originally a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_stock.html" title="Penny stock">penny stock</a>, its stock price reached a peak at $286.50 (<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_dollar.html" title="Canadian dollar">Canadian dollars</a>) on the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Stock_Exchange_3164.html" title="Toronto Stock Exchange">Toronto Stock Exchange</a> (TSX), with a total capitalization of over $6 billion Canadian dollars.</p>
<p>Busang's gold resource was estimated by Bre-X's independent consulting company, Kilborn Engineering, to be approximately 70 million ounces. Reports of resource estimates of up to 200 million ounces were never made by Bre-X though the property was described as having this potential. Bre-X's gold resource at Busang was a massive <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>. Encouraging gold values were intersected in many drill-holes and the project received a positive technical assessment by Kilborn. Crushed core samples had been falsified by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confidence_trick.html#Well-known_confidence_tricks" title="Confidence trick">salting</a> with gold that has a wide variety of characteristics that had been subjected to mineralogical examination by Bre-X's consultants. The salting of crushed core samples with placer or supergene gold constitutes the most elaborate fraud in the history of mining. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Bre-X collapsed and its shares became worthless in one of the biggest stock scandals in Canadian history, and the biggest mining scandal of all time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bre-X_d7e2.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>David Walsh founded Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 as a subsidiary of Bresea Resources Ltd. The company did not make a significant profit before 1993, when Walsh followed the advice of geologist John Felderhof and bought a property in the middle of a jungle near Busang River in <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Borneo</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Project manager, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Filipino</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">geologist</a> Michael de Guzman's first estimate of the site was approximately 2 million ounces.</p>
<p>The estimate of the site's worth increased over time; in 1995 it was 30 million ounces (850 t); in 1996, 60 million (1,700 t); finally, in 1997, 70 million ounces. The <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_price.html" title="Stock price">stock price</a> of Bre-X rose to $280 per share by 1997 (split adjusted) and at its peak it had a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_capitalization.html" title="Market capitalization">market capitalization</a> equal to US$4.4 billion. As the estimated size of the deposit grew, so did the stock price and the hysteria. Junior energy and mining stocks usually flounder and are ignored by the financial establishment, but the immensity of this opportunity was too great for the big players to ignore. In a greedy frenzy the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Stock_Exchange_3164.html" title="Toronto Stock Exchange">Toronto Stock Exchange</a> listed Bre-X in its premium TSE 300 index, and there was real talk about adding it to the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average_ca80.html" title="Dow Jones Industrial Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>.</p>
<p>Some other mineral companies, including <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placer_Dome_b462.html" title="Placer Dome">Placer Dome</a> organized failed <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeover.html" title="Takeover">takeovers</a>, but the Indonesian government of president <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a> also got involved. Stating that a small company like Bre-X could not exploit the site by itself, the Indonesians suggested that Bre-X share the site with the large Canadian mining firm <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrick_Gold_4ce2.html" title="Barrick Gold">Barrick Gold</a>, in association with Suharto's daughter Siti Rukmana. Bre-X hired Suharto's son Sigit Hardjojudanto to handle their side of the affair. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hasan_1ccc.html" title="Bob Hasan">Bob Hasan</a>, another Suharto acquaintance, negotiated a deal whereby Bre-X would have a 45% share, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeport-McMoRan_c99d.html" title="Freeport-McMoRan">Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold</a> would run the mine and Hasan would get a cut as well. Bre-X would have the land rights for 30 years. The deal was announced <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and Freeport-McMoRan began their initial due diligence evaluation of the site.</p>
<p>An interlaboratory test program revealed several months before Bre-X’s boss salter vanished that Busang's 2.9 m crushed core samples contained significantly more gold than corresponding 0.1 m library core samples. The <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_variogram.html" title="Sampling variogram">sampling variogram</a> for Bre-X’s bonanza-grade borehole BSSE198 displayed a much higher degree of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spatial_dependence.html" title="Spatial dependence">spatial dependence</a> than any other borehole. Yet, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analysis_of_variance.html" title="Analysis of variance">analysis of variance</a> proved the intrinsic variance of gold in this borehole with its average grade of 12.3 g/t to be statistically identical to zero, as one would expect with fraudulent gold assays. Meanwhile, Matheronian <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geostatistics.html" title="Geostatistics">geostatistics</a> continued to convert Bre-X’s bogus grades and Busang’s barren rock into a massive phantom gold resource.</p>
<p>The fraud began to unravel rapidly on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> when Filipino Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman died falling from a helicopter in Indonesia. His body was found four days later in the jungle, mostly eaten by animals and identified from <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molar_%28tooth%29.html" title="Molar (tooth)">molars</a> and a <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingerprinting.html" title="Fingerprinting">thumbprint</a>. (On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, however, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a> published a front-page story asking if de Guzman might still be alive; one of his multiple wives claimed to have received a Brazilian money order from him, dated February 2005.)</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a> the American firm <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeport-McMoRan_c99d.html" title="Freeport-McMoRan">Freeport-McMoRan</a>, a prospective partner in developing Busang, announced that its own due-diligence core samples showed "insignificant amounts of gold". A frenzied sell-off of shares ensued and Suharto postponed signing the mining deal. Bre-X demanded more reviews and commissioned a review of the test drilling. Results were not favorable to them and on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a> Bre-X refused to comment. David Walsh blamed the whole affair on web "ghost writers" who had spread rumors on the Internet and damaged the company's reputation. Canadian gold analyst Egizio Bianchini considered the rumors "preposterous". A third-party independent company, Strathcona Minerals, was brought in to make its own analysis. They published their results on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>: the Busang ore samples had been salted with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_dust.html" title="Gold dust">gold dust</a>. The lab's tests showed that gold in one hole had been shaved off gold jewelry though it has never been proved at what stage this gold had been added to those samples. This gold also occurs in quantities that do not support the actual original assays. Trading in Bre-X was soon suspended on the TSX and the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasdaq.html" title="Nasdaq">Nasdaq</a>, and the company filed for <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> protection. More details eventually emerged: Bre-X's claims that gold occurs at the site were subsequently proven to be true by local miners who successfully mined gold at the site in shafts and adits from the Central Zone. The site had been inspected by many outsiders. Cesar Puspos was the Project Manager.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Bre-X_d7e2.html" title="Edit section: The aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The aftermath</span></h2>
<p>By May, Bre-X faced a number of lawsuits and angry investors who had lost billions. Among the major losers were three Canadian public sector organizations: The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (loss of $45 million), the Quebec Public Sector Pension fund ($70 million), and the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Teachers_Pension_Plan_afa1.html" title="Ontario Teachers Pension Plan">Ontario Teachers Pension Plan</a> ($100 million). There was fallout in the Canadian financial sector also; the fraud proved a major embarrassment for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Munk_0345.html" title="Peter Munk">Peter Munk</a>, the head of Barrick Gold, as well as for the then head of the Toronto Stock Exchange (resulting in his ousting by 1999), and began a tumultuous realignment of the Canadian stock exchanges whose effects are still being felt.</p>
<p>Walsh moved to the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahamas.html" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and died there of an apparent <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, still protesting his innocence; Felderhof, Bre-X's Vice-President, Exploration had a residence in the <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayman_Islands_08a3.html" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> the <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> (Canadian federal police) announced it was ending its investigation without laying criminal charges against anyone. Critics charged that the RCMP was underfunded and understaffed to handle complex criminal fraud cases, and also charged that Canadian laws in this area were inadequate. However, despite the dropping of criminal charges, civil <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_action.html" title="Class action">class action</a> suits against Bre-X directors, advising financial firms and Kilborn continued.</p>
<p>Bre-X finally went <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a> in 2002 although some of its subsidiaries like <i>Bro-X</i> continued until 2003.</p>
<p>Felderhof divides his time between Indonesia and Australia. Reports that he lives in the Cayman Islands have been inaccurate, as is much of the reporting of this saga, for several years. In <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1999.html" title="May 1999">May 1999</a>, the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Securities_Commission_60f6.html" title="Ontario Securities Commission">Ontario Securities Commission</a> charged him with <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insider_trading.html" title="Insider trading">insider trading</a>. Curiously, no other member of Bre-X's board of directors, or others associated with the Busang project, were charged by the OSC. The OSC admitted that there is no evidence that Felderhof was either involved in the fraud or was aware of the fraud. The trial was suspended in April 2001 when the OSC tried to have presiding judge Justice Peter Hryn removed for alleged bias against the prosecution. This was denied by an independent judge, and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">December 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> the appeal was also denied by a panel of judges.</p>
<p>The trial resumed in 2005. Felderhof attended a number of the Court hearings — but did not testify — as the six-year case made its way through the system. The basis of the OSC action as well as the civil class-action suits is the alleged existence of numerous and obvious "red flags", as detailed by Strathcona, that should have been recognized.</p>
<p>Begun in 2001, the now nearly six-year-long trial of John Felderhof is expected to wrap up in early 2007. Lawyers in the case finished their closing arguments in late <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Ontario Superior Court Justice Peter Hryn is expected to deliver his verdict in <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>.</p>
