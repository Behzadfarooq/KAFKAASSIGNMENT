<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenau_University_1c28.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Brenau was founded in 1878 as a private institution for the education of women. W.C. Wilkes, the institution's first administrator, is credited with building many of the historic buildings that still stand today.</p>
<p>In 1900 H. J. Pearce purchased the institution and renamed it Brenau, a linguistic blend formed from the German word brennen, "to burn," and the Latin aurum, "gold." Its motto is "As Gold Refined by Fire." <b>Brenau College</b> remained privately owned until 1911 when a board of trustees assumed stewardship of the college, as remains the case today. In 1928 Brenau created a female, residential, <a href="../../../c/o/l/College-preparatory.html" title="College-preparatory">college-preparatory</a> school serving grades 9 through 12, and in the late 1960s, Brenau began offering evening and weekend classes to both men and women through what is known today as The Evening And Weekend College.</p>
<p>Brenau <i>College</i> became Brenau <i>University</i> in 1992 by a vote of the Board of Trustees, a name change that reflected the comprehensive programs of study, the diverse student body, new and stricter employment criteria for professors, and the scope of available graduate programs.</p>
<p>In 2002 Brenau's Online College was formed using <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> technology to reach students who because of professional or personal responsibilities are unable to attend classes on campus. Several <a href="../../../b/a/c/Baccalaureate.html" title="Baccalaureate">baccalaureate</a>, master's, and certification programs as well as individual classes are available in this format.</p>
<p>The institution is led by Dr. Ed Schrader, its ninth president, who has held the position since January 2005. Brenau is <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_accreditation.html" title="School accreditation">accredited</a> by the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> and several subject-specific accrediting organizations.</p>

<p><b>The Women's College</b> of Brenau University continues the rich tradition of education for women, serving both residential and commuter students. The mission of the university is reflected in the strong emphasis on the broad-based <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_arts.html" title="Liberal arts">liberal arts</a> education supporting its 30-plus majors, which prepare graduates for their many future roles. The Women's College is recognized for its outstanding instruction in the fine arts and for its programs to develop leadership skills as well as for its comprehensive nationally-recognized <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learning_disabilities.html" title="Learning disabilities">learning disabilities</a> programs.</p>

<p><b>Brenau Academy</b> was formed in 1928 when Pearce told his wife that some of the first-year college students were having trouble with their course work. She began a program to help prepare young women for college which evolved quickly into the Brenau Academy, now the only female, <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_preparatory.html" title="College preparatory">college preparatory</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_school.html" title="Boarding school">residential school</a> for grades nine through 12 in the state of Georgia.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s Brenau began offering evening classes to male students at the junior and senior levels. As the number of evening students grew from 17 in 1969 to 1,466 in fall 2003, the structure of the program evolved and is known today as the <b>Evening and Weekend College</b>. Students earn <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s.html" title="Bachelor's">bachelor's</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degrees.html" title="Master's degrees">master's degrees</a> in teacher education, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_administration.html" title="Business administration">business administration</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">accounting</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursing.html" title="Nursing">nursing</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_administration.html" title="Public administration">public administration</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interior_design.html" title="Interior design">interior design</a>.</p>
<p>The teacher education program also offers an educational specialist degree. Men and women of non-traditional age attend classes after work and on weekends on the main campus and at five off-campus sites throughout Georgia.</p>

<p>In <b>The Online College</b>, the newest unit of Brenau University, college students of all ages can earn degrees via the internet. The mission of the Online College is to serve students who may be working, traveling, disabled, geographically isolated from institutions of higher education, or homebound while caring for children or other family members.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenau_University_1c28.html" title="Edit section: Student population">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Student population</span></h2>
<p>The Women's College continues as the heart of the university with 747 students from 20 states and 13 other countries. Twenty-five percent are from minority groups (not including international students) and 17% are older than 25. Eighty-five percent of the residential students and thirty-seven percent of the entire Women's College campus are members of a sorority.</p>
<p>In the 2002-03 academic year, Online and Evening and Weekend College students totaled 1700, 80% female and 20% male. Minority students make up 32% of this population, and the majority of enrollees are more than 25 years old. The Academy has an enrollment cap of 80 students, and begins each year at capacity.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenau_University_1c28.html" title="Edit section: Athletics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Athletics</span></h3>
<p>Brenau University is a member of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics_af06.html" title="National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) and participates in the Southern States Athletic Conference where its teams play as the "Golden Tigers".</p>
<p>Long neglected in favor of academic programs and fine arts, a new emphasis on developing the athletics department was clear in 2002 when Mike Lochstampfor began his first year as head coach of the Brenau University <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> team. Lochstampfor came to Brenau after serving as the Director of both the Men's and Women's Soccer programs at <a href="../../../o/g/l/Oglethorpe_University_f39d.html" title="Oglethorpe University">Oglethorpe University</a> in Atlanta. In 2004 Brenau's soccer team advanced to the conference tournament for the first time in many years and even received, at one point in the season, regional recognition for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Also in 2002 another boost to campus athletics came when Lila Harste was named head coach of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_country_running.html" title="Cross country running">cross-country</a> team, and in 2004 Brenau's <a href="../../../s/o/f/Softball.html" title="Softball">softball</a> team played their inaugural season. Leading the team was new head coach Devon Thomas, Georgia Athletics Coaches Association "Coach of the Year" in 1999, 2002 and 2004 and North Georgia "All Area Coach of the Year" in 1999, 2002 and 2004.</p>
<p>The 2005-2006 academic year saw a new <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a> team hit the courts with another new member of the University staff, Loren Hauck, as head coach. Brenau further plans to add swimming in 2006, and has already hired Jim Young to coach the team. An intercollegiate <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a> team is slated for a 2007 introduction, and attempts are also under way to move the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew.html" title="Crew">crew</a> team to varsity status.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significant is the hire of Gary Bays as head coach of the new Golden Tigers collegiate <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> team, to be launched in 2006. Former women’s basketball coach for Florida’s <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Southern_College_e77f.html" title="Warner Southern College">Warner Southern College</a>, Bays was named NAIA Region XIV Athletic Director of the Year for 2005, and joined Brenau in October 2005 with plans to put both <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_team.html" title="Varsity team">varsity</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_varsity.html" title="Junior varsity">junior varsity</a> teams on the court in the 2006-2007 academic year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenau_University_1c28.html" title="Edit section: Greek life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Greek life</span></h3>
<p>Greek life at Brenau University has a long and prosperous tradition; established in 1909, it is one of the oldest <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_system.html" title="Greek system">Greek systems</a> in the United States. Brenau is one of only three women's colleges in the United States that has Greek life, and with eight <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorority.html" title="Sorority">sororities</a> active on campus, Brenau has the most chapters. The other women's colleges with Greek systems are <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephens_College_3671.html" title="Stephens College">Stephens College</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia%2C_Missouri_7d5d.html" title="Columbia, Missouri">Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelman_College_b9b8.html" title="Spelman College">Spelman College</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a>.</p>
<p>Of the eight chapters active at Brenau, two are NPHC (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Pan-Hellenic_Council_cc97.html" title="National Pan-Hellenic Council">National Pan-Hellenic Council</a>) and six are NPC (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Panhellenic_Conference_d6b9.html" title="National Panhellenic Conference">National Panhellenic Conference</a>) sororities. For the six NPC chapters "formal recruitment" follows Panhellenic's recruitment guidelines and occurs annually at the beginning of the academic year, while the NPHC or historically African American Greek organizations hold their recruitment separate from the formal process. These sororities follow NPHC recruitment guidelines, with membership intake for <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Kappa_Alpha_e54f.html" title="Alpha Kappa Alpha">Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Sigma_Theta_354b.html" title="Delta Sigma Theta">Delta Sigma Theta</a> at the discretion of the individual organization.</p>
<p>Every woman at Brenau who is a member of a sorority becomes a member of the campus' Greek Council, the governing body over all sororities on campus, both NPC and NPHC. The Greek Council sponsors social and other events throughout the year including the Panhellenic Winter Ball, Greek Week, and Formal Recruitment.</p>

<p>Brenau University Galleries, located on the campus of Brenau University in Gainesville, feature one of the finest university art collections held by an educational institution in the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>Until 1985, when John S. Burd became president of the university, Brenau lacked a designated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery.html" title="Art gallery">art gallery</a>; student and faculty work was displayed in various buildings across the campus. Recognizing the need for a gallery, Burd converted a small chapel outside the balcony of the University's Pearce Auditorium into the “President’s Gallery”. Director of visual arts Mary Jane Taylor became the first gallery director and began expanding the frequency and breadth of art exhibitions on campus throughout the late 1980s. Burd also initiated the creation of Brenau's permanent art collection in 1986. The first important acquisition during this period was a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Still_life.html" title="Still life">still life</a> painted by the American artist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Merritt_Chase_da16.html" title="William Merritt Chase">William Merritt Chase</a>. The collection today consists of over 1,100 pieces and is periodically exhibited on campus.</p>
<p>Highlights include early oil paintings by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir_a0df.html" title="Pierre-Auguste Renoir">Pierre-Auguste Renoir</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne_20f8.html" title="Paul Cézanne">Paul Cézanne</a>; <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watercolors.html" title="Watercolors">watercolors</a> by <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_4886.html" title="Eugène Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>; artifacts from the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Columbian_74eb.html" title="Pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> period of American history; an oil painting by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke; sculptures by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Arp_df45.html" title="Jean Arp">Jean Arp</a>, Maria Artemis, Clyde Connell, and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_King_08cf.html" title="William King">William King</a>; a <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gouache.html" title="Gouache">gouache</a> by Amelia Peláez; and one of the largest collections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prints.html" title="Prints">Printmaking</a> anywhere by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper_Johns_0de3.html" title="Jasper Johns">Jasper Johns</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990 Brenau's <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">neoclassical</a> library building, originally built in 1914, was redesigned to house the Simmons Visual Arts Center. The second art gallery director, Jean Westmacott, was appointed by the university that year and Brenau held its inaugural art exhibition, featuring Jasper Johns's prints from the Leo Castelli Collection, at the Simmons Visual Arts Center in March 1991. This exhibition also launched an outreach program focusing on art education. Gallery tours and hands-on workshops for children have become a regular feature of this educational curriculum. Since the opening of the Simmons Center, the university has hosted a wide range of art exhibits, including the work of Brenau's faculty and students as well as the work of nationally and internationally acclaimed artists. The works of Benny Andrews, <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Buchanan_3289.html" title="Beverly Buchanan">Beverly Buchanan</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamar_Dodd_9a8b.html" title="Lamar Dodd">Lamar Dodd</a>, Nancy Graves, William King, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Lichtenstein_b0b3.html" title="Roy Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>, Marisol, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, Donald Saff, Frank Stella, and Neil Welliver have appeared in the university's galleries. The Brenau galleries have also featured such group exhibitions as the women artists from the Vogel Collection.</p>
<p>In March 2002 the Burd Performing Arts Center opened and gave the university a new home for visual art on campus. The center's gallery is known as the Leo Castelli Gallery, in honor of the New York art dealer and university trustee responsible for several major art acquisitions and exhibitions by the Brenau University Galleries. The gallery's primary function is to house long-term exhibitions of art from the permanent collection of the university.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenau_University_1c28.html" title="Edit section: Pearce Auditorium">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pearce Auditorium</span></h3>
<p>In late 1895, a meeting of the Gainesville, Ga., townspeople discussed the need for a new auditorium. Dr. A.W. Van Hoose and Dr. Haywood Jefferson Pearce, president of Brenau University from 1893-1943, asked the community to lend Brenau $10,000 without interest for five years for the construction of an auditorium. The funds were raised in a short period, and the contract for the construction was signed April 1, 1896.</p>
<p>The auditorium was completed within only a year and dedicated on May 21, 1897, as "the largest of its kind in the South." Nearly 67 years later on March 26, the auditorium was dedicated in honor of Pearce.</p>
<p>In 1978 the building was named to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, along with others on the Brenau campus. Three years later it was closed for renovations, reopening in the spring of 1984. "It's difficult to imagine Brenau University without Pearce Auditorium. In fact, it is hard to imagine Gainesville without Pearce Auditorium," said John W. Jacobs Jr., chairman of the Brenau board of trustees, as he began the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial.html" title="Centennial">centennial</a> observance of the dedication of Pearce Auditorium.</p>
<p>In addition to its wide usage by such local groups as The Arts Council, the Gainesville Theatre Alliance, the Gainesville Ballet, the Gainesville Symphony Orchestra and others, Pearce Auditorium has been the site of many famous speakers. <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Keller_8c40.html" title="Helen Keller">Helen Keller</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Durant_f2f2.html" title="Will Durant">Will Durant</a>, Ted Shawn, Ruth St. Dennis, Martin Luther King Sr., <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letitia_Baldrige_01eb.html" title="Letitia Baldrige">Letitia Baldrige</a>, Robert Peters, Williams Warwick, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Fonda_5ebb.html" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_von_Trapp_5b33.html" title="Maria von Trapp">Maria von Trapp</a> all have spoken or performed in Pearce.

<p>During the 1970’s James and Francis Mathis started collecting artifacts from the early days of those who settled in Northeast Georgia. A number of items were soon displayed at Gainesville’s Home Federal Savings Bank. As others in the community started to express an interest in remembering the past, a nucleus began to be formed with plans to start a museum.</p>
<p>The City of Gainesville made available to the group a vacant fire station building downtown. Volunteers then began collecting objects that would relate to the history of this area. The Georgia Mountain History Museum was underway. School children, tourists, and home-folks were soon attracted to the museum.</p>
<p>By the early 1990’s, it was realized that the future of the museum had to include its own building in a more accessible location. The turning point came in 1995 when Brenau University President John Burd committed a tract of campus property for the History Museum, the White Path Cabin, and a blacksmith shop donated by Hoyt Herrin. Volunteers started soliciting the community for contributions and, after some years of stop and go, architectural plans were finally completed and all stood in readiness for its grand opening, held in May of 2004.</p>

<p><b>Eclectic 89.1 WBCX</b> has a mission to serve Brenau University, Gainesville, NE Atlanta, and North Georgia.</p>
<p>Until the current station manager took over four years ago local programming was minimal at best; featuring no more than a few hours per week originating with students or any other local programming. The station broadcast an "Easy Listening" format that was completely automated.</p>
<p>Today WBCX provides a student and community oriented alternative to commercial radio; supplying listeners with the widest mix of music and diverse programming in the greater North Georgia area. Currently reaching the potential of over a million listeners from downtown Atlanta into areas of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>WBCX changed its name two years ago to Eclectic 89.1 to reflect this new focus on diversity and variety.</p>
<p>The station prides itself in the fact that it can not be tied down to any of the ever-narrowing demographics that commercial radio seeks to capture. This station likewise does not seek to cater only to youth or alternative college culture. They seek to provide quality radio to people of all ages, tastes, races and cultures simultaneously.</p>
<p>Eclectic 89.1 has ten different formats -- each day has a different format with a different focus.</p>
<p>The formats are not based on musical genres (such as rock, jazz or soul), but moods, education, and a sense of quality music that is directly linked to its origins in the Jazz continuim of the 20th century, and the Classical continuim of the past six centuries.</p>
<p>The station seeks to build a sense of community through their passion for quality music. The DJs are all volunteers who pick the music they play based on knowledge and passion rather than that which has been selected by corporations, focus groups, charts or trends.</p>
<p>WBCX caters simultaneously to the rich and poor, the young and old, the rural and the urban, the white and black and Latin and Asian and middle eastern and all other cultures in between.</p>

<p>Firespark! is the 2-week co-educational summer program for students in grade 9 through 12 from all over the world who are gifted in theatre, dance, music, visual art, and mass communications. Student admission is based on essays, recommendations by current educators and auditions when applicable, and classes are led by working arts professionals who also reside on campus during the program.</p>
<p>The programs offered at Firespark! are all goal oriented, with students working towards appearing in performances within their field of study staged before their peers. Students who are visual-arts focused are featured in a gallery showing at the program’s conclusion, while mass media students are heard on Brenau’s WBCX-FM.</p>
