<p>If you mean do I think there should be articles on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldingham.html" title="Coldingham">Coldingham</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldingham_Priory_6c36.html" title="Coldingham Priory">Coldingham Priory</a> seperately, then yeah I do. The first is a village, the second is a religious house ... a whole range of things should keept them separate - besides the fact that Coldingham is a functional modern village ... there are things like categories, lead template (can't have a settlement AND monastery template). I think that maybe, though, Coldingham monastery could be a separate article, but that could be discussed; the Cowan and Easson <i>Medieval Religious Houses of Scotland</i> book - the standard scholarly reference book on the topic - treats them both separately. It is a bit of an anomaly that the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldingham_Priory_6c36.html" title="Coldingham Priory">Coldingham Priory</a> article is atm devoted almost entirely to pre-priory days. BTW, to add to it all, I recently created the article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prior_of_Coldingham_91de.html" title="Prior of Coldingham">Prior of Coldingham</a>.

<dd>The Scoto-Saxon monastery is not the same as the Anglo-French priory, which was no more the same as the former than Melrose Abbey was to the monastery of Old Melrose. And one would never make the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_St_Andrews_8b5f.html" title="Priory of St Andrews">Priory of St Andrews</a> cover the Scottish abbey which lasted into the 13th century. Plus, there is a very important technical difference of status - at least as far as these High Medieval Anglo-Normans were concerned - between an "Abbey" and a "priory". <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 00:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Noticed that you’re an expert on the Douglas family and wondered if you have anything on Sir William Douglas, Lord Douglas. My interest stems from Bricius de Douglas who was Bishop of Moray at the turn of the 13th century. He along with some brothers all occupied high positions at Elgin Cathedral. My query is this: the Registry of Moray says he was a brother of William Douglas, Lord of Douglas, (Reg. Moray, p. 43) but I think this was a mistake and instead of being a brother, he could have been his son. Have you anything either way? Thanks, --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillreid_6116.html" title="User:Billreid">Bill Reid</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillreid_5802.html" title="User talk:Billreid">Talk</a> 20:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many thanks for your very informative reply. Archibald must have been up in Elgin for a family meeting because he is recorded in a charter with Lord Bishop Brice, Hugh his brother, Archibald de Douglas and Freskyn the dean, all as witnesses – <i>Testibus Domino Bricio Moraviensi episcope, Hugone fratre meo, Freskyno decano Moraviensis ecclesie …</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Could you check if Maxwell gives a citation for the second generation of William Hugh and Andrew de Moravia. I can connect William and Hugh with Gilbert and Richard as an extended group of brothers but can’t fit Andrew in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can help you with the Bothwell Morays. Walter de Moravia de Petty, son of Hugone II de Moravia, married Olifard, the heiress of Bothwell c 1250 – 58. Their second son, Andrew de Moravia had a son, the famous Andrew Moray who fell at Stirling Bridge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I may have something on the possible Douglas/Moray tie-up but I need to be more certain. Once again thanks for your help and if I find anything in the Elgin records which I’ll be delving into again next week, I will let you know. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillreid_6116.html" title="User:Billreid">Bill Reid</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillreid_5802.html" title="User talk:Billreid">Talk</a> 14:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you asked what was considered OR in this article. Pretty much the entire beginning of the article, which is unsourced. Unless you have reliable sources on the following, it is pretty much just your own opinion: "Priggish-ness can be viewed as a symptom of Institutionalisation, whether that be in Politics, The Armed Forces or Public School.A Prig is generally a passive-aggressive, instigating fights rather than partaking of them. The Prig is a survivor and will unconsciously attach him/herself to any group that would seem to further his/her prospects.The Prig undertakes all projects with a definite sense of Smugness". --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 01:18, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Brendan. Hope you're keeping well. Nice start to the article, but I'm afraid I can't add much to it. I don't think I've ever been to Dunbar Castle, which is odd when I grew up just up the river (somewhere that used to belong to your ancestors as it happens). Your work on the Good Sir James caught my eye yesterday, and very fine work it is too!

<p>I think you'll have to give a good source for Haddington being a thanage. I cannot find that anywhere. In 1176 in the Taxation Rolls of the Deanery of Lothian it is rated next to Dunbar, which also included Whittingeham. "Hading" in Saxon signifies "ordinatio consecratio" or the giving of Holy Orders, while "tun" signifies indifferently either a dwelling-place or hamlet, a village or a town. Also, females <i>come</i> with a dowry, they're not given one. In Scotland it was usual to have a pre or post-nuptial marriage contract or settlement drawn up which provided the bride-to-be/wife with guaranteed occupation for life, rents and teinds for life, etc., rather than property in their own right.

<dd>Now here I can help! Haddington is listed as a thanage in Alexander Grant, "Thanes and Thanages from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries" (in Alexander Grant &amp; Keith J. Stringer (eds), <i>Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community. Essays presented to G.W.S. Barrow.</i> EUP, 1993. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7486-1110-X</a>). It's named as a thanage in charters of David I (apparently ESC 122 and 134) (Grant, p. 81). Definitely a thanage. Barrow (<i>The Kingdom of the Scots</i>, "Pre-Feudal Scotland: Shires and Thanes", p. 29) concurs: Haddington was a thanage and the original shire of Haddington was a small one, not the later Haddingtonshire/East Lothian, but something comparable to Bonkleshire, Islandshire, the Shire of Yetholm, et al. Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:35, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ha! Well I'll examine that carefully as I have that publication. From my own research I would be inclined to think that in fact Haddingtonshire was <i>bigger</i> than it is now and probably included much of what is now Midlothian, the whole being termed by the English simply as "Lothian".
