<p>David</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>David O' Shea was no stranger to the entertainment industry before he became a member of the band BREEZE, he was a performer in' THE CAT CLUB' of Cork since a very young age, he also had several national television appearances on national television including the popular kids show 'STREAM' on 'THE DEN'.He is one of the main guitar players in the band BREEZE and has also worked on songs such as 'We Will Never See Again'.His music experience also spans outside the group,being on the school choir.He is still at school at the moment,he is attendin an Gaelscoil(an all Irish speaking school) and he is tries to balance his time beteween school-work and the band .His ambition is to be recognised as a professional guitar player in the future and also to take the band to the next level.</p>

<p>Sarah</p>
<p>Sarah is an active member of the band BREEZE and she is the only female of the group. Sarah has always had a keen interest in singing, but she claims however until she joined the band BREEZE she was too unconfident to express he music talent.So far Sarah sang in many of the Breeze songs including 'We Will Never See Again' and her voice has being described as different and soothing.She states that "being the only girl of the group has its advantages beacuse I get noticed more then the other lads".Sarah has clearly a unique talent and her voice is truely amazing.Many oppertunitys has arisen since she has joined the band BREEZE including performing in the popular musical 'Blood Brothers'.Sarah hopes that things with Breeze will reach the top 10 as soon as possible.</p>
