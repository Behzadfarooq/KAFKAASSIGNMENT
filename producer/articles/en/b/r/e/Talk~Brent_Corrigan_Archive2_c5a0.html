<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i>Fuck Me Raw</i></span></h2>
<p>Please correct to show that <i>Fuck Me Raw</i> was released in July, it is not "to be released in September" as the article currently (innacurately) states. Also, <i>Take It Like A Bitch Boy</i> another Corrigan bareback video, will be released on September 1.

<dd>Until now, the <i>Fuck Me Raw</i> DVD is only available in <b>pre-order</b> on the very few online stores that sell it. (To be honest, I have been able to find only one online store that propose that DVD). Even the VOD websites don't propose it. As soon as this title will be available to the public on more websites than Cobra's, the "to be released" note will disappear. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam67fr_f313.html" title="User:Sam67fr">Sam67fr</a> 09:23, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sigh. Some people on this board really seem to thrive on posting demonstrabaly false information and then when someone posts the right information they are accused of being "stalkers, defamers", etc. The facts are that <i>Fuck Me Raw</i> was released 3 weeks ago. It is available for immediate delivery at the producer's website. I ordered my copy in the normal course of business and received it in the mail over a week ago. The title is in such widespread release that it has already hit the secondary market, appearing on Ebay. (I would post auction links but I would undoubtedly be accused of stalking, defamation, promoting a commercial site, copyvio and taking a shot from the grassy noll.) It is also available at other web merchants for immediate delivery. I will gladly provide these links to a moderator upon request-or anyone can easily google the title and the star and find them for themselves.

<p>I am proposing that the grossly inaccurate phrase "to be released in September 2006" be removed from the entry for <i>Fuck Me Raw</i> in the Videography section of the article. Reasons: This video was released on August 1. It has been available for immediate delivery for over 2 weeks on the manufacturer's web site. It is now available-for immediate delivery, <i>not</i> pre-order at other major web sites. It is available for immediate purchase at at least 2 internet auction sites. It is a travesty to pretend that this video will not be released until next month.

<dd>The Redlight Video and Badpuppy Video pages (essentially the identical page) say "Available 8.17.06, preorder today." Obviously, that's today's date, and the page source shows it was written that way, not with date coding. Adult DVD Now says "In Stock!" The others include no date. As a result, I believe "(released August 2006)" would have sufficient sources. The article currently does not include any date (except the year) at all, which also is sufficient. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 17:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Atleast one of the links prominently proclaims that the video is 'in stock'. To me, that's good enough. Whether or not this video is actually currently available is also rather irrelevant, as this issue will resolve itself automatically in a month or so. Let's leave it at this, and look at the rest of the article. There are still a number of things to be sourced, and a little NPOVing to do. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 21:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Updated Picture and Information</span></h2>
<p>I just revised the page with a new picture and a with new information from various sources. The picture is used with permission of Brent Corrigan. An emailed statement of this permission is being sent from him, and should arrive by 8/15/06.</p>
<p>I sourced the additions to the recent GayWebMonkey article about him, which includes more detail about his situation prior to his first porn films, the circumstances around his decisions to do those films, and what happened to him afterwards. Given the strong words on this page, hopefully this sourcing will help prevent another war from erupting.</p>
<p>Additionally, I also added more subheadings to make the article easier to read. I removed the "likes to skateboard" in the introduction as, according to my reading of Corrigan's website, this doesn't appear to be the case. I also removed the "double penetration" reference from the introduction as well. It just didn't seem to be relevant to the entry, as the major points of Corrigan's story is that he was underage when he made the first films and that those films were primarily bareback.</p>
<p>I placed a new, recent picture at the top of the article and moved the DVD cover picture down to the section about his underage porn films. It seems to be more germane that way. The new picture does seem a bit large for the page. I don't know if there is a way to size the picture down a bit.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how to do "ibids" so the GWM article appears several times in the references section.</p>
<p>In the interests of disclosure, I also wrote the GayWebMonkey article. During my interview with him, he provided even more detail about everything that has happened over the past few years. I didn't think that there was a way to source it without it looking like simple partisanship and violating Wiki neutrality.--<a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 07:16, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice work, though it will need to be cleaned up. Statements such as "He believed that at 16 he 'knew everything.'" are quite unfactual. You may not agree with the way Cobra has handled this situation, but the article will have to give them every benefit of the doubt. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 07:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, even with the source, it's still an opinion stated as fact. Something along the lines of "Corrigan stated in an interview that, at 16, he thought he knew everything." is encyclopedic language, as it is completely factual. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 09:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Writing "He believed..." followed by a citation to the interview where he stated this belief is the same thing. The "interview" text is redundant. But I'm arguing over a quibble.

<li>You've got to be kidding Jody W. This listing has now been completely re-written into a biased piece of crap. It will not last. Virtually all reference to what has been fundamental to Corrigan's success (bareback receptive sex in almost -<i>all</i>- his scenes, semen eating and double penetration) has been deleted. It's like and article on Brando that fails to mention that he was an actor. Furthermore, despite Corrigan's claim to be born in 1986, he has refused, for over a year, to produce a birth certificate in the litigation with Cobra. His early films continue to be sold on Ebay and Naughtybids. The bald faced statement that he was born "on October 31, 1986" is totally unproven except out of the mouth of a self-admitted liar.

<li>I have added the words "coupled with his "no holds barred" barred sexual practices (bareback receptive anal sex, semen eating, rimming and receptive double anal penetration)" which provide a glimpse at some of the reasons behind Corrigan's popularity I have also added the word "all" to clarify that Corrigan has performed in nothing but bareback scenes in all his released material, except for his bottoming scenes with Brent Everett. I will, of course, abide by the moderator's opinion on this added material. Sources-all of Cobra's released videos as listed in the videography; brentcorriganxxx.com which features free clips of Corrigan engaging in rimming, bareback receptive anal sex and eating the semen of another model from <i>Fuck Me Raw</i> and the upcoming <i>Take It Like a Bitch Boy</i>;Corrigan's website on his double penetration-<a href="http://www.brentcorriganonline.com/blog/?page_id=5" class="external free" title="http://www.brentcorriganonline.com/blog/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.brentcorriganonline.com/blog/?page_id=5</a></li>

<dd>I moved the list of sexual activities down to the more logical section of "Underage videos," changed the wording to be more NPOV, and linked them to other sections of the Wikipedia. "Eating semen" is part of the definition of "fellatio" and "double penetration" is a bit euphemistic. I changed those parts as well. Lastly, I modified the introduction paragraph so that it now summarizes his sexual activities as being "extreme" and shows that he released documentation to the media about his age. The validity of that documentation is for a court to decide.--<a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 03:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, I find it very repugnant that people are using webmonkey as a "source." Give me an f-ing break. Anyone in the "industry" should be quoted as a potential source but not a reliable one. GAYVN is perhaps the only "respectable" source you're going to find on this article.</p>
<p><br />
This article was very very anti-Cobra and very Pro-Brent. The fact remains that there is considerable debate about whether or not Brent Corrigans actions were a form of entrapment to the producers of Cobra Video and whether or Cobra Videos subsequent actions have harmed Corrigan. I know there are several fans of his work on this site, but your job is to report information neutrally and look at all facts, please don't bolster Corrigan just becuase you all think he's hot.

<dd>Julien, I modified some of your edits. There were several sections that were unsourced so I pulled those.. One of your changes from "Cobra producer" to "Cobra producers" was factually incorrect. That wasn't what the sourced article said. I left in your requests for citations regarding Cobra's emails and the XXX website. I too have heard of it and have seen such things on occasion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I too, can't believe this</span></h2>
<p>This article is laden with bias. I realize that the main point of the article is to talk about Brent Corrigan, but all the edits and reverts that they seem to cause are all based on whether or not ALL of the information is presented in a pro-Corrigan light. Let's get some facts straight.</p>
<p>1) This person appeared in a relatively "new" type of gay pornography (bareback, non-safe porn that featured younger looking guys instead of guys who actually looked like men) 2) The guy who produced the movies has been in trouble for pedophilia before 3) Corrigan has CLAIMED that he was underage when he made a few of his movies (but no independent, oustside VERIFIABLE source can either confirm or deny this) 4) No one seems to know, for sure, WHY he has made this claim but the results have had profound effects on Cobra Video and Corrigan himself 5) The majority of the debate in here is coming from the fact that this revelation has caused a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>Can people at least agree on these propositions? or are even those debateable? --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulien_Deveraux_5c4d.html" title="User:Julien Deveraux">Julien Deveraux</a> 23:35, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Jody- you say that "if he's lied, he's lied. I'm not going to cover for him.". But since he once provided documents stating he was born in 1985 and now provides documents (California driver's licence-you can get one for $50 in Macarthur Park in the name of Mickey Mouse) stating he was born in 1986 there is no "if" as to whether he has lied. He could not have been born in both 1985 <i>and</i> 1986! Ergo, he is a proven liar.<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.9.171.207.html" title="User:68.9.171.207">68.9.171.207</a> 14:19, 22 August 2006 (UTC)Tommy</li>

<p>Where is the link that says they are "illegal" on Ebay? Private organizations do not declare something illegal! I can say <i>Deep Throat</i> is "illegal", have a press conference, etc. That doesn't make selling the video "illegal"! The Corrigan videos have been sold repeatedly on Ebay and other auction sites.

<p>You are right Sam, the problem is that there are several disagreements on "sources" in this article and whether or not they are valid. In particular, there are people who are using an article in a gay porn magazine, which lacks journalistic credential, as "evidence" that claims made by Brent Corrigan are indeed, fact. Meanwhile, Cobra Video, has spoken publically on this topic but only through its email-list-serv which, unless a moderator/admin can tell us how to cite, remains impossible to cite. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulien_Deveraux_5c4d.html" title="User:Julien Deveraux">Julien Deveraux</a> 23:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In line with the [Biographies_of_living_persons|Biographies] section, I pulled the negative statements that weren't sourced ("Criticism should be sourced... Responsibility for justifying controversial claims rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim.") and linked sources that were provided here in the talk section to their appropriate sections (popularity of Corrigan's videos, still for sale on ebay, etc.) It started out as fixing one thing, then morphed into an ongoing series of cleanups and links... I also added the blp tag to the top of the talk page.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversion of 17 biased edits</span></h2>
<p>Just when we had a consensous version of this article along comes ol' Jody with 17 edits in one day to shatter the NPOV and turn it (very temporarily) back into an anti-Cobra spin page. Here is the source for Corrigan consuming semen-<a href="http://www.brentcorriganxxx.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.brentcorriganxxx.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brentcorriganxxx.com/</a> After the age pages click the red "Click Here Exclusive Fuck Me Raw Clip gallery" You will see Corrigan eating another models semen. Jody, you falsely state that Corrigan made 4 Cobra videos. In fact the videography lists 7 already released plus 1 being released this month. Here is one of many source showing California drivers licenses are available day and night in Macarthur Park with any name/birth date you want. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/06/02/state/n100321D11.DTL&amp;type=politics" class="external free" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/06/02/state/n100321D11.DTL&amp;type=politics" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/06/02/state/n100321D11.DTL&amp;type=politics</a> If you want to make edits please make them 1 at a time so that they can be properly researched and moderated. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommypowell_dce8.html" title="User:Tommypowell">Tommypowell</a> 19:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</p>

<dd>Tom, I sourced everything I put up. There was a link back to what external, verifiable source any third party could go an see. I created links to your sources -- something you couldn't or were unwilling to do. The whole "cum eating" et.al, as a measure of his popularity isn't mentioned in anything you list. Jason Sechrest discussing Corrigan's barebacking, the top rated reviews of those first four movies, and the sales figures, <i>in an on-line publication that can be clicked on and verified</i> is a source. Find a source that says Corrigan big gulps of goo is what made those movies successful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, it's those first movies he made -- in the section called "Underage Videos" -- that are the subject of controversy. I've added text to indicate it's the videos those scenes appear in that are in question -- something you could have done but chose not to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding his age, unless you have a linkable source that shows Corrigan is lying -today- about his age, you are speculating. Further, you are opening Wiki up to <strike>liable</strike> libel. Read the Wiki section on biographies of living person. I had the tag at the top of the talk page. You give the benefit of the doubt to party in question unless you have <i>a source to the contrary.</i> Linking to a source where you can buy fake IDs is great -- if you are writing a Wiki article on fake IDs. You are saying that Corrigan is lying today about his age. That's your opinion. What's verifiable is that he states he lied about his age in the past, that Cobra wanted legal documentation provided to their attorney, and that Corrigan responded publicly through a porn columnist. Anything above that is speculation or opinion. The Court is going to weigh in on the final truth of the matter. Not you and not me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anti-Cobra. If you have links to the material Cobra has published, above and beyond what is now in the press, then by all means provide it. You haven't done this. Nor has anyone else. The Wiki biography page says if you can't provide a source, pull it immediately. It's up to the presenter of the negative information of a living person to provide a link to it, not the rest of us to say "Well, it prevents an edit war if we leave that unsourced material in, so be it."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Provide some verifiable sources, Tommy. <a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 20:30, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, not too sure where to put this, so I thought I would put it under the cleanup. One paragraph is stated twice:</p>
<p>Drivers license</p>
<p>"On March 14, 2006, Corrigan showed a California Drivers License, which he stated was his, to columnist Jason Sechrest (of jasoncurious.com) at the GayVN Awards. Sechrest then wrote on his website that he had inspected the driver's license and "...he [Corrigan] was born in 1986."[9]. The legal veracity of Corrigan's age remains a subject of the continuing lawsuits. Outside of Corrigan's actions through Jason Curious, no other physical documentation of his date of birth has been released or viewed by the wider media. News agencies in California have reported on the ease with which fake drivers licenses can be obtained.[5]</p>

<p>Am I to understand from your deletions that I am barred from posting even a one line sentence stating the unusual sexual activities Corrigan engages in on film <i>even if I am making no claim linking them to his popularity</i>? This is like an article on Hendrix which forbids stating that he played the guitar with his teeth unless there is some specific link stating "he was popular because he played with his teeth". But if that is your decision I will have to abide by it. Secondly, if you are barring any mention of Corrigan's sexual practices on film from the article as (your words) "superficial" and that " Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" what pieces of information may I delete from the current article as "superficial" or "indiscriminate collections of information"</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A full paragraph discussing Corrigan's as yet unrealized alleged rationale for moving to San Diego-"When I moved originally, my biggest excuse was I had serious interest in film," said Corrigan. "I wanted to direct and I had a lot of interest in the artistic side of it. I figured if I'm going to do it anywhere, southern California is the fucking place to do it. That was my big lure so I thought I'd come here, do my two years in high school, get residency established then go to UCLA or something of that degree."</li>
<li>2. His alleged abandonment by his unnamed mother.</li>
<li>3. His alleged dating practices in high school-"Brent also stated that, at 16, he met and began dating an older man who introduced him to an unhealthy social scene.</li>
</ul>

<dd>"[My boyfriend] introduced me to a lifestyle that wasn’t very fitting of a 16-year-old. He was nothing but the worst influence on me. But I thought this is what gay people did.

<dd>Tom, providing information about a subject's family, about their own view of their motivations for their choices, and about their self-professed justifications for their actions, is far from being "superficial."

<p>Since I am being barred from even the briefest mention of the things that make Corrigan stand out in the porn universe; double penetration, semen eating, etc. I will, unless specifically barred by a <i>moderator</i> remove trivial items such as who he allegedly dated in the 10th grade or his pie-in the sky pretensions to be a film director. I don't think too many Wikipedia articles concentrate on who the subject dated in the 10th grade, or their teen-age pretensions to careers they never realized or their unrelated views on how communities are "not all into evil and drugs". Jeez-maybe we can hear about his favorite color and sports team.68.9.173.186 13:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</p>

<dl>
<dd>Tommy, since, in his own words, "the 10th grade" is the age when Corrigan got involved with porn, the older boyfriend is the one who had a hand in getting him involved in that porn, and his desire to be in the movies were part of his justification for doing that porn, the information is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/germane" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/germane" rel="nofollow">germane.</a></dd>

<p>His sexual practices on film is what makes him notable, not his alleged 10th grade dating practices, his completely unrealized alleged goal of going to UCLA film school, his alleged problems with his (unnamed) parents, or his less than awe inspiring philosophic thought that "not eveybody is all into evil or drugs". I think you would agree that his videos sell because of his sex scenes; his philosopical musings, 10th grade dating habits and sob stories concerning his childhood have never been published to my knowledge, unless you have a link?

<dd>If there was no controversy around his age then, much like Johan Paulik or Kip Knoll, his family background and general beliefs might not be necessary to his article. Debatable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, given that most of his notoriety is because he was, or states he was, underage at the time of his first videos, then his relationship with himself, his family, peers and lovers, just like the details around age verification documents, lawsuits, or dueling "official" websites, are all on point.</dd>

You have repeatedly deleted that single sentence. Now I am deleting the trivial, superficial and/or indiscriminate collections of information you have added. I don't think there is any doubt that his videos are notable because he is the <i>only</i> (glad to hear any other name you can come up with) twink porn star of this millenium who barebacks bottom and swallows semen and does internal cum shots and rims and accepts double penetration. I am sure you know that these are the reasons his videos sell not his resentments against his parents or his failed ambition to enroll in UCLA film school or his deep (LOL) philosophical wisdom that "not everybody is all into evil and drugs". <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommypowell_dce8.html" title="User:Tommypowell">Tommypowell</a> 13:30, 11 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</p>

<li>I accept what you say Radiokirk, it also follows that, absent any link to the contrary, Corrigan's popularity is not verifiably linked to his grudges against his parents, his dating habits in the 10th grade, his unrealized wish to enter film school or his less than earth-shattering philosophy that "not everybody is all into evil or drugs". If anyone can provide a source linking Corrigan's popularity to these trivialities I would welcome them-LOL. Otherwise, I think it is safe to assume that few, <i>if any</i> of his videos sales buyers are even aware of Corrigan's parental spats, 10th grade dating habits, film school fantasies or truistic philosophical musings. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommypowell_dce8.html" title="User:Tommypowell">Tommypowell</a> 15:51, 11 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</li>

<p>The information in the "Cobra video response" section is already included in the "Dispute over age verification documents" section.

<p>Began process to bring this article more in line with Wiki Project Biography standards, which included adding dates and location to intro paragraph, the appropriate boxes and fields, as well as listing Corrigan with the biography work groups. The info box for pornstars only allows one link to the "official" home page. Since there are two dueling pages, I left it out, but did add the link to the imdb home page.<a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 05:15, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tom, as I'm sure you wanted, I've reverted your changes.</p>
<p>As RadioKirk noted, your cum eating business was removed because you failed to provide any source to make it more than supposition for his "fame" on your part. It wasn't a personal slight against you. Nor was it a reason for you to be vindictive.</p>
<p>I've explained that Corrigan's state of mind is appropriate to a biography article. He states that his "excuse" for moving to LA was that he wanted to be a movie director. It was, again, in his own words, and taken from a <i>verifiable</i> source, part of his rationalization for doing porn. Whether you think that's a valid rationalization for doing porn isn't the point. It's not your bio page. It's his.</p>
<p>His family life also is germane to the topic. The fact that, in his opinion, his mother wasn't there and that he never knew his father, are important to his story. He's mentioned it in two different interviews. It's verifiable. It's not superficial. It stays in.</p>
<p>I've clarified that the boyfriend he met when he was 16 was also the one who got him into porn. You could have pointed out that connection was vague. You, yourself, could have made the connection clearer. How? The references were right there. All you had to do was click on them...</p>
<p>Lastly, once again, in your zeal, you crapped the page formatting. I've lost count of the number of times you've destroyed the html/wiki code on the page. I understand once or twice, but at this point, to me, you don't care about the page being correct but rather only you being right. <a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 14:41, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is any verifiable source which shows that he is famous for his 10th grade dating habits, parental spats, failed film school fantasies or mind numbing philosopy that "not everybody is all into evil or drugs" please provide those links. Otherwise this is just trivial, superficial and indiscriminate collection of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>See Radiokirk above in "Sources" chapter- "That he does it is not the point; it must be demonstrated through a reliable source that those practices are the reason he's "critically top rated and commercially top selling" or the data is superficial. Please see Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. RadioKirk (u|t|c) 14:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)" As you would have the article, the unique on-screen sexual acts of a porn star are non-germane, but his 10th grade dating habits, parental grudges, film school fantasies and bathetic philosophical quotes are!</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as the page formatting, I am a complete novice on this. All I am doing is deleting the text of your suppositions. Again, if you have a "recognized industry expert" that says Corrigan is "famous for" his dating habits in 10th grade, parental spats, film school fantasies, etc. please provide them. Otherwise, this your "supposition, which can be removed at any time".</li>
</ul>
<p>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." This is policy, not a guideline. All the sources in the world stating that someone does something do not necessarily make that person famous for that something—a recognized industry expert has to say so, or it's one editor's supposition, which can be removed at any time.

<dd>Tom, you don't seem to understand. RadioKirk pulled your text because you never provided verification for <i>what you were asserting</i> -- that BC was famous for the acts you mention, or that he rose to fame for those same acts. RadioKirk's statements applied to your claim, because you didn't meet the burden of verifiability Wiki sets forth.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The quotations I inserted, about the reasons why he moved, about the person he dated who got him started, about his relationship with his family, all speak to the reasons <i>why</i> he got involved in the business in the first place. They can be verified by interviews from two different sources. I'm therefore reverting your edit.<a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodyw1_8a65.html" title="User:Jodyw1">Jodyw1</a> 20:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it that's the case I will add a single sentence to the article regarding his on screen porn acts with <i>no</i> claim that they are the cause of his fame. Hopefully this will end the dispute.68.9.173.186 23:27, 11 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</p>

<dd>Reedy, BC has written that most of the double scene was faked. It was a few seconds of footage looped over and over again.

<p>I saw Jody's response. I'm not sure I want to get involved in this article. But I'm really sorry, when I see Users quarreling for minor issues, when they can collaborate to improve the article. I've expressed my opinion and I resume it as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I donot think "semen swallowing" is worth mentionig, since I do not believe this is a particularity of Corrigan. My impression is that other pornstars are doing the same thing. So, why is it worth mentioning?</li>
<li>"Cobra Video's first-ever double anal penetration". This could be worth mentioning if a verifiable source is provided. <b>I donot regard the current citated source as valid and verifiable</b>. It is an <b>unsigned advertisement</b> for commercial reasons. Excuse me, but I donot trust such sources. And, by the way, even in this source, where is the "first-ever double anal penetration" exactly mentioned?</li>
<li>"[Corrigan] dated in the 10th grade or his pie-in the sky pretensions to be a film director". I regard this information, <b>if citated and verified</b>, as important and relevant. This is a biography and such information is useful for the understanding of Corrigan's temperament and choices.</li>
<li>If you can't find a solution, follow instructions from <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a>. But I strongly suggest you reach a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">Consensus decision-making</a>. <b>Don't regard each other as an ennemy. This is the wrong philosophy here. You are both interested in improving the article. You are both there in improving Wikipedia. When an article gets better, everyone wins, and Wikipedia wins; that's what really matters here.</b>--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 07:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

From interview with Brent Everett- "Your double penetration scene with the other Brent is one of the hottest things ever captured on film. What are the odds that you would ever be the recipient of such action in a video? wow thanks man:) as far as the odds of me being the recipient of a double penetration, very low..lol..very very low" <a href="http://www.shareprovider.com/edonkey-cat-27-hitsD.html" class="external free" title="http://www.shareprovider.com/edonkey-cat-27-hitsD.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shareprovider.com/edonkey-cat-27-hitsD.html</a>. In conclusion, a whole lot better sourced than your uncorrobarated, self-serving statements by Corrigan, especially with his own website statement that " Though I wasn’t in complete pain, I was uncomfortable." If you have a link to <i>any</i> other Cobra performer bottoming for a DP in a Cobra video please provide that link. Of course there is none, as you well know. It does seem bizzare that you want to censor a one-line NPOV sentence describing the on-screen sex performance of a <i>porn star</i>. If that is your agenda then go to every page of a gay porn star and censor any mention of their on-screen sexual activities. These are porn stars, not poets or historians. Their on-screen sex acts are their <i>raison d'etre</i>.68.9.173.186 13:24, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Tommy</p>

<dd>Pal, I think you are talking to the wrong person. And yea! The best thing I have to do in Wikipedia is to censor pages. If I wanted to interfere, the easiest I had to do would be to edit, since I am an established user. And you don't answer to most of the points of my statement. If you want to continue revert wars with other users, go on, I don't care! And if you want to keep the article as it is now, keep it! But which are the "uncorrobarated, self-serving statements by Corrigan". Did I provide such statements? To whom are you talking? Are you a bit confused or I'm wrong? Anyway, I'm out of the article. I've better things to do in Wikipedia. My only intention was to help, when a peer-review was asked. If you don't want once other Wikipedians' help and assessments, I don't want twice to help. Especially, when I have to do with persons, who don't understand other people's statements and intentions. Go on as you wish! Your problem!

<p>Stop creating trouble. Youtube links are not being used as a "source" but as additional clips on the subject; much like a list of recomended books and articles in an appendix. As for copyrights I marvel at the concern disinterested parties seem to show for others presumed copywrights. I suggest that unless a valid source indicates that material is a copywright infringement we presume that the clip is public domain, posted by the copywright holder or licensed for free use like Alex Jones does for all of his videos. Furthermore, non-copywright holders like yourself should keep their nose where it belongs and spare us these false pieties regarding other peoples property rights which they have NO true knowledge of. Maybe you should spend your life patrolling local supermarkets for shoplifters if you have such concern for others alleged rights. Makes about as much sense as what you are doing here. 68.14.22.161 13:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)Tommy Powell</p>

<dd>Copyright infringement is serious business; per <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPY_08ab.html" title="WP:COPY">WP:COPY</a>, we can presume no such thing: "Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating <i>someone else's</i> copyright. If it is, please <i>do not</i> link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (<i>Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry</i>)." This is policy, and <b>cannot be circumvented</b>. To "presume that the clip is public domain" without verification is to expose Wikipedia to legal action by copyright holders; to do so repeatedly demonstrates a wanton disregard for policy and US law and is a <b><a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">bannable</a></b>—not just <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blockable</a>—offense. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 17:34, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reduce indent) Not yet, there's an additional issue: per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, we should only be adding links that "contain information that can't or shouldn't be added to the article."

<dd>Ok, I'll take your word for it that you own the copyrights, but I am still unconvinced that your trailer adds anything of value to the article.

<p>J, it's not "fan art." It's a trailer for a short film he acts in. And the reason the trailer provides "no information" is because...it's a trailer. It's there to <i>tease</i> the audience with what is to come. The project is a bit behind it's original completion date, but it will be done soon.
