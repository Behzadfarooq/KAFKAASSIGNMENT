<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following from the Green Bay section of the article: "Favre's first pass completion was notorious for being the only NFL pass in which the same man was the passer and reciever. The ball was deflected by another player's helmet and bounced directly back to Favre."</p>
<p>1. This sentence was in middle of discussion of his poor play during the September 20, 1992 Cincinnati game. This actually took place the week before against Tampa Bay. 2. This is a nice trivia answer, but not the first or only time this has happened as the sentence contends.</p>

<p>"Going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre was going quite a bit over the speed limit when his car went out of control." That sounds so lavished. I was around when that happened, everybody knew - and before he became "the legend" - would easily agree that he was drunk with his brother at the time of that accident. Can I prove it? of course not, only him and a couple people at most would ever know that, but could it be true?...... this somewhats explains why I protest wikipedia's original research policy. Either way I don't feel that what is written is NPOV with the line "Favre was going quite a bit over the speed limit" and will remove, or re-write it and likely due to it and its nature - the entire section, if it is not fixed. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithotyn_a45d.html" title="User:Mithotyn">Mithotyn</a> 01:09, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I originally added more information about the painkiller addiction two years ago, and have, for lack of a better term, 'put it back'.

<p>For your information I am the "revisionist" who removed that...I think it needed a better title...It was originally in its own section but if it's in the green bay section, that should be fine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why does the article ignore the fact that Favre was a great QB in the 90s and has been a mediocre QB (at best) in the 2000s?</span></h2>
<p>The overall tone seems like it's written by Favre's publicist. All of his 2000 playoff appearances (and isn't the playoffs what really matters - and his 90s playoff results made him a great hall of famer) involved embarrassing performances. 6 picks vs. the Rams including 3 returned for TDs. 4 picks vs. the Vikings including an incredibly embarrassing one. The game losing pick vs. Philly in OT. All of these poor performances plus leading the league in '05 in ints/passing attempt can not simply be blamed on supporting cast. He may have put up a lot of hollow #s in the 2000s but he hasn't been among the top 5 QBs in a long time.70.16.144.86 01:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Your opinion. A rather silly opinion in any case. Isn't it an accomplishment just to make it to the playoffs?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Why write an article attempting to smear an otherwise great career?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the article should ignore Favre's less than impressive (to be generous) performance in the past several seasons (including, IIRC being statistically the worst starting quarterback in the NFL last year) because he had an outstanding career in the previous decade? The only one "smearing" Favre's career is Favre, because he either can't or won't accept that it's time to retire. If his career has gone to crap in the last few years (which it has), the article shouldn't sugarcoat it. 71.203.209.0 11:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He's thrown for over 3000 yards in every one of those seasons, 20 or more TDs in every one of those seasons, and has thrown 20 INT's in 2 of those seasons. That's pretty consistent with his numbers in the 90's when he was so much better (according to you).</dd>

<p>I don't understand why adding the line "widely considered to be one of the best QB's in the history of the NFL" is considered POV when it's near statistical fact. Please, if Joe Montana can have that in his article, I don't see why Favre can't. Until someone points out a reason not to, I'm putting it back.</p>

A well written article shouldn't need to have such a biased statement in it to make an assertion that Favre is one of the all-time best QB's in the NFL. This is a conclusion readers MIGHT possibly come to based on the FACTS in the article. Regarding the "citation" that was included supporting this statement, it was equally unsuitable, because it didn't offer any source for the claim. A valid source would be a cited quote from a noted expert or analyst on the topic. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackel_6f4f.html" title="User:Jackel">-Jackel</a> 15:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, what's interesting about this is, if someone wanted to create an article section or short summary devoted to the December 16, 1996 SI article - in the greater context of Brett Favre - we could probably legimately use this image in that section of the article. But just by itself, it sounds like we can't, and certainly not as the infobox image. I've been looking pretty hard for Favre images myself, and this is not an easy hunt.</dd>

<p>How many seasons has Brett started every single game? The first section in the article mentions that Brett started "every single game played by his team for nearly sixteen straight seasons". But the Records section mentions that Brett "started every game his team has played over the past 14-season period." Clearly, only one of these two statements is true. Considering that his streak started on September 27th, 1992 and that it is now 2006, I'm more inclined to believe that the latter statement is the correct one. Am I mistaken? Brett Favre has started 241 consecutive games, including 20 in the playoffs!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strahan</span></h2>
<p>"Players and fans from around the league were highly critical of the play. Mike Freeman of the New York Times wrote: "Yes, Mr. Favre, Strahan deserves the record, but please, handing it to him the way you did, as if you were throwing change into a Salvation Army bucket, is the kind of mistake Favre may never live down".[" id just like to point out that what he did was out of the goodness of his heart. its all ok if you want to find something wrong with what he did, but seeing as the game was nearly over and the packers were sure to win (i say that lightly), this was strahans last chance of getting the record. im sure strahan appreciates as well and theres no need to ruin it by saying he didnt earn it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.141.163.68 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.141.163.68.html" title="User talk:69.141.163.68">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.141.163.68_773c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.141.163.68">contribs</a>).</small></p>
