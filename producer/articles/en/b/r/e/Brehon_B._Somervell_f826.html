After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> Rivers. He then attended the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_War_College_42d5.html" title="U.S. Army War College">Army War College</a>, marking him out as one of the Army's best and most promising officers.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> he was District Engineer, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a> Engineer District. As such he became involved in a conflict between proponents of the development of hydroelectric power through damming the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Falls_of_the_Potomac_River_371a.html" title="Great Falls of the Potomac River">Great Falls of the Potomac River</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland-National_Capital_Park_and_Planning_Commission_11e2.html" title="Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission">Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission</a>. Despite his advocacy, the falls remain undammed to this day. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, he teamed up with Hines again, for an economic survey of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, which culminated in a seven volume report. Named as District Engineer for <a href="../../../o/c/a/Ocala%2C_Florida_eebd.html" title="Ocala, Florida">Ocala, Florida</a>, Somervell got behind a project to build the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Florida_Barge_Canal_e435.html" title="Cross Florida Barge Canal">Cross Florida Barge Canal</a>. Somervell became the natural choice to head the project but although president <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> allocated emergency funds for the canal in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, opponents of the canal protested that the canal would cause sea water to seep into the ground water, and work was stopped a year later. In the meantime, he was finally promoted to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, Somervell was appointed as head of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Works_Project_Administration_14c4.html" title="Works Project Administration">Works Project Administration</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Over the For three and a half years he spent $10,000,000 a month on depression relief works. He coped with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that that "I wouldn't know a Red if I saw one, and wouldn't do anything about it if I did".

<p>In <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, Somervell was appointed as head of the Construction Division of the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartermaster_Corps_0bcd.html" title="Quartermaster Corps">Quartermaster Corps</a>, and was promoted to the temporary rank of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">Brigadier General</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">January 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>. His immediate concern was the construction of a series of camps to house the draftees who were now pouring into the Army, which were scheduled for completion by <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>. Reasoning that time was more important than money, Somervell pushed the project through to completion on time. The cost increased by $100 million but the job was completed on time. He was also responsible for constructing new facilities to hold stores and munitions, for which $700 million was allocated by <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. By <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a>, he was responsible for a work force 485,000 people employed on military construction projects. By <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a>, 375 projects had been completed and 320 were still underway, with a total value of $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>The best know of these projects was <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">The Pentagon</a>, an enormous office complex to house the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War Department's</a> 24,000 staff together in one building. On the afternoon of Thursday, July, 17 <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Somervell gave <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_John_Casey_f02a.html" title="Hugh John Casey">Hugh J. Casey</a> until Monday to design the building. Over that weekend, Casey and his staff roughed out the design for a five-story, four-sided structure, with an estimated cost of $33 million. President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> subsequently moved the site of the building, over Somervell's objections, but Somervell still pursued his own designs, making important changes, including the addition of a fifth floor. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency and by <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, some 13,000 workers were working around the clock on the building, which was completed in early <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> at a cost of $63 million, costs having blown out due to the emphasis on speed and the additional floor.</p>
<p>Somervell hoped to become <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_Engineers_3e8e.html" title="Chief of Engineers">Chief of Engineers</a> but was passed over in favor of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Reybold_5ff6.html" title="Eugene Reybold">Eugene Reybold</a>, the Assistant Chief of Staff (G-4) on the War Department General Staff. Worse, Somervell's post was abolished on the transfer of the Construction Division to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corps_of_Engineers_5994.html" title="Corps of Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a>. Somervell instead received <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Reybold_5ff6.html" title="Eugene Reybold">Reybold's</a> former assignment. As G-4, Somervell strove to implement President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt's</a> war production goals against a rising tide of opinion that they were unattainable and impractical, yielding an unbalanced force.</p>
<p>Within weeks, however, the tables were turned.

Three huge new commands were created by Executive Order Number 9082 of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_28.html" title="February 28">February 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, "Reorganizing the Army and thr War Department" <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>: the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Forces_8bec.html" title="United States Army Air Forces">Army Air Forces</a> under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Arnold_7002.html" title="Henry H.

McNair">Lesley J. McNair</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Services_of_Supply_8b96.html" title="Services of Supply">Services of Supply</a>, under Somervell. As such, he was not only promoted to the rank of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">Lieutenant General</a> over the heads of many more senior officers, but many of them now found themselves his subordinates, including <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Reybold_5ff6.html" title="Eugene Reybold">Reybold</a>. He was answerable to two men, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army_45fa.html" title="Chief of Staff of the United States Army">Chief of Staff</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall.html" title="Marshall">Marshall</a>, and the Under Secretary of War, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_P._Patterson_9b5d.html" title="Robert P. Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a>. Somervell built up a good working relationship with both, based on his ability to get things done.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/r/Services_of_Supply_8b96.html" title="Services of Supply">Services of Supply</a> were renamed the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Service_Forces_476e.html" title="Army Service Forces">Army Service Forces</a> in March, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, as the term "supply" was felt to be too narrow a description of the broad range of logistic activities carried out by the organization.</p>
<p>Somervell was often accused of being stubborn, arrogant, and impatient. Some saw him as an empire-builder, who spent too much time feuding with other agencies. A <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> attempt by Somervell to abolish the Technical Services failed amid false rumours that he was being considered for the post of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army_45fa.html" title="Chief of Staff of the United States Army">Army Chief of Staff</a> if <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_C._Marshall_f33b.html" title="George C. Marshall">George Marshall</a> was sent to Europe to command the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force_df3c.html" title="Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force">Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force</a>. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagent "white-elephant" projects, such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canol_Road_3b28.html" title="Canol Road">Canol</a>, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded.</p>
<p>In the end, though, his contributions towered over his faults. Somervell understood logistics and its paramount importance in modern warfare, and he spared no effort to ensure that the American fighting man had all he needed for victory.</p>

<p>Somervell retired from the Army on April, 30 <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> and moved back to <a href="../../../o/c/a/Ocala%2C_Florida_eebd.html" title="Ocala, Florida">Ocala, Florida</a>. He accepted an offer to become president of <a href="../../../k/o/p/Koppers.html" title="Koppers">Koppers</a>, a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh.html" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>-based company that mined coal and manufactured and sold coal-based products. Applying the same managerial techniques that he had employed in the Army, he thoroughly reorganized the company, and doubled revenues and trebled profits over the next five years. He suffered a severe heart attack in September, 1954 and returned to his home <a href="../../../o/c/a/Ocala%2C_Florida_eebd.html" title="Ocala, Florida">Ocala</a> to recuperate, and in early 1955 he decided to resign as president and withdraw from day-to-day operations. There, he died of a heart attack on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>.</p>
