<h2><span class="mw-headline">Random Question</span></h2>
<p>I have a question about the nude images on wikipedia. Who provides them? Do random people just takes pictures of themselves naked and put them on wikipedia? (If you're wondering, I don't find nude images offensive)</p>
<p><a name="Propriety_of_Image" id="Propriety_of_Image"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Propriety of Image</span></h2>
<p>Forget morality, whether it's porn or not, and all that. What matters, first and foremost, is that it is A) Not work-safe and B) Illegal to view in some places. There should be an image, but a line drawing, diagram, picture of a statue, basically anything but a photo or photorealistic image is more appropriate. --anonymous</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia can't adjust its rules to particular foreign countries and so on. It's hard to please everyone. The current picture doesn't intend to arouse as it's not shown in a sexual context, so it can't really be classified as erotic, but rather informative. -- <a href="../../../j/u/g/User%7EJugalator_9adf.html" title="User:Jugalator">Jugalator</a> 02:19, July 23, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What about a not work-safe tag?
<dl>
<dd>Even if it is illegal in some countries, wouldn't you just have to delete it on that country's launguage's page? Even so, I doubt it's illegal in UK/Australia/Canada. But perhaps put a NSFW tag to keep minors out.
<dl>
<dd>How would a NSFW keep minors out? It would probably attract them. Also, if it's not-safe-for-work, why are you looking at the Wiki article on breasts at work anyway?</dd>

<p>I noticed most (or all) the pics are of white women's breasts... Isn't that undesirable given we're supposed to have a global point of view? Pics of, Asian, black, Latina etc. breasts would be a step forward (tho replace existing pics, wikipedia is not a gallary). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mikkerpikker</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker">...</a> 00:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the poster above.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should endeavor to create a library of breast pictures from every ethnic group imaginable. A sort of "It's A Small World" of titties.</p>
<p>Based on the documentary, "Journey of Man" <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1212_021213_journeyofman.html" class="external free" title="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1212_021213_journeyofman.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1212_021213_journeyofman.html</a></p>
<p>We should create, "The Journey of Mammaries."</p>
<p>From the nipples of Nepal to the boobs of Bangladesh. The tits of Turkey to the areolas of The Andes.</p>
<p>Let's get a United Nations email directory and send the message: People of Earth... show us your tits!</p>
<p>There are thousands of ethnic varieties of soft, fleshy womanhood to explore. We should endeavor to preserve these for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>For future generations.</p>
<p>For our children.</p>
<p>Tastefully, of course.</p>

<p>While I do think it would be nice to have a cultural diversity of breasts in the article, I'm not going to go out and put together a video montage of naked breasts set to the "It's a Small World" song.

<p>So I took a look at <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_penis_size.html" title="Human penis size">human penis size</a> an lo and behold there is not ONE illustrative picture there, as opposed to the multiple pictures on this article.

<dd>oooh...good point. If I had a penis or male breasts, I'd take pictures and post them. Its best if these types of pictures have a clear history and have been volunteered by wikipedians though. You seem to be male. Go for it!<a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> 01:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, this article should really include the anatomical differences between male and female breasts. Pretty much everyone knows that guys have nipples, but not many people are aware that guys have smaller, less developed versions of all of the other anatomical structures that female breasts have, can actually lactate if their hormones are sufficiently out of whack, and can even rarely get breast cancer.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. It's weird to compare mature and young at the top, and never show male breasts. As far as the functionality of male breats, some male to female transsexuals have produced milk due to the hormones; the necessary parts are there.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pictures that are Needed</span></h2>
<p>Ok based on the complaints I think we need to a make a list of what is needed (and what is not) for pictures and then agree and act upon it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Male Breast: at least for comparison.</li>
<li>Breast of other colors: I’m not the only one that thinks this page has got a racist problem here</li>
<li>Size range: the only picture showing a breast size other then the rest is disputed? What wrong with you people, it should be the other way around; more variation is needed to represent an accurate profile of what breasts are.</li>
<li>Animal Breast: why not? Again good comparison</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to expand the list and comment.</p>
<p>Come on people get your dicks out of the floppy drive and start taking this article seriously, try to edit the article with wiki in mind rather then your gonads!--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerBen_3b13.html" title="User:BerserkerBen">BerserkerBen</a> 19:35, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These feel like good ideas to me, although you should watch your words and accusations. As for <i>sexism</i>: A problem is often to find GFDL-compatible pictures, even moreso if we are to have a diverse racial, gender, size and species coverage. Focus is obviously given to <i>female</i> breasts as these are not vestigal and logically most interesting to document from an encyclopedic perspective. As for <i>racism</i>: see above. It is most likely a "problem" that the largest Wikipedia reader population is caucasian and photographing their or their spouses breasts and I doubt you need to look for more controversial causes than these. Come again if you found out an image was voted down simply because it was a photograph of asian breasts.</dd>
<dd>As for your non-aggressive <i>comments</i>: I do believe that they're good ideas though, especially the part about size range. Racial differences are covered in at least one image in the current article. Since male breasts are vestigal traits I find them less important from a documentary perspective, but could of course be covered in just one picture. As for animals, that could be useful for an additional section in the article, although then again, we need to find properly licensed imagery that focuses on mammals' breasts. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 12:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree here that there are more varieties of breasts that are needed to be pictured. I call on people to get more pictures up there of breasts of other varieties: more variety in sizes (they all look to be approximately the same size except for the larger ones - where are the natural smaller breasts?), male breasts, more variety of breasts from different ethnicities, etc. <a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvartulfr1_c6b5.html" title="User:Svartulfr1">User:Svartulfr1</a> 06:57 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor edits on culture</span></h2>
<p>Changed the statement that "some cultures...forbid the public display of breasts"etc. Redundant considering earlier in the same section this is stated in the sentence "many cultures consider... display indecent." Instead I changed it to religions, and lumped in christianity to even things out a bit and make it a more inclusive category (subsection under "culture" for "religions" recommended). I also added that public breastfeeding is okay.

<p>OK, i was clicking random article and found the page. And you guys are a little eccessive about you "pornography" theorys! I'm 11 years old and my eyes have not burned out! If this were hard pornography or somthing then they'd need a warning. I'm 11 and i lived. If i were 8, then how should i be able to touch-type? my point here is that "human knowledge" and "human knowledge not concerning the human body" are very different- Daniel_123</p>

<p>† And at the same time, let's get away from referring to white people as "Caucasian". We really should save that term for the peoples of the Caucasus Mountains of Asia. Just using that term actually can be considered bias and/or cultural imperialism. But yeah, we need more color (and I didn't say black) in here.</p>

<dd>You admit that it's offensive. That's a good first step. But I don't understand why you don't agree that it's racially based. When Wombdpsw said "breasts of color", did you think he was talking about breasts that had been painted green or blue? Or were you aware he was talking about the breasts of black women, asian women, hispanic women, and so forth? To say that the breasts of women of other races "look awful" is certainly racially based. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:32, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>THIS STATEMENT ABOVE IS JUST AS OFFENSIVE AND RACIST...WHERE ARE YOU KASREYN?</p>
<p>I have no objection to an image of 'breast of color' as you are suggesting, but wouldn't we then be calling it <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokenism.html" title="Tokenism">Tokenism</a>?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've made that point here before. It would not be possible to have exactly proportional representation unless we had hundreds of images, so we could represent proportions with differences measured in single percentage points. Since of course we can't have hundreds of images on the page, we're not going to be able to make it perfectly representational. Representations of the four or five most populous races is about the best we can hope for. Note that the need for such representation does not allow for any weakening of WP policy on copyright and free images. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 01:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's a closeup of a breast showing much better detail than the three small images on this article. Specifically it also shows nipple tumescence in detail. As the article on the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> takes time to show flaccid and erect states, my feeling is that an illustration of the erect state of the nipple is worth showing in context at least once.</p>

<dd>I'm not keen on that picture, because it's clearly a surgically enhanced breast (as well as the unnatural shape, there's also an obvious surgical scar). I agree with the plus points above, but i think the introduction and maajority of the article should primarily be about natural breasts. Not that ther's not a place for discussing surgery on here too, but it doesn't strike me as being a good introductory pic.<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 19:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I am the original photographer of this image, I can assure you that this is a natural breast. The "scar" is due to her bra being removed a minute before or so. Inferiz 08:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, it's not a scar then i was wrong. She's wearing a <i>terribly</i> badly fitting bra if that's wear the underwire lies though. Please, get her to find a bra that fits.<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 21:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we need to display a wider range of breasts and from women of different backgrounds. How do we go about getting decent images not just those someone ripped from pornography? SallyB 01:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know where you got your magical ability to look at a photograph of breasts and determine it was taken for pornographic purposes. I'd love to have such an ability myself. None of the images on this page have any information on their image pages linking them to pornography that I see. All are presented tastefully. No sexual paraphernalia are visible.</dd>
<dd>More seriously: whatever original purpose the photos were taken for cannot have any relevance. Only their current content can matter. In the article on <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feet.html" title="Feet">feet</a>, a photo of a foot would be informative and educational. How about adding the same photo in the article on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_fetishism.html" title="Foot fetishism">foot fetishism</a>? Would the very same image suddenly become pornography? Images are images. People get aroused for their own personal reasons, which are entirely unpredictable. It's not our job to try to anticipate those reasons.</dd>
<dd>I do agree, however, that a wider variety could be displayed. Perhaps images could be found and added of the breasts of women of other races - though that risks opening up the can of worms labelled "equal representation" - and I don't think we're likely to find photographs of <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainu_people.html" title="Ainu people">Ainu</a> or <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskimo.html" title="Eskimo">Eskimo</a> breasts.

<dd>agree, but why did you remove Brst-Lrg01.jpg? Surely that was exactly the kind of pic that should be added... I know the size/quality's not great but it's a start.

<p>What's this about "<i>large</i> and white"? I wouldn't say any of the current pics display particularly large breasts. That's actually the main misconception i wanted to challenge when i created the "size, shape, composition" section... this idea that C cup breasts are large. In fact, it's just about average. What we need is a range of say AA-HH cup sizes, this idea that breasts exist in sizes A,B,C and D is perpetuated enough elsewhere... everytime someone uses 'DD' as a synonym for 'unbelievably massive', it's ridisulous, and wikipedia should represent true diversity. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 18:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have to agree with SallyB. I wouldn't know firsthand about frequency world-wide, as I've only been outside the United States once. But I've traveled a great deal within the United States and one of my favorite pastimes is people-watching (and, frankly, admiration of the world's feminine beauty). The average for (natural, of course) breasts seems to be somewhere between B and C, tending toward C. D's aren't particularly rare, nor are A's. Breasts over D in size are hard to find. Many C through E's are fake, since these seem to be the sizes women aim for in getting breast implants. I have no way of knowing how many C's through E's I've seen that were not natural (except for the cases when the implant is so bad it's obvious through clothing), so this skews my observations. Extremely large cup sizes are vanishingly rare regardless; I'm guessing not many women outside of the pornography industry opt to have implants to increase their size to F's or higher (heck, even E's is a stretch of the imagination), since on all but the largest frames they would be disproportionately large. Of course, note that these are nothing but recollections of observation and not real data. What we really need is some medical study on actual measured - not reported - cup sizes of a wide cross-section of races and ages. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 22:33, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wish i had statistics to back this up, but i don't - only my own observations. I agree that we need a medical study, but i've not found such scientific evidence online. It's commonly stated though that average is a C cup, but also that 75% of women wear the wrong size bra (too small), so i'd say that the true average is more like D, and that means there must be a lot of women above D. Which there are, all over the place. Anecdotally, you only have to look at the recent success of [<a href="http://www.Bravissimo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.Bravissimo.com" rel="nofollow">Bravissimo</a>, a UK-based lingerie shop set up to cater for the above-DD market (they don't sell anything smaller than a D cup), which is rapidly expanding, and has gone from one store to 12 stores around the UK (as well as a successful internet business) within the past 5 years. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 18:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">computer teacher's perspective on the "pictures of boobs" debate...</span></h2>
<p>During the 2005-2006 school year, I was the computer teacher at a small K-8 <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parochial_school.html" title="Parochial school">parochial school</a> in the United States. It was because of content like the pictures of female breasts in this article and the <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">nudity</a> article that I was compelled to switch to websites like <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahooligans.html" title="Yahooligans">yahooligans</a> in the classroom. As was noted by a previous poster, "having a range of photographs about these body parts could really perform a valuable educational function for young people..." I agree 100%, but the laws in my state...:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skepticfiles.org/aclu/co_16.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.skepticfiles.org/aclu/co_16.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticfiles.org/aclu/co_16.htm</a></p>
<p>The rest of my post will assume that you have read the information from the above website. Had I allowed a student to view the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast.html" title="Breast">breast</a> article, I might have been protected by the statement, "...serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value." Showing nude pictures is acceptable in SOME <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a> classes in the United States. HOWEVER, there is undeniably a tremendous taboo in the USA when it comes to allowing young people to view nudity. Furthermore, the definition of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexually_explicit_material.html" title="Sexually explicit material">sexually explicit material</a> can differ from community to community.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose a compromise. I recommend that wikipedia continue to provide the pictures of female breasts, but with an added layer of protection for children, parents, teachers, and others. Is it possible to replace each picture with an empty frame. Then users could just follow the link below the frame to find the picture...? The pictures would still be available, but not as obvious to "innocent" children whose parents might object to nudity on wikipedia. Also, male breasts should be included in this article. Or, a separate article should be created. Discuss please. Gobbles414 04:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sadly, we cannot comply with such requests. Wikipedia has the goal of providing a free and high-quality uncensored encyclopedia to the entire world. It cannot be limited by the local taboos and cultural myopia of any nation (and I say that as a fellow American). Prevailing American attitudes towards nudity are indeed a terrible shame, but the only hope is for those attitudes to change. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> censored for such reasons.

<dd>No wikipedian wants to hurt kids. I could probably add a common sense qualification to the not-censored-for-minors policy without it being reverted. Then editors to articles like this might have a little more leeway. I assume there's already some more detail to the policy, but I don't feel like searching for it right now. Anyway, four photos as opposed to one drawing doesn't do all that much more educating, especially if parents and teachers will be hiding the page from kids. <a href="../../../-/b/a/User%7E-Barry-_cf34.html" title="User:-Barry-">-Barry-</a> 08:02, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is made clear that Wikipedia's mission is to document <b>all</b> human knowledge, and that images and content may be found which are objectionable to some. Therefore it is made clear that Wikipedia is not intended for children but for an adult audience. It is impossible to adopt any local community's standards of "decency" without violating standards in another community somewhere in the world. Therefore, if any censorship were imposed, the logic of the situation would demand complete censorship to avoid offending the lowest common denominator, resulting in an encyclopedia empty of information. The disclaimer makes it sufficiently clear that such images may be found at <b>any</b> time without warning on Wikipedia, and it is also made clear that Wikipedia cannot prevent even worse images from being added by vandals, at least momentarily. If there is a problem, I'd say that the disclaimer should be a little more prominent on the main page. Beyond that, this entire section is moot. You are proposing altering the founding goals and structure of the encyclopedia. For that, I would recommend you contact the Wikimedia Foundation.

If we include too much, people can simply hit the back button or look away, but if we include too little then we disappoint our readers.</dd>
<dd>I would also agree that, information content being equal, the less potentially offensive of two images is probably the wiser choice. But I don't feel that a line drawing carries as much information content as a photograph, plus the potential offensiveness of a photo of a breast, in my opinion, is so low that it doesn't warrant such an exchange.

<dd>Wow! This is obviously still a very controversial subject! I read two comments that represent the most opposing points of view on this topic.</dd>
<dd>"The entire issue of children is irrelevant... It is impossible to adopt any local community's standards of 'decency' without violating standards in another community somewhere in the world..." AND "...it's universal common sense that we should publish what would be least objected to if it provides essentially the same information as the alternative and if the alternative is likely to be censored or considered inappropriate by many people."</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, both of these positions have merit. Should Wikipedia automatically yield to cultures and governments? Of course not...! Then we'd be in a situation where "controversial" topics like <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> couldn't be discussed. I don't think that any reasonable Wikipedian would want that kind of censorship. However, we should show some sensitivity for as many points of view as possible. For example, the number of Muslims who would have a problem with pictures of uncovered female breasts is probably huge -- it is more of a cultural taboo that I religious one, I have learned. So we're just going to say to Muslims, "Sorry, we're not going to respect you're right to learn about female breasts within the context of your own cultures because you're Muslim!" My question is, <b>WHY CAN'T THERE BE A MIDDLE GROUND?</b> Some possible compromises include:</dd>

<p>This discussion of images applies to numerous other articles, most of the sexology and sexuality oriented. I have begun a discussion of the broader topic on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sexology_and_sexuality_WIP-image-guidelines_b99f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexology and sexuality/WIP-image-guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexology and sexuality/WIP-image-guidelines</a> to have people participate in working on a guideline consensus (not a policy, or rules, as that hasn't been possible in the past). Having a consensus of people who have hashed this out and agreed on some guidelines will help in the future to combat against the types of problems we have had in the past. (Prudish people pushing their POV, Trolls trying to create controversy, Vanity images, etc.) Of course it won't be a solution to all problems, and they will still need to be dealt with on a case by case basis, but there really isn't a need to rehash the entire barrel of pickles on every image on every sexuality based page, and then again when someone tries to change an image. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 02:08, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the word "normal" there, not because I feel the breasts shown at the site are not actually normal, but just because I'm a bit leery of any appearance of supporting any particular site's POV. After reading through the site's text, there are several claims which appear to directly contradict this article's claims. Of course, that's not really important when considering that their images are fine, so the link should remain.</p>
<p>The site makes some interesting points, but ultimately fails to recognize that complete de-sexualization of the female breast goes against their purpose as a secondary sex characteristic (per our article). Additionally, they make a very bizarre distinction between "mature" breasts and other breasts; their definition of "mature" breasts is, apparently, the breasts of women who have undergone pregnancy and breastfed their children. This would mean that, in their view, childless old ladies have "immature" breasts. To my knowledge there is no such distinction made by anatomists or doctors, so the site does appear to be pushing a rather odd, but probably harmless POV. Which is why I'd rather avoid using their descriptive adjectives. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 10:49, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Other editors and I have <i>repeatedly</i> asked all editors who can to add free (ie., legally usable) images of breasts of other races to the article.

<dd>Indeed. There is a general, often unspoken social understanding that the public display of female breasts is unacceptable throughout western / anglophone countries. It has partially to do with the dominance of Christianity in those lands, but there are other contributing factors as well.

<p>I have heard (but unfortunately do not have a reliable reference) that one function of human breasts is to help women to carry infants safely, by cushioning the skull which is under-developed in new borns.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "Mature" breast</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the photo near the top of the article that purported to be the breast of a "mature" pregnant woman. I don't know who put it there, but I presume that it was done in direct response to the other photo which was entitled the breast of a "young woman".</p>
<ul>
<li>We know that the other photo is bonafide, because its source says so, says that it is a "young" woman, says that she is pregnant and emphasises the changes due to pregnancy. Moreover, the clinical signs indicate that it is indeed the breast of a pregnant, young woman.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The removed photo hhas been lifted from Flickr. There is no written indication as to whether the woman that the breast belongs to is young or old, pregnant or a virgin (although, come to think of it, the two may not be mutually exclusive). The most pertinent comment is that the underwire mark should have been removed by the photographer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The appearance of the breast did not support its description in this article. The breast in the removed photo had the appearance of belonging to a young female, rather than one that might be termed "mature", either in years or through childbearing. It didn't look like the breast of a woman who had given birth. And if it was indeed the breast of a woman who might be termed "mature" in years (shall we say 35-60) (rather than young or "aged"), then it was in remarkably good shape and had dropped remarkably little for a largish breast.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Concerning the phto of the young pregnant woman, I have pushed it further down the page, into the paragraph that describes breast function and where the enlarged nipples, and so on, are relavent to the information adjacent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have put in its place a nice pic which was in the area of shapes and sizes. The size of the photo was significantly different to the others and I thought it was superfluous at that point. It is, however, a nice, dare I say "normal" photo, in the sense that it represents breasts in the way that many people usually see them- not feeding a baby, not with heightened eroticism, not clinically, but in the context of one's mirror, a bedroom, a bathroom, a change room or any other such situation. More than 50% of us (people, that is) see female breasts every single day in these contexts without perceiving them clinically or erotically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing that I like about the leading photo is that the breasts could be nicely interpreted in an aesthetic, clinical or erotic sense, depending upon ones viewpoint, or they could be just ones own breasts in the bathroom.</p>
<p>As for the one I deleted- It was a beautiful photo of beautiful breasts. Sorry to be so ruthless, but let's deal with accuracy.</p>

<dd>Actually it's the other way round. <a href="../../../c/l/o/Image%7ECloseup_of_female_breast.jpg_a7ba.html" title="Image:Closeup of female breast.jpg">Image:Closeup_of_female_breast.jpg</a> had been there a long time as an introductory pic. the woman did happen to be pregnant at time, but that's not the main point. The main reason it was chosen as the intro pic is simply that's it's the best pic available. It was <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotherAmy_5698.html" title="User:MotherAmy">MotherAmy</a> who introduced the "mature" label in the caption in order to justify the comparison with her own pic, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Image%7EBreast_and_nipple_changes_during_late_pregnancy.jpg_af8d.html" title="Image:Breast and nipple changes during late pregnancy.jpg">Image:Breast and nipple changes during late pregnancy.jpg</a>, which she called "young" and pregnant. I've now rearranged the pics. There's nothing wrong with either, and both do have a place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can i suggest that people don't try to change the main <i>intro</i> pic without discussing it first. There's been a lot of discussion about it, as you can read on this talk page, and we'd just about reached a consensus. That's not to say it can't be changed to something other than <a href="../../../c/l/o/Image%7ECloseup_of_female_breast.jpg_a7ba.html" title="Image:Closeup of female breast.jpg">Image:Closeup_of_female_breast.jpg</a>, but let's talk about reasons first, please. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 18:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I went back to Flickr to check out that image and observed that there are other pics of the woman who owns the breast, who indeed is pregnant, although the pic of the breast in particular doesn't say that. It's certainly a great photo. It was the interpretation without solid evidence that worried me- but in I hadn't looked quite far enough. I like the current arrangement of pics.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Brassieres</span></h3>
<p>There needs to be better coordination between this page and the Brassiere page. There is a lot of overlap. Some material was shifted here the other day, which I don't mind, as long as the link is clear, but it is sitting a little awkwardly in its current position (size and shape). Understanding normal breast maturation is critical for understanding brassieres. <a href="../../../m/g/o/User%7EMgoodyear_14a4.html" title="User:Mgoodyear">Mgoodyear</a> 23:38, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an editor who has added a fair a bit to both the brassiere and breast pages, i'd agree that as the 2 articles are getting to be more comprehensive, they are meeting in the middle and a bit of overlap is emerging. We should indeed coordinate the two better, so as not to add info to one which is really about the other. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 20:19, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've had a go at a tidy up of this section. I thought a bit of rearrangement of the text was in order, since the section had expanded so much. I've tried to make things more logical, but if anyone's got any better ideas, please improve it. One loss is the gallery of breasts in a column. It was me who introduced that, but i'm not convinced it was useful with the current pictures. It was intended to illustrate diversity, but never really had the required full range of sizes, ages and skin tones to do that on its own. Perhaps it makes more sense to put examples spread throughout the text as i've tried to do now? <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a><a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpute_ea34.html" title="User talk:Spute"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not a huge fan of illustrations in an encyclopaedia, unless they really add a lot, or say something that cannot be be easily explained in words. With an online version, it is easy to link to places where are such photographs such as 007 or Encuesta.</dd>

<dd>As for the question of pics, i think that the inclusion of photos and other illustrations within article pages is crucial, and is an important part of how wikipedia works. Sites like <a href="http://www.007b.com" class="external text" title="http://www.007b.com" rel="nofollow">007</a> are clearly biased, and it is not sufficient to link to such places. Good, non-copyrighted pictures need to be presented in context, from a neutral point of view, and the best way to do that, it seems to me, is the obvious, established way, from within wikipedia itself. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 21:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The featured pic was decided on after a long debate, and just happens to be the best picture we were aware of. The caption states that the breasts belong to a pregnant woman because the woman was indeed pregnant when the photo was taken, so the caption just adds some info.

<dd>As the person who originally added the image (at least, I'm pretty sure I was), I wasn't even aware at the time that the woman was pregnant; no one was. A more sharp-eyed editor than I noticed what he felt were signs of it in the appearance of the breasts (perhaps am OB/GYN?), and so we contacted the original creator of the image at flickr, and he confirmed that the model was pregnant at the time, so we added the note for completeness's sake. It really doesn't make a lick of difference to anyone (that I'm aware of) that the woman is pregnant; it's not particularly visible. The only reason I seized upon the image originally was that it was high-quality, well-focused, showed extremely good detail on the nipple, and above all, was <i>tasteful</i>. I think this last quality is the reason the image has kept the top spot for so long. It walks the tightrope between those who want the images here to be very sexless and clinical, and those who want them to look like something out of a porno. This one is neither. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 06:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This photo does not appear realistic - it does look like a 'model' with fake boobs, imho. No, it isn't porno, but it still is not encyclopedic. Again, look at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>. Is there any reason this article needs a lead photo, where that one does not? That one has an anatomical model, and then futher in the content of the article, images that represent what is in the discussion.Jance 06:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Hello all! I don't normaly edit anatomy articles and, after browsing through the article, I came up with a new section. I propose a section about the inclusion of breast physics in video games. It could sight how breasts went from the "mono-boob" to the independantly moving breasts today. It could be a type of pop-culture section on the article. I even found an article on another site about the history of breast physics. As a gamer, it is obvious to see that moving boobs in games nowadays are important to some gamers. Plus, with the way games are going now, pretty soon it seems like breasts will become their own character. Anyway, I won't add anything to the article without any feedback and will draft up a section in my sandbox. I really think that a more non-medical look at how breasts are seen in the world would be good for the article. So, if anyone else has an opinion on my idea, I'd like to hear it.

<dd>That is not a contemporary position. And, it is contrary to what the FDA in the US recommends. The previous paragraph was sourced and accurate. Dr. Oliver, you really need to stop deleting what other editors write without explanation. Many surgeons do not agree with the 18 year age, and evidently the FDA does not either.
