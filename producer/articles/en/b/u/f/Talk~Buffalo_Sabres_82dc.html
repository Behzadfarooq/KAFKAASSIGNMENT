<p>Interim-captains (In my opinon), shouldn't be on the captains list. Just because a player has worn the 'C', while the captain is injured &amp; out of the line-up, he doen't belong on the Captains list. Example 1: Andreychuk &amp; Mogilny don't belong on the Sabres Captains list. If we listed all the INTERIM-CAPTAINS on each Nhl article's "Captains List" some articles would be unecessary long lists. Example 2: the Habs have had Robinson &amp; Skrudland &amp; McPhee &amp; Denis Savard serve as INTERIM-captains ,yet they don't belong on the Captains list. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 21:12, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So you're saying that Mogilny's captaincy which ran from 11/01/93 to 4/29/94 or all but 16 games of the season (longer than any of the captains of the ridiculous rotating captain season of 2003 - which are listed in the article by the way) should simply be ignored as if it didn't exist? It should be included, especially when the Sabres website lists it. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>My opinon is that, a Captain (LaFontaine), when injured &amp; out of the line-up ,doesn't usually get stripped of his Captaincy (That's why I've disputed Mogilny's captaincy). However, since the Sabres website lists Mogilny as a captain (not interim-captain), then you're correct &amp; I'm in error. I'll edit the LaFontaine &amp; Mogilny articles (succession boxes), to show Mogilny was Captain. My apologies please, I needed you to convince me of my errors, which you have. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 22:59, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/f/Talk%7EBuffalo_Sabres_82dc.html" title="Edit section: 1999 Stanley Cup Final -- Ignorance of Possesion Rules and Bias in wording">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1999 Stanley Cup Final -- Ignorance of Possesion Rules and Bias in wording</span></h2>
<p>In the 1999 season summary, I believe there is significant bias in the article.</p>
<p>Point by Point:</p>
<p><i><b>In the sixth game of the seven-game series, Brett Hull's triple-overtime goal - one that remains in dispute</b></i> - How can something remain in dispute 5 and 1/2 years after it was decided conclusively by NHL officials still be "in dispute"&#160;? If something was decided, it can no longer be in dispute.</p>
<p><i><b>as Hull's skate was visibly in the goal crease--ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. (In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal whilst an offensive player's skate was in the goal crease.</b></i> - This statement ignores the puck possesion continuance rule, that was was even discussed by Gary Thorne and Bill Clement while there 'appeared' to be some question to the legality of the goal. The 1999 NHL rulebook also allowed for a person in posession of the puck to enter the goal crease. Hull's first shot was from outside of the crease, while shooting momentum carried his foot into the crease. The subsequent 2 rebounds came right back to Hull's stick. The goal was allowed to stand by officials on the ice, and contrary to popular thought, was reviewed by replay officials. Possession of the puck was what made the goal legal in the eyes of NHL officials. The puck meerly bounced off Hasek's left leg pad, and was only controlled on the stick by Hull's 3 shots. Possesion of the puck was therefore maintained by Hull, which would make the goal legal.</p>
<p><i><b>At the time, even Dallas Morning News hockey writer Keith Gave questioned the legality of the goal.</b></i> This may have been the case, but Keith Gave was notrious in Dallas for NOT being a pro-Stars beat writer. His tenure at the Dallas Morning News was short lived, in comparison to writers at the Morning News since. Regardless, the article fails to mention that those supporting the legality of the goal included Al Strachan of the Toronto Sun, Don Cherry of the CBC, and Wayne Gretzky - all of whom generally have broader appeal and understanding of the game than Keith Gave would.</p>
<p>This article has a general appearance of being either a) Pro-Buffalo Sabres or b) Anti-Dallas Stars or c) Both</p>
<p>I suggest opposing viewpoints on this 'controversial' event in the history of the Buffalo Sabres, Dallas Stars, and the NHL be allowed on this page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, Hull's skate was also visibly in the crease, the 1999 rule was on the books, and I presume that Gave did indeed question the legality of the goal. Those are all <b>facts</b>, not conjectures or surmises, and that is what Wikipedia is about. Conjectures, surmises, speculations and irrelevancies include how long Gave was a Dallas-based reporter, what his reputation for being slavishly pro-Stars was, and who might be more knowledgeable about the sport. These might certainly be valid counterarguments in a debating forum -- although I can't think of a tangent less NPOV than discussing whether or not the fellow was a traitor to Dallas sports for calling a goal as he saw it, green and gold or not -- but against exactly what are you trying to argue? That the goal was one of the most notorious controversies in Stanley Cup history? That you started a debate on the issue is yet more proof -- if any demonstrations were needed -- to the contrary. Indeed, it may be <b>the</b> most controversial single goal in Cup history; I can't think of one more so, off the top of my head. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think its neutral as stands (minus that long-winded play-by-play that was deleted). Basically its stating that there was a controversy. Are you disputing that? By the way I'm neutral in this: I not very fond of either team: Sabres because I was in Rochester at the time and I had to put up with all the whining from the ESN sportcasters. Stars: because they made hockey utterly boring throughout the 90ies and into the 21st century. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 19:42, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You keep ignoring my point that Hull maintained possession according to the league officials. Accusing me of conjecture?</p>
<p>Fine. Here is a quote and a link:</p>
<p>The debate isn't. NHL officials supervisor Bryan Lewis said Hull's goal counted because he maintained possession of the puck from the time he played it beyond the crease.</p>
<p>"A puck that rebounds off the goalie, the goal post, an opposing player is not deemed to be a change of possession," Lewis said. "Therefore, Hull would be deemed to be in control of the puck, allowed to shoot and score a goal, even though the one foot would be in the crease in advance of the puck."</p>
<p>link: <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/20/sabres_bitter/" class="external free" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/20/sabres_bitter/" rel="nofollow">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/20/sabres_bitter/</a></p>
<p>That explanation should be included in your article to present the counterpoint as to why the goal was allowed. That is -- if you are truly being neutral.</p>
<p>Present a fair argument for both sides. Because there are opposing arguments on this.</p>
<p>In addition, the comments of Gretzky and Al Strachan are as relevant as Keith Gave's. Also relevant is Keith Gave's bias against the team he was the beat reporter for -- the Dallas Stars. Gave reported, and was openly a fan of the Detroit Red Wings, a rival of the Stars. Having heard him on radio down here numerous times on KTCK 1310 and WBAP 820, as well as reading his columns, he was clearly not happy even being in Texas. That lead to his departure to CBS Sportsline in 1999. None of this is conjecture-- it is FACT.</p>
<p>Al Strachan's comments in the Toronto Sun can be found in Canoe.com/Slam Sports archives. He is one of the most respected hockey writers in Canada (far away from Dallas). But you choose to ignore his opinion while singling out the lone voice is lunacy who was BREIFLY in Dallas.</p>
<p>You present a FAIR point of view and acknowledge a difference in opinion on this, or I will edit the article again for you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That there is a difference of opinion is already present and does not need to be belabored. Perhaps you are misunderstanding that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is neither a debating forum</a> nor a proper venue for partisan bullying. We are neither Sabres nor Stars fans here, we have no partisan axes to grind, and since we are not ourselves trying to debate the merits of the arguments, we're not really interested in who made the arguments or what their qualifications are. That the NHL officials made the call, and the grounds upon which they made it, is cited in the article. The relevance of Gave's citation is in so far as it is pertinent there was enough of a difference of opinion on the goal that a Dallas sportswriter disagreed with it. Perhaps you can turn all that energy onto the very scanty Dallas Stars article, which ironically enough -- and scarcely neutral, come to that -- does not mention the incident at all. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 12:51, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not acknowledging at all that the goal was controversial would be a mistake in my opinion. I'll tell you right now, I am a Sabres fan and always have been. And I can tell you that this event goes down in Buffalo sports lore as one of the greatest travesties in the history of sports. Whether it's true or not is not up to Wikipedia to decide, but the controversy has to be acknowledged. The Lindy Ruff "No Goal" proclamation at the parade should also be included. And, it should be noted that they did change the rule the next year. Why change the rule if it didn't cause controversy?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should present both sides of the argument and maybe put forth that although the league officials made their final decision (that it was a legal goal), the debate continues on to this day with fans and hockey commentators. But you can't have an article about the Sabres and omit the most infamous play in team history. That would be like excluding Bill Buckner from the Red Sox article. Right or wrong, it was significant, and does continue to be debated.</dd>

<p>It Was a sad day for hockey when that goal happen, the NHL knows damn well that they totally screwed up that day. Thankfully, due to that happening, the In the crease rule was abolished. But the fact is, that rule should never have existed to begin with. Brett Hull's legacy was tainted by that goal. It shouldn't be. It just was an error on the NHL's part. And the Sabres fans have every right to be upset. However its unlikely the Sabres would have gone on to win the Stanley Cup if they would have won Game 6 anyways. Why? Because only 2 teams have ever won the Cup in a game 7 on the road. And that was the Leafs in 1942, and the Canadiens in 1971. This has been proven in the recent seasons, as the past 4 of 5 seasons we saw the Stanley Cup Finals go to 7 Games. and the home team won all 4 of them.</p>
<p>But rest assure Sabres fans, Your Stanley Cup is coming. Ugly Jerseys or not. It's coming.--<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Pizza_700f.html" title="User:Dr. Pizza">Dr. Pizza</a> 18:23, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the NHL changing the "in the crease" rule for the 1999/2000 season, I was under the distinct impression the league had decided to change this rule mid-season, or at least before the playoffs started. What I seem to remember is that it was not changed because of this incident, merely that the controversy happened to coincide with the last year of the rule standing, and that there was significant discussion about the impending rule change throughout the season. This is memory only and it may be very difficult to verify this, but if anyone can back this up it'd be appreciated; I can't seem to find anything supporting my memory of a hockey season that occurred when I was 11 years old unfortunately.--Silverandcold 07:27, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not in the least.

In it, at the 24:24 mark, the question was asked of when the Sabres would go back to the blue and gold scheme. This portion of the interview runs to the 25:43 mark, and you can ignore the "form-fitting" part of the interview. The look of the way the jerseys will be the same as the previous year, as that was told in March the NHL owners did not like the Nike-designed streamlined jerseys used during the Olympics in Turin. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoseNuggets_0929.html" title="User:NoseNuggets">NoseNuggets</a> 7:17 PM US EDT June 23 2006.</p>

<p>Err ... I'm wondering under what criteria one could possibly call him a star? In only one season did he get as many as 20 goals and had only 300 points in his whole career. It's odd to compare him to Mike Foligno, a recognized star who scored 355 <i>goals</i> in his career with five 30+ goal seasons, and whose career scoring high is nearly twice that of Ruff's. Ruff was a good leader and had a decent career as a third-liner, but that's about it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're comparing two different types of players. Not a star in the scope of the NHL, but definitely a key player on the Sabres teams of the 80's. A players worth goes beyond mere goals and assists - after all he (not Foligno) replaced Perreault as the captain when Gil retired. I agree - not a "star" - "key player" is a better term and in terms of contributions to the franchise, he's <i>now</i> done more for the team than Foligno ever did, but I'll leave your edit. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 13:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well ... when it comes down to it, hockey's about two things, and two things only: putting the puck in the other guy's net and keeping it out of your own. No one ever claimed Foligno was poor defensively (anything but, actually), and he captained the Sabres himself (succeeding Ruff, come to that), so you can't knock his leadership either. Ruff has done a good job as coach, but no one would have ever dared trade him in his playing days even up for any of the other five guys mentioned, and probably not for some other key Sabres of the period either, such as John Tucker, Mike Ramsay, Tony McKegney or even the Christian Ruutuus of the world. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>The new logos being speculated as the upcoming 2006-07 logos don't really seem to do the article justice by being stuffed down where they are, and flowing into the team's record section.

<p>Doing some digging in the news, it would appear that ... yes, several newspapers have actually run stories on the issue not only concerning fan's displeasure over the new, projected logo, but also on the <a href="http://www.fixthelogo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.fixthelogo.com/" rel="nofollow">Fix the Logo</a> website, which there has been somewhat of a minor edit war over.

<dd>I agree - again refrain from posting non NPOV material regarding the new uniforms - that includes posting fan creations and speculative pictures of the jersey. What has been verified is that yes, there will be new jerseys with a new logo and they will be unveiled Sept. 24, that the original blue and gold jersey with the buffalo and crossed sabres will be their third jersey that they will wear at 15 home games this season, and that the logo that has been circulating the net is the new logo, but it is not the exact symbol - only a part of it, and that nearly 23,000 Sabres fans have already signed an online petition protesting this logo.

<dd>My reasons for proposing, list by seasons? There were a few NHL team pages that had their list by seasons, while others were by players. I was looking to have all 30 team pages the same. However if consensus is for 'list by players' (by 22:00 UTC today), I'll edit ALL 30 teams in that fashion. Then I'll not tamper with NHL page team captains list, anymore. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 20:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>To differentiate Captains &amp; Alternate captains from acting Captains &amp; acting alternate captains (eg. Phillips filling in for Alfreddson &amp; Warrener filling in for Yelle). I propose making acting 'C' &amp; 'A's bolden, while regular 'C' &amp; 'A's, are wiki-linked to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28ice_hockey%29.html" title="Captain (ice hockey)">Captain (ice hockey)</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28ice_hockey%29.html#Alternate_captains" title="Captain (ice hockey)">Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains</a>. EXAMPLE: Ottawa's current roster- Alfredsson - <b><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28ice_hockey%29.html" title="Captain (ice hockey)">C</a></b> while Phillips is <b>C</b>.

<p>As the Consensus was to list captains (by players) NOT (by seasons), I've re-added 2004-05 (not as NHL lockout, rather as calender years) as Obviously Sabres rotating captaincy was uncertain during this time-period (April 2004 to October 2005). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 22:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
