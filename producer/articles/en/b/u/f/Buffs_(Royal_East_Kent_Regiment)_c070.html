<p>The 3rd Regiment received its nickname of "The Buffs" because it had been issued 'buff coats'- armor made of soft <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather.html" title="Leather">leather</a> - first when it served abroad in Holland and later when it was a Maritime Regiment of Foot. It was later given buff-colored facings and waistcoats to distinguish itself from those of other regiments and had their leather equipment in buff rather than dyed the traditional white.</p>
<p>It received the title of "The Old Buffs" during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dettingen_dff2.html" title="Battle of Dettingen">Battle of Dettingen</a> in 1743, when the 31st (Huntingdon) Regiment marched past <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Great_Britain_0274.html" title="George II of Great Britain">King George II</a> and onto the battlefield with great spirit. Mistaking them for the 3rd due to their buff facings, the sovereign called out, "Bravo, Buffs! Bravo!". When one of his aides, an officer of the 3rd regiment, corrected His Majesty, he then cheered non-plussed, "Bravo, Young Buffs! Bravo!", thus granting the 31st the honour of being nicknamed the "Young Buffs". The 3rd Regiment then took to calling themselves the "Old Buffs" to keep themselves distinct from the 31st.</p>

<p>The Buffs obtained the name of "The Buffs" officially in 1744 while on campaign in the Low Countries. The 3rd Regiment was then under the command of <b>Lieutenant-General Thomas Howard</b>. At the same time, the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Howards_ec7f.html" title="The Green Howards">19th Regiment of Foot</a> were commanded by a colonel named <b>The Honourable Sir Charles Howard</b>. In order to avoid confusion (because regiments were then named after their colonels, which would have made them both <i>Howard's Regiment of Foot</i>), the regiments took the colours of their facings as part of their names - the 19th Foot became the <b><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Howards_2394.html" title="Green Howards">Green Howards</a></b>, while the 3rd Foot became <b>Howard's Buffs</b>, eventually being shortened to simply <b>The Buffs</b>.</p>

<p>This famous cry has been rumoured by many to have been uttered on the field of battle, but it was actually born on the parade grounds of a garrison.</p>
<p>It comes from when the 2nd Battalion was stationed at Malta in 1858 and were quartered with the 1st Royal (North British) Fusiliers. Adjutant Cotter of The Buffs, a Scot who had formerly served in the Royal Fusiliers as a Sergeant Major, would not brook any disarray on the parade ground from his raw recruits, shouting "Steady, The Buffs! The Fusiliers are watching you!"</p>
<p>This greatly amused the Fusiliers and they called out “Steady The Buffs!” on the slightest provocation, first in Malta and later whenever the two battalions met from then on. The phrase caught on and was soon shouted whenever The Buffs marched by. It then passed into common usage, even appearing in <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s novel <i>Soldiers Three</i> (1888) and his play <i>Pity Poor Mama</i>.</p>

<li>From 1595 to 1665, the four regiments of the <b>English Brigade</b> served under Dutch command. In 1665, with the coming of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War_2ab0.html" title="Second Anglo-Dutch War">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a> the British and Scotch Brigades were ordered to swear loyalty to the <i>Staadtholder</i>. Those who obeyed would be allowed to contnue in Dutch service and those who disobeyed would be cashiered. Using his own funds, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_George_Downing%2C_1st_Baronet_0e2a.html" title="Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet">Sir George Downing</a>, the English ambassador to the Netherlands, raised the <b>Holland Regiment</b> from the starving remnants of those who refused to sign. It was designated as the 4th Regiment of Foot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1689 the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> deposed James II Stuart and seated <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">William Henry, Prince of Orange-Nassau</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadtholder.html" title="Stadtholder">Stadtholder</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Netherlands_4038.html" title="United Netherlands">United Netherlands</a>, on the throne of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> as William III of England. To reduce confusion between the Regent's <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Blue_Guards_86b7.html" title="Dutch Blue Guards">Dutch Blue Guards</a> regiment and the Stuart-era "Holland Regiment", the latter was renumbered the 3rd Regiment and had its title changed to <b>The Lord Admiral's Regiment</b>. Since Prince George of Denmark was Lord Admiral (and thus was its Honorary Colonel), it was also known as <b>Prince George of Denmark's Regiment</b> until his death in 1708.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>1st (Regular) Battalion</b> existed continuously from 1572-1961.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>2nd (Regular) Battalion</b> was intermittently raised in 1678-1679, 1756-1758, 1803-1815, and 1857-1949.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1758, the 2nd Battalion raised in 1756-1758 was converted into the <b>1st Battalion, 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment</b>. In 1881, it was converted into the <b>2nd Battalion, 28th/61st <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gloucestershire_Regiment_239d.html" title="The Gloucestershire Regiment">The Gloucestershire Regiment</a></b>, whose battalions were later amalgamated together in 1948. In 1994 <b>The Gloucestershire Regiment</b> was amalgamated with <b>The Duke of Edinburgh's Royal (Berkshire and Wiltshire) Regiment</b> to form <b>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Gloucestershire%2C_Berkshire_and_Wiltshire_Regiment_b225.html" title="Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment">Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment</a></b>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardwell_reforms.html" title="Cardwell reforms">Cardwell reforms</a> of 1881 the <b>East Kent Militia</b> became the Regiment's <b>3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion</b> [1881-1953] and its short-lived <b>4th (Special Reserve) Battalion</b> [1881-1888].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>From 1881-1908 the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Army</a>'s <b>1st (Kent) Volunteers</b> and <b>2nd (The Weald of Kent) Volunteers</b> Battalions were raised. From 1908-1921 and 1939-1947 they became the regiment's 4th and 5th Battalions. In 1921-1939 and 1947-1961 they were amalgamated as the 4th/5th Battalion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1914-1918 the following battalions were raised for service in World War I:
<ul>
<li>2/4th (Territorial Army) Battalion [1914-1917]</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1956 the <b>410th (Kent) Coast Regiment (Royal Artillery)</b> was disbanded and converted into infantry. It was then combined with elements of the <b>4th (Territorial Army) Battalion, The Buffs (Royal East Kent) Regiment</b> to form the <b>5th (Territorial Army) Battalion</b> of <b>The Queen's Own Buffs, The Royal Kent Regiment</b> and was the last separate unit to bear the distinct honours of The Buffs.

<li>During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Albuhera_6e9c.html" title="Battle of Albuhera">Battle of Albuhera</a>, the 3rd Regiment, serving as part of Colborne’s brigade, was caught in a heavy rainstorm. Then they were caught in the open by French cavalry, their muskets rendered useless by the downpour. Before they could form square, the cavalry had ripped through their ranks and began slaughtering them. <b>Ensign Thomas</b>, who had earlier rallied his company after his captain was wounded and captured, was carrying the Regimental Colour. He was later surrounded and was called upon to surrender. Crying “Only with my life,” he only gave up the Colour after being cut down and mortally wounded (though it was later recaptured by <i>Sergeant Gough</i> of the <b>1st Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers</b>). He was buried after the battle by a sergeant and a private of his company, the only two men out of an original complement of 63 to survive the battle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also during the <b>Battle of Albuhera</b>, a similar act of heroism was to unfold. <i>Ensign Charles Walsh</i> was carrying the King’s Colour. The pikestaff of the Colour had been broken by cannon shot, his escort had fallen and he was surrounded and badly wounded. Just before he was about to be taken prisoner, <b>Lieutenant Latham</b> rushed forward and seized the Colour from him with his left hand and defended it with heroic gallantry with his sword in the other, refusing to yield it to the enemy. Then a French Hussar seized the staff and struck Latham with a sabre blow that severed one side of his face and nose but he still continued to struggle. A second sabre stroke severed his left arm, but Latham seized the staff with his right hand and continued to resist until he was thrown down, trampled on and pierced several times with lance thrusts. At this moment a British Cavalry regiment, <b>The 4th (Queen's Own) Dragoons</b>, arrived and drove off the French troopers. Latham then exerted the little strength left to him to conceal the Colour in his jacket, where it was later found. Latham survived his grievous wounds and not only recuperated but stayed in the army until he retired in 1820. As a reward for his gallantry and his heroic defense of the Colour, Latham was given a special promotion to Captain and was later presented with a gold medal by his brother officers. A trophy depicting the scene made in sterling silver, called the "Latham Centerpiece", was designed for the 3rd Regiment's Officer's Mess; it is now in the Regimental museum along with Latham's gold medal.</li>

<p>The Buffs is one of five regiments that can march through the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a> with drums beating, bayonets fixed, and colours flying. This is due to a Royal Warrant written in 1672 allowing them to raise volunteers "by beat of drum" in the City of London. Since recruiting parties paraded in full array accompanied by company or regimental musicians and marched with a colour, this right was given to the regiment as a whole.</p>
