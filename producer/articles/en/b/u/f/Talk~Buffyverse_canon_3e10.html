<p>1)i think that the orgign is three parts and not four<br />
2)i personally finds the canon notes in wikipedia very usefull. it's obvious that somepeople think that only the onscreen is canon and that some thinks that only the comics writen by actors are canon and that basicly for every combination there is somewhere someone who thinks that this is the real canon. what i really want to know is what the majority of buffy fans regard as canon. and i'm getting it, thanks&#160;:) --84.109.54.117 00:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no fixed 'canon' for the Buffyverse, it is a subjective term. Unlike <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_canon_254b.html" title="Star Wars canon">Star Wars canon</a> no authority has come out and defined which materials are and are not canon. The star wars canon is indisputable since its creator has formally organised it (see web page). In fact Whedon does not seem interested in doing as such. Just like the church centuries ago did not have a defined 'canon', and different people argued about what should and should not be 'canon'. At one point early in Christianity, many people argued that 'Revelation' should never be canon, but now to Catholics it is. I personally believe that when Whedon or Mutan Enemy are involved with the writing it becomes canon, and all else is secondary canon that takes place in a similar but parrallel universes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Buffy fans refuse anything as canon that is not onscreen.</li>
<li>Some Buffy fans I know refuse that <i>Haunted</i> is canon because they dislike the Mayor's role in it despite it being written by Espenson.</li>
<li>I personally don't think something being written by an actor/actress makes it canon, but can still respect the opinion that it does.</li>
</ul>
<p>... and so on. 'Canon' can be different to different people until there is a consensus (which there is not for the Buffyverse).</p>

<p>The purpose of an encyclopedia should be to consider all points of view not just the dominant ones. Should the abortion article just focus on republican views? Should the Palestine article be written only from a Jewish perspective? A good encyclopedia should remain neutral or deal with all points of view without rubbishing any of them. In the same way there does not have to be a problem.</p>
<p>In other words I am saying wikipedia is capable of dealing with the whole Buffyverse not just the canon Buffyverse. In fact Wikipedia's explicit policy is <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Buffy fans have the right to access to information about 'uncanon' sources as about 'canon' sources. they also deserve unjudgmental access. I believe I have recently been dealing with 'canonical issues' in a reasonable and neutral way based on actual cited sources and therefore do not require heavy editing unless there is a consensus on the discussion page of one of my articles for a particular direction? I think it would be better if when commenting on whether material is cannon, that is done in such a way that people who are fans of such material are not rubbished. Use of language, that implies that 'uncanon' material is inferior, unimportant, or a waste of time is not showing <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>, and shows disrespect to those who read the materials, and even more disrespect to those writing articles about them. I personally do not see the problem with using information from uncanonical sources as long as it is clearly referenced.</p>

<p>was wondering what the problem with mentioning the comics written by <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_Enemy_Productions_9c26.html" title="Mutant Enemy Productions">Mutant Enemy Productions</a>. This information seems worthy of including, after all i was hoping the article could be comprehensive and inclusive as possible, and surely the article is not overly long? so why not include this text???&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Several of the comics have been written by script-writers of <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_Enemy_Productions_9c26.html" title="Mutant Enemy Productions">Mutant Enemy Productions</a>, and do not seem to contradict any information from the 'Buffyverse canon'. Some fans argue that any/all of these might also be considered canon. For example:</dd>

Also having this information from the article deleted means it even more unbalanced, it now has 150 words devoted to 'canon' section. and 792 words devoted to 'uncanon' section! Therefore in my opinion it seems it should be included?</p>

<p>This entire article currently appears original research. It cites as the sole arbiter of canonicity "the fans," who are not a verifiable source to my knowledge. Was some poll done of them? Is there some other way for the reader to check the consensus of fans? Absent that, this would need to be referred against a definitive list of canonical material from Whedon or some other authoritative source (As happened with Star Wars and Babylon 5). Otherwise, the entirety of this article is speculation. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:02, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The designation and treatment of canon and non-canon stuff seems to be a major point of community debate. Folks argue over what is and is not canon. Folks edit and remove non-canon stuff exuberantly, to the chagrin of editors who believe that non-canon material should be included (while being labeled for what it is). This article presents a fundamental aspect of the debate while not attempting to provide an authoritative, definitive word. I do see your point, and I think it is important to talk about this issue some more since it weighs heavily on what material editors are "allowed" to add to buffyverse pages (see extensive debates, most notably comments by Paxomen), and hopefully fellow editors can find some cites from authoritative folks. But I don't consider this article to be entirely speculation, it is trying to make a comprehensive list of buffyverse and nonbuffyverse materials and examine the involvement/approval of "show" folks in their creation, as well as examining continuity issues. I also think it is important to have a page like this (it has survived a deletion attempt, indicating that at least some people agree) in order to provide editors with SOME sort of reference for what should be included in character bios and show pages, as well as add some predictibility about what is going to be summarily removed by canonites (term used affectionately). I haven't worked on this page but I have considered it a helpful reference while working on buffyverse editing and hope that these issues can be discussed further to make wiki-buffyverse more comprehensive and complete. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 15:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this is meant to be a content guideline, it should probably be moved to the Wikipedia namespace as a subpage of the Buffy WikiProject. It certainly doesn't seem to come anywhere close to an encyclopedia article at present, although it would, I think, provide a very useful guideline for the project. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Phil. One thing that was glossed over in the deletion debate above is that SW/ST canon is established pretty rigidly by their parent companies. The quote from Joss Whedon pretty much states that he doesn't pay that much attention to it, and thus the majority of this information is speculation. A subset of it would be undoubtedly useful to the WikiProject, but as an article-space page... I don't think it's suitable. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 15:46, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update 2: I just gave the article the major overhaul I think it needed - I had to remove a lot of comments that were OR. It means that there are no sections of the article where it is stated "This is considered canon" or "This is not considered canon" unless that can be backed up. I reckon that this article is <i>just</i> about deserving to keep its place on the mainspace. I found some good sources where Whedon and writers refer to 'the canon'. - <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 15:50, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm having a hard time understanding this sentence from the "Buffy promo (Christmas)" section, and as I have no knowledge of this promo, could someone fix it? The issue that I have is with the sentence: "It would have to take place shortly after Amends, since snow in Sunnydale is highly unusual however it is clearly not canon since both the narrator and Buffy actively break the Fourth wall." So my question after reading it is: what's not canon, the snow or the promo? Could someone please fix the unclear run-on sentence? Zekintha 04:55, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Due to the recent overhaul of the article that section of text no longer exists. What was meant though was that the promo overtly broke the fourth wall and therefore did not fit in with the continuity of the series. The promo featured Buffy and Angel in a Snowy location which might potentially have been Sunnydale following the events of the episode "Amends" when it actually does snow in Sunnydale. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 00:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
