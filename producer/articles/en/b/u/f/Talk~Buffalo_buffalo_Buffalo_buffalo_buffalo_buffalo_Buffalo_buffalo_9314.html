<p>I've often wondered about this supposed sentence. How is this gramatically valid? Using "Buffalo" for the city, "bison" for the animal, and "bewilder" for the verb, how would one write it? "Buffalo bison Buffalo bison bison bewilder Buffalo bison"? It seems to stop making sense round about the fifth buffalo. In the "translation", what does the clause "whom other bison from the city in New York intimidate" correspond to? What in the original sentence is the syntactical equivalent of "whom"?- <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 19:16, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one below has answered your quesiton plainly. You're interpreting the sentence wrong. Your third "bison" should be "bewilder": "Buffalo bison Buffalo bison bewilder bewilder Buffalo bison". The clause "whom other bison from the city in New York intimidate" refers to the parenthesized words here: "Buffalo bison (Buffalo bison bewilder) bewilder Buffalo bison". The subject of the sentence is "Buffalo bison Buffalo bison bewilder"; the verb is "bewilder" and the object is "Buffalo bison". Turning back to the subject, it could be written more clearly as "Buffalo bison whom Buffalo bison bewilder". Does that help?</dd>

<p>Regarding the fish-and-chips example under English: surely adding quotation marks in the initial part of the phrase totally defeats the point of the sentence, namely "wouldn't it be better if there *were* quotation marks"? I'm going to remove them, do feel free to discuss this if you think I'm incorrect. Philosophicles 13:25, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's right. And, if you change the sentence to "Red-headed boys, blonde girls tease, tease brunette girls", it's no longer a sentence. "Red-headed boys, whom blonde girls tease, tease brunette girls" <i>is</i> a sentence, but it's a different one, actually, since it is talking now about <i>all</i> the red-headed boys (and it so happens that they are all teased by the blonde girls), rather than the subset of red-headed boys who are teased by the blonde girls.

<p>Buffalo-city buffalo bully/buffalo bison (that) proper-noun-Buffalo (do) buffalo is as far as you can get legitimately. You cannot omit the descriptors and adjectives legally. I cannot see that this is a legal sentence at all. If one really <i>needs</i> this kind of Mensa-cruft, try "That that that that is is that that that that is," or Elvis Costello's "People pleasing people pleasing people like you" (which is legitimate and only omits potential hyphens), but not this. There are too many missing terms for this to be valid. To say, "With enough tinkering you can understand this" is not the same thing as saying "this is a <b>syntactically</b> valid sentence." As for "grammatically correct," that's out of the question, as the suggested parsings show us that there are several elements that need punctuating. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>sentences like this have been around for far longer than 1992, as claimed in the article. when i attended Hampshire College Summer Studies in Math/Cognitive Science in 1984 and 1985, sentences like "buffalo buffalo buffalo" (and longer variants) were commonly used to test parsers that students wrote (usually in Lisp). other variants were "fish fish fish", "char char char" ("char" is a type of fish) and "French french French".</p>

<p>I'm thinking of asking User:Xiorlanth directly since he/she added it but can someone help me make sense of this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Malay lovers can say "Sayang, sayang, sayang sayang sayang. Sayang sayang sayang?", which translates to "Darling, I love you. Do you love me?". This is a true homophone as the same word is used for pronoun and verb. The person being asked can even reply "Sayang," or "Sayang sayang sayang," in return.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's been a while since I've used my Malay much but I can't think why there is two sayangs (sayang, sayang,) in the first sentence. Unless it's supposed to be saying "Darling, darling, I love you" in which case we should make this clear...

<p>I was looking at this article, and noticed a (basic) grammatical mistake in the 'Fuck' example (because it was the only one I could actually understand.) The sentence read; "Fuck! Fucking fuckers fucking fucked!"</p>
<p>until (just as I was about to) someone fixed it to; "Fuck! Fucking fucker's fucking fucked!"</p>
<p>Considering this, is there a possibility that most of the examples in the article are flawed? I, personally think that most of them seem to be incorrect (e.g. I would have capitalised Buffalo at different places in the sentence.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think "Fucking fuckers fucking fucked" is in simple past tense with a plural subject, while "Fucking fucker's fucking fucked" has a singular subject in either present perfect simple or simple present tense, right? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 16:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 'Fuck' example seems to miss the point. Using derivational morphology to turn 'fuck' into 'fucking' and 'fucker' is cheating---the point of the original example ('Dogs dog dogs') is that 'dog', without any additional morphology, is both a noun and a verb and can be used both ways in a single sentence. Of course, the point of switching to 'buffalo' is that 'buffalo' doesn't even require any additional inflectional morphology to make a grammatical example. Luckily, 'fuck' is both a noun and a verb, even without any additional morphology, so if you want, you could have this example:</p>
<p>Fucks fuck fucks</p>

<p>I believe the more precise term for the different usage of the word is "homonym" not "homophone".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well <i>maybe</i>...
<ul>
<li><b>Homonyms</b> are words that either sound the same or are spelled the same but which have different meanings.</li>
<li><b>Homographs</b> are words that are spelled the same but which have different meanings. eg Bow (of a ship - pronounced like 'bough') and Bow (and arrow - pronounced like 'beau'). All Homographs are by definition also Homonyms.</li>
<li><b>Homophones</b> are words that sound the same but which have different meanings. eg To, Too and Two. All Homophones are also Homonyms.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But Buffalo, buffalo and buffalo are spelled alike <i><b>and</b></i> sound alike - so they are Homophones <i><b>and</b></i> Homographs <i><b>and</b></i> Homonyms. To call them <i>homophones</i> is to miss that they are also spelled alike and to call them <i>homographs</i> would miss the fact that they are pronounced the same way. Calling them <i>homonyms</i> is a little vague since you don't know whether the words are spelled alike or sound alike or both. Whichever word you choose misses a little of the information - but in this case, all three are correct. I suppose you could argue that the city of Buffalo is always capitalised so it's not a homograph of buffalo (the animal) or buffalo (the verb) - so I guess you could just about maybe kinda uber-pedant your way into arguing that <i>homograph</i> is out of the running - and I suppose that would make <i>homophone</i> fractionally more precise than <i>homonym</i> but that's one hell of a stretch. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:40, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I regularly roam Wikipedia inserting {{references}} at the drop of a hat. But somehow this feels different to me.

<dd>I agree with Colin; it seems like the "no original research" rule shouldn't apply here, as supplying examples isn't research per se. But I have a further question, and would like some feedback from the community. I posted a sentence, "That that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected," which has since been deleted (EDIT: it's back up). What's more questionable, however, is that I included a discussion of the sentence, which crosses into the realm of original research. Mitigating this, however, is (1) that the discussion itself served as further exemplification of use-mention distinction and recursive referencing in English, and (2) that, as a professor, I am the type of "expert" who actually does get quoted on these matters, but simply citing myself doesn't seem appropriate. I'm not sure what the policy should be here. For reference, here is my prior addition:
<dl>
<dd>"That that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected." If you'd understood that sentence, then you'd have seen that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been that that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been referring to. This result being on its own relatively unforseeable, we might even say that that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been that that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been referring to had been unexpected. That "that that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been that that "that that that that had been had been that that that had been had been unexpected" had been referring to had been unexpected" had been a valid sentence can be seen by rephrasing it as "the fact that the sentence "the fact that that was what it was was unexpected" was a sentence which refers to itself would not be likely to have been foreseen"</dd>

<p>One can devise an endless number of such "facts". Unless the example is discussed in some reputable publication, its notablility is questioned. There are millions of "facts" whih don't suit for wikipedia. there is a verifiable "fact" eg through DMV records that I register my car in California.

<p>Clearly it is not about "facts" (Mikka your lack of English comprehension really does call into question your qualification to adjudicate on this kind of article). What is needed is some criteria for inclusion. We don't want 600 examples. We want a reasonable number of the best. Finding a source is beside the point - that way we can end up with serveral hundred feeble but sourced examples. I suggest we limit the list to a dozen or so and only have the best dozen. Then we have nice arguments about relative quality, but so what. (Look at all the weak and "so what' examples in other languages. They should be trimmed.

<p>The following example was deleted as original research</p>
<ul>
<li>The only sentence in English that has 'because' three times in successive order: Some people say that one cannot begin a sentence with because because because is a conjunction. However, the preceding claim is incorrect: There is no "only" sentence having three consecutive occurrences of the word "because", because "because" can be used three times in a row in any number of valid sentences. Furthermore, because "because because because" is valid, this sentence goes on to show that "because because because because" is valid. And because "because because because because" is valid, *this* sentence shows that "because because because because because" is valid. And so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Howevere I decided it is worth saving for history, because it reveals the power of quotation to create sentences of this type, — which is already present in the classical "had had had" example. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:48, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I couldn't reproduce the results, unfortunately (I get less than 100 results for a large number of <i>buffalo</i>s. But I do remember reading that when there are more than 10 words between the quotes, Google ignores some (I'm not sure which). Did you check whether some of those 94,300 pages actually have 17 <i>buffalo</i>s? I also seem to recall that when you use * (to replace an unknown word), it isn't counted as a word. So you could try searching for "buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo * * * * * * * buffalo buffalo buffalo", and hope that the stars will actually correspond to <i>buffalo</i>.</dd>

<p>The 10-word version introduces a new verb "Buffalo buffalo", which Rapaport likens to "Tennessee waltzing". For clarity, the following two sentences have similar syntax:</p>

<p>My understanding had always been that this example was interesting not just because it was a really long sentence using only one word-form, but because arbitrarily long sentences of this type were all grammatical, i.e., every sentence buffalo<sup>n</sup>, n &gt;= 1, is grammatical and interpetable. Thus some of the supposedly similar examples like "two to two to two two" or "malo malo malo malo" are not quite the same, because they can't be extended unboundedly. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Chiang_7aad.html" title="User:David Chiang">David Chiang</a> 00:06, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding is correct, according to <i>Sweet Reason: A Field Guide to Modern Logic</i> by Tim Tymoczko and Jim Henle. It's a great book, and I highly recommend it.

<dd>Please allow me to disagree. The author of "buffalo" himself explains that the example was designed in the context of the observation that if one rearranges words in a sentence, then one produces a very small number of grammatical sentences, "with a few weird exceptions". The "buffalo" was an example of such exception: a sentence however you rearrange the words in it still stays grammatical. I didn't add this into article because this explanation was in a non-reputable source: mailing list or something, which are not allowed in wikipedia. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:53, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does that still hold true with the capitalization of the city Buffalo? Though I suppose that the only feature Buffalo the city adds to the sentence is another part of speech (adjective) that also can make a more easily parsable longer sentence. The proposition still holds with just using buffalo (without capital) as noun and verb. I think, while your point is interesting, the concept of the article is more about "homonymic/phonic sentences." However, if you're able to reliably source the idea, it would be an interesting article by itself.</dd>

<p>Synesthetic asked me for another parse tree, for the longer Buffalo sentence (B11, I think). I can also do this for the similar, but simpler sentence "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo", basically the same structure, but with the common nouns unmodified by the proper noun. This may help people understand the more complicated sentence.

<dd>They should be well-known <b>and</b> also try to be as interesting as the original "Buffalo buffalo …" sentence, which really involves a lot of interacting phenomena (homophony, zero plural, zero verb derivation, unmarked relative clauses, noun-noun compounding) to produce a dumb but grammatical sentence. The Polish examples only show that you can put two homographs side by side and the resulting combination sometimes makes sense. I suspect this is not hard to find in Polish, since a lot of genitive plural feminine and neuter nouns look just like masculine nominative singular nouns (the two examples given are instances of this pattern, and I just found "but but" and "mat mat" just flipping through the dictionary for 2 minutes — they don't mean much, but maybe a Polish speaker with 2 minutes would find more). Or how about "bez bez" (without meringues) and then, "chcę bez bez bez" (I want the lilac without meringues)? It's funny, but it doesn't go any further than that. Now if somebody reveals that "<i>Szczęk, szczęk szczęk szczęk? Szczęk szczęk szczęk-szczęk szczęk!</i>" is a perfectly understandable Polish dialogue, then I <b>love</b> it.

<p>The <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/3/3-175.html#1" class="external text" title="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/3/3-175.html#1" rel="nofollow">original email</a> features a longer version involving the verb 'to Buffalo buffalo'; to intimidate in a Buffolian way (c.f. to Tennesse waltz). This would make the sentence 'Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo'. Worth including? It does have a nice symmetry to it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the suggestion that "to Tennessee waltz" is a legitimate verb was rather tongue-in-cheek in that email.

<dd>I do buy that "Tennessee waltz" is a legitimate verb in a certain community or culture (of dancers). The same is not true for "Buffalo buffalo," at least not yet (not even in the Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo-editing community). I certainly don't accept it. In fact, to me, it makes it less interesting because then the basic "unit" of the sentence is "Buffalo buffalo" with only 5 repetitions and two different meanings. In the original, we have 8 repetitions of "buffalo" with three different meanings, which is more interesting to me than the symmetry of the other example. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaimeLesMaths_f7a6.html" title="User:JaimeLesMaths">JaimeLesMaths</a> 00:22, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read the earlier discussion under the section "homophones" - it's really not right to call the entire category of these things "homophones" when some of the cases are "homographs" and other cases (such as the 'buffalo*8' sentence in the title) are clearly both homophones AND homographs. "homonym" is a much better term IMHO.

<p>I am interested in doing the audio recording for this article. However, there are some obstacles.

Second, I wouldn't be able to sound like a native speaker for the parts in the "other languages" section. While normally that would disqualify me, I don't know if we can find anyone who could do that in the world. I could finesse the European languages, I supposed, but it would be really off for the Filipino and Chinese ones.

<p>I deleted the section once again, and asked that anyone reverting it please post here, so hopefully we should get an answer as to why it keeps reappearing.</p>
<p>Reasons for deleting this reference:</p>
<p>1) This section has no point but to bring up a topic which is, self-admittedly, not in the domain of this article. 2) This article, as has been established in previous corrections and debates, is not at all about repetitive words, but is about a complex, grammatically correct sentence which is interesting for reasons of grammar. Not only is the topic of the section outside the domain of the article, it in fact has nothing to do with the article. 3) It falls into the trap of original research, with no sources given or possible. In addition, the first sentence is a subjective measure of how many repititions are in modern songs. This is not something that should be in an encyclopedia.</p>

<dd>I agree—this article has turned into a mess of original research, barely related to the sentence in question.

<dd>Song lyrics is not original research.

<p>I can't find a published source for this example (I think it was only recently pointed out), so I am putting it here instead, and will leave it to others to decide if it can be included.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The fell fell, from the fell fell.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This uses four meanings of the word fell, and can in fact be parsed to have <i>two</i> different meanings. The four meanings of fell are: (a) the noun 'fell' (an animal hide); (b) the noun 'fell' (referring to a, sometimes barren, upland area); (c) the adjective 'fell' (something deadly and dangerous); (d) 'fell' as the past tense of the verb 'to fall'.</p>
<p>Using these labels, the two meanings of the sentence are:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The fell<sup>c</sup> fell<sup>a</sup>, from the fell<sup>b</sup> fell<sup>d</sup>.</li>
<li>(2) The fell<sup>a</sup> fell<sup>d</sup>, from the fell<sup>c</sup> fell<sup>b</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second meaning may be slightly silly, as a deadly animal hide would not really form part of a rational sentence, and similar objections may be raised for the first meaning of a deadly upland area. But I'd be interested to see what others think.</p>
<p>This construction has also been mentioned at the language reference desk. I may be able to dig up the link to that discussion (it was probably earlier in 2006) if anyone wants it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first time I heard this kind of sentence was "Oysters Oysters Oysters Eat Eat Eat" (To crack it, look at the base case: Oysters Eat, which is clearly grammatically correct/ The second case, Oysters Oysters Eat Eat simple means "The Oysters (that Oysters Eat) Eat" From there, it is easy to take this onto infinity. Oysters Oysters Oysters Eat Eat Eat would mean "The Oysters (that Oysters (that Oysters eat) eat) eat") Should this example be added to the main page? It seems like it fits the original topic, that is, a gramitcally correct phrase consisting of just one word, much better than many of the other english examples listed, which often instert other words inbetween the repeated words or simply use words that sound the say. --Sirclucky 02:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Any relative clause in English can be repeated indefinitely in this way, and it is thus not notable or unique to any word or combination of words in the language. The only interesting thing the above phrase does is make use of the fact that 'eat' can be both a transitive and intransitive verb, in order to use it in both capacities. But as I explain in the 'limits' section of the article, the problem with using this tactic is that the nesting of relative clauses is usually considered syntactically incomprehensible in English, even if it does not technically break any fundamental syntactic rules. What is special about <i>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo</i> is that it creates a sentence of maximal length *without* the use of nested relative clauses. --<a href="../../../y/s/t/User%7EYst_e353.html" title="User:Yst">Yst</a> 08:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cantonese is also a tonal language, which is not made clear. In fact, it uses more tones than Mandarin does. I would modify the entry so it is clear but I don't know if the Cantonese phrase which is presented is ever used as a teaching tool. Does anyone know?</p>

<dd>I agree. There's lots of great stuff here, but the article itself is too poorly defined in scope and content, and the criteria for inclusion of material too vague, for this article to be called a good and finished work --<a href="../../../y/s/t/User%7EYst_e353.html" title="User:Yst">Yst</a> 04:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do, and here's why: This article, unlike most Wikipedia articles, shows an amazing display of the unique culture that Wikipedia supports, without breaking any of the rules. While some of the material is less necessary, it does not actively harm the article. Also, the article is notable, well visited, and academic, in some regard. It provides the information in a non-biased way, and well frames the hilarity of the actual topic. While it might be seen as slightly less-than-professional to keep this article, or to promote it, it points out some of the major benefits that the wiki has to other encyclopedic mediums- allowing knowledge to be spread despite it not being strictly (and arbitrarily) professional. I don't only believe that this article should be lifted to Good Article status, I think that someone should prepare it to be used as a front page. --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerty8472_5999.html" title="User:Werty8472">8472</a></dd>

<p>Okay, if I'm understanding the sentence as "NewYork bison (who) NewYork bison intimidate(comma) intimidate (other) NewYork bison, then the image parse-tree is incorrect. "New York" as a city is a proper noun, but as "New York subway tunnel," it'd be a proper adjective. For the buffalo sentence, Buffalo(city) is a modifier for buffalo(bison). Could someone fix it, and fix the tags to match?(I'll try but I've never uploaded an image before) Unless of course I'm horribly mistaken, in which case please explain in small words. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantras_f651.html" title="User:Cantras">Cantras</a> 05:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, a noun does not become an adjective simply because it modifies another noun (which nouns do rather a lot in English), it becomes a noun adjunct within the compound, and remains a noun. "Buffalonian" would be an Adjective. "Buffalo" is never an adjective. The semantic test for this is the placement of the word following a copula used in an attributive capacity, in which case only an adjective is acceptable (whereas either an adjective or a noun adjunct may modify a noun within a noun phrase). "Those bisons are Buffalonian" is acceptable, as "Buffalonian" is an adjective, while "Those bisons are Buffalo" is nonsense (they are a city?), as Buffalo, here as anywhere else, is merely a noun which, like all English nouns, can be used as a modifier within a noun phrase, or in apposition to one, but not elsewhere. --<a href="../../../y/s/t/User%7EYst_e353.html" title="User:Yst">Yst</a> 10:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Indeed, for any n ≥ 1, the sentence buffalon is grammatically correct.[3] The shortest is 'buffalo!', meaning either 'bully (someone)!', or 'look, there are buffalo, here!' For n = 0 could be argued to be a valid garden path sentence; one's definition of 'sentence' may or may not include "" as a valid sentence.

<p><i>Bison from Buffalo, New York, who are intimidated by other bison in their community, also happen to intimidate other bison in their community.</i></p>
<p>I feel like the commas (besides "Buffalo, New York") shouldn't be in this sentence. Having them there makes it sound like the first mention of bison is talking about all bison, when it's supposed to be only a subset (a buffalo can't intimidate itself, presumably). I think this is a case of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_relative_clauses.html#Restrictive_or_non-restrictive" title="English relative clauses">restrictive vs. nonrestrictive clauses</a>? The "who are intimidated by other bison in their community" is necessary to restrict "bison" to the right ones... it's not additional unnecessary description and shouldn't be set off with commas.</p>
