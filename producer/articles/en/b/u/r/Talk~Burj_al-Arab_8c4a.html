<p>on one caption in this article, it says the "disc at top" is a helicopter landing pad. I don't have a "source", but a picture I saw showed it from above to be an exotic tennis court. So it being a helicopter landing spot may be inaccurate.</p>

<dd>It is, according to several different sources. I didn't believe it either, at first. -- Robert
<dl>
<dd>It is the Worlds tallest building used fully as a hotel. There are some taller buildings in the world which have hotels in them, but the buildings are also used for other purposes. There is a building in China or Canada which has a hotel located from some 44th floor and above, but the lower floors are not meant for Hotel purpose. Also, there is a purpose built hotel building in North Korea, which was built as the tallest hotel building in the world (taller than the Burj al Arab) but it is not operational yet, due to some political and economic reasons. Hence, it is not yet the tallest hotel in the world.

<p>I really doubt this statement:</p>
<p>"So expensive was the hotel's design and construction that it is estimated that to reach breakeven, it must be entirely booked for 400 years."</p>
<p>Because at an average of $2000/night x 202 rooms x 365 days equals about $200,000,000 in revunue/year alone. Plus, what company is going to build a hotel that won't turn a profit in anyone's lifetime. That's just absurd. -- <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueue_4258.html" title="User:Queue">Queue</a> 17:45, Sep 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're forgetting a few things. 1) Operating costs. You're assuming that ever dollar made by the hotel is profit. This is far from true -- it's not cheap to keep up such a large and ornate building. (remeber that one million liter fish tank?) 2) No company built the Burj al-Arab. It was built by the government to put Dubai on the map -- much like the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burj_Dubai_5174.html" title="Burj Dubai">Burj Dubai</a>, which also will probably not be profitable. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 21:04, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's true about the costs, and the operating expenses. That's one of the reasons it's like an "only in Dubai" type of place. The operating costs alone don't warrant it as a profitable business. But... it brings attention to Dubai and therefore business and travel, so... I guess that's the point.</p>

<dd>I agree that the current photo at the top is pretty dull, considering the splendor of the building, but I haven't been able to find one that Wikipedia would be allowed to use. There were some decent ones <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saudi/4101537/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saudi/4101537/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I think, but I'd rather have a poor photo than a somewhat better photo with a copyright pasted onto it. My reading of the license was that removing it would be a violation, even if the creator were still given credit. By the way, the lovely pool photo later in the article is almost surely a copyright violation, too.

<dd>I hate to say it, but it actually looked a little bit better in my browser before the latest change. <b>(I am not suggesting changing it back; it's no big deal either way, really.)</b> But I mention this because layout is often a product of which browser you use, what size browser window, and your Wikipedia skin. With Firefox 1.5.0.4 on MacOS 10.4.6 using Monobook, there is little difference between the two, but the text flowed a tiny better previously. So it might be a good idea to test a page in various browsers, windows, and skins to see how it looks.

<dd>Thanks for trying. It looks better now (main picture on top right and text now beginning on same level to the left of it) but is still not perfect (three smaller pictures do not float below main one but slightly offset towards the center). Using IE6/WXPMCE2K5SP2 right now. Maybe it looks great on an Apple or in Firefox but most folks still use IE6 so it should look acceptable there as well, IMHO.

<p>I was of the view that all of the suites faced the beach (or faced the ocean, or something), with the hotel being on an island set out from the city as it is. Is this true? Not much is said regarding the layout - isn't it part of a whole neighbourhood of man-made islands, with expensive houses to be reached by boat etc. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 00:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted the unrequested/undiscussed change of the infobox image. The older image is a much better and more representative photo of the building, showing the Burj's best-known profile. The other photo also duplicated the head-on view of the building which is the first photo in the Notable Attributes section. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 17:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>There was a considerable controversy regarding the claim that the structure looks like a huge Christian cross when viewed by anyone sailing into city. Some locals claim that this was an intentional move on the part of the British architects. This issue is more ironic when one considers that the Tower of the Arabs is widely considered to be Dubai’s most important landmark.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure if 'ironic' is quite the word here; there's no irony if it was intentional, and if not intentional then it's just an unfortunate blunder of some sort, if even that.

<p>This article seems to have some major problems with NPOV. The criticism section attacks the two criticisms it lists and ultimately concludes that all of the goals of the tower have been met without citing any sources. Many parts of the article read as though they were written by the Burj al-Arab marketing staff.</p>

<p>This article was flagged for a clean-up, so I did.</p>
<p>I amalgamated similar information, created more sensible categories, removed redundant pictures and moved interesting ones. I also made a passable attempt to re-word the whole article; it read like a brochure.</p>
<p>More information is required in the "Criticism" section, for which the main argument seems to be, "People hate the hotel because it's so awesome."</p>

<dd>Sorry, I missed this discussion. On reflection, you're right, the criticism is not extensive enough as it stands to merit a section. However, I think the sentence "Another critic includes the city of Dubai as well: “both the hotel and the city, after all, are monuments to the triumph of money over practicality. Both elevate style over substance.”[12]" should be incorporated into the rest of it. I'll do a draft. Sylvain1972 14:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, I think the section should stay. The section contains legitimate criticism, not in the sense of negative appraisals but criticism in the sense of reviews by architecture critics. I've changed the heading to try to convey this.

<dd>On most wikipedia articles that have the 'al' in them, which is Arabic for 'the', the general convention is to use the "X al-Y" format.

<dd>Even though the hotel's site renders it differently, the vast majority of citations I see in the media are to the form "Burj al-Arab" (with lower case "al-" and hyphen). <a href="../../../t/i/t/WP%7ETITLE_d4b7.html" title="WP:TITLE">WP:TITLE</a> says to use "what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize", and that "[n]ames of Wikipedia articles should be optimized for readers over editors; and for a general audience over specialists". In addition, all the relevant examples in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Arabic%29_1a3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Arabic)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Arabic)</a> show the standard transliteration as "X al-Y" as you mention.
