<p>The term "Burmese Indian" refers to a broad range of ethnic groups from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, most notably from present-day <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. The widely-accepted term <i>ka-la</i>, however, is considered derogatory. Its root is believed to be <i>ku la</i> meaning either "to cross over (the Bay of Bengal)" or "person" depending on the way it is pronounced. According to the History Professor U Than Tun, the 'Kala' is derived from “Ku lar” meaning the people who adhere to a caste system. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Their association with foreign rule and repression in the form of colonial courts, police and <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepoys.html" title="Sepoys">Sepoys</a> under the command of the British has been mainly responsible for a lasting animosity compounded by the more obvious difference in their physical appearance, unlike the Chinese who also happen to be Buddhists and historically regarded by the <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamar.html" title="Bamar">Bamar</a> as their cousins. White Europeans were also called <i>kala hpyu</i> (white kala) before British rule became established.<sup id="_ref-sy_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sy" title="">[2]</a></sup>The Indian was seen to be subservient and loyal to the white man giving rise to the expression, <i>Myin oungun, kyun kala, maya tawthu</i> - "a chestnut for a horse, a <i>kala</i> for a slave and a village girl for a wife".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

The majority of Indians arrived in Burma whilst it was part of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British India</a> as indentured labourers, civil servants, engineers, river pilots and traders.

<p><b>British colony Burma</b></p>
<p>During the British colonial administration of Burma, Indian Immigrants were brought in to run the almost all of the Government Services and to run the British companies. They also formed the military and civilian staff of the British Army and Burma Police Force. Some of them were clerks, almost in all the fields of manpower (skilled and unskilled). Others were doctors, engineers, hospital and medical workers, teachers, Burma Railway staff, river shipping staff, Post office staff and rice mill staff. Some were staff and workers for; mines, oil fields, banks, shops, treasury and Public Administration office. As private civilians, they also came in as; traders, various type of shop owners, servants, launders (dhobi), hotel and restaurant owners, dispatch boys, watchmen etc. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Hindi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hindi</span></h4>
<p>The "Hindi" are the people who speak Hindi language which is an Indo-Aryan language. There are conflicts between the Urdu speakers (mostly Muslims) and the Hindi speakers (mostly Hindus). The Hindi speakers are divided into a number of ethnic and social groups. The Hindus, who constitute the largest group, are divided into four main social groups called "castes", a hierarchical order based on the principles of "purity and pollution",as below_</p>
<ul>
<li>Brahmans, the priests and scholars</li>
<li>Kshatriyas, the rulers and warriors</li>
<li>Vaisyas, the merchants and professionals</li>
<li>Sudras, the laborers and servants</li>
</ul>
<p>These four castes have many sub-castes, which are further divided into circles. Castes are culture groups, based not only on occupations, but also on customs, manners, and habits. The majority of the Hindi speakers are Hindus, which is considered more a lifestyle than a religion. Hindus worship a pantheon of gods that are both good and evil. They believe that sacrifices and offerings must be made to the gods regularly to appease them and avoid calamity. Hinduism teaches that the soul never dies. When the body dies, the soul is reborn or "reincarnated." The soul may be reborn as an animal or as a human. They worship some gods in the form of animals. Cows are considered sacred, but other animals are also revered. The law of "karma" states that every action influences how the soul will be born in the next reincarnation. If a person lives a good life, the soul will be born into a higher state. If a person leads an evil life, the soul will be born into a lower state.</p>
<p>The Muslim Hindi-speaking women still follow the tradition of purdah, which is the covering of their entire bodies, especially their eyes, as a sense of seclusion. However, purdah is practiced to varying degrees depending on the extent of westernization and urbanization.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Brahmans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brahmans</span></h4>
<p>Brahmans are known as Ponnas in Burmese. They are priests and scholars of the highest ranking group or most purified among the cast system in India. Ancient Burmese Kings up to the present Military Rulers and most of the Myanmar Citizens used to rely them for advise as they are famous in Astrology and Palmistry. Burmese Kings used the service of the “White Ponna” and “Dark Ponna” as consultants for any advise in daily events up to the administration of the country e.g. for the Royal customs, rules and regulations. Sometimes they were given the post of the Royal Ministers. In Burmese folk tales and reigious stories, they were usually portrayed as villains.</p>
<p>The Buddhist kings of Indo-China had borrowed from Hinduism much of their court ceremonial. In Burma, Siam, Cambodia and Champa, and in a host of smaller states, Brahman astrologers and soothsayers were masters of the ceremonies. As interpreters of the omens and repositories of ancient tradition their influence was great. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Bengali">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bengali</span></h4>
<p>The Bengali came from Bengal region, that is Bangladesh and West Bengal, a state in India. Their native language is Bengali. Their culture remains diversified e.g. from various castes, such as the Brahman, Kayastha, Vaidya, Namasudra, Gandha Banik, Saadgop, Napit, Mahisya, Kanaani, and Subarnabanik. Their occupations and religions had created other cultural distinctions as well. The majority of Bengalis are Muslims (60%), while the rest are Hindu or Hinduized animists. The Bengali of Bangladesh are the largest group and are 99.9% Mulsims.</p>
<p>Bengali Hindu worship many gods. Cows, monkeys, snakes, and many other animals are sacred. They teach and practice yoga and believed in reincarnation (a continual cycle of death and rebirth). The law of karma states that every action influences how the soul will be born in the next life. The cycle continues until spiritual perfection is achieved. Then the soul enters moksha, a new level of existence, from which it never returns. Some of them are staying near the Myanmar- Bangladesh border and Mawlamyaing City, Mon State.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Gujarati and Soorti">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gujarati and Soorti</span></h4>
<p>The Gujarati came from the state of Gujarat, western India. Their language is Gujarati. They are a complex group, speaking various dialects and having many cultural distinctions. Some of these differences are based on region, while others are based on their "caste". They are often involved in trade or in operating small businesses.</p>
<p>The Hindus, who make up the largest group, are divided into a number of castes or jatis. They practice purdah i.e. the women are required to wear veils and remain isolated.</p>
<p>Approximately 30% of them are Muslims and those Gujarati Muslims are called Soorti. There are a lot of Soorti in Burma/Myanmar. Most of them are well to do merchants and entrepreneurs and industrialists.</p>

<p>While there are 25 million Orisi in India, some of them migrated to Bangladesh and Burma. The Orisi speak an Indo-Aryan language called Oriya and also known as Oriya. United Nations ex-Secretary General U Thant’s father is an Oriya.</p>
<p>Almost all the Oriya are Hindu. They used to pray to the deities, the "disease spirits," and the village gods. Gunias (magicians) practice witchcraft and sorcery. Extensive rituals and festivals are celebrated throughout the land. The Orisi believe that sickness is placed on people by evil spirits and witches. They also sustain the belief that planets and stars in the zodiac are responsible for an individual's physical and mental condition. They look to herbal folk medicines, exorcisms, and the gunias for cures from these and other illnesses. The Orisi believe that death is simply a passing from one life into the next. They believe that this cycle of death and rebirth will continue until the spirit merges with the person's "absolute soul." They believe that Yama, the god of justice, sends the soul to heaven or hell.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Tamil people from Tamil Nadu came to work in Burma during the British colonial rule. Telugu and Hindi speaking workers also migrated at that time. Burmese Tamils, Telugu and Hindi speakers had their own language magazines, schools and movie theaters for screening movies imported from India in their own mother tongue. The "immigrant population", although many had been living there for generations and have integrated with the Burmese society, became a target for discrimination and oppression by the new government formed after the military coup in 1962. The Myanmar Military Government closed down the Tamil, Telugu and Hindi magazines, schools, except for schools that were operated from temples and houses.<a href="http://www.geocities.com/tamiltribune/02/0702.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/tamiltribune/02/0702.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Gurkha, also spelt as Gorkha, are people from Nepal who take their name from the eighth century Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath. His disciple Bappa Rawal later moved further east to found the house of Gorkha, which in turn founded the Kingdom of Nepal.Many Gurkhas or Nepalese migrated out of Nepal and settled in various parts of northern India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. They speak Khas Kura language. Like other Hindu, the Nepalese belong to a "caste" structure which has only two categories: upper class landowners and lower class servants. Most of the Nepalese in Myanmar are farmers and most of them own the lands. They grew wet rice, dry rice, maize, millet, wheat and vegetable. Most of the farmers raise buffalo and goats for meat and cows for milk. Nepalese villages consist of loosely grouped homes surrounded by farm land. Some of them are staying in larger towns where the temples or monasteries are located.</p>
<p>Almost all of the Nepalese in Myanmar are Hindus, worshipping many gods. They believe in ghosts and demons. Many Gurkha or Nepalese arrived Burma with the British India Army. Gurkhas are best known for their history of bravery and strength in the British Army Brigade of Gurkhas and the Indian Army. They were designated by the British as a Martial Race. Martial Race is a designation created by officials of British India to describe "races" (peoples) that were thought to be naturally warlike and aggressive in battle, and to possess qualities like courage, loyalty, self sufficiency, physical strength, resilience, orderliness, hard working, fighting tenacity and military strategy. The British recruited heavily from these Martial Races for service in the colonial army.</p>
<p>Gurkhas Regiments served in the Second World War, most notably in Malaya and Burma where the Allies suffered the intense attacks from the Japanese. They had a heavy fighting in 1944 in the Arakan and during the Japanese offensive from March to June 1944 against north-east India at Kohima and Imphal. Imphal was besieged by the Japanese until the Allies achieved a decisive victory at Kohima in June and the Japanese fled back into Burma. The Regiment continued with the successful Allied offensive into Burma and on the 3 May the Burmese capital Rangoon was liberated. Gurkha soldiers have won 13 <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Crosses_b89d.html" title="Victoria Crosses">Victoria Crosses</a>.

<p>There are also known as Chetti, Chetty, Chety, Shetty or Setti. The first Chettiars arrived Burma during the British rule – in 1826 accompanying Indian troops and labourers during the British campaign in Tenasserim in the first Aglo-Burmese war. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> Their activities, however, were petty and remained so even after the first formal Chettiar ‘office’ was established in Moulmein in 1850. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> It was, however, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the passing of the Burma Land Act brought about the mass entry of Chettiars into Burma. By 1880 the Chettiars had fanned out throughout Burma and by the end of the century they had become by far the ‘the most important factor in the agricultural credit structure of Lower Burma’. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup> By 1905 there were about 30 Chettiar offices in Burma. According to the Burma Provincial Banking Enquiry Report (BPBE), the most dependable source on the extent of Chettiar operations, this number had increased to 1,650 by 1930. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup> Conveying more graphically the ubiquity of Chettiar offices, the BPBE concluded (1930a:203) that in ‘nearly every well-populated part of Lower Burma there is a Chettiar within a day’s journey of every cultivator’.</p>
<p>A community of moneylenders indigenous to Chettinad, Tamil Nadu,the Chettiars operated throughout the Southeast Asian territories of the British Empire. They played a particularly prominent role in Burma where, they were typically demonised as rapacious usurers, responsible for all manner of vices concomitant with the colonial economy. Not least of these was the chronic land alienation of the Burmese cultivator. Their role was crucial in the dramatic growth in Burma's agricultural output during the colonial era. Success of the Chettiars in Burma lay less in the high interest rates they charged, than it did to patterns of internal organisation that provided solutions to the inherent problems faced by financial intermediaries. A proper functioning financial system could have provided better solutions perhaps for Burma's long-term development, but Burma did not have such a system, then. Tersely and pointedly speaking, Chettiar banks are fiery dragons that parch every land that has the misfortune of coming under their wicked creeping.. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Without the assistance of the Chettiar banking system Burma would never have achieved the wonderful advance of the last 25 to 30 years…The Burman today is a much wealthier man than he was 25 years ago; and for this state of affairs the Chettiar deserves his thanks. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Chettiars were the crucial providers of the capital that turned Burma into the ‘rice-bowl’ of the British Empire. But they were seen as the moneylenders, vilified as predatory usurors whose purpose was to seize the land of the Burmese cultivator. The truth was that the Chettiars were the primary providers of capital to Burmese cultivators through much of the colonial period, but the combination of the collapse of paddy prices in the Great Depression, the Chettiar insistence of land as collateral, and the imposition of British land-title laws, did bring about a substantial transfer of Burma’s cultivatable land into their hands. The Chettiars did not charge especially high interest rates and, indeed, their rates were much lower than indigenous moneylenders. In the end the Chettiars were expelled from Burma, in the process losing the land they had acquired and much of their capital.</p>
<p>Chettiars had the role in the reclamation of the Irrawaddy Delta for rice growing. Burma’s emergence as the ‘rice-bowl’ of the British Empire came as a result of what Furnivall (1956:116) memorably lauded as the ‘epic bravery and endurance’ of the country’s cultivators in reclaiming the swamps and jungles of the Irrawaddy Delta. An epic motivated by Burma’s entry into the commercial imperatives of the British Empire, the conversion of the Delta into rich paddy-producing land initially required little capital. Britain’s great ‘exchange banks’ took care of shipping, milling and other export-finance needs, and up until the middle of the nineteenth century the amount of capital required ‘on the ground’ in land preparation was slight. As Adas (1974b:389)noted, <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup>in the early years of British rule in ‘Lower Burma’ the growth in rice exports was founded on cheap and surplus labour within cultivator families, and upon abundant land that required little more than clearing. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The majority of the Punjabi live in India and Pakistan; but they can also be found in nearly thirty other countries. Punjabi is an Indo-European language that is divided into six main dialects. It is primarily spoken in the major regions of India and Pakistan. Those who speak Punjabi language or those who inhabit the Punjab region are called Punjabi.</p>
<p>It is commonly said among the Punjabi that "land, women, and water are the sources of all conflicts." This simply means that they deem it necessary to control the means by which one perpetuates his family and property. The Diaspora Punjabi reflect the three major religions of their homeland: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Most of the Diaspora Punjabi speakers are Sikhs, except for those in Myanmar, who are mostly atheists. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion that was founded in northern India during the sixteenth century. Its teachings have combined the elements of both Hinduism and Islam in an attempt to find one god who transcends all religious distinctions. <a href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=108182&amp;rog3=BM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=108182&amp;rog3=BM" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In March 1944, the Japanese 31st Division moved northwestward in Burma's Naga hills and invaded Imphal and Kohima in India. Finally, after 64 days, amid terrible losses on both sides, the Japanese were beaten back. The determination and gallantry shown by allied troops in the Kohima siege was quick to become the subject of poem, song, and legend.Today in the Kohima cemetery, among the 1,378 grave markers, is the famous Kohima Memorial with its historic inscription:<br /></p>
<p>"When you go home<br />

<p>The Burma Star Association was founded in 1951 by Admiral the Lord Louis <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountbatten.html" title="Mountbatten">Mountbatten</a>, Field Marshal the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Slim_03b6.html" title="Viscount Slim">Viscount Slim</a> and other British Veterans of the Burma Campaigns. Admiral Mountbatten had been CinC of the Allied Southeast Asia Command (SEAC) with the late General Joseph C. "Vinegar Joe" <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stillwell.html" title="Stillwell">Stillwell</a> as Deputy CinC. Stillwell was also the Commander of the U.S. China-Burma-India Theater of Operations and Chief of Staff to Generalissimo <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Kai-sheck_e3b3.html" title="Chiang Kai-sheck">Chiang Kai-sheck</a> for all Chinese forces in the CBI. Then General William Slim Commanded the British XIV Army in India and Burma. Following the total defeat of Japanese Imperial forces in Southeast Asia General Slim is said to have told his troops: "When you go home don’t worry about what to tell your loved ones and friends about service in Asia. No one will know where you were, or where it is if you do. You are, and will remain ‘The Forgotten Army.’"</p>
<p>Reunions were held by various units (UK) in England and the China-Burma-India Veterans Association was formed in the U.S. In 1950 only, Admiral Montbatten started the Burma Star Organization. Admiral Mountbatten became the first patron, an honor held until his death by assassination in 1979. Current Royal Patron is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The first president was Field Marshal the Viscount Slim upon whose death was succeeded by his son, Colonel the Viscount Slim.</p>
<p>"I have never met a despondent Sikh in the front line. In a hospital in the rear he will moan dreadfully over a small wound, but in a fight he will go on to his last breath, and die laughing at the thought of Paradise, with the battle-cry of Khalsa ji ki jai as he falls.</p>
<p>"This very cry, a friend told me, came over a field telephone in the Arakan when a Sikh signal-havildar had been cut off beyond hope of rescue. The line remained alive. The havildar described to my friend how the Japanese were creeping up. A pause, then he came back to say that he had killed a skirmisher, but that now his ammunition was exhausted. "There’s not much time, Sahib. I’ll break the telephone before they get me. Victory to the Holy Brotherhood!" They found him dead beside an enemy he had brained with the butt of his Sten.</p>
<p>"A remarkable people, the Sikhs, with their Ten Prophets, five distinguishing marks, and their baptismal rite of water stirred with steel; a people who have made history, and will make it again."</p>
<p>"Every man in this magnificant battalion of the Indian State Forces [1st Patiala Regiment] stands 5 foot 11 inches, or over: they are the finest lot of Sikhs I have ever seen, and that is saying much. Every officer in the Lieutenant-Colonel Balwant Singh's battalion is a Sikh. In discipline, turn-out, and fighting efficiency the 1st Patialas have earned the unstinted admiration of all their comrades in the division." <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[17]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Finally, we that live on can never forget those comrades who in giving their lives gave so much that is good to the story of the Sikh Regiment. No living glory can transcend that of their supreme sacrifice, may they rest in peace. In the last two world wars 83,005 turban wearing Sikh soldiers were killed and 109,045 were wounded. They all died or were wounded for the freedom of Britain and the world and during shell fire, with no other protection but the turban, the symbol of their faith."</p>

<b>Pyu Kings are Maharajas</b></p>
<p>In Chinese Chronicles they recorded Pyu as ‘P’aio’. But Pyu Called themselves Tircul. <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[41]</a></sup>. There are records of Nan Cho and Tibet alliance in 755 AD to defeat Chinese. Nan Cho king Ko-lo-fen communicate with Pyu. Pyu Kings were called Maharajas and Chief ministers were called Mahasinas.</p>
<p>Nan Cho conscripted Pyu soldiers to attack of Hanoi in 863 AD. In 832 AD Nan Cho looted Han Lin village from Pyu. <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Pyu kings named Vishnu as in Gupta, India</b></p>
<p>Inscriptions in Pyu language using a South Indian script, showed a Vikrama dynasty ruling there at least from AD 673 to 718. <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[43]</a></sup>On Pyu’s stone inscriptions, kings names with Vikrama were suffix with Vishnu. The same tradition was noticed in Gupta era India 100 BC.and in Sri Kestia, Mon in south, Thai and Cambodia. Statue of Vishnu standing on Garuda with Lakshmi standing on the lotus on left. And Brahma, Siva and Vishnu thrones were also found. Name, Varman indicated that there was influence of Pallava of India. <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[44]</a></sup> The mentioning of Varman dynasty, an Indian name, indicated there was a neighbouring and rival city, but Old Prome is the only Pyu site so‘ far to be excavated in that area. <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
<b>Indian Dravidian tribe in Panthwa</b></p>
<p>In Chinese Chronicles Chen Yi-Sein instead gives an Indian derivation for Panthwa village, as the name of a Dravidian tribe settled in Mon’s areas around the Gulf of Martaban. This group was later one of the pioneers in a ‘Monized’ occupation of Beikthano village, which also led to the village/city being called Ramanna-pura, linked to Mon areas of southern Myanmar (1999:77). <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Tagaung dynasty is explicitly incorporated into the story of Duttabaung’s mother and father; the lineage of the Queen of Beikthano is less consistent, but always intertwined with that of the Sri Kestra village rulers. In all of these, links are made between territorial control, royal patronage of Hindu or Buddhist sects and supernatural events. ibid</p>

<p>The Arakanese chronicles claim that the Kingdom was founded in the year 2666 BC. <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was ruled by various legendary Indian dynasties and they made their capital at Dinnawadi (Dhanyavati), Wesali, Pinsa, Parin, Hkrit, Launggyet and Mrohaung along the river Lemro. <sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Wesali founded by Hindu Chandras</b></p>
<p>"The area known as North Arakan had been for many years before the 8th century the seat of Hindu dynasties. In 788 AD a new dynasty, known as the Chandras, founded the city of Wesali. This city became a noted trade port to which as many as a thousand ships came annually; the Chandra kings were upholders of Buddhism, ... their territory extended as far north as Chittagong;---- Wesali was an easterly Hindu kingdom of Bengal --- Both government and people were Indian. <sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[64]</a></sup> So far as Arakan is concerned, the inscriptions show traces of two early dynasties holding sway in the north. The earlier one, a Candra dynasty, seems to have been founded in the middle of the fourth century A.D. Its capital was known by the Indian name of Vaisali and it maintained close connections THE PRE-PAGAN PERIOD 9 with India. Thirteen kings of this dynasty are said to have reigned for a total period of 230 years. The second dynasty was founded in the eighth century by a ruler referred to as Sri Dharmavijaya, who was of pure Ksatriya descent. His grandson married a daughter of the Pyu king of Sri Ksetra. <sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
<b>Hindu statues and inscriptions in Wesali</b></p>
<p>The ruins of old capital of Arakan - Wesali show Hindu statues and inscriptions of the 8th century AD. Although the Chandras usually held Buddhistic doctrines, there is reason to believe that Brahmanism and Buddhism flourished side by side in the capital.</p>
<p><b>Chittagong is from Tsit-ta-gung</b></p>
<p>The Arab chief was the Thuratan, in the Arakanese utterance whom the king of Arakan Tsula-Taing Tsandra (951-957 AD.), claimed to have defeated in his invasion of Chittagong in 953 AD. In memory of his victory the Arakanese king set up a stone trophy, in the conquered land. And inscribed on it the Burmese word, "Tsit-ta-gung" meaning "there shall be no war". And from this remark of the monument, according to Burmese tradition, the district took its name, Chittagong. <sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Chittagong under Arakanese rule</b></p>
<p>Nearly a century, from about 1580 till 1666 AD Chittagong was under almost uninterrupted Arakanese rule. Arakanese captured and sent numbers of the inhabitants of Bengal into Arakan as agricultural and slave labours.</p>
<p><b>Arakanese known in Bengal as Maghs</b></p>
<p>The Buddhists Arakanese, known as Magh or Rakhine are descended from Aryans of Maghada, <b>India Mongolians mixed with the Tibeto-Burmans</b>. <sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 16th and 17th centuries the Arakanese (known in Bengal as Maghs) in alliance with the Portuguese constituted a plundering party. By dominating the riverine tracts they plundered and devastated large parts of southern and eastern Bengal. <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>They carried a large number of men, women and children from the coastal districts of Bengal, <sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[69]</a></sup> as captives and the Maghs (Arakanese) employed them as agricultural labour. It is well known that the Kingdom of Arakan was a sparsely populated area, which required huge amount of human labour for agriculture. With this intention the Arakanese employed a large number of captives in the villages of land on the bank of the Kuladan river to the Naf. This Kula population of the country form about 15 percent of the whole population. A.P.Phayre mentions, "the Kolas or Mossalmans, are of an entirely different race. They being of Bengalee descent. <sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Burmese settlement in Arakan</b></p>
<p>“The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century AD. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal. All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab”. <sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Arrival of Arab Muslims</b></p>
<p>The Arab Muslims first came into contact with Arakan through trade and commerce during the 8th century AD and since then Islam started spreading in the region. In those days the Arabs were very much active in sea-trade, they even monopolized trade and commerce in the East. <sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr. Mohammad Enamul Haque introduces another Arakanese chronicle, which informs us of an Arab settlement, in the tenth century AD. extending from the mouth of the Meghna to the North of the Naf riverin the East. <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the passing of time, the number of Muslims in Arakan began to increase. Gradually these Muslims have established very good and cordial relations with the local people and intermixed by marrying local women.</p>
<p>"They differ but little from the Arakanese except in their religion and in the social customs which their religion directs; in writing they use Burmese, but amongst themselves employ colloquially the language of their ancestors". <sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even, a Russian merchant, Athanasius Nitikin, who travelled in the East (1470) mentions regarding activities of some Muslim sufis of Pegu (<a href="../../../b/a/g/Bago.html" title="Bago">Bago</a>). The Merchant pictured Pegu as "no inconsiderable port, inhabited by Indian dervishes. <sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Ships wrecked at Ramree Island</b></p>
<p>In the history of the Arakanese kings, it is recorded that during the reign, of Arakanese king Mahat-y-ing Chandayat (780-810 AD.) several Kula or foreign ships were wrecked upon the island of Ramree, and the people who boarded on them were said to be Muslims. The Arakanese king ordered them to be settled in the villages of Arakan. <sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Narameikhla alias Solaiman Shah</b></p>
<p>However, Islam made its first major political and cultural impact during the early 15th century through Narameikhla, king of Arakan. He lost the war,run to India Mogul Empire for help. With the help of Muslim soldiers he was restored as a king and Narameikhla, took the title Solaiman Shah. <sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[77]</a></sup> and established a new dynasty, known as Maruk-u-dynasty, with its capital at Mrohaung. <sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Arakan coins with Islamic features</b></p>
<p>With effect from the year 1430 the kingdom of Arakan became tributary to Bengal and the kings assume a Muslim name and struck coins with Kalima (The declarition of Islamic faith of the single God, Allah and believef of His messange Mohammad- Peace be upon him.) <sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>"It is common for the kings, though Buddhist, to use Mohamedan designations in addition to their own names, and even to issue medallions bearing the Kalima, the Mohammedan confession of faith, in Persian script". <sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>This practice was prevalent among the Arakanese kings till the first half of the seventeenth century. This was because they not only wished to be thought of as sultans in their own rights, but also because there were Muslims in ever larger numbers among their subjects. A.P.Phayre observes that the practice of assuming Muslim name and inscribing Kalima in their coins was probably first introduced in fulfilment of the promise made by Mung-Somwun but was continued in later time as a token of sovereignty in Chittagong. <sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>He also mentions that "these they assumed as being successors of Mussalman kings, or as being anxious to imitate the prevailing fashion of lndia. <sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Muslim influence in Arakan since 1430</b></p>
<p>So the Muslim influence in Arakan may be said to date from 1430, the year of Narameikhla's restoration.During his reign an unexpected development took place, which paved the way for a period of Muslim domination in the land of Arakan. From this time onwards the relation of Muslims with the Arakanese became more intimate and for about two centuries Arakan was united in a bond of friendship with Islamic lands. As a result of the impact of the civilization of the Muslims, Arakanese culture also progressed and thus began the 'Golden Age' in the history of Arakan. <sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Muslims Massacred in Arakan</b></p>
<p>The next and last event was the flight of Shah Shuja, the brother of Aurangzeb, to Arakan in 1660, which brought a new wave of Muslim immigrants to the kingdom of Arakan and also caused politcal changes. Later on the prince and some of his soldiers were murdered on Feb., 1661. <sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Kaman or Kamanci</b></p>
<p>But “who escaped the massacre were later admitted into the king's bodyguard as a special archers unit called Kamans or Kamanci”. <sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1666 to 1710 the political rule of Arakan was completely in their hands, during which the Muslim Kaman units played a decisive role of king makers and king breakers. Their numbers were increased from time to time by fresh arrivals from upper India. <sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Buddhist Arakan Kings with Islamic names</b></p>
<p>All the kings of Arakan were said to be Buddhist. However to rule the 12 towns in the Bangal smoothly seven kings decided to have Arakanese and Mogul Islamic names. The interference of Ava and Pegu in the affairs of Arakan had important consequences for that country. The Ava king placed his son-in-law on the throne of Arakan. The Mons in return invaded the country, killed the Burmese nominee and replaced him with a ruler chosen by Razadarit. In 1430, however, with the assistance of Bengal, the exiled king, Narameikhla,returned and was reinstated as the vassal of the Mohammedan king of Gaur. He founded Mrohaung as his capital, and his, Mohammedan followers built a mosque there. From this time onwards the Arakanese kings, although Buddhists, used Mohammedan titles in addition to their own names, They even issued medallions bearing the Kalima, the Mohammedan confession of faith. The connection between Arakan and India became even more pronounced when in 1459 an Arakanese king occupied Chittagong. <sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>

<p>Burmese Indians had made their livelihoods as merchants, traders and shopkeepers as well as manual labourers such as coolies, dockers, municipal workers, rickshaw men, pony cart drivers, malis and durwans. They were also heavily represented in certain professions such as civil servants, university lecturers, pharmacists, opticians, lawyers and doctors. They had virtual monopolies in several types of businesses such as auto parts and electrical goods, ironmongery and hardware, printing and bookbinding, books and stationery, paper and printing ink, tailoring and dry-cleaning, English tuition, and money lending. They traded in textiles, gold and jewellery where the market was traditionally dominated by Burmese women.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Muslims">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Muslims</span></h3>
<p>Myanmar Indian Muslims formed one of the definite group among <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar_Muslims_dd83.html" title="Myanmar Muslims">Myanmar Muslims</a> or Burmese Muslims. Some people like to refer Burmese Muslims as the more advancely assimilated or original or oldest group amongst all the Muslims in Burma or Myanmar. That is because they are more "Burmanized" when compare to other groups. But nowadays, because of mixed marriages and intermarriages, it is some times difficult to differentiate who is who.</p>
<p>When we called them Indian Muslims or Myanmar Indian Muslims, we mean that they were descendents of the following countries - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Some even came from Afghanistan. Myanmar Indian Muslims are descendants of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turks.html" title="Turks">Turks</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors.html" title="Moors">Moors</a>, various groups of Indian-Muslims, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistanis.html" title="Pakistanis">Pakistanis</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathans.html" title="Pathans">Pathans</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengalis.html" title="Bengalis">Bengalis</a> intermarried with local Burmese and many ethnic Myanmar groups such as, <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakhine.html" title="Rakhine">Rakhine</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shan.html" title="Shan">Shan</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen.html" title="Karen">Karen</a>, Mon etc.</p>
<p>The various sub groups of Burmese Indian Muslims are; Soorti, Meimans, Chulia. Tamil, Bengali, Pakistan, Shia (originated from Iran), Dawoodi-Bhora community, Isaili Community, Malabar group,Hydrabud Muslims, Madarasi depending from their origin in India subcontinent.</p>
<p><b>Assimilation</b></p>
<p>They arrived, temporary or permanently settled and married with local Burmese and Myanmar ethnic minority girls and formed the core of the Myanmar Muslims. Mixed marriages, intermarriages and assimilation process of throwing away of almost all their foreign languages, foreign dresses and foreign culture slowly shaped them into Ethnic Myanmar Muslim group of today.</p>
<p><b>Limit of assimilation</b></p>
<p>But they had drawn a line in the ongoing process of assimilation. That limit is their religion, Islam. As practising Muslims they could not go beyond the limit of tolerance of Islamic principles. So Myanmar Muslims threw away Urdu and Bengali languages.Even Arabic is learned just to read Holy Koran and for prayers. Indian Myanmar Muslims now speak Myanmar as their mother tongue although earlier generation still speak Urdu, wear Myanmar dress and even have an official Myanmar name as well as Islamic Arabic name. <sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Nationalization</b></p>
<p>Most of the Indian Muslims who could not cut the umbilical cord went back to Indian subcontinent after General Ne Win took over and nationalized all the business. So who decided to continue to stay in Burma cut off the umbilical cord and have shown love to the new home, Burma. Now most of them are second and third generation or some of them were married to locals and almost totally assimilated into mainstream Myanmar Muslims. Now they lost contact with their roots and most of them are even not interested at all to trace their origin.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[89]</a></sup>&lt;</p>
<p><b>Myedu Muslims</b></p>
<p>Some of the earliest Myanmar Muslims or Zerbardi or Kala Pyo or Myedu Muslims or Myedu Kalas or Thone Thaung Khunhit Yar (=3700) were also actually from the Indian subcontinent of Asam and Manipura, brought in by the Burmese Kings as prisoners of wars. <sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[90]</a></sup> Some of the most assimilated or Burmanized Muslims in Burma took the name Pathi as the race and even try to put infront of their name as a prefix e.g. Pathi Ko Lay.</p>
<p>Pre-war Rangoon was dominated by Indians. Transport, trade to almost all of the service sectors, government and private alike was in the hands of Indians so that it was a must to master the Hindi or Urdu for even the Burmese Buddhists to survive in Rangoon, the capital of Burma. <sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1930 Census, British enlisted Muslims as Zerbardi Race. But most of the Muslims did not know the origin of the word and refused to accept that name. Moshe Yegar solved the problem by the following finding. He searched for the source and found out in the library in Singapore that the Arab sailors called themselves, people above the wind. (Orang atas angin, in Malay) and called the Muslims from Burma, Thailand, Malaya and Indonesia as, people under the wind (Orang bawah angin, in Malay). That is Zerbard in Farsi. So Zerbardi referred to Muslims from Burma, Thailand, Malaya and Indonesia. <sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Exiled Moghul Emperor</b></p>
<p>The Mughal (and Muslim) rule was formally abolished by the British. The last Muslim Moghul Emperor of India, Abu Za’far Saraj al-Din Bahadur Shah and his family members and some followers were exiled to Yangon, Myanmar (Burma).</p>
<p>The king-poet was arrested from Delhi after the failure of the first war of independence against the British in 1857. The sad and broken Bahadur Shah was brought here in chains after the brutal murder of his sons.</p>
<p>Bahadur Shah Zafar spent four long years in Yangon and died on November 7,1862. Confined to a garage attached to a bungalow of an English officer, Zafar lived the life of a 'faqir' and passed away in ignominious anonymity in the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>Two other exiled members of his family, wife Begum Zeenat Mahal and granddaughter Raunaq Zamani Begum who died in 1930 were buried alongside Bahadur Shah's grave.</p>
<p>Even after his death the British seemed to fear him and did not allow any visitors to the premises for thirty years. To keep people away from the grave, the stone put there merely said that he was buried 'near this spot.'</p>
<p>Now his burial site became a minor diplomatic clash between India and Pakistan. Both of them want to control the site now famous as a shrine and even Burmese Buddhists used to go and pray there because Za’far Shar, as they known, was regarded as a saint. <sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Mazar (mausoleum) , located at No. 6, Theatre Road, is the most famous address for any Indian visiting the Myanmar capital, Yangon. Beginning with Subhash Chandra Bose, there has been a tradition of Indian leaders visiting the monument as part of their official itinerary. Ex-King had the inspiration to compose the immortal couplet in which he spoke of his deprivation of two yards of land for his burial in his mother land "do gaz zameen bhi na mili."</p>

<p><b>The following is General Aung San’s speech to Indian Chambers of Commerce.</b> But it was broken by successive Myanmar Military Rulers. <sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Welfare of all, irrespective of race or religion</b></p>
<p>“I want to address the Indians and Chinese residing in this country. We have no bitterness, no ill will for them, or for that matter for any race and nationality in the world. If they choose to join us, we will welcome them as our own brethren. The welfare of all people of this country irrespective of race or religion has always been the one purpose that I have set out to fulfill. In fact it is my life's mission.”</p>
<p><b>Acceptance of Indians as Burmese nationals</b></p>
<p>We cannot confine the definition of a nationality to the narrow bounds of race, religion, etc. Nations are extending the rights of their respective communities even to others who may not belong to them except by their mere residence amongst them and their determination to live and be with them. I am glad to know that you regard yourselves as nationals of this country. So far as I am concerned, I am perfectly prepared to embrace you as my own brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><b>Naturalization of foreigners</b></p>
<p>Race, religion, and language are thus by themselves not primary factors which go to the making of a nation but the historic necessity of having to lead common life together that is the pivotal principle of nationality and nationalism.</p>
<p>Nowadays, with the increasing mutual intercourse of nations, there is such a provision in many of the constitutions of the world for naturalization of foreigners.</p>
<p><b>Race and nationalism</b></p>
<p>What then constitutes nationalism? The main factor is the having to lead together one common life sharing joys and sorrows, developing common interests and one or more common things like racial or linguistic communities, fostering common traditions of having been and being one which give us a consciousness of oneness and necessity of that oneness.</p>
<p>I recognize both the virtues and limitations of pure nationalism, I love its virtues, I don't allow myself to be blinded by its limitations, though I knew that it is not easy for the great majority of any nation to get over these limitations. In so far as nationalism encourages us to love our people and love others. In so far as nationalism inculcates in us a sense of national and social justice which calls upon us to fight any system that is oppressive or tyrannical both in our country and the world, there I am completely with nationalism.</p>
<p><b>Nationalism and religion</b></p>
<p>Every student of social and political science knows very well that such slogans as race, religion, language do not alone constitute nationalism. There are one or more races in almost every country. Nowadays, we have different religions being embraced by members of the same nationality.</p>
<p><b>Dirty politicians' exploitation</b></p>
<p>Some of us have been going still about the same old way of ‘dirty’ politics. But is politics really ‘dirty’. It is not politics which is dirty, but rather the persons who choose to dirty it are dirty. But it is in history that opportunist political leadership taking advantage of the strong national sentiments of the people may try to exploit the nationalism of the people for their selfish individual or group interests. We must be careful of such exploitation of nationalism. For then racial strives and bitterness will be fomented and fostered among us by interested parties in order to divert our attention from the main objective. <sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[95]</a></sup><a href="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/5/14/soa.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/5/14/soa.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p><b>Trump card of dirty politicians</b></p>
<p>They say politics is dirty. They say politics is religion. They say these all in contradiction with each other in one and the same breath. Politics is religion! Is it? Of course not. But this is the trump card of dirty politicians. In this way, they hope to confuse and befog the public mind, and they hope to slur over and cloud real issues. Theirs is the way of opportunism, not politics. Religion is a matter of individual conscience while politics is a social science. Of course, as a social science, politics must see that the individual also has his rights, including the right to freedom of religious worship. But here we must stop and draw the line definitely between politics and religion, because the two are not one and the same thing. If we mix religion with politics, this is against the spirit of religion itself, for religion takes care of our hereafter and usually has not to do with mundane affairs which are the sphere of politics. And politics is frankly a secular science. That is it.</p>
<p><b>External and internal Freedom</b></p>
<p>I believe in the inherent right of a people to revolt against any tyranny that people may have over them. History has amply demonstrated the right of a people to its own freedom, and that once it is denied to them, even in the case of the peoples who belong to the same stock. There is therefore nothing wrong in the aspirations of a nation if it wants to regain the freedom that is its birthright and attempts to have it. Every nation in the world must be free not only externally (i.e., free from any foreign rule) but also internally.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Anti-Indian Riots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Indian Riots</span></h4>
<p><b>British Official White Paper</b></p>
<p>This paragraph's basic facts are taken from Maurice Collis' <b>"Trials in Burma".</b> He was the judge in Rangoon, eye witnessed the riots and wrote his book based on the <b>British Official White Paper</b> given by, <b>The Simon Commission (The Royal Statutory Commission, appointed according to the Law of the Government of India1919, The Montague-Chelmsford Law)</b></p>
<p><b>Anti Indian sentiments</b></p>
<p>Anti Indian sentiments started after the First World War during the British rule. In Burma there were half million Muslims in 1921. Burmese population then was only eleven million. And in capital Rangoon 70% of the population was Indians, 10% was Chinese and Burmese Buddhists were only 20% of the population. Capital Rangoon is more like a foreign city and Burmese Buddhists were like foreigner in their own country. More then half of Indians were Indian Muslims. Although Myanmar Muslims are different from the Indian Muslims and Indian Myanmar Muslims, Burmese Buddhists put them together even mixed with Hindu Indians, and called them Kala.</p>
<p><b>The root of this hatred was_</b></p>
<p>(1) Different in religion.<br />
(2) Basic anti foreigner feelings.<br />
(3) Low standard of living of the recent migrants.<br />
(4) Recent migrants willingness to do, Dirty, Difficult and Dangerous jobs.<br />
(5) Indians took over the Burmese lands especially Chittiers.<br />
(6) Indians had already filled up and monopolized the government services when the Burmese were later ready for those jobs.<br />
(7) Professional competition.<br />
(8) World economic recession of 1930 aggravated the competition for the reduced economic pie.<br /></p>
<p><b>1930 anti-Indian riots</b></p>
<p>In 1930 there was an anti-Indian riots in Burma under British rule.</p>
<p>The problem started in Yangon port, because of the irresponsible action of the British firm of Stevedores. It had employed hundreds of Indian labourers. While those Indians were on strike, that firm had employed the Burmese workers just to break the strike. So the Indians had to give in and ended the strike. Next morning when the Burmese workers came and report for work they were told by the British firm that their service was no more needed. Some of the Indian workers who were angry because they had to end the strike at failure because of these Burmese workers laughed at them. Some Burmese workers were angry and started the fight and Indians retaliate. It grew rapidly into anti Indian (including anti Muslims) riots. Even within the first half-hour at least two hundred Indians were massacred and flung into the river. Authorities ordered the police to fire upon any assembly of five or more who refuse to lay down the arms, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. That was a black day of 26 May. Within two days it spread to the whole country and no one knew the exact causality.</p>
<p><b>63% of Yangon was Indians</b></p>
<p>In 1931 Indian population of Yangon was still 63% of total and more than half of them were Muslims. Even Burmese Buddhists must be able to speak Hindi / Urdu in order to survive in Yangon.</p>
<p><b>Anti Muslim riots in 1938</b></p>
<p>There was another anti Muslim riots in 1938, while still under British rule. The real basic hidden agenda was aimed at British Government but the Burmese dare not show this openly. The growing Nationalistic sentiments fanned by the local media disguised as anti Muslim to avoid the early detection and notice followed by the full blown force of mighty British Government machinery.</p>
<p><b>Ultra-Nationalists</b></p>
<p>The Burmese Nationalists fanned the anti Muslim sentiments by using the following facts.</p>
<p>(1) Problems in mixed marriages. Issue of conversion of the Burmese girls and the religious and legal matters that follows, e.g. non-conversion, divorce, death and inheritance.<br />
(2) Economically the Muslims were better and some amount of jealousy set in.<br />
(3) Buddhists could not accept Myanmar Muslims as fellow citizens but look down on them as Kalas or foreigners.<br />
(4) Burmese Newspapers started the hate campaign against Muslims since 1935. They use the words such as “ Muslims had taken their wealth and girls”, to incite hatreds. They called to expel the Muslims from the government service and to ‘deport’ them.<br />
(5) There was a religious argument between a Moulvi Hassan Shah and a Buddhist, Maung Pan Nyo. A book came out in 1931 about that and Buddhists published pamphlets again to attack Islam. Burmese Muslim Abdulla Maung Sin wrote the rebuttal claiming that Maung Pan Nyo’s book offended Islam and the Prophet. Then Maung Shwe Hpi, a Myanmar Muslim published a book and included all of the above-mentioned books and articles. Hasan Shah published the new edition without any consequences. In June 1938 a Buddhist journalist published the most offending extracts. Newspapers, organizations and Buddhist monks demanded action against the author. They called to stop inter marriages to prevent the spread of Islam.<br />
(6) The monks even guarded in the markets to prevent the Buddhists from purchasing at Muslim shops. Because of these anti Muslim activity and preparation and inciting to start an anti Muslim riots, Muslim organizations and Muslim newspapers started a campaign to please the Buddhists to avoid a riot.<br />
On 26.7.1938. anti Muslim rally was held at Shwe Dagon pagoda.</p>
<p><b>Burma for Burmese Campaign</b></p>
<p>Burmese started the Burma for Burmese only Campaign. Then marched to the Muslim (Surti) Bazar. While the Indian Police broke the violent demonstration, three monks were hurt. Burmese Newspapers use the pictures of Indian police attacking the Buddhist monks to further incite the spread of riots. Muslim properties: shops, houses and mosques were looted, destroyed and burnt to ashes. They assaulted and even massacred the Muslims. It spreads to all over Burma and recorded that 113 mosques were damaged.</p>
<p><b>The Inquiry Committee by British</b></p>
<p>On 22.9.38. British Governor set up the Inquiry Committee. They found out that the real cause was the discontent in the government regarding the deterioration in sociopolitical and economic conditions of Burmans. The book was used as an inciting factor by the irresponsible Burmese newspapers. They use the anti Muslim propaganda as a disguise to cover up for the political struggle to gain independence.So the Buddhist used the Muslims as a scapegoat, for the first time, to fight against the British.</p>
<p>The Simon Commission (The Royal Statutory Commission, appointed according to the Law of the Government of India1919, The Montague-Chelmsford Law) to inquire the effects of Dyarchy system of ruling Burma, had recommended that special places be assigned to the Myanmar Muslims in the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>It recommended that full rights of citizenship should be guaranteed to all the minorities: the right of free worship, the right to follow their own customs, the right to own property and to receive a share of the public revenues for the maintenance of their own educational and charitable institutions. It recommended Home Rule or independent government separate from India or the status of dominion.</p>
<p>But the British Government refused to accept all those recommended except the separation, at the round table committee on India held in London in 1930.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: After Independence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After Independence</span></h4>
<p><b>PM U Nu</b></p>
<p>After the independence Prime Minister U Nu appointed few Muslims into his cabinet. They were not included as the representatives of the Myanmar Muslims but on their own capacity as the political ally of the Prime Minister and the ruling party. They were even told to dissociate themselves from the Islamic Religious activities.</p>
<p><b>Burma Muslim Congress</b></p>
<p>The BMC, Burma Muslim Congress was founded almost at the same time with the AFPFL, Anti-Fascist Peoples’ Freedom Party of General Aung San and U Nu before World War Two. On 25.12 45 in Pyin Mana, U Razak was elected the President of BMC and decided to join AFPFL. U Razak was elected AFPFL President in the Mandalay district in 1946. Later the Governor accepted him as the member of constitutional council. He had a very good relations with Buddhist and even fluent in Pali (Buddhist scriptures are written in this ancient language of India). He became the Minister of Education and Planning in Bogoke’s (General Aung Aung San) Government and was assassinated together later.</p>
<p><b>Muslim Ministers toe the party line</b></p>
<p>But he had supported the main policy of the AFPFL: that is against the partition along the community or religious lines. U Razak and his few associates objected to the struggle of those demanding specific constitutional guarantees for the Myanmar Muslim minority. So, although U Razak was a very popular, important and prominent Myanmar Muslim leader who had successfully organized the Myanmar Muslims to be able to get an official record that they had participated since the very beginning of the Burmese National struggle towards independence.</p>
<p>His stand of united Burmese (Myanmar) nation sacrificing the long-term interest of guarantee for the rights of Minority Myanmar Muslim satisfied not only the Burmese Buddhist leaders of the AFPFL.</p>
<p>U Raschid and more prominently U Khin Maung Lat, follows the general policy of sacrificing the Rights and Interests of the Myanmar Muslim Community for ‘the country and their party’. So some of the Myanmar Muslims later refused to regard or recognize them as their true representatives or saviors.</p>
<p><b>U Nu expelled the Burma Muslim Congress</b></p>
<p>Prime Minister U Nu, just few months after independence of Burma, requested the Burma Muslim Congress to resign its membership from AFPFL. In response to that U Khin Maung Lat, the new President of BMC decided to discontinue the Islamic Religious activities of the BMC and rejoined the AFPFL. Later he became the Minister of Justice but no more represented the wishes of Myanmar Muslim community.</p>
<p><b>The Burmese Muslim League</b></p>
<p>The newly formed The Burmese Muslim League requested a special government department for the Muslim affairs to determine their own future, as the same as for other minorities, who had Ministries in Yangon and governments in their states.</p>
<p><b>Buddhism, the state religion of Burma</b></p>
<p>U Nu removed the Burma Muslim Congress from AFPFL on 30.9.1956. BMC was asked to dissolve since 1955.</p>
<p>Later U Nu decreed the Buddhism as the state religion of Burma against the will of the Ethnic Minorities and various religious organizations including Myanmar Muslims.</p>
<p><b>U Nu's restrictions on Muslims</b></p>
<p>U Nu as the devoted Buddhist was pressured by the wealthy and influential Hindi merchants, ordered the prohibition of slaughtering the cattle. Although he relaxed that during the Kurbani Edd (Hari Raya Haji), Muslims had to apply the permits for each cattle and strictly follow under police supervision. Although General Ne Win revoked the first order and allow the slaughter of cattle for daily consumption, the second order of strict restriction for the sacrifice remained up to the present and the Muslims, even Mosques’ official who failed to adhere to the permitted number of cattle are arrested and punished.</p>
<p><b>Haj pilgrimage during U Nu</b></p>
<p>And some Muslims complained that U Nu’s government had made more difficult conditions and regulations for the Haj pilgrimage than the Buddhists pilgrims going to Sri Lanka and Nepal.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Indians_cc0c.html" title="Edit section: Under Military governments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Under Military governments</span></h4>
<p>Myanmar Muslims are suffered a lot under the Autocratic, Oligarchical, Totalitarian, Xenophobic, Oppressive, Repressive and Tyrannical Military rule of Ne Win and his cohorts.</p>
<p>Burmese Muslims were allowed to hold high posts in civil service and in armed forces before Ne Win came into power. Despite the sacrificial contributions, which Burmese Muslims had made towards attaining Independence and in reconstructing the war-torn country after World War II, Ne Win apparently had extremely short memory of these facts. He denied high official posts to Burmese Muslims in civil service military and in Government offices (i.e. Party and Politics). He-had also forgotten the fact that Burmese-Muslim leaders were martyred along with our national hero General Aung San when he was assassinated.</p>
<p>So it is not surprising that one could not find Muslim, ministers or Deputy Ministers in Burma under Ne Win. But there were cases of double standards in that those Burmese-Muslim intellectuals who professed Buddhism as their new faith were exalted to high posts. One such individual was Dr. Maung Di, the son of the prominent Dean of the Islamic College in central Burma, who was promoted from the post of Professor in Chemistry to Deputy Minister of Education after he officially declared himself a Buddhist. During the successive Military Governments, those Myanmar Muslim who wanted to join the Military were asked one common question- could you eat pork? We in the army cannot arrange for halal food.(Actually just want to stop the long tradition of caring for Muslims.)</p>
<p><b>Ne Win's blatant abuses on Muslims and Indians</b></p>
<p>The chairman of the BSPP (Burma Socialist Programme Party), Ne Win, had forbidden the Burmese Muslim community to enlist themselves as a separate racial group so the Muslims in that country do not exist as a Burmese Muslim race. <sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[96]</a></sup>, <sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[97]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[98]</a></sup> Actually he was also a mixed blooded <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Chinese_477c.html" title="Burmese Chinese">Burmese Chinese</a>. His handpicked General Khin Nyunt is also a Myanmar Chinese and he continued with Ne Win's policy by creating anti-Muslim riots off and on.</p>
<p>During the early 70's Burmese Muslims, were insulted repeatedly in the Government newspapers for no reasons whatsoever by calling them “Kala dain”, meaning low-class Indians or spawns of Indians. And Ne Win labeled the Burmese Muslims as "Mi-masit, Pha-Masit", meaning Bastards. He used this term repeatedly in the important speeches which eventually led up to the legislation of basic principles which formed the foundations of the Citizenship Act 1982 which discriminated and denied the rights of Burmese Muslims (Myanmar Muslims).</p>
<p><b>King Dragon expelling Rohingyas</b></p>
<p>While preparing for that Citizenship Act, General Ne Win tried to expel and clean up some of the Arakan Rohingya Muslims in an operation, code named-‘King Dragon’. During that operation, the Burma armies rounded up Muslim villagers from Arakan and their identity cards were confiscated. Later these authorities claimed that those identity cards were fakes and were torn or burnt to ashes. After that these Muslims were beaten, tortured, looted, raped and driven out from their villages. So more than three hundred thousand Muslims fled to near by Bangladesh. It was only after UNHCR put some pressure did Ne Win, agreed to allow in some refugees who still hold the Burmese I.C.s. There are still some refugees in Bangladesh and some of them have set up anti-Rangoon groups to fight for self-determination. About 60,000 of Muslims have since migrated to Saudi Arabia where they were greeted with open arms as brothers-in-Islam. <sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>Racial and community riots are one of the dirty tricks and tactics of Military rulers to cover up the economic failure and political dissent.</p>
<p><b>Bertil Lintner predicted an Anti-Muslim riot</b></p>
<p>Being familiar with the above usual maneuver, adopted by the Burma Military Government, Bertil Lintner, famous Sweden journalist expert on Burma, was certain that the economic failure and political dissent would be covered up by inciting anti-Muslim racial riots. The premonitions and predictions he made made since 17th. of April 1988 in the Bangkok Post, really come true within a couple of months’ time. Myanmar Government agents managed successfully to incite the anti-Muslim riots in Taung Gyi and Prome, the native town of Ne Win. Hundreds of Muslims were killed especially in Prome. Properties of Muslims were looted or were put to the torch. Houses, shops, mosques, Muslim religious schools and even the Muslim orphanage were destroyed in those areas. The Military Intelligence chief Brigadier General Tin Oo surreptitiously launched an anti-Muslim campaign in Min Doan and Kyone Doe but that attempt, fizzled out and failed to create widespread community riots in the country. After that some of the Muslim victims fled to the east near Burma Thailand border and formed a group of Muslim freedom fighters who vowed to fight against the central Burmese Government. <sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>

<p>--- the sort of fighting and bloody killings that took place between 1812-19 when the Burmese kings of Mandalay tried to conquer and subdue the Shan Ahom kingdom in Assam, India, where the Burmese General Maha Bandula's troops committed indescribable cruelties and barbarities as to decimate something like 2/3 of the population and certainly 1/3 of the men and boys - disemboweling them, eating their flesh and burning them alive in cages to intimidate and suppress the Shan Ahom of Assam,India. <sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>This event so weakened and disorganized the Shan Ahom that by 1839 the kingdom was completely annexed by the British. Before that from about 1220 - 1812 AD they maintained themselves under one Dynasty, (that of Mong Mao 568-1604 AD when its descendants ruled Hsenwi or Theinni in Burmese). Indeed the Shan Ahom resisted conquest by the Mughals who had conquered much of India before the British incursion.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[102]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/2/12/dialouge.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/2/12/dialouge.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Burmese translation of above interview_ <a href="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2007/2/11/b/soab.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2007/2/11/b/soab.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

His paternal parents were U Pho Sin and Daw Sin from Pantanaw. U Pho Hnit studied in Calcutta and was the wealthiest person in Pantanaw. <i>The Working People's Daily</i>, the state-owned newspaper, unfairly and wrongly claimed that as U Thant was not a pure Burmese, he had no patriosm. <sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[107]</a></sup><br /></p>

<li><b>Bahadur, the Pelé of Burmese football</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For much of the 1960s, the team was led by the Ghurka-born striker from Shan State, Suk Bahadur—the Pelé of Burmese football, who was also a dominating tennis and field hockey player as well as the national 100-meter sprint champion.<br /></p>
<p>Historian John F. Cady writes in his book The United States and Burma that following consecutive victories in international matches in 1970–71, "proficiency in soccer became a significant mark of Burmese identity and prestige." <sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[108]</a></sup><br /></p>
<p>Indeed, football provided a strong focus for the representation of Burma to the rest of Asia. The list of Burma’s football "heroes" meanwhile provides an epic narrative of sorts in which the "beautiful game" has made an important contribution to the construction of the nation. To restore that sense of pride to Burma's national side, the state-owned press kicked off a small media campaign. A January 13, 2000, article in the English-language daily The New Light of Myanmar urged public support. "To reach the Golden Age in soccer again, all media organizations are to provide assistance for development of soccer." A separate article in the same paper stated that football victories bring honor to the state and that the people's "hearts are thrilled with pleasure when they see or learn the victory of their national team. That is the sign of expressing their patriotism." <sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[109]</a></sup><br /></p>
<p>Currently ranked 153rd in the world FIFA rankings, nobody at home or abroad ever gave Burma any chance of qualifying for the prestigious 32-team finals—the first ever in Asia. But despite its long isolation and tight media controls, live broadcasts of European football are widely watched and Burma remains a football-frenzied nation. But the indifference shown towards Burma’s domestic football and the falling fortunes of the national team provide a revealing cultural index for the dashed hopes of the Burmese people and the decay of the country itself. <a href="http://www.theglobalgame.com/burma.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theglobalgame.com/burma.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<li><b>Daw Tint Tint @ Usha Narayanan, wife of Former Indian President, Kocheril Raman Narayanan</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1949, <a href="../../../k/2E/_/K._R._Narayanan_6d23.html" title="K. R. Narayanan">K. R. Narayanan</a> joined the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) on Nehru's request. <sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[110]</a></sup> He worked as a diplomat in the embassies at Rangoon, Tokyo, London, Canberra, and Hanoi. He was the Indian ambassador to Thailand (1967-69), Turkey (1973-75), and the People's Republic of China (1976-78).</p>
<p>While working in Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar), K. R. Narayanan met Ma Tint Tint, whom he later married in Delhi on 8 June 1951). Ma Tint Tint got the BA (Psychology) from Rangoon University and went to India to do Masters. <sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[111]</a></sup> Their marriage needed a special dispensation from Nehru per Indian law, because Narayanan was in the IFS and she was a foreigner. Ma Tint Tint adopted the Indian name Usha and became an Indian citizen. Usha Narayanan worked on several social welfare programmes for women and children in India. She also translated and published several Burmese short stories; a collection of translated stories by Thein Pe Myint, titled Sweet and Sour, appeared in 1998. She is the only woman of foreign origin to have become the First Lady. They have two daughters, Chitra (who has served as Indian ambassador to Sweden and Turkey) and Amrita.</p>

<li><b>Helen of Bollywood</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Born on July 14, 1938 or 1939. Helen was exotic as all vamps must be, but the Bombay film industry's somewhat uncomplicated notion of exotica was such that Helen could be made to fit any set of circumstances. As an alien with no fixed place of origin (her mother was a half-Spanish, half-Burmese, and her father a Frenchman posted in Burma though she took on her step-father and became Helen Richardson and walked her way to Assam along with other refugees after the Second World War), she could be any kind of foreigner, any outsider.</p>
<p>It is a tribute to her talent and charisma that she literally side-stepped all competition during the period she strutted her stuff to perfection. How good a job did Helen make of seduction? A great one for the viewers - her fan base hasn't diminished much in close to 50 years." <sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[112]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/04/14/stories/2006041400460100.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/04/14/stories/2006041400460100.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
