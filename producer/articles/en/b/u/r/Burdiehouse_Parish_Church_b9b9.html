<p><b>A Short History of Our Church by Joe Bell</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdiehouse.html" title="Burdiehouse">Burdiehouse</a> and Southhouse as we know it today, is built on farmland which was cultivated by Mr. George Hamilton. The farmhouse was situated at the left-hand corner of Southhouse Road and Southhouse Crescent.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that on an old map there is a triangle marked with the name “Kaimes” at this spot. The farmhouse was pulled down after a fire destroyed it and its place has been taken up by a home for the mentally handicapped citizens.</p>
<p>In 1946 the first tenants of the No.s 5,7,9 &amp; 11 Southhouse Road took up residence. In the next 3 years to 1949 the population grew very quickly as more council houses were built in the area. Soon it was felt by some of the residents that a church was needed to serve the area. Edinburgh Presbytery of The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> acknowledged the need and in cooperation with the Kirk Session of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberton.html" title="Liberton">Liberton</a> Kirk set up a Church Extension programme with Rev. T.C. Chapman, a retired Church of Scotland minister from Calabar to attend to Pastoral duties in Burdiehouse/Southhouse area which was still in the Parish of Liberton Kirk. Rev. T.C. Chapman resided at 46 Liberton Brae and as far as we can determine was a member of Liberton Kirk in retirement.</p>
<p>The first church service was held in Old Burdiehouse School….a two classroom, one level building. A partition was opened to make one fairly large space, capable of seating 50 or more Parishioners on a Sunday. The first Church Officer was a dear lady called Mrs. Marshall who was also the School Janitor. So began BURDIEHOUSE CHURCH proper.</p>
<p>As the housing schemes of Burdiehouse &amp; Southhouse grew so did the congregation meeting in the Old School building at Old Burdiehouse Road and so it became important that a Church Building be erected in the area of Burdiehouse. With the cooperation of Edinburgh Presbytery a “Hall Church” was built and opened on the first of September 1951. The Hall church was dedicated at the service on Sunday 2nd September 1951 by the Rev. James Jardine of Lothian Road Church and Moderator at that time of Edinburgh Presbytery. The Rev. R. MacIntosh, Secretary of the Church of Scotland Home Board preached the sermon and the service was conducted by the Rev. Robert Lockhart who became the first inducted minister of the consecrated and dedicated church in Burdiehouse and Southhouse area.</p>
<p>The Hall church did service for nine years and was a success in its efforts to minister to an ever increasing population of the area. With the decision by the District Council to commence building new houses in Gracemount area it became apparent that the Hall church would soon be too small to serve the ever increasing area now including&#160;:- Southhouse, Burdiehouse, Gracemount, Straiton part of Gilmerton Dykes etc. and so plans were laid to build a new Church in the Parish to be ………</p>
<p>On 29th January 1960 a Building Warrant was issued for the building of a the new church…..The estimated cost of this church was £28,000………many of you will remember how you were encouraged to give 6d. "To buy a brick for the Kirk”. In fact the Church when built cost approx. £33,000. It was originally planned to have it on the corner of Captains Road. And Gracemount Drive….central to the proposed new Parish. However by some strange quirk of Local council planning the ground allocated was not that planned……</p>
<p>The present Church building was opened &amp; dedicated on Sunday 23rd March 1961. It is unique in that there is no other Church in Great Britain like it. The walls of the church are built with a material called “Siporex” which is a Scandinavian Patented Brick which was made in this Country by Costain Concrete of Newmains &amp; Linlithgow. The beautiful and novel feature of our Church is the Chancel wall mainly constructed of Glass from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall showing a 15ft. cross and its centre piece in the open “Sanctuary Garden” beyond. There are shrubs and trees surrounding the Cross made of teak….</p>
<p>Birds, often fly into the garden to rest on the cross and the flowering shrubs…Looking from the congregation over the long teak communion table to the cross in the garden with the signs of life one cannot help but get the feeling of God and creator and sustainer of all.</p>
<p>Burdiehouse Church was opened and dedicated by the Rev. Dr. A. C. Craig moderator designate of the General Assembly of the time….The architect to the Church was Mr. Harry Taylor, ARIBA.,ARIAS, architect to the Church of Scotland Home Board. The Congregation through their “Purchase a Brick” scheme managed to clear the debt with the help of other congregations in the Presbytery. The church became a FULL STATUS CONGREGATION with delineation of a Parish identified BURDIEHOUSE PARISH in the mid sixties.</p>
<p>Burdiehouse Parish Church to date has had four ministers including our present one.&#160;:-</p>
<p><b>The Rev. Robert Lockhart</b> served Burdiehouse Church both when it was Hall church in Burdiehouse and the new Church in Gracemount Drive with great vigour until 1963. His ministry for 11 years was and still is greatly appreciated by our congregation. It is due to his unstinting efforts that we have both a congregation and a Church building of which w are proud today.</p>
<p><b>The Rev. J.E.M. Baikie, M.A., B.D., M.Litt.</b> was inducted as minister of Burdiehouse Church in 1963 and served us very well until 1974, again an eleven year ministry. A very valuable contribution to the spiritual well being of Burdiehouse Church &amp; Parish.</p>
<p><b>The Rev. G.I. Hastie, M.A., B.D.,</b> was inducted to the Church &amp; Parish in 1974 and stayed with us until 1986. A very able and worthwhile minister. He did very valuable and dedicated work to the sick and elderly in the community. A twelve year ministry of success to Burdiehouse Church &amp; Parish.</p>
<p>Part of 1986 and through the whole of 1987 we were in a Vacancy situation with no inducted Minister. <b>The Rev. Dr. H.S. Heavenor</b> acted as Pastoral Assistant during 1987 with the Interim Moderator being <b>the Rev. Brian Embleton, B.D.,</b> until February 1988 when our preset Minister <b>the Rev. Iain A. Macdonald, L.Th.,</b> was inducted to the Church &amp;Parish of Burdiehouse.</p>
<p>The history of the organisations of the Church is a separate research subject and may in time be filled in by the writer of this Short History of Burdiehouse Church. The history of us is in the making and still to be written. May God favour us in the future with His guidance as he has done in the past.</p>
