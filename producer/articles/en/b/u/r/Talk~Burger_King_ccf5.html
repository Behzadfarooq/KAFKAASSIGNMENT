<p>All of the burger kings I have been to now offer free wifi for an hour when you buy something there. When you buy something, you ask the cashier for use of the hotspot and they print off a ticket for you to login on. Anyway, google shows up the usual war driving results when you look up "burger king wifi" So there's not much else I can add. 207.81.213.37 11:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Burger King has made a comeback in Poland. So the flag should be added as well as info, however I can't do it as editing is disabled for me. Today (7 feb. 2007) Amrest (the polish operater of Pizza Hut / KFC) has started Burger King's second expansion in Poland with a restaurant in the new Zlote Tarasy shopping center in Warsaw.</p>
<p><br />
That's true, but as for today (18.02.07) that <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> restaurant is still closed - there is even no logo on walls, that covers still not opened restaurant... We can check that this will be a Burger King only by looking onto information boards with plans. Mibars</p>

<p>I think there should be a mention of the paper crowns in the main article,as they've been a long staple of Burger King. At most,they're still available on request.</p>
<p>They have crowns sitting all over the restaurant in a location over here. I took two of 'em. I still have an old 1991 version and the new one, so I may take a photo of both together for this page, if I get bored as hell. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaleson_9aee.html" title="User:Caleson">Caleson</a> August 25, 2006</p>

<p>Could someone add any information on burger king's mascot. That big plastic king dude, and explain why I keep seeing photos of him on the internet that say "Where is your god now?"</p>
<p>Yes, It is making fun of how creepy the ads are. You see a man in his bedroom and then this guy in a mask shows up from nowhere unannounced and uninvited. In short the "Burger king" is more creepy than "Jason" form the horror movies.</p>
<p>There are several sites on the internet, including blogs, that discuss how creepy the Burger king mascot is. It's most likely a ploy by Burger King's marketing group to generate "chatter" about the icon.</p>

<p>Burger King's in MI used this strategy so consistently that we all assumed that it was a national strategy too. The fact that our article doesn't cover that makes me think it may not have been.

<p>ok, ill probably get shot for saying this... I work at Hungry Jacks (Aussie version of Burger King) in Perth, WA. i have to say that the most safety concious people are actually the teenagers like me who work there. all the people my age who do the same job as me (burger maker basically) wear hair nets, hats, gloves, aprons etc. however, there are health/safety violation, and youd be surprised but 99% of the time it is the managers who do it. None of the managers wear hair nets or hats, and none of them wear gloves. their excuse is that they dont actually make the burgers, but do paper work, but in a rush hour if you walk into the back you can be assured that a manager will be helping the crew out by making the burgers...all the time with no hat, no hair net, and no gloves...</p>
<p>oh and btw, before you all stop eating HJ's or Burger king, jsut remember, chefs in proper reastuarants NEVER wear hear nets or gloves at all....jsut a thought...freaky773 11:24, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just following on from what freaky has said having worked in Burger King before. I wish to confirm the scenario with regards to the manger never wearing hairnets etc, This is infact the case. Prolly a little incidental but for the most pasrt Mansgers should infact be on the floor except in unusual circunstances according to the officail documentation governing procedures, but who is going to tell them outherwise likewise with them wearinh hairnets. With regard to handling food, when i worked there food was handled by the preparer with raw hand but there was a huge emphasis on minimal contact.</p>
<p>Most sanitation codes only require hair to be restrained and do not say how. BK employees' hair is covered by the baseball cap that it has its employees wear, longer hair will be tied back to add extra protection. Local health regs may require more stringent mean. Go to any restaurant and you will find this to be the case.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen or remember the short lived commercials featuring Whopperheads. They were part of a 2004-2005 promotion in which BK partnered with an online music company (can't remember which one), advertising the chance for a free song with every whopper purchase. I have seen two of these kinds of commercials. The general theme involved some hippy-type youngsters getting talked down to by authority figures who diss the former as "whopperheads," an equivalent of potheads. I find these commercials amusing and would like more informtion.</p>

<p>I am suprised that no one thought of putting a paragraph about the controversy involving the Burger King Corporation and Rikamor, Ltd who operates a Burger King franchise in a mall in the Israeli occupied West Bank town of <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maale_Adumim_4905.html" title="Maale Adumim">Maale Adumim</a>. Apparently Rikamor, Ltd. opened this restaurant in violation of their franchise agreement. Burger King thought that Rikamor was opening a franchise within a legitimate area of the State of Israel and when they found out that it was actually in the West Bank they (Burger King) revoked Rikamor's franchise and ordered them to stop using and remove all references to Burger King when Rikamor refused Burger King sued and won unfortunately though as far as I am aware the restaurant is still being operated in violation of an Israeli court order and Burger King's trademark rights. The Arab community has started a worldwide boycott of Burger King as a result. 141.150.96.49 06:48, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In 1999 a McDonalds franchise was opened (and initially approved by Burger King) in <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maale_Adumim_4905.html" title="Maale Adumim">Maale Adumim</a>, which is a settlement and therefore against Burger King policy (or the franchise agreement if above is correct). Some people noticed and protested - so the Burger King representative from Abu Dhabi returned to Israel to check out the claim and discovered that <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maale_Adumim_4905.html" title="Maale Adumim">Maale Adumim</a> was indeed a settlement - apologized and revoked the license. The restaurant reopened a short time later under a local fast food chain name.</dd>
<dd>The Burger King representaive (coming from the regional HQ at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Dhabi_b84d.html" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>) didn't notice the first time around that Maale Adumim was a settlement and the franchisee somehow "forgot" to tell the representative.</dd>
<dd>Both is perfectly understandable because a) if you are driven to Maale Adumim you wouldn't know/notice that you are in a settlement (if you are unfamiliar) because it looks just like any other neighbourhood/<a href="../../../g/a/t/Gated_Community_3017.html" title="Gated Community">Gated Community</a> and b) is considered by Israel (and Israelis) to be inside the Jerusalem municipality city limits, which were expanded after the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Day_War_87dc.html" title="Six Day War">Six Day War</a> into the West Bank with the additional area being <i>annexed</i> by Israel (as opposed to merely being <i>occupied</i> as the West bank and the <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>).

He apparently has a "PhD in Cheesey" and can teach people sit by giving them a Cheesy Bacon Angus Steakburger.

<li>The Products section is mostly very US-centric, many of those products do not exist internationally. Additionally it's full of US English idioms - please check for US English terms such as "applesauce" - this isn't too intuitive to a British English speaker and could probably do with an appropriate wikilink.</li>
<li>In many places, facts that are unrelated to the flow of the prose are inserted. A chief example would be the Steven Seagal reference in a section that otherwise reads as corporate history. Seagal working there is trivia at best.</li>

<p>Someone really needs to clean this up. The facts and figures section states that they did $11bn in sales and sell 2.4bn burgers a year? What? A quick serach will tell you that their revenue is less than a fifth of that, which also means the outrageous figure of 2.4 billion is useless.</p>
<p>No, the figures are correct. System-wide sales is different from company revenue. $11b is system-wide sales and represents the value of sales at all Burger King restaurants. Revenue consists of sales at company owned restaurants, franchisee royalty payments and property income. This, as you rightly point out, is a little less than a fifth of $11b.</p>

<p>(Trivia) The Burger King article mentions employees singing the "Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, special orders don't upset us!" jingle but the main singer was the Burger King Lady, never mentioned in the article. After a couple years, she disappeared and then appeared in a Selsin Blue anti-dandruff shampoo commercial. Was she ever identified and did she go on to other roles? For instance, Elizabeth Shue appeared in McDonalds commercials.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Kids Club</b>. It is unclear how the the paragraph starting "In the 1970s, BK had a Kids Club..." relates to the Burger King Kids Club "launched in 1990", described earlier in the section. The chronology and continuity needs fixing. Was this an earlier Kids Club that was discontinued and then revived in 1990? Or what?</li>
<li><b>Hungry Jack's</b>. The statement "More recently, Hungry Jack's has 210 locations in Australia while Burger King only has 81 locations" conflicts with the earlier "In 2003 Burger King Australia ceded to Hungry Jack's and the Burger King stores were rebadged, joining forces with Hungry Jack's to take on McDonalds Corp." When does "recently" refer to? Was the 2003 agreement rescinded?</li>

<dd>Define "mindless." Do you honestly think someone would find the mentioning of noteable employees to be absolutely mindless or insane? Considering the <b>many</b> Wikipedia pages that include Trivia sections, I think most people would find it rather interesting and perfectly suitable. They provide a place for notable information that simply wouldn't fit into other sections of the article. In fact, I have yet to see <b>anyone</b> argue the concept of Trivia sections - well, except you. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaleson_9aee.html" title="User:Caleson">Cale</a> 22:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should any mention be made of the fact that at Burger King you can ask them to remove (or add) things from the Burger?

<dd>Honestly, I think most fast food restaurants would take a request to modify parts of your order.

<p>The information that BK Restaurants have been targeted by Insurgents is unnecssairy. This part is unbalanced and poltical. Many Western (and non-Western) targets have been attacked in Iraq, and across the world Burger-King and other Fast Food Restaurants have been attacked, vandalised etc. for various reasons. So I see no need to emphasize this. Burger King is still present in Iraq and Halal, which is the only relevant information, unless we start to include all attacks on BKs for the other countries.</p>
