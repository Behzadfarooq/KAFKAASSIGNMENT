<p>Bardock appeared in the manga. Volume 10 accd. to Viz. Check it out to get the chapter number, or I can do it later. In the manga, he's 'Burdock' though. And don't forget his son Raditz...</p>
<p>in the anime, didn't vegeta once say that bardock was a scientist and invented the technique of creating a false full moon? <a href="../../../x/u/n/User%7EXunflash_e6b9.html" title="User:Xunflash">Xunflash</a> 22:01, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>I think the article name should be changed to Burdock instead of Bardock. Not only does the translated manga use the Burdock spelling, but the Japanese pronouncation (<i>baadaku</i>) is literally how you pronounced the vegetable, burdock. Bardock was just FUNimation's way of obscuring the name pun (such as naming Lunch, "Launch," Freeza, "Frieza," Coola, "Cooler," ect). Any thoughts? Chibi Gohan 21:26, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, his name is heard clearly as "<b>Ba</b>dakku", and not "<b>Bu</b>dakku". Granted, it's not much of a reason, but it's something. Is kind of difficult to decide how clear the pun is supposed to be. But I'm hesitant to use the Viz translation just because it's Viz - they also call Boo "Djinn" instead of "Majin". Viz seems to like translating names that don't need translation. -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 00:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I edited the article is because his name <b>isn't Bardock</b>. Bardock is simply the name FUNimation decided to pull out of their asses, such as with "Cooler," "Launch," "Frieza," "Korin," ect. Let's look at the instances of the use of Bardock vs. Burdock.</p>
<p>Bardock: FUNimation's English dub (which is prone to name changes) as well as any merchandise based on their English dub (cards, video games, ect). Burdock: VIZ's English manga, the subtitled version of the anime (by the very talented Steve Simmons), the Japanese version (as <i>baadakku</i> is simply the Japanese pronounciation of the English word burdock), and last but certainly not least, Akira Toriyama, the creator of the character as well as the entire series. In the Dragon Ball guide book "Dragon Ball Forever," Toriyama was asked about the characters and their names. Here's what he had to say about Burdock: "I don't remember him very well (this is understandable since he was only in two panels!). Was he in the original story? If so, his name would definitely come from the vegetable." (and then it says "(<i>baadakku</i>=<i>gobou</i>)" which is the Japanese word for burdock).</p>
<p><i>Well, his name is heard clearly as "Badakku", and not "Budakku". Granted, it's not much of a reason, but it's something.</i></p>
<p>"Burdock," as in, the vegetable, isn't "<i>buudakku</i>" in Japanese, it's <i>baadakku</i>. The long 'a' sound makes the 'r' sound.</p>
<p>And to SUIT, about what you said in one of your edit summaries ("The mover didn't wait for a full consensus. In fact, there wasn't even a vote. I'm moving it back until it's actually discussed"), you do realize that no one was willing to discuss it in the first place, right? I asked that the ones who kept reverting it back to Bardock discuss it in the talk page first, but they never listened. Only now are we having a discussion.

<p>Well, Toriyama's not really very good at English. He romanizes Goku as "Gokuu" or "Gokuh" and Kuririn gets "Kullin" or "Kulilin" or even "Kyliln". So, Toriyama's romanizations should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>That said, it does seem that the name is really "Burdock". The only thing I can think of is perhaps there's a katatkana switch, can anyone get a quick scan of that Landmark page or any instance of his name as well as proper katakana of "burdock"? -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 13:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But Toriyama didn't romanize it as Burdock, he said (in Japanese) that his name is taken from the vegetable, burdock. Logically it would be spelled b-u-r-d-o-c-k in English. Chibi Gohan 22:25, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's unclear whether he meant for the character's name to be the word directly, or if he wanted to have a slight variation. Toriyama does both with Saiyan characters (though more frequently he uses variations on vegetable words instead of the word itself). The name <i>could</i> be "taken" from "burdock" but changed slightly, like he did for Broli, Paragus, Kakarrot, etc.</p>
<p>From what we've seen, it's probably 'Burdock'. I've been told that 'burdock' would be <i>baadakku</i>, and with Toriyama's answer in the quoted interview specifically mentioning godou like that - I'mm leaning toward 'Burdock' myself. -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 23:03, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Burdock inventing the false moon.</span></h2>
<p>I've been watching the japanese version of DBZ Uncut, and Vegeta never said that Burdock created the false moon. He said something along the lines that "only a few gifted saiyans have this ability". I think that the reference of Burdock creating the false moon, must have just been dialogue that FUNIMATION added in the dubbed american version of DBZ.</p>
<p>- That whole business about Goku's father inventing a false moon is an invention of the early FUNimation dub. What Vegeta actually says is that a saiyan who collects enough bruits rays can actually create an artificial moon. The bruits waves is absorbed through the eyes and sets off a gland in the saiyan's tail. That is what triggers the oozaru form.</p>
<p>possibly-taracka</p>
<p>It was. Bardock was not a "brilliant scientist." <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 21:01, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>None of the information in the Bardock special is canon Bartock did NOT play an important role in the Saiyan race other than fathering Goku user:Dragon Emperor</p>
<p>Actually, Dragon Emperor, the Bardock Special is canon due to the fact that Akira Toriyama considers it canon thus making the events in the Bardock Special Canon.</p>
<p>In the first showing of DragonBall Z, it <i>is</i> said that Bardock was a brilliant scientist and whatnot. However, when the tv special came out, there were obvious conflicts. When FUNimation redid the episodes for the "Ultimate Uncut" edition of the Saiyan, or now called, "Vegeta" saga, all mentions of Bardock being a scientist have been edited out. user:Nsmith4658</p>
<p>I think I remember Vegeta mentioning that Goku's Saiyan grandfather was the creator of the false moon trick in the anime, though I have not seen the episode for quite some time and I may be mistaken. - <a href="../../../s/h/40/User%7ESh%40z%40M_fb74.html" title="User:Sh@z@M">Sh@z@M</a></p>
<p>No, Vegeta's saying of Bardock being the scientist behind the Power Ball is false, and a line thrown in during the original dubbing of the show. It is incorrect, the original line in the Japanese has Vegeta explaining the numbers of (I forgot the exact name) light rays needed from the moon to be absorbed by the eyes to change into an Oozaru. My guess is they thought this was too boring/technical for kids and made up the thing about Bardock, probably not even knowing there was a TV Special about him that would later cause this confusion. - User: VegeKaka</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anime to manga</span></h2>
<p>the line "<i>He is the first character portrayed in a manga that was actually introduced in anime filler.</i>" should probably be "<i>...in the manga...</i>". I don't know of any other character in any other anime that was introduced first in the anime and then in the original manga, but saying Bardock's the first in <b>a</b> manga makes it sound like he's the first one ever. -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 12:33, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The sentence "first character... in <b>a</b> manga" makes it sound like he's the first <i>ever</i> in <i>any</i> manga - which may be true, but seems like a guess.

<p><br />
So, <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)">Power Level</a> changed it back to "a manga". I'm still rather skeptical about this.

<p>You should leave it as that. What I'll do is add ["he is the first <b>known</b>...] That better? --<a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)">Power level (Dragon Ball)</a></p>
<p>Saying he's the first in any manga is a bit out of scope.

<p>That's why I added <b>known</b> next to it. Until you can find someone else, change it. I couldn't find any research <b>anywhere</b> concerning a character that appeared in filler, and then the manga, except for Burdock of course. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)">Power level (Dragon Ball)</a> 17:16, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, how about "Bardock is the only character in the Dragon Ball manga that originates in the anime."? I'm worried about bloating the sentence with "Dragon Ball", but would "the" be too ambiguous? -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 17:27, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Like I said, until you can find another fictional character in <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">this real life world</a> which was either introduced, showed up first, etc. in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">animation</a>, and then had a role in <b>a</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, then you can change it.

I'm getting confused. I think that the article should say "<b>the</b> manga" because saying "<b>a</b> manga" is out of scope for the article.

<li><b>Support</b> there is no other Bardock to confuse this with. Brackets don't need to be used unless there is a dab page. This is also very similar to what happened with the King Cold article which was moved for the same reason. There were no other King Cold's --67.71.77.211 05:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am crazy confused here. Mr. Satan gets put at <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercule.html" title="Hercule">Hercule</a> but Bardock should stay at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardock.html" title="Bardock">Bardock</a>? I support the move to Bardock, but I'm just confused as to why the change from the Viz translation (and sop soon after that "Hercule" debacle). -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 00:58, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dunno, I just suport the Japanese version names, and whoever moved it to Burdock didn't meet a concensus first, so it got moved to Bardock (Dragon Ball). <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuthehedgehog_00ac.html" title="User:Takuthehedgehog">Takuthehedgehog</a> 03:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
