<p>According to the Congressional Record, Chap. XC. - <i>An Act to establish a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen and Refugees</i> became a law on March 3, 1865. It was designed ..."to continue during the present war of rebellion, and for one year thereafter,...." Its purpose was ..."the supervision and management of all abandoned lands, and the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel states, or from any district of country within the territory embraced in the operations of the army, ...." "The said bureau shall be under the management and control of a commissioner to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, whose compensation shall be three thousand dollars per annum, and such number of clerks as may be assigned to him by the Secretary of War, not exceeding one chief chief clerk, two of the fourth class, two of the third class, and five of the first class."</p>
<p>Sec. 2. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, "That the Secretary of War may direct such issues of provisions, clothing, and fuel, as he may deem needful for the immediate and temporary shelter shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen and their wives and children, under such rules and regulations as he may direct."</p>
<p>Sec. 3. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, "That the President may, ... appoint an assistant commissioner for each of the states declared to be in insurrection, ....</p>
<p>Sec. 4. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, ..."tracts of land within the insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, there shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land, ... for the term of three years at an annual rent not exceeding six per centum .... At the end of said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any parcels so assigned may purchase the land and receive such title thereto as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land, as ascertained and fixed for the purpose of determining the annual rent aforesaid.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, "That all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act, are hereby repealed."</p>
<p>Approved, March 3, 1865.</p>

</ul>
<p>Contrarily, the Wikipedia article often mentions "education" and "blacks" and "schools" and "churches." The Wikipedia article also claims that "anti-white violence" existed. (I had never heard of "anti-white violence" until I read the Wikipedia version of history). The Wikipedia version makes no mention of a Commisioner. (Old <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_O._Howard_dd96.html" title="Oliver O. Howard">General Howard</a> was the tyrannical ogre who wielded a heavy hand and tormented the "poor white farmers.") The article is extremely distorted and non-factual.</p>

<p>The article repeatedly mentions "schools."</p>
<p>A "school" is like a "house" in that there are small ones, and there are large ones. A "doghouse" is a "house" just as the Presidential mansion (the White House) is a "house." The "schools" that the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen. and Abandoned Lands constructed were shanties that passed as "schools."</p>
<p>I have been inside of one of those shanties that passed as a "school." I know what I saw.</p>
<p>The real "schools" were the land-grant colleges that were constructed after 1865. More than 50 of them were built. They were not built to educate <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colored.html" title="Colored">colored</a> people, they were built to educate white people. Many of them have become universities. They have large campuses. They're comparable to the White House, while the shanties are comparable to doghouses.</p>
<p>There is no reason to mention "schools" without describing their sizes and capabilities. A "house" may refer to a dollhouse or a "house" of cards. Please do not announce that they "built schools" unless you describe those "schools" which I call shanties. 71.240.32.87 06:28, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The quality of a school is in its teaching. The buildings were of comparable quality to those all over rural America as late as 1910. National churches built better quality buildings and colleges. In 1890 the Land Grant college system was extended to black colleges. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:36, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure what is driving the obviously biggoted commentators above, but this is the ONLY Talk Page I have seen that refers to blacks as "Colored People" and "Negroes." As for the reference to "schools", even if a dwelling is a shanty that would still constitute a viable place for a "school." Most of the comments above - with the exception of Rjensen - are virtually incoherent. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenmitchell_f4fd.html" title="User:Stevenmitchell">Stevenmitchell</a> 06:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
