<dd>Neo-nazi is an american phenomenom, Varg is a nationalist socialist but he is not a neo-nazi. Some don't really appreciate the difference between the two, but I feel it is very relevant. Neo-nazis are americans who are very mistaken about what aryan means. National socialists like Varg, while still racist, differ significantly from the american breed of neo-nazis as national socialists do understand what aryan means. The two groups don't intermingle either. Varg's music is infused with his national socialist ideals so I do believe it should be mentioned regardless of whether or not people want to agree with this poltical views. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanctum_7a9b.html" title="User:Sanctum">Sanctum</a> 02:13, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>with all due respect, what makes you think that *neo-nazism* is an all american issue? the term is used for the new generation of national socialists, for people who think the old nazis did. I am German and I know what I'm talking about - it's not like we don't have any neo-nazis here. and if you look at the labels and titles of one or two of the tributes, you must admit that at least the obvious audience seems to be fascist... --Jinx138 20:11, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually have been writing papers about Varg's politics in my Radical Right class. Varg is a pretty good candidate for a prototypical member of the Radical Right because the Radical Right isn't an exact and delineated category. For example, although Varg used to be into neo-nazism and used to believe in its tenets, he now claims to have abandoned it and seems to have moved on to be wholly devoted to a growing part of the Radical Right that is Odinist. Now, this faction of the Radical Right is clearly racist, sexist, and certainly connected to various parts of the extremist Radical Right. However, this certainly doesn't make Varg a neo-nazi, at least not anymore. Although he used to believe in it, and is clearly still Radical Right, he is a part of a new category within racist groups that is exploiting a sort of anti-globalization, communalism, environmentalist, racist paganism. If people here want to include Varg as a part of neo-nazi music for his influence on National Socialist Black Metal and his previous belief in neo-nazism, by all means include him because he was a part of it and a big influence on that group getting media attention. Yet, just be sure that you don't confuse his older views with his newer one's. Yeah, well, I guess absurdly ranting about Varg on wikipedia is what I get for taking this class. Anyway, if you want to analyze his views and get a better understanding of really crazy dangerous assholes in Europe, I suggest reading through the archives at [<a href="http://www.burzum.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.burzum.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], but beware, it can be equally scary and funny for its poor account of history and utter seriousness. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrizimm_efa0.html" title="User:Brizimm">Brizimm</a> 04:25, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I posted on the NSBM discussion, Varg is odalist and interpretents that in a racistical way, mind you, there is no link between odalism and racism, except what the page <a href="../../../o/d/a/Odal.html" title="Odal">odal</a> shows, some nazi's had the rune on their uniforms. It is not confirmed however. As Varg says he is not a socialist, not even on a national manner thus he is not a (neo)nazi. As i said before, there has to be a line drawn between racism and nazism.</dd>

<dd>He says most of his audience consists of neonazi's - but he states he is not one himself ^, He is not socialist on a national level (Don't forget Hitler's political party was called "NSDAP - National Socialistic DAP", which basically means he is not National Socialist, which is basically what nazi's are. And i also think there have to be none of his political ideas, maybe a mentioning towards it, because this page is about his music, which was made to "boycot" the Death Metal scene at the time, and later to boycot metal itself. I do not believe the Keyboard albums are anyway related to his racistic ideas because in that time, his ideas were those that i mentioned above. Political ideas should be moved to <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varg_Vikernes_eb7b.html" title="Varg Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a>' page, because his music is not political in any way. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksteel_6b8a.html" title="User:Darksteel">Darksteel</a> 12:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The band was formed in 1987 <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=88" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=88" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the first release wasn't until 1991. He revived Uruk-Hai in 1991. The band was basically "on-hold" when he was with Old Funeral. -Reaper-</p>

<p>Sources on this subject are almost universally questionable. However, as I understand it, Vikernes was never convicted of Arson. He is in prison for the murder of Eronymous. The Fantoft Kirk, which he photographed the ashes of for his second album "Aske", was set fire by a 16 year old female fan of the group. Vikernes certainly instigated this; in his trial for Eronymous' murder he claimed he was building an army of church arsonists, and that he couldn't be stopped. I think the most they legally have on him is "Conspiracy to commit Arson". He never actually set fire to a church.</p>
<p>It's debatable whether he actually set fire to any of the churches, but they never convicted him of this. -Reaper-</p>

<p>Varg was born simply Kristian Larsson Vikernes. Kvisling was legally appended to his name later after varg took a profound liking to Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian fascist.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Quisling (Qisling) means "descended from one of the kings ancestry" - He beleives he is related to the king of Norway - not that he is related to Harald V or any of his family - probably Vikernes' way of saying he is an earthly form of Wuotan.</dd>

<p>Two sentences from the article: <i>"Varg Vikernes expects to be released from his sentence early, around August 2006, and intends to continue Burzum."</i> — <i>"He will not continue the band when he is released and has disavowed himself from the black metal scene entirely."</i> Which is it? —<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirk_b166.html" title="User:Quirk">Quirk</a> 13:59, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me he just said he'd stopped the band to stop rumours about new releases coming out and had no plans to make anything new in the near future. Currently it seems he doesn't care if he continues it or not, but he has not ruled it out completely, if that makes sense.&#160;:/ --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtakistan_ebb2.html" title="User:Etakistan">Etakistan</a> 05:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tagged this as {{contradiction}} because of the conflicting statements about Vikernes' neonazism - it'd be nice if someone could clear that up once and for all. -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> (<i><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchneelocke_54a1.html" title="User talk:Schneelocke">cheeks clone</a></i>) 14:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Vikernes is not a nazi as lots of people once called him. The pagan ideals that he follows may be a bit similar to nazism but have no connection to them what ever since paganism was around long before nazism was. Varg has stated on burzum.org that he laughs at people who call him a nazi because it is simply not true."</p>
<p>should be reworded, and better integrated into the article, right now it sticks out like an awkward thumb, there are no sources and the sentences are poorly constructed.</p>

<dd>As I posted on the NSBM discussion, Varg is odalist and interpretents that in a racistical way, mind you, there is no link between odalism and racism, except what the page <a href="../../../o/d/a/Odal.html" title="Odal">odal</a> shows, some nazi's had the rune on their uniforms. It is not confirmed however. As Varg says he is not a socialist, not even on a national manner thus he is not a (neo)nazi. As i said before, there has to be a line drawn between racism and nazism.</dd>

<dd>He says most of his audience consists of neonazi's - but he states he is not one himself ^, He is not socialist on a national level (Don't forget Hitler's political party was called "NSDAP - National Socialistic DAP", which basically means he is not National Socialist, which is basically what nazi's are. And i also think there have to be none of his political ideas, maybe a mentioning towards it, because this page is about his music, which was made to "boycot" the Death Metal scene at the time, and later to boycot metal itself. I do not believe the Keyboard albums are anyway related to his racistic ideas because in that time, his ideas were those that i mentioned above. Political ideas should be moved to <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varg_Vikernes_eb7b.html" title="Varg Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a>' page, because his music is not political in any way.</dd>

<p>Emocore is listed in the genre box. Is this accurate? I'm not terribly familiar with the band but this seems more than a little suspect.
