<dd>Was that not the point of you notifying me on my talk page? As a matter of fact the image was tagged at the time, yet does not seem to have been saved, there was also an explanation for the blurring in the right hand corner, which was where my children had been edited out, I am mystified as that was definitely saved, yet no record remains - strange. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 22:11, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi Burgundavia, I noticed you've changed <a href="../../../i/d/w/Template%7EIdw-pui_9c6a.html" title="Template:Idw-pui">Template:Idw-pui</a> to have a very light background, and to include the full image name (with namespace) as parameter. While these are possibly good things (and I can see the benefit of the parameter change), {{<a href="../../../i/d/w/Template%7EIdw-pui_9c6a.html" title="Template:Idw-pui">idw-pui</a>}} is now out-of-synch with {{<a href="../../../i/d/w/Template%7EIdw-uo_1ad7.html" title="Template:Idw-uo">idw-uo</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../i/d/w/Template%7EIdw-cp_452c.html" title="Template:Idw-cp">idw-cp</a>}}. Should the other two be changed, or this one changed back? Please reply to this section.

<li>I would change the other two to the same style. I changed them to make them less garish, as they already stick out, and to make copying easier, as I generally do lots of images at once, and thus copy the image file name to several places, including there and list for addition to the PUI page. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/u/r/User_talk%7EBurgundavia_a5f1.html" title="User talk:Burgundavia">âœˆ take a flight?</a>)</small> 08:14, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hello, yes I did take that pic. I had uploaded it onto commons, but then when I tried to put it in the article another picture of an album cover kept going up instead. I reaslised that it had the exact same name but was on wikipedia, so I uploaded again over that. If that is taken off, without the album cover being deleted, then the vatican article will look a bit silly!

<p>It never occurred to me that a government's photo collection would not be in the public domain. Anyhow, the Bet Alfa pic was from the World Zionist Organization, but the Kibbutz Dan pic was from the Israeli National Photo Collection. I am assuming that the photos are acceptable though. The kibbutz article has been up at the official English version of the kibbutz website. <a href="http://www.kibbutz.org.il/eng/welcome.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kibbutz.org.il/eng/welcome.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kibbutz.org.il/eng/welcome.htm</a> <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinopup_b4d0.html" title="User:Dinopup">Dinopup</a> 23:49, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Burgundavia, I honestly wasn't trying to be daft with these edits! What I was trying to do was to get the number of {| symbols equal to the number of |} symbols in those airport articles. The reason I noticed this is because it is one of the things the <a href="../../../w/s/_/WP%7EWS_f722.html" title="WP:WS">Wiki Syntax Project</a> checks, as people will regularly start a table without closing it, or close a table without opening it, or nest tables but stuff up the syntax. Sometimes this has no visual effect, but sometimes it results in whole sections of an article not being visible until it's fixed. So finding and fixing these situations is useful. With tables, there are almost always two types - there is the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_Taxobox_Usage_8713.html#Taxobox_for_a_plant_species" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life/Taxobox Usage">taxobox style</a>, where the table is started in an included template ('Taxobox begin'), and ended in an included template ('Taxobox end'); Or there is the straight start a table (possibly with a template, such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Template%7EPrettytable_25a4.html" title="Template:Prettytable">prettytable</a>, to define it's appearance), followed by the straight table end. E.g.</p>
<pre>
{| {{subst:prettytable}}
... blah blah ...
|}
</pre>
<p>Now, the problem with the airport tables, was that they had mixed those two styles - it had an {{Airport frame}} at the start, but an |} at the end. Whilst the end result <b>was</b> valid wiki syntax, it had three problems, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like invalid syntax to software performing very simple checks for syntax problems.</li>
<li>It looks like invalid syntax to humans reading the wiki source (for example, I assumed it was wrong at first, because it just looks wrong).</li>
<li>It's inconsistent - ideally a table should start one way, and end the same way (not start in a template, and end on the page).</li>
</ul>
<p>So in terms of fixing this, whilst producing the same output, there were two choices that seemed applicable. One was to match the starting {{Airport frame}} with an equivalent ending template, which is what I did with {{Airport end frame}}. The alternative would be to do something like:</p>
<pre>
{| {{pretty airport box}}
... blah blah ...
|}
</pre>
<p>Would you prefer the second of these styles? If so, please just let me know, as I'm happy to change them all over to use this style instead. Basically, I'm just looking for a consistent table start and table end style, but the actual style that is used doesn't bother me. I hope I've explained what I was doing OK, and that you don't think I'm completely mad :-) -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:18, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I have now spent a considerable amount of time tagging the images uploaded by me over the past few years, which you have questioned recently. Because of the long time lapse since these pictures were first uploaded to Wikipedia, I have had to dig deep into time to find the right tag for each image, and I believe I have done a good job by following the guidelines on the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> page. Since there are so many images involved here (over 80), I placed all the images relating to me in a separate section, see <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossibly_unfree_images_5fcf.html#Compliance_by_User:IZAK" title="Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images">Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images#Compliance by User:IZAK</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Possibly_unfree_images#Compliance_by_User:IZAK" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Possibly_unfree_images#Compliance_by_User:IZAK" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Now, as I mention in that section: I have now provided updated legitimate tags for the images enumerated below by User:Burgundavia. I hope that the questions have been laid to rest about sources as I have now updated the tags to reflect their current status using Wikipedia's own guidelines from <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. I respectfully request resolution of this matter as soon as possible. Thank you. One more point, if you come across any more images that may have been uploaded or incorrectly tagged by me in the past and you need more accurate information, <b>please contact me about each and every one of them on my user page as soon as you find them and not days or weeks after you list them</b>. I will hopefully respond to all requests as best I can under the circumstances. Thanks again! <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:27, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Burgundavia, i don t see on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> where is says that it is (proposed as) policy that we can t add an article to both direct parent and more ultimate parent cats. is there another page on policy i m not finding?</p>
<p>the primary goal of categorizing (as stated on the policy page cited above) is accessibility. Having an article so central to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Category%7ENova_Scotia_e7bd.html" title="Category:Nova Scotia">Category:Nova Scotia</a> go through two lesser cat links is poor accessibilty. moreover, <a href="../../../n/o/v/Category%7ENova_Scotia_e7bd.html" title="Category:Nova Scotia">Category: Nova Scotia</a> is a thinly populated cat - there is neither space or clutter issues involved in having a few (there are a few more) instances of redundant categorizing for the sake of far better accessibility.

<p>I have reverted all your external links, as I feel they do not add value to wikipedia. Sites with pictures are easy to find. Burgundavia (âœˆ take a flight?) 02:51, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Easy to find? So what? And it's HARD to find sites like ford.com? A lot of the pictures are UNIQUE. 1. You may have created this page for the exclusive purpose of adding to wikipedia. If you did, that is a strict no-no What are you talking about? What page? The car article pages already existed!</p>
<p>2. It looks like many of your images are copyright violations. There are not. You would be very wise to not make such accusations.</p>

<p>Hi Burg. I don't agree about the whole content of the note. True is that Palestine is not a state yet. However, the Palestinian territories are currently under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which took it over from Israel following the 1993 Oslo Accords. Particularly, the airport of Gaza is located in Gaza city, which is controlled by the Palestinian Authority. For the West Bank, civil control over substantial areas is granted to the Palestinian Authority. The kind of those <b>airports are civil infrastructures</b>, as opposed to military ones. I don't imagine a category of Palestinian universities having such a note! Indeed, if the construction of airports is disputed than surely Israel would have not agreed about their construction. This is my explanation and I am still not convinced of the relevance of that note there. <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 12:26, May 21, 2005 (UTC) <sup><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF">Wiki me upâ„¢</a></sup></p>

Thanx for deleting the image. There are some more images added by me with similar history. I had also marked them for deletion but they have not been deleted yet. I also tried looking for suitable replacements (that come under fair use) but could not find any. I am listing the images. Kindly delete them.<br />

<p>OK. Sorry to sound a bit angry here, but you tagged a bunch of images I put on wiki with "Image deletion warning" including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:200px-Ikebukuro sta2.jpg</li>
<li>Image:200px-Takadanobaba station.jpg</li>

</ul>
<p>I guess I wasnt clear when I said "from Japanese page" but of course I ment from WIKI Japanese page. And if you spent two seconds looking there, you'd know these are not evil pictures and they can be used on wiki. For example Shinokubo: <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Shinookubo_sta1.jpg" class="external free" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Shinookubo_sta1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Shinookubo_sta1.jpg</a> Is GNU and yes when I uploaded it I didn't know how to make the tag, and if you want to put the correct tag on them, do it, but don't jump to "delete!!!" status with out a little checking around, please!! thank you. any questions, let me know. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENesnad_02ec.html" title="User talk:Nesnad">User talk:Nesnad</a> 13:58, 24 May 2005 (UTC) <b>more from me:</b> good effort, trying to tag all those images. I did tell you they all have a source, the Japanese wikipedia page, they are not images you want to whack. I am busy with a project can't tag them now, if you have too much to do, I understand. If you can't, I'll tag them later when I have time to chase them down.

If you can tag things as no source, you can tag them with their source when you learn it. It's only fair, man. Otherwise you are saying "I tag them as no source and want them to be deleted even though I've been told they are GNU and they have a source" which is silly.

<p>Howdy, I submitted this image and you marked it as PUIdisputed. I sent an email to Bob Gruen at his website, asking permission to use <a href="http://www.bobgruen.com/files/johnlennon/r004.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bobgruen.com/files/johnlennon/r004.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> photograph of Yoko on Wikipedia, and he was fine with it. I'm still a newbie to wikipedia, and it wasn't clear to me which copyright tag I should use. Was I wrong in assuming that it's ok to put an image on Wikipedia as long as one gets permission? <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodenTaco_608d.html" title="User:WoodenTaco">WoodenTaco</a> 20:36, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excuse me, I didn't "merely upload it." I uploaded it from a GFDL source, which I identified. If you think that GFDL source had a copyright issue, take it up with them.

<dd>You mean "estimated", right? Not knowing when you took a photo isn't very surprising. And the uploader could probably have narrowed it down closer if he had bothered.

<p>Dear Corey:</p>
<p>I have just outlined my reasons why I have listed the map as a GDFL on the map page itself. I hope this is right and I have done it all correctly. If not, please dont hesitate to contact me again. Thank you for spotting the fact that i had not given a copyright rating. It was one of the earlier ones I worked on and I guess I justmissed it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>John Hill</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Dear Corey:</p>
<p>I and my partner Jo Wynter (and Gisela Whitear who works for Cook Shire Council) adapted the map for use in our report. It was based on a standard map used by Cook Shire Council for many pamphlets, free handouts, etc. They keep changing the basic map to highlight whatever subject they are using it for. If there is any copyright on it, it would probably belong to Jo Wynter and myself as we are listed as the authors of the report. Jo Wynter is, of course, happy for it to be used and, so as to cover all bases, I have just contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Cook Shire Council to write a letter of permission for its use. Will scan it when I get it and send it on to you.</p>
<p><br />
Cheers,</p>

<p>Hi, just spotted your tag for copyright info. This has now been clarified. There is a note on my talk page about images I upload, but I guess you must have missed it. Just for future reference: If I haven't taken a photo myself, then it's from The Regimental Photo Archives Collection, and I'm the Regimental Photo Archivist, If I upload photo's to wiki the images are free, but to anyone else they arn't. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 11:02, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your not the only one that's confused, over licences. Basically I'm uploading images that I don't mind people taking and using themselves, but I don't want people to abuse them or use them to earn a profit from. I don't follow the US licence system, I'm British, so is there an international licence you could suggest that falls within my requirements. I did take a look at the wiki sections on licences, but after half an hour I needed an aspirin and a lie down in a dark room. On some of my images I've put:-</dd>

<dd>Yes! lots of nice images, if you follow all the links from the Duke of Wellington's Regiment page you will see I've uploaded lots of images of various Dukes of Wellingtons, which are on the linked pages in the Duke of Wellington page articles, plus I've also uploaded lots of previously unkown nice photo's of Victoria Cross Recipients to the pages converted from the Victoria Cross Reference website. So if you intend to delete everything I've ever uploaded there will be a bit of a mess to sort out, editing away all the links. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 13:59, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm pretty sure It's not going to be used so feel free to delete it if there are any issues with it. <a href="../../../n/r/b/User%7ENrbelex_e99b.html" title="User:Nrbelex">Nrbelex</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/r/b/User_talk%7ENrbelex_ed7d.html" title="User talk:Nrbelex">talk</a>)</sup> 00:24, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the time I don't think it had an issue requiring deletion and it was requested that somebody try to delete the black background; I went ahead and did that. If I had known the original was under consideration for deletion due to (c) issues, I would not have created the new image.

<p>Hello, I noticed your notice on this page regarding a possible copyvio with Image:65mustang.jpg. This user in on an a WIKI-vacation and might not be aware of the situation. Perhaps as a courtesy, an email to him would give him the opportunity to correct the attribution. On his behalf, thank you.

<p>Sorry I was unable to continue conversation, I was called away on urgent business, I will have to confirm with higher authority before progressing further on Crown Copyright Tag, The UK is currently on a Public Holiday weekend, so it may take a bit of time. In the meantime these obsolete images I uploaded can be deleted, as they were replaced by updated images:-</p>
<p>Image:DWR Honorary Queen's Colour.JPG Image:DWR Honorary Regimental Colour.JPG Image:DWR Regulation Queen's Colour.JPG Image:DWR Regulation Regimental Colour.JPG Image:DWR CD Cap Badge.jpg Image:DWR 33rd Badge Template.jpg</p>
<p>Please advise regarding tags on Regimental Colours, you mentioned other tags, though these items would also be covered by CC as they are replaced &amp; updated every 25 years, paid for by the Regiments, so they are Regimental property.</p>
<p>Also logo's of badges: I created those, using CorelDraw, as copies of the original logos in the archive records, again the Regiment owns the original logo's, not the Government.

<p>I did indeed create this image, and so it would normally be PD. The only thing is, I'm not sure if the music itself is yet in the public domain--<i>Petrushka</i> was written in the 1910s, but I don't know if it was published before the 1940s (I have one reference work to hand which suggests it wasn't, but it's not very clear). I would think that, if nothing else, the image is OK for us to use under fair use (it's a tiny excerpt from a much larger work), but I'm not sure if it should be considered PD or not. Sorry I can't be more definite. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a> 20:20, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The picture was taken off www.cardomain.com, where as far as I've read, images do not have copyrights. Still if you can see something regarding that subject in their page, let me know and I'll be glad to take the picture down.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in answering; I started out in Wikipedia as a means of not going crazy while I was between jobs. Now I have a couple of jobs and have found it quite hard to set some time apart and answer back queries. I've also forgot most of the typing commands and I'm having a had time posting this.</p>

<p>I'm currently in Africa, with very erratic access to the net.

<dd>Yes, that would be great. Also, I wonder how to tag images whose copyright belongs to organizations that a) no longer exist and b) never had any legal existance (i.e. political underground movements). Moreover, concerning the Somalia images, could a similar tag be made as on that of public use of Soviet images? --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 16:44, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HI, I was doing RC today and noticed the <i>new</i> article <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._C._Penney_6e48.html" title="J. C. Penney">J. C. Penney</a>. Some mistake, obviously, I thought, but on checking I found that the article of that name had recently been <i>deleted</i>. Looking at it I see that the article was a perfectly good stub for months on end, then someone grafted a copyvio onto it. Someone spotted it and listed it as a copyvio, and then, against normal procedure (revert to non-violating article) the <i>entire article and its history were deleted.</i> I see you marked it pending deletion in April so I guess this must have been your decision.</p>
<p>Please be more careful. In case you didn't know, this guy was the founder of a large chain of department stores. The article had been present on Wikipedia since September, 2003 and there wasn't a hint of copyvio until March of this year. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:50, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Mr. Burgundavia. I was just looking (and replying to) the comment you made on my <a href="../../../i/m/a/User_talk%7EImaek_b68b.html" title="User talk:Imaek">talk page</a>, and I realized that you made the Meta, Fr, and Simple links at the head of your page <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">external links</a>. This adds the little graphic with the arrow and the box to the right hand side of the link. In order to make these internal links (which they are; just in secret), you can link to them using [[:NAMESPACE:article]], so for your Meta page, (which is special: it doesn't need the leading colon) it would be:</p>
<pre>
[[<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="meta:Main_Page">meta</a>:<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Burgundavia" class="extiw" title="meta:User:Burgundavia">User:Burgundavia</a>|Burgundavia]]
</pre>
<p>But for all language wikis, you will need to preface it with a colon. Your french page, for example:</p>
<pre>
[[:<a href="../../../../fr/index.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Main_Page">fr</a>:<a href="../../../../fr/b/u/r/Utilisateur%7EBurgundavia_269c.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Utilisateur:Burgundavia">Utilisateur:Burgundavia</a>|Burgundavia]]
</pre>
<p>(Just a note: leaving the colon off of the front of language-links make it show up in the "Other Languages" bar on the left-hand side. You might also want to consider this.) You can read up about interwiki linking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html#Links_and_URLs" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Not saying you must, just saying it's a cool feature of Wikipedia you might want to check out. Thanks --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaek_d778.html" title="User:Imaek">Imaek</a> 23:55, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
