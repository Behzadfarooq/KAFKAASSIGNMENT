<p>Re: "<i>Bacharach's music is characterized by the frequent use of innovative chord changes, striking rhythmic patterns, frequent modulation (that is, key changes), and odd time signatures (for example, 5/4 or 3/2), going from one time signature to another in the same song, often successively.</i>":</p>
<p>I don't think you can reasonably maintain there is anything <i>odd</i> about 3/2. It means precisely the same thing as 3/4 and 3/8 simply using a different note value as point of reference. I also don't think it's the business of this article to define <i>modulation</i>. (Furnish a link to a separate <i>modulation</i> article if you're adamant.) "Innovative" strikes me as awkward and point-of-view; <i>unusual</i> would be better. <i>Changing meter</i> would be less verbose and rambling than "going from one time signature to another in the same song, often successively". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheScotch_6f86.html" title="User:TheScotch">TheScotch</a> 18:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if it is useful to have the "known records" section. It is hardly a representative selection, and it seems less than practical to list them all.

<hr />
<p><b>Burt Bacharach</b> (born <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>) is an American composer of popular music. He teamed with lyricist <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_David_36d6.html" title="Hal David">Hal David</a> and others to write many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, including "I Say a Little Prayer For You", "The Look of Love", "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", "Alfie" and "What the World Needs Now Is Love".</p>
<p>Bacharach's music has been sung by a number of popular singers including <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionne_Warwick_8af7.html" title="Dionne Warwick">Dionne Warwick</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/e/Aretha_Franklin_5ce5.html" title="Aretha Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Jones_%28singer%29_8063.html" title="Tom Jones (singer)">Tom Jones</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpenters.html" title="Carpenters">Carpenters</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Springfield_7baf.html" title="Dusty Springfield">Dusty Springfield</a>. The music has been praised for the distinctive melodies, sophisticated style and at times a light classical feel. He wrote a total of 52 Top 40 hits in his songwriting career.</p>
<p>He has been married four times, to Paula Stewart, actress <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angie_Dickinson_7384.html" title="Angie Dickinson">Angie Dickinson</a>, lyricist <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carole_Bayer_Sager_fef7.html" title="Carole Bayer Sager">Carole Bayer Sager</a> with whom he collaborated on a number of pieces, and currently (2003) Jane Hanson.</p>
<p>Bacharach has had cameo roles in a number of Hollywood movies including all three Austin Powers movies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Re: "<i>Bacharach's music has been sung by a number of popular singers...</i>":</p>
<p>It would be better to say either "Bacharach's <i>songs have</i> been sung by a number of popular singers..." or "Bacharach's music has been <i>performed</i> by a number of popular singers...." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheScotch_6f86.html" title="User:TheScotch">TheScotch</a> 18:41, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Currently (2003) Jane Hanson" makes it sound as if the two were married in 2003. It would be better to say "and since 1990 to Jane Hanson"--substituting for "1990" the year they actually were married, whatever that is. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheScotch_6f86.html" title="User:TheScotch">TheScotch</a> 18:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We say he was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and I don't doubt that, but I'm pretty sure he's a graduate of Forest Hills High School in Queens (NYC).

<p><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_%28band%29.html" title="Love (band)">Love</a> certainly recorded "My Little Red Book" (and nicely, at that) I believe that the claim that it was written for them is wrong.

<p>Yes, you're right. Not only did Bacharach not write the song for Love, he strongly disapproved of Love's rendition--according to the extensive liner notes of the Rhino box-set release <i>The Look of Love: The Burt Collection</i> . <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheScotch_6f86.html" title="User:TheScotch">TheScotch</a> 18:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The song "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is listed in the article as being "from the movie of the same name." The song was written after the fact to cash in on the movie's popularity, and appears nowhere in the movie itself. The same would be true of "Wives and Lovers." I'm removing the film reference from the article listing. Rich 03:15, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We need to be careful, as sometimes the wording will be "after the movie of the same name" in which it is correct if quoted exactly. Sometimes songs are written for the movie and rejected for inclusion, so research and double checking are essential with these.--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETednor_7c93.html" title="User:Tednor">Tednor</a> 09:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to see this beefed up. It should be mentioned that his father was a well-known newspaper columnist in Kansas City. And there's an ongoig unconfirmed legend that Bacharach was kicked out of McGill for playing classical music boss-nova style, many have tried to establish whether this was true but nobody has as of yet. I'd love to know. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaforcemedia_9c1d.html" title="User:Megaforcemedia">Megaforcemedia</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaforcemedia_9f08.html" title="User talk:Megaforcemedia">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Megaforcemedia_2c23.html" title="Special:Contributions/Megaforcemedia">contribs</a>) 25 September 2006.</small></p>

<p>I humbly suggest that we avoid giving the readers a headache and/or false impressions under the "hits" category. These records should be limited to top 40 hit singles, and only the versions that attained such successs. For example: "i just don't know what to do with myself" was recorded in a version prior to dusty's as well as many after, including Nicky Holland's version for The Best Man and the White Stripes version, neither of which were singles and neither of which charted. I love Dusty more than any singer and would love to see her name many times in this list, which could easily happen if i started putting all the times she sang a Bacharach song in. However, I feel it is most important that she get credit for having the sole "hit" version of "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself" and not have that fact muddied by the names of other artists. Do others get what I am saying and agree?</p>
<p>Also, please note chart info in brief behind the artist thanks!</p>
<p>One more thing, is there a way to split off the songs into their own subpages (and separate from above, as the focus of such will be different), so that all artists who recorded the songs can be mentioned? With a catalog such as Bacharach's this will eventually prove both necessary and invaluable. Those editing could place the Record Company and year of Recording behind the artists names and the whole list could be alphabetized to avoid double-entry.

<p>That is exactly why I'm wondering about creating an "appended page" for this use. I know little of the technical aspects of Wiki and try to focus on bulking up content instead of the technical aspects. Is there such a thing as an appended page in Wiki??

<dd>I have no clear idea what you mean by an "appended page". You can add a page at any time. If you are asking about a subpage of a particular page, the answer is that they go against guidelines and we almost never do them in article space, except for things like a temporary page used for a translation in progress. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not a musician, nor a composer, but I notice as a <i>listener</i> that Bacharach places many staccato lines in his bridges, and especially horn parts (i can't think a single Bacharach trumpet part which is not delivered staccato!).

<dd>I think that you are responding more to his use of syncopation, and other unexpected rhythmic patterns. Bacharach doesn't really use staccato to any especial degree. The trumpet <i>obbligati</i> to which you refer are not really staccato. 66.108.105.21 18:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC) Allen Roth</dd>

<p><br />
Whether or not Bacharach uses "staccato to any especial degree", he does tend to use trumpet or fluegelhorn staccato conspicuously, distinctively, and memorably, which has nothing whatsoever to do with his use of syncopation. "Walk On By" is a case in point. Re: "The trumpet <i>obbligati</i> to which you refer are not really staccato": They're <i>short notes</i>. What would <i>you</i> call short notes other than <i>staccato</i>? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheScotch_6f86.html" title="User:TheScotch">TheScotch</a> 18:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Its acceptable to discuss in this article the life and death of Nikki as it relates to Burt. There can be a verifiable entry on the impact of Nikki's life and death on Burt. For example, there probably should be more verifiable information on the song Nikki in the article, including why Burt wrote it and what messages it sends. However, since Nikki herself is not notable, it is not appropriate to include facts about her (birth date, death date, etc.) that are not directly related to Burt. This is especially true at this moment in time since she just died and given the way she died. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 21:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While Asperger's Syndrome is lifelong, it was not officially recognized in this country until the 90s. AS doesn't cause depression, but many Aspies have depression and are slightly more likely to kill themselves than neurotypical people.

<p>You appear to confusing style (in my opinion, <i>bad</i> style) with grammar. Save your religious fervor for the Revivalist meeting. Here are some more representative and more authoritative sources:</p>
<p>John Hodes and Mary Whiteman: <i>Harbrace College Handbook</i>, 136: "Either the <i>'</i> or <i>s</i> may be used to form such plurals as the following:.... the 1970's or the 1970s".</p>
<p>Margaret Shertzer: <i>The Elements of Grammar</i>, 99: "The <i>'s</i> may be added to figures, signs, symbols, and letters of the alphabet to form the plural. ...<i>In the 1900s (or 1900's) technology spread through every aspect of human life, from transportation and cooking to</i> in vitro <i>fertilization.</i>"</p>
<p>A reasonable compromise if you simply cannot tolerate the apostrophe, it seems to me, would be simply to spell out the word <i>seventies</i> (or <i>eighties</i> and so on).</p>

<dd>I'm simply pointing out Wikipedia's style guide backed up with a number of sources. Hardly "religious fervor." The apostrophe in dates and numbers makes no grammatical sense. And I was especially responding to the troll and grammar-police wanna-be and his nasty message: "Anyone unfamiliar with this punctuation is unfamiliar with very BASIC rudiments of the English language and show thus not undertake to edit English prose" which I find persnickety and more than a little humourless. Whoever that person is, I'm sure he's loads of fun at a party. It's all too finger-wagging schoolmarm for me. (Especially since he's wrong--the final irony). That's all I have to say on the matter. I believe that Wikipedia standards and style guides should be maintained, even for just the sake of consistency. (And don't you think it a bit odd that the article this person chose to "correct", of all the entries in Wikipedia, is Burt Bacharach? I find it a bit peculiar. Probably just me). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 15:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have cut the following from the article. It was way too much about one song that, as is acknowledged, "never even dented the 'bubbling under' singles charts". Also, some of the tone is fannish and unencyclopedic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In April 1960 a very strange Bacharach composed (also arranged &amp; conducted) song appeared by the late-fifties rockabilly artist and soon to be actor - Paul Hampton. The song was titled: "Two Hour Honeymoon" and appeared on Dot Records (#16084). This is a bizarre novelty song with haunting music by Bacharach about a couple who have just been married and are driving in their car on the way to their honeymoon, when they have a bad accident and the wife is killed and the husband (narrator) is lying there dying, talking to his dead wife and saying that they only had a "Two Hour" Honeymoon. This is one of THE strangest records ever issued and never even dented the "bubbling under" singles charts!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifties rockabilly artist Paul Hampton issued the bizarre song ("Two Hour Honeymoon") in April 1960 on Dot Records. This was co-written with Bacharach and featured his arrangement &amp; conducting of the haunting backround music in a song about a newlywed couple involved in a fatal auto accident right after their wedding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul Hampton (who, I gather, wrote the lyrics, Bacharach just wrote a melody) doesn't even have an article. I'd suggest writing that article — with appropriate citations, in an appropriate style — discussing the song there, and giving it a one-line mention (at most) here. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
