<p>We should use the <b>most correct information</b> available - for all Wikipedia articles. For anime and manga articles specifically, the guidelines are to use hepburn romanizations of the original names, unless another romanization (that is also 'correct') is more frequently used (for example, Goku rather than Gokū), or if the name is derived from an English word (for example, Trunks rather than Torankusu).</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure this out right now. I've got a Super Barcode Wars card that says "Bar<b>duck</b>" <a href="http://www.dbzcollection.fr/barcode/cartes/barcode3/images/96_jpg.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.dbzcollection.fr/barcode/cartes/barcode3/images/96_jpg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbzcollection.fr/barcode/cartes/barcode3/images/96_jpg.jpg</a> -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 16:23, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had this same discussion on the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majin_Buu_56d7.html" title="Majin Buu">Majin Buu</a> article. I suggested changing the article to Djinn Boo (because I thought that we were going by the English manga names) and it worked, but it was reverted shortly after. I really don't know what determines the name of a Dragon Ball article, but what we should be doing is using the English manga names for <i>all DB articles</i>, not a manga name on one page (<a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_Goku_%28Dragon_Ball%29_accd.html" title="Son Goku (Dragon Ball)">Son Goku</a>, for example) and an anime name on another (like Bardock). We need to come up with some sort of agreement on how the DB articles are named (if there isn't one already). // <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke-kun27_416b.html" title="User:Sasuke-kun27"><font color="blue"><b>Sasuke</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasuke-kun27_a050.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasuke-kun27"><font color="purple"><b>-kun</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasuke-kun27_30a7.html" title="User talk:Sasuke-kun27"><font color="black"><b>27</b></font></a> 20:24, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's been discussed, were going to have to use the <a href="../../../v/i/z/VIZ_Media_a7db.html" title="VIZ Media">Viz</a> Manga names, since the manga has the highest source of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> in fiction, hence, Bardock should <b>definitely</b> be changed to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ffcd.html" title="Burdock (Dragon Ball)">Burdock (Dragon Ball)</a>. // <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)"><font color="blue"><b>Power</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Power_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f043.html" title="Special:Contributions/Power level (Dragon Ball)"><font color="purple"><b>level</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/o/w/User_talk%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_d945.html" title="User talk:Power level (Dragon Ball)"><font color="black"><b>Stacy's Mom</b></font></a> 21:21, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps it should be discussed again. This blind adherence to the Viz translation is flawed. There are clear guidelines for Wikipedia already, we should use those.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Japan-related_articles%29_4f6d.html#Romanisation" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)">MOS:Japan related articles</a></b></p>
<p>The name should be a hepburn romanization of the original name, unless another correct romanization is more well known (ie: Gouk rather than Gokū), or if the word is derived from an English word (ie: Trunks rather than Torankusu).</p>
<p>So, in this case, Burdock may be the correct article name, but <b>not</b> because it's used by Viz. Viz has many problems with its Dragon Ball release, including erroneous names. If all the DB articles are using the Viz translations instead of Wiki guidelines, they should all be re-checked to make sure the article names are correct.</p>

<dd>Ever heard of the vegetable, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdock" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdock" rel="nofollow">burdock</a>? That is an English word, and Toriyama has said it's derived from that same vegetable (just like all of the other Saiyans, such as Kakarrot (carrot), Vegeta (the word "vegetable), Nappa (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cabbage" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cabbage" rel="nofollow">the cabbage</a>), Raditz (<i>radittsu</i> in Japanese, derived from <i>radisshu</i>, or radish), Tullece (lettuce), Paragas (asparagas), and Broli (broccoli).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Uh huh... and the discussion here is whether the name is simply 'Burdock' or if it's slightly different, or "derived", from the word 'burdock'. Some Saiyan names are exactly like the word (Nappa) while others are slight variations on the word (Broli). From what we've learned, it's probably 'Burdock' and not 'Bardock' or 'Barduck'. -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 22:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Landmark says that the vegetable is pronounced <i>baadakku</i>, like Burdock's name, so it should just be spelled Burdock. Chibi Gohan 23:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could we get a quick scan of that? -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 00:33, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't own a scanner. Perhaps this could be discussed on DaizenshuuEX (since people like Steve and Julian are there). Chibi Gohan 19:28, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, here's what I've got:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Burdock" -- which would be pronounced <i>bur dock</i></dd>
<dd>バードック -- <i>baa do ku</i></dd>
<dd>バー<b>ダ</b>ック -- <i>baa <b>dah</b> ku</i></dd>
<dd>(Bur)ダ(ck) -- <i>bur dah k</i></dd>
<dd>Burdock</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, so, "yay, whole lotta useless work".</p>
<p>So 'burdock' would normally be バードック in katakana, and Toriyama (apparently) decided to change one of the characters (so it's a reference to burdock not just 'burdock'). But the kana he used instead of ド was ダ, which (with a 'k' sound added on) sound exactly like 'dock'. The romanized name should reflect the original spelling and show the change from that word - but it already does (Just like Vegeta and Videl, but that's another explanation). Unless someone wants to romanize it as 'Burdahk' or 'Burdawk', I suggest 'Burdock'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That said, 'Bardock' is a correct romanization, but doesn't hold as true to the original word.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, who's up for a Move Request to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ffcd.html" title="Burdock (Dragon Ball)">Burdock (Dragon Ball)</a>? -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 16:05, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where's your source that says burdock is pronounced バードック (<i>baadokku</i>) as opposed to バーダック (<i>baadakku</i>)? Chibi Gohan 19:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, not much of a source really. I don't think 'a guy' is really much of a source. Oliver Hague, over on the DaizEX forum, and I have been debating it for a while. バードック is (apparently) a much more common 'spelling' for 'burdock' than バーダック. A quick google shows DBZ or other anime sites for バーダック and 'herb' stores and cooking stores for バードック. バーダック could be a transliteration for 'burdock' but it's just not the most common one, I guess. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 20:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>support</b> the move to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ffcd.html" title="Burdock (Dragon Ball)">Burdock (Dragon Ball)</a>. ----<font face="comic sans ms"><a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)"><b>Power level</b></a><a href="../../../p/o/w/User_talk%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29__talk_here_72f0.html" title="User talk:Power level (Dragon Ball) /talk here"><font color="sky blue"><b>(Dragon Ball)</b></font></a></font> 15:32, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also think it should be moved to <i>Burdock (Dragon Ball)</i>. And note that we have not only the VIZ translation backing the move, but also Steve Simmons, who is a hell of a lot more accurate than whoever writes the dub scripts. Chibi Gohan 19:12, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know how to remove those alternate names? When I try to delete them, it leaves a blank space in the article where the alternate names should go. And nobody says Budock or Badock anyway, not to mention the fact that they're incorrect. Chibi Gohan 19:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with the move to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ffcd.html" title="Burdock (Dragon Ball)">Burdock (Dragon Ball)</a>, I just don't want to do it right now. *meh* If someone else does the work, I'll vote it, but I'm not too worried about it. The same goes for the info box. The whole thing needs to be redone, for all the DB pages. The alternate names thing is useless and confusing (there should be a whole section detailing the name). Other anime character info boxes are better, I'm looking at possible reworks. The same goes for the template at the bottom. There's one for characters, one for the anime, I think there's a third too.

<dd>I know I'm coming into this late, but there was no Requested Move posted, so I didn't notice. I really disagree with this title. Almost <i>no one</i> in the United States knows this character by this name. A search on Google for "Burdock Dragonball" shows only 1440 hits, compared to almost 200K hits for the same with "Bardock". The only reference to "Burdock" in the US is in one line of one page of the VIZ manga, but "Burdock" is the spelling and name preferred in the Anime series (as dubbed/edited by FUNimation) and the TV movie (also by FUNimation). According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>, we should <i>Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things.</i>. "Burdock" fails this twice: first by requiring the disambiguation from <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock.html" title="Burdock">Burdock</a> (the bush) and second by not being the name most commonly associated with the character. I agree that "Burdock" might be a more "true" transliteration, but Wikipedia policy is often to choose the more well-known name for the title, even against a more "correct" one. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 23:14, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good points all around. And I agree that "Bardock" is probably more well known than "Burdock" but I'm torn as to whether that's enough to warrant it's use or not. <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html#Romanisation" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP#Romanisation</a> says we should use the English spelling for transliterations from katakana, but <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7Eanime_aa0f.html#Sections" title="WP:anime">WP:anime#Sections</a> says we should use official romanizations if possible. Choosing one distribution company's translation over another is a wrought with difficulty (and I don't want to get into <i>that</i> right now). I'm just unsure what is more important: recognizability, or correct information. "Bardock" is a decent transliteration of the katakana, but it's obviously not what it's supposed to be. And "Burdock" isn't so far off that noone would figure out who's being referred to.</dd>

<p>First, I'd like to ask anyone who knows how to archive everything above. The page is cluttered and needs to be cleaned. I'd do it, I just don't know how.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm sure everyone means well, but the opening paragraphs where it says that "Burdock's name is a pun on 'burdock', which is an herb", the second "burdock" should stay lowercase, it's not a proper noun.</p>
<p>Now on to the Name section. Perhaps I've just not fleshed it out enough to make it understand able -but I'm worried that a long drawn out explanation would clutter the article. I'll expand on the explanation and ask y'all to point out where it should be cut down.</p>
<p><a name="Name" id="Name"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Talk%7EBurdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_0c84.html" title="Edit section: Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h3>
<p>Burdock's name is, like all other <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saiyan.html" title="Saiyan">Saiyans</a>, a pun on a plant. In this case, the herb <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock.html" title="Burdock">burdock</a>. In Japanese foreign words are transliterated into a special alphabet called "<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a>". These characters are very much like English letters in that they are sounds without meanings (as opposed to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">Kanji</a> which are whole words in a single character). The word "burdock" transliterated into katakana is バードック (<i>bādokku</i> pronounced like "<i>baa doe coo</i>") but the character's name is written as バーダック (<i>bādakku</i> pronounced like "<i>baa dah coo</i>"), changing the <i>do</i> character to <i>da</i>. This character change actually makes the kana sound <i>more</i> like "Burdock" to English speakers than it did before, and that makes it difficult to accurately <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanize.html" title="Romanize">romanize</a> the word to show the pun. Normally one would simply spell out the word exactly as the kana sounds, in this case <i>badakku</i>. But knowing the word is based on an English word it is common to use that spelling if at all possible. The problem arises in the character change from ド (<i>do</i>) to ダ (<i>da</i>). To show the change the romanization should mirror the change as well. The ダ (<i>da</i>) character replaced the "do" part of "burdock", so it would seem obvious to change the word to "burdack" - but such a change would alter the pronunciation of the change. The new spelling "burdack" doesn't have the same syllable sound a ダ (<i>da</i>). In fact, the only English spelling that would keep the same sound would be "burdawk" or "burdock".</p>
<p>So the word could conceivably be romanized as "Burdock", "Barduck", "Badack" or any combination of those syllables.</p>
<p>It's just that it seems a bit redundant, but taking things out makes it more ambiguous. I think most of the explanation about katakana can be taken out (a link to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> should suffice) but I'm not sure how indepth the explanation the romanization should go. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 21:51, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock_%28Dragon_Ball%29_ffcd.html" title="Burdock (Dragon Ball)">Burdock (Dragon Ball)</a> → <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardock.html" title="Bardock">Bardock</a> — Article recently renamed (outside of <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>), but new name does not follow <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>. According to that policy, we should <i>Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things.</i> "Burdock" as a name is only used in the VIZ manga translation, once, for a character that appears in two panels. There are only 1440 Google hits on "Burdock Dragonball". "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardock.html" title="Bardock">Bardock</a>", the original name of this article, is the name used consistently in the anime (as translated by FUNimation), is used in the title of the TV movie (also by FUNimation), and used in nearly every US tie-in product. "Bardock Dragoball" receives 200,000 Google hits. I believe this name was chosen due to a mis-reading of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP</a>, which anyway is only a guideline while WP:NAME is official policy. This change would also allow us to use just "Bardock" as the article name, without the parenthetical disambiguation which makes linking more cumbersome. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 06:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reasons for using Bardock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bardock is the most common variation of the name. (1400 Google hits for Burdock vs 200,000) (See also <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test</a>)</li>
<li>Bardock is in the name of a title of a movie in the US: <a href="../../../f/a/t/Bardock%7E_Father_of_Goku_cdc7.html" title="Bardock: Father of Goku">Bardock: Father of Goku</a>. Using "Burdock" as the character name would make that article quite odd.</li>
<li>"Bardock" requires no disambiguation on Wikipedia, while "Burdock" does. This makes linking more difficult and less natural.</li>
<li>"Bardock" is the name used in both the "cut" and "uncut" FUNimation-translated anime series, including in the title of the movie. In contrast, Burdock is used only once in the VIZ-translated manga.</li>
<li>In the US, the "Bardock" name precedes Burdock by several years.</li>
<li>Both names are reasonable romanizations of the Japanese. While "Burdock" may express the pun better, that's a subjective test. We have more objective criteria, though WP:NAME, to use.</li>
<li>Akira Toriyama chose "Barduck" for the name, not either of these two options, so neither is more "correct" as far as the creator of the work is concerned. Most Toriyama-English names (such as Gokuh, etc.) aren't used in the US, but it at least doesn't provide any weight against this option, either.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Point of clarification: Toriyama never wrote the name out in English. The name was only ever written as バーダック. The only other reference we have is a short interview where he said the pun was on <i>gobô</i> (the Japanese word for <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock.html" title="Burdock">burdock</a>). "Barduck" is used on Japanese "Super Barcode Wars" cards. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 06:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> is the official policy on naming. Simply put, "Burdock" fails test 1.6: <i>Use common names of persons and things</i>.

And I'll quote again, from <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>: "When there is no long-established history of usage of the term, more consideration should be given to the correctness of translation, rather than frequency of usage." <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 03:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, it doesn't. <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> is great, but it's meant only as a general guideline, and other guidelines should be used when they are geared more towards a specific topic. As such, we should focus on established practices (if any at all). These would be <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime</a>. Both say we should use standard English spelling for loan words, and official romanji spellings for names. The character's name is a pun on a loan word, and I <i>believe</i> that the most common spelling for that plant is <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock.html" title="Burdock">burdock</a>, not "bardock". "Burdock" is also Funimation's offical romanization of the name, as seen on the Japanese subtitles on all current DVD releases. Beyond that, <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIgnore_all_rules_b268.html" title="WP:Ignore all rules">WP:Ignore all rules</a> says any guideline or policy can, an <i>should</i>, be ignored if such a rule prevents the article from becoming "better". --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 06:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's <b>your</b> opinion. The word choice "improv[e]" is <i>intentionally</i> ambiguous. It's meant to promote debate over what is an "improvement". You think that naming the page "Bardock" would be an improvement, I think "Burdock" would be an improvement. We should <i>debate</i> this.</dd>

<dd>Firstly, Funimation isn't really one for making a lot of sense, but they are good for one thing (if nothing else): brilliant Japanese subtitles. All dual language releases include a English subtitle track translated from the original script by Steven J. Simmons. These translations serve as Funimation's official romanji spellings for the series. The dub uses certain names, the subtitle track uses others. Is it that you doubt the subtitle track says "Burdock"? <a href="http://img74.imageshack.us/img74/8917/cap006hj9.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://img74.imageshack.us/img74/8917/cap006hj9.png" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/9941/cap005on2.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/9941/cap005on2.png" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>I know what you mean, I was the one that argued for "Kuririn" back in 2004 and have since had a change of heart after being on Wikipedia for a while. But, let's look at the guidelines you cited. In the "Article Name" section of <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime</a>, the recommendation is <i>Name your pages in English and place the native transliteration on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly recognized by readers than the English form. See: WP:NAME</i>. That's all I can find in there about naming and that says nothing about official romazations there. (And anyway, "Bardock" is also an official romazation, not a bastardization like "Hercule". Let's not touch that argument.) In <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP</a>, there's a section on "Romanisation", but it only stipulates the romanization scheme to use when writing Japanese words. BUT, it also recommends that you follow <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> which covers this case nicely: <i>If a native spelling uses different letters than the most common English spelling (eg, Wien vs. Vienna), only use the native spelling as an article title if it is more commonly used in English than the anglicized form.</i>. Again, the recommendation is the "common" name and not the "correct" one. Can you point out the specific guidelines that you are citing? <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 06:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The point here is to use English first but keeping romanizations of the original names above dub names.

<dd>And, again, I'm not trying to use guidelines to back up one position or the other. There are plenty of reasons to use "Bardock" and there are plenty of reasons to use "Burdock" - I just think that the most compelling of which is "Burdock" is the most correct romanization.</dd>

<b>So</b>, why should we choose one name over the other? We should choose a correct, common, official, English name. But there are some problems with that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The correct name is "Burdock". I can show you step-by-step why that's the correct name. But, that name is perhaps less common than others.</li>
<li>The most common name is probably "Bardock". The problem then is that it's not the most correct name</li>
<li>The 'official name' idea is best rule to go by usually - but in this case there are so many different English versions that it would be unfair to choose one over the other. Not counting the out-of-print adaptations, there are at least <b>five</b> different English versions. There's the Funimation uncut dub, the Blue Water dub, that other UK dub (where Piccolo is "Big Green"), a Mailasian English dub, and the Viz translation. But even then, we can find more rather recent English versions too: Viz has had two or three other versions of Dragon Ball released (with varying degrees of censorship), Funimation's got an official Japanese-translated subtitle track, the original censored Ocean dub, the old Pioneer movie releases, and then there's the video games... and I'm sure I'm forgetting some. Beyond that, there's problems with all the adaptations: The Funi dubs are rather inconsistent with script accuracy and names (both of characters and techniques), and have had censorship issues in the past (though that's not <i>much</i> of a problem now). Viz has had multiple releases of the manga, and has made rather odd translation choices, as well as using completely wrong names, and visual censorship. Though, the Japanese-translated subtitles on the Funi dual-audio releases are very consistent (as they should be, all being done by the same translator).</li>
<li>"Burdock" again would be the choice for using 'English names', I think, as it actually is an English word.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
So, I really don't know which name should be used. There's problems all around. Any thoughts? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 19:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, since we are mostly going by English manga names (<a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenshinhan.html" title="Tenshinhan">Tenshinhan</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuririn.html" title="Kuririn">Kuririn</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeza.html" title="Freeza">Freeza</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunch_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1b30.html" title="Lunch (Dragon Ball)">Lunch</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_%28Dragon_Ball%29_a0ff.html" title="Kiwi (Dragon Ball)">Kiwi</a>, etc.) I don't see why the article has to be titled <b>Bardock</b>. Remember that we're going by the names that the creator himself, <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akira_Toriyama_c562.html" title="Akira Toriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>, gave to these characters. So even if Toriyama didn't create Burdock directly (but did modify his appearance a bit and stretched his name meaning) he still named him <b>Burdock</b> in the manga, and <a href="../../../v/i/z/VIZ_Media_a7db.html" title="VIZ Media">VIZ</a> verifies this. Now I don't know katakana or hiragana and whatnot like you DesireCampbell, but now I really do understand one thing; and that is that Dragon Ball is all comprised of name puns. That is what I understand about this. About the manga names for <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegerot.html" title="Vegerot">Vegerot</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majin_Buu_56d7.html" title="Majin Buu">Madjinn Boo</a>, etc., that's a whole 'nother story which we should take care of later. --<a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPower_level_%28Dragon_Ball%29_1a1a.html" title="User:Power level (Dragon Ball)"><font face="orange"><font color="orange"><b>Power level</b></font> <font color="orange"><b>(Dragon Ball)</b></font></font></a> 03:01, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Be careful what you wish for. If you really want to follow the manga names, then you need to use "Hercule" for Mr. Satan. Or, at the very least, "Majin Boo" for Majin Buu. The thing about translating from Japanese is that Toriyama didn't write "Burdock" or anything else. He wrote in a Janguage that doesn't use Roman characters and whose transliteration into Roman characters can be done in many different ways-- either strictly phonetically (Bādakku -- pronounced about baa-dak-coo), as close-as-possible-while-still-sounding-English (Bardock), or scrambled a bit so the original pun is more clear (Burdock). Which is more valid the more-closely-phonetic or the more-closely-meaninged? The answer is that there is no straight-forward answer. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 05:57, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We shouldn't use the manga's translation just because it's the manga's translation. Viz did a great job translating everything else, it's just the names they seems to be bending over backwards to fuck up. Oh, and I want to make it very clear to <b>Power Level</b> and anyone else: I don't know Japanese. I know <i>of</i> it. I can pick out a few spoken words, and can plod my way through pronouncing some katakana - but I'd never want to give the impression that any of this information is coming directly from me. The whole 'explanation' of the name comes from me pestering people who <i>do</i> know Japanese; "what does this character mean?" "how is it pronounced?" "what would this mean?" etc. Anyway, names in Dragon Ball aren't easy things. Some names seem easily transliterated (like Kuririn) but we see odd spellings in the manga (like "Kullin"), other names (like Jheese) are simply <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engrish.html" title="Engrish">Engrish</a> and it's hard to determine what the English spelling should be.</dd>
<dd>I think the best thing to do is use the Funimation Japanese-track subtitles. They're translated by a highly trained, highly experienced, highly respected individuals (Steve Simmons for Z, GT, the Z movies and Z and GT TV specials; and Clyde Mandelin for DB and its movies) and are official romanizations (as the guidelines say to use). If any official romanization is contested, we can discuss it further (like we're doing here).</dd>
<dd>Specifically, I think that "Burdock" is the best, most correct, name - but understand that switching to the official romanization would probably serve the article better. I don't have the 'Father of Goku' DVD. Can someone here confirm what Daimao translates the character's name as? If it's "Bardock", then that coupled with the wider use of "Bardock" seals the deal (so to speak) for me. But, if its "Burdock" on the DVD then that coupled with my explanation of the name pun hardens my resolve for keeping "Burdock". --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 13:06, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I stated earlier, why keep <b>Bardock</b> if the manga had it spelled <b>Burdock</b>? Why keep <b>Tien Shinhan</b> or <b>Tienshinhan</b> if the manga has it as <b>Tenshinhan</b>, etc.?

<dd>Among English speakers, people are more familiar with the Funimation dub than anything else. The Manga is the only officially licenced merchandise that Funimation does not control.

<dd>So your argument is don't move this because the others need to be moved too? That doesn't make any sense at all. If all of the articles need to be moved then they should be moved. There is no guideline that says to use manga names, there is a guideline that says to use common English names. Funimation dub is more common that Viz manga translation. The reason the names are where they are is because of fanboys refusing to accept the Funimation dub, probably due to the over censorship. When the uncut version was made the names were not changed. Something you may wish to consider. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 20:36, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's clear a few things up.</p>
<ul>
<li>The guidelines state that we should be using official romanizations if at all possible. That would mean to use Kuririn instead of Krillin, Tenshinhan instead of Tien. Because there are many "official romanizations" discussion is sometimes needed to decide on the best corse of action. Usually we would choose the most common name, but such a guieline can be ignored if another name would make the article "better" (which is another point for discussion).</li>
<li>This is not the place for a discussion of canon - <b>but</b> suffice it to say that Viz is not canon. They distribute and translate the manga, nothing else. Their censored manga is <b>not</b> to be held as the pinnacle of English Dragon Ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still undecided on what the article name should be. There are good reasons to use either name, so I'm placing my complete trust in Daimao's translations.</p>

<dd>Wrong. The guidelines state we should be using the name by which best known in English. That is clearly Bardock. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 20:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Simply using the most common name is not the best policy. We don't name the Katakana article "Chicken scratch". Further, how is "Bardock" 'clearly' more common? Because it's used in the the English anime dub? 'Burdock' is used in the manga, and the Japanese audio track subtitles.

<dd>Thank you, Desire Campbell, for making all these people and their FUNimation worshipping turn right around and bite them in the ass. FUNimation calls him "Burdock"! Isn't that great all you people like Jaywhatever that say we should use FUNimation because it's the end-all-be-all of Dragon Ball names and is absolutely perfect in every way??? Yeah, I think it's great too.&#160;:D Looks like we're using Burdock, as we were always going to do in the first place.</dd>

<dd>My argument was not "use Funimation". It was "use the Funimation dub" because it is more widely known and used. I don't feel to strongly one way or the other, but I want you to understand my argument. I don't feel that Funimation is automatically right, but that's where common English use would lie, and as this is English Wikipedia we should use common English wherever appropriate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 19:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, we see your point. It's not that it's not a valid point, it's just not that standard practice for articles about anime and manga. Is Bardock more common than Burdock? Probably. Almost assuredly. But there are guidelines and standards in place for a reason; using official romanji names is a compromise between "hard core" fans and casual fans. One group would look for, and expect, the original names; the reasoning being, this is an article about a Japanese literary character and the original Japanese name would be the most accurate. While more casual fans might only know the "dub name". As a compromise, we tend to use the official romanizations of the character names. This keeps the names accurate (maybe not as accurate as straight romanji, but acceptable to hardcore fans) and recognizable to casual fans (perhaps not as recognizable as a dub name, but they'll be able to find it on their DVDs).</dd>
<dd>And I'll be the first to advocate <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIgnore_all_rules_b268.html" title="WP:Ignore all rules">WP:Ignore all rules</a> if doing so would make the article better.

<dd>Actually, it is standard practice. It is very standard practice. Dragon Ball is the odd man out in that regard. Every guideline points to <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>, which insists on common usage as the ultimate point at which an article should be named. Naming a character one letter different only causes confusion for readers and does nothing to improve the article. Bardock, as has been repeatedly shown, is the most widely recognized. It is what FUNimation uses in their offical dubs. Subtitles are not an issue, because this is the English Wikipedia and we go on the assumption people aren't watching subtitled Japanese episodes. Bardock is how his name is dubbed. The movie article uses that name. Policy dictates we use the most common name so long as it isn't horribly inaccurate. One letter is and never will be horribly inaccurate. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 21:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>WP:NAME also says that "When there is no long-established history of usage of the term, more consideration should be given to the correctness of translation, rather than frequency of usage."

<p>Hell y'all, saw this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the Dragon Ball series, nearly all Saiyans are named using English-language vegetable puns. Burdock's name (Bādakku) is a pun on burdock, a herb. In English, the pun is either rendered directly (as 'Burdock') or <b>retaining the initial 'bā' sound</b> (as 'Bardock').</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And wanted to know if there's a better way to word this. I know what [whoever wrote this part] means by "retaining the initial <i>ba-</i> sound", but it kind of makes it sound like 'Bur' is an inaccurate romanization. To recap: the word "burdock" is written as バードック (<i>ba-dokku</i>) in katakana, but the character's name is written as バーダック (<i>ba-dakku</i>). The <i>ba-</i> sound comes from "bur", so romanizing バー (<i>ba-</i>) to "bur" is actually <i>more</i> correct that "bar" in this case, even though it would probably normally be romanized as "bar".</p>
<p>But I'm stumped as to what would convey the same message more clearly. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 13:03, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You state above, and I confirmed based on my own not-opened-in-three-years Japanese books, that it would be pronounced "<i>baa dah coo</i>". I was trying to get that across without being too verbose about it. I think the trick is that we have an English word, transliterated into Japanese, and then back into English. I wanted to express how it sounds in Japanese, without making a POV judgment about which name is right. (But acking that there are variants.) <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 17:03, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see, but the wording seems to imply that "Burdock" is not as 'correct' as "Bardock". I know that's not what you mean - it's just how it sounds.--<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 01:04, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, two things. Burdock as referred to here is not a vegetable. The plant is sometimes called an herb (it's a thistle), but this is a pun on the Japanese food (gobo), which is the root of the plant. It should be noted as a vegetable. Second, the loss of the "r" sound within words is common in transliterated Japanese. For example, "center" becomes "centaa", just as in many Commonwealth accents. You could perhaps note it as, "In English, the pun is either rendered directly as 'Burdock', or transliterated as 'Bardock' to reflect the Japanese pronunciation." <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 10:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could someone more knowledgeable about Japanese than I answer one quick question for me; are we ABSOLUTELY sure that Bardock/Burdock's name is meant to be the LITERAL English word for the vegetable/herb/plant thingie or a PUN for the word? I ask this because such a scenario was the make or break deal for naming Freeza as such and not "Freezer". In other words; it was agreed that "Furiza" was intended to be a pun on the english word for Freezer and not the actual English word itself. Hence the article being named "Freeza". Just as likewise it was very recently agreed that "Bebi" was intended as the actual English word "Baby", and not a pun on the word, hence the article move to Baby.</p>
<p>I ask this question because I read through most of the discussion and I didn't see this point brought up at all like I did with Bebi. And if it was, then I missed it and you have my apologies for wasting space here.</p>
<p>Thus if the Japanese kana translates as the straight up romanji for the English word Burdock, then fine. But if not, then the name ought to be a little different from the real word (hence Bardock) to reflect that it's a pun on the word and not the actual word itself, as that very distinction was the deciding factor in the above two examples. These are IMO the trickiest kinds of names to translate in Dragon Ball, and ought to be handled with care for such details. <a href="../../../f/u/a/User%7EFuad_Ramses_e7b3.html" title="User:Fuad Ramses">Fuad Ramses</a> 11:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Here's the thing: the character's name <i>is</i> a pun on the English word "burdock", but there's no good way to show that pun in English.</p>
<pre>
   "Burdock" -- which would be pronounced bur dock
   バードック -- baa do ku
   バー<b>ダ</b>ック -- baa <b>dah</b> ku
   (Bur)ダ(ck) -- bur dah k
   Burdock 
</pre>
<p>"Burdock" written in <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> would normally be バードック (I say "normally", as such an act isn't an exact science, but バードック would be by far the most used kana), but the kana used is バー<b>ダ</b>ック, which would be a pun on the word, not the exact word.</p>
<p>That said, the word change is not something that can easily be shown. When an English word is transliterated into katakana, the pronounciation distrts slightly. Usualy this is simply over-enunciation. The change is from 'do' (like "doe, a dear, a female dear") to 'da' (with a long 'a' sound, so more like "dah", not like "dad"). That change makes the pronounciation of the name <i>more</i> like the English pronounciation of "burdock" than the original kana. The original word is pronounced 'burdock', the direct kana is pronounced 'baa-doe-coo', and the pun is 'baa-dah-coo'.</p>
<p>So, to show the punnery we would change the English spelling from 'Burdock' in a way that showed the change in the kana. That change would be from 'do' to 'dah', but that makes the word sound exactly the same to English speakers. The problem is that the pun is only really visible in the kana.</p>
<p>This isn't the only name in DragonBall like this either. Both Videl and Vegeta (I believe, I'll have to check soon) have changes in the kana that can't be shown in English because we <i>already</i> pronounce the word that way.</p>
<p>If we used the name "Bardock", that would indeed mean we use a name that is <i>like</i> the pun word, but slightly different. <i>But</i> we would be using a name that does not accurately reflect the pun used in the original script. Secondly, we would be going against <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime</a> Project guidelines (which are pretty well thought out). Trying to decipher the best representation of the character names is a tough job, and might be considered "original research". That's why I think following the Anime Project's guidelines is a great idea. The Anime Project states we should use whatever the official romanji is. Which would mean using the Funimation Japanese-language subtitles as translated by Steven J Simmonds (DBZ and GT) and Cylde Mandelin (DB). These men are not only professionals but are <i>grealy</i> respected by the fan community.</p>
<p>DragonBall names <i>are</i> tricky. Damn tricky. That's why there should be a section about the name pun (like the one on the Burdock page) on every DB character page. Which is another one of the things the <a href="../../../d/b/z/WP%7EDBZ_d2f3.html" title="WP:DBZ">WP:DBZ</a> Project is trying to do. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 22:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you may be incorrectly interpreting the katakana transliteration. バーダック is a better direct representation of the English pronunciation than バードック (at least in the case of American English, which is what is taught in schools in Japan). <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent reading as always Desire. Very informative and fascinating. So essentially what you're saying is that even though the name IS meant to be a pun, due to the actual Japanese pronunciation of the word being more dissimilar to the English word and the supposed "pun" being closer to it, we thus have to turn to the original word for lack of a better phonetic alternative, as anything else would deviate too much from the actual kana that Toriyama-san went with. It's certainly a legitimate and well rationalized argument, not to mention a bizarre coincidence. But personally I would have stuck with Bardock. Even though it's technically incorrect from a phonetic standpoint as you've pointed out, I'd have gone with it simply to get across the IDEA that it's a pun for "Burdock", and not Burdock itself. It's more consistent and in keeping with the rest of the Saiya-jin names, which are all puns on words for veggies (both English and Japanese, though mostly English). Burdock kinda breaks the "pattern" so to speak.</p>
<p>It's one of those weird (yet interesting) linguistic quandaries, where the translator is forced to put some personal interpretation into translating the word, and make a judgment call on what gets the general idea across the best, and often times in such scenarios there's no right or wrong answer from a technical standpoint. But you'll certainly get no argument from me about using Burdock, as it is (as you've clearly demonstrated) still a technically correct tanslation/interpretation. And also the decision behind going with it comes from far better intentions (proper Japanese to English romanization and getting Toriyama's ideas across) than the "official" English alternatives (merchandising, offending overzealous parents, dumbing down for what's perceived as a child's level, random whim etc.). Plus who am I to argue with someone like Steve "Daimaō" Simmons? Though granted I'll readily take him on about Kakarot vs. Kakarotto, but that's a whole other can 'o worms. <a href="../../../f/u/a/User%7EFuad_Ramses_e7b3.html" title="User:Fuad Ramses">Fuad Ramses</a> 08:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah Faud Ramses, I had the same problem at first. I watched the TV special and it clearly sounds like an "a" rather than a "u." But I think a better example, or at least more similar example than Videl would be Baata. Pun- Butter. FUNi name Burter, Viz name Butta. Correct me if I'm wrong, but can't the "aa" be equivolent to our "ar," "ur," and "er?" It can lead to some confusion from time to time, so in this case it does make sense to go as close to the pun as possible. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 09:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is Bardock not Burdock. I saw the movie and he was called Bardock. It was even spelled Bardock. It should be changed from Burdock to Bardock. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.243.223.146_ba36.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.243.223.146">70.243.223.146</a> (talk) 14:45, 22 February 2007</small></p>
<p>No, the official translation of the Japanese script is "Burdock". We checked. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 19:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
