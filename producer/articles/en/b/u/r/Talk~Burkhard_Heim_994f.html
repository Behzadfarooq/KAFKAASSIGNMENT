<p>Please feel free to add to this list and modify it as appropriate. Endeavour to maintain neutrality and generality in the terms, as its purpose is to provide a summary for the archived talk page. Hence, precision is not necessarily a primary concern here; the list should not be considered comprehensive as a large number of topics were covered.</p>
<p>The topics discussed included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper licensing of Heim's image in the article</li>
<li>Validity of an article on Heim
<dl>
<dd>This included discussions regarding:
<ol>
<li>Notability of Heim and his work</li>
<li>Whether the article qualifies as containing original research</li>
<li>The encyclopedic value of an article on Heim</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How to achieve a neutral and balanced point of view
<dl>
<dd>This included discussions regarding:
<ol>
<li>The perceived bias in the initial article</li>
<li>Requests for article cleanup</li>
<li>Notability of Heim's work</li>
<li>How to classify or label Heim</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Value of Heim's works
<dl>

<li>Heim's work in relation to the context of modern theoretical physics</li>
<li>Perceived inconsistencies and contradictions to current theories and experiments
<ol>
<li>The neutral electron</li>
<li>The 6, 8, dimensional spaces</li>

</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The consensus reached on multiple issues on the archived talk page in no particular order is that</p>
<ol>
<li>The articles on Heim should make explicit and clear that Heim's work needs to undergo more peer reviewing (several peer reviewed papers have now been published - including a prize-winning one on aerospace applications) and rigorous analysis before it can be taken more seriously in the scientific community</li>
<li>Split the article into <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_Theory_a8d7.html" title="Heim Theory">Heim Theory</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkhard_Heim_0098.html" title="Burkhard Heim">Burkhard Heim</a>, where the former will focus on his theories, while the latter will be primarily biographical.
<ul>
<li>The biographical article should have thorough references to his academic and personal history;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoidance of derogatory terminology is prefered especially in contexts where other alternatives are available to convey the same idea.</li>
<li>Heim's physical condition influenced his decisions regarding his publications, either by choice, necessity, or both - this should also be made explicit and clear.</li>
<li>There is some reservation and skepticism towards Heim's work which is difficult to mitigate</li>
</ol>
<p>Unresolved issues include</p>
<ol>
<li>The issue about "E" and whether it renders a paper related to Heim's work inconsistent or not. Consensus was to move on to another topic. Was recently discussed again on April 19, 2005.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>(Also, many issues above under "Perceived inconsistencies and contradictions..." should probably be considered unresolved.)</li>

<p>I decided to be "WikiBold" and archived the old talk page; I added the header at the top which I hope is satisfactory. It might be better to move the header into the talk page afterwards. I also added a "reorganizing" tag for the old talk page. I'm hoping to preserve all of the original talk material and also create a new summarized version of the old talk page. It will be clearly marked as a "refactored" version.

<p>A recent post was made in the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Talk%7EBurkhard_Heim_Archive1_7ac3.html#Going_ahead" title="Talk:Burkhard Heim/Archive1">old talk page</a> about a recent paper published in the <a href="../../../a/i/a/AIAA_a292.html" title="AIAA">AIAA</a>.</p>
<p>As new papers were mentioned here before, let me announce a forthcoming article in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>, Jan 7th 2006 issue, on Heim theory and propulsion - largely based on above AIAA prize-winning paper. If it does not appear, then I will be rather surprised - that should only happen if some urgent discovery pushes the article back to a later issue. --<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 15:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC) Hee hee hee! That new scientist article has attracted lots of attention - largely positive. Heim's theory is widely seen as a marvellous development. So, all the negative nay sayers here who even sought the erradication of the page, are being shown the error of their ways. Web searches for Burkhard Heim now get many more hits than ever before . And with more scientific papers on the basics theory in the offing, and a mass formula applet being suggested, it seems that Heim is indeed to take the world by storm, as was once facetiously suggested here.--<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 18:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll certainly grant you that the recent publicity for Heim makes articles on him and his ideas worth having on Wikipedia. But I don't for a moment concede that Heim's theory is correct or even well-defined, and I think that both articles here should make that clear. My own hope regarding this new surge in publicity is that a few noted theoretical physicists will look at the theory and make clear statements about it. I've already seen <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/01/05/spacedrive/#comment-8332" class="external text" title="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/01/05/spacedrive/#comment-8332" rel="nofollow">one</a>, by Sean Carrol at the University of Chicago:
<dl>
<dd>"Just so nobody gets too excited â this paper is complete nonsense, not worth spending a minuteâs time on. If I find the energy I might post on it, but this is no better than the other hundred crackpot preprints I get in the mail every year."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As I've said before, I really don't understand why aerospace engineers would feel themselves competent to judge a highly technical paper in particle physics and quantum gravity (or why their judgement of it carries particular weight with anyone else). I certainly wouldn't trust myself to certify the reliability of an airplane design, particularly not one claiming to be based on a revolutionary (and untested) new concept in the industry!--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteuard_a577.html" title="User:Steuard">Steuard</a> 20:28, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think this perhaps highlights the differences in the ways engineers and physicists think about a problem. The AIAA, in awarding the paper about Heim's work, is awarding the logic of the methodology for use of the "drive system", not reviewing the physics underlying such a drive. I'd prefer to read an abstract or the entire paper before I make that statement with any certainty, but that's my best understanding based upon discussions with several of my professors in the aerospace engineering department at my university. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 21:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. I've got to admit that I don't understand that approach at all. If I submitted a paper to the AIAA explaining in detail how to build a Star Trek style transporter with the help of the "Pyramid Jesus Unified Field Equation", would I win the next prize? (I've actually seen a booklet that used that term, incidentally.) Perhaps some engineers are so accustomed to simply applying and refining the principles supplied to them by physicists that they've fallen out of the habit of even wondering whether their underlying assumptions are correct.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteuard_a577.html" title="User:Steuard">Steuard</a> 04:09, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before dismissing Heimâs initial and extended theories, one should <b>note that the very significant distinction</b> between him and other crackpots was the amount of respect he had commanded from such great theoretical physicists as <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pascual_Jordan_4f4f.html" title="Pascual Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker_e963.html" title="Carl Friedrich von WeizsÃ¤cker">Carl Friedrich von WeizsÃ¤cker</a> (von Ludwiger, 2001).

<p>Hi. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> has asked me to translate a text in French which could contain information on Heim that could be useful in this article. I see that there are issues of neutrality going on, not to mention that, simply adding to the article the direct translation of a text found at <a href="http://quanthomme.free.fr/energielibre/chercheurs/CHERCHEURS2.htm" class="external text" title="http://quanthomme.free.fr/energielibre/chercheurs/CHERCHEURS2.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a> may constitute a copyright violation. In light of all of that, I'm posting here my translation of the text, so that the people who are more involved with the article can decide how to best use it. For the original, please visit the indicated website.</p>
<p>Redux's translation:</p>
<p>"Northeim, Hannover.</p>
<p>A German physiciSTS of international fame, his works were translated by physiciSTS with the Sandia Lab, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p>He worked under difficult conditions. Both his hands were amputated following a lab accident during World War II. He also suffered from advanced deafness as well as being almost completely blind. He had to undergo more than 50 surgeries in order to recover some part of his basic abilities. He taught and work as a deaf, blind man. Through the years, with the help of his wife, who served as his secretary, and equipped with a special gadget, he had the texts read to him and memorized them. He enjoyed a prodigious memory and became a âhuman computerâ, recording in his brain formulas and knowledge, categorizing thousands of pieces of information while being capable of imagining and creating.</p>
<p>He believed that it was possible to both increase or annul gravity. On January 7, 1969, at the Institute for the study of force fields of Nordheim, near Goettingue, in the region of Basse Saxe, he stunned his colleagues by demonstrating in practice that it was possible to create artificially a gravitation field, transforming light into magnetism.</p>
<p>Ten years earlier, he had already demonstrated, in theory, the possibility of transforming an electric field into a gravitation field and vice-versa. At the time his theory of the uniformity of the quanta of the force fields of gravitation and matter, which, in addition to describing physics and the biosphere, also disserted on psychology and the spiritual domain, was a sensation in the scientific world and made way for numerous publications that spanned from serious analyses to the phantoms of science fiction. His theory is one-of-a-kind in modern physics because it allows, among other things, to calculate exactly the masses of all particles as well as the most important constants. His theory of fields deducts the existence of a hyperspace, a sixth dimension and has relevant consequences to cosmology, both technologically and metaphysically. The Second Congress on his theory was held in 1998. Heim imagined devices in which photons lost their luminosity, that is to say, their energy. They become invisible as the luminescent energy is transformed into gravitational energy which exercises magnetic force. The savant inspired himself in air chambers to build an extremely sensitive detector that allows to register even the weakest pulses of gravitation. This invention can be considered as the future corner stone of space propulsion and evokes an analogy between terrestrial science and extraterrestrial technology. According to Burkhard Heim, discovery through cognition is common to all the sentient systems in the Universe, for they possess a common source. So, for religious reasons, he discontinued voluntarily his studies on cosmogenesis and evolutional phenomena."</p>

There are many technical terms in the text. I did my best to word it as accurately as possible, but some review may be necessary as far as the technical stuff is concerned. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:07, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a>, your translation will help us assess what material can be added to the article.

<p>This translation is quite interesting, as it mentions some references which I don't think have been discussed previously on this page. For example, what might "On January 7, 1969, at the Institute for the study of force fields of Nordheim..." refer to? <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 01:26, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are quite welcome. About the Institute, they didn't give the name of the place, but rather discribed its scope and where it is located. It could be that it <b>is</b> the "Institute for the study of force fields of Nordheim", maybe that's the actual name of the place. Perhaps someone knows about that... I didn't, so I stuck to what the text read. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:48, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, after my latest biographical additons to yhe article, it should be clear that the "Institute for the study of force fields" is the "Institut fuer Kraftfeldphysik e.V.", from which a colleague embezzled funds, increasing Heim's distrust and secrecy. Nordheim was where Heim lived with his wife, so he must have registered the firm with HQ at his house. However, looking again at the 'Nachruf', there's a photo of Heim in front of his 'Kontrabator', which is presumably in the lab in his home in Nordheim. This is from 'Bunte' in 1957.</dd>

<dd>Heh, interesting metaphors! Well, just go right ahead and as always, feel free to do so. I'd much rather see more active participation on these pages anyway. If you move large chunks of text around, I'd probably just edit the text in their new locations so they fit in nicely with the rest of the context in which it's placed. I'm comfortable with this approach for articles like this, as I think its a pretty productive and positive type of editing. Just remember to leave edit summaries and notes on talk pages!&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 18:33, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hdeasy, your math is bogus. If the experimental value has 7 or more valid decimal places and the theoretical value differ in in the first seven places, either the the theoretical value has less than 7 valid decimal places or is in disagreement with the experimental value. In neither case it is correct to say, that it has 7 places of accuracy. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 10:56, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, it's a Wiki - anything can be changed so no need for any potential apologies&#160;:-) I was suggesting that if you think the quoted number is only accurate to say, only one or two digits, then you could change the number so that it reflects this. I'm not sure how this should best be done. I don't mind how the numbers are presented so much myself, but it might be worth mentioning that other sites consider the results more accurate than that those presented here. Right now, I've sort of drifted off to collecting some other relevant papers. I might add some of these as references to the article later. The response from the German archives are rather slow. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 16:27, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Somewhat agree. The current formulation as a result of my edits is self-contradictory. But to judge between "agreement withing error bars of the theoretical calculation" and "according to the newest experimental results, in disagreement by X stddevs", we need to have more information on the theoretical error bars. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 17:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just saw all this. Is this not against the Wikipedia policy against insulting behaviour to say my math is 'bogus'?: It was not I who put in the original figure of 7. I had intended altering to a more realistic figure. What the original user of this figure probably meant was 7 significant figures. Leaving this unjustified insult aside, I must say it shows poverty of spirit on your part, Pjacobi, to essentialy ignore the AIAA prize - as someone who lives in north Germany you should be impressed by Uni Braunschweig's praise of Hauser.

<dl>
<dd>Oh dear. Why don't we try this?
<ol>
<li>Get rid of the "7 decimal places" claim, but print the numbers <i>verbatim</i>.</li>
<li>Let's take a page, say <a href="http://www.heim-theory.com/downloads/G_Selected_Results.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heim-theory.com/downloads/G_Selected_Results.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and put the results online in a table as they are depicted in the document <i>verbatim</i></li>
<li>Then, we mention something like "the results in this table are from" this source. We avoid attempting to interpret the numbers, and simply state something like, "in 19XX calculations were done with Heim theory and we got this". Period.</li>
<li>We won't mention anything about X number of decimal places of accuracy. The fact is, this is the only source I know of which has these numbers calculated and none of us are in any better position to say whether the published numbers are "good" or "bad". So, as a neutral encyclopedic article, we won't comment on how these numbers look. We'll just say, "X said it was this number".</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Does this sound reasonable to everyone? I'm well aware of the shortcomings of the published results, but the reality is, any interpretation we give of the numbers will necessarily be an interpretation, and at the moment, it's probably best to avoid that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well on a side note, I disagree that statement of facts are exempt from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. I think people can choose to refrain from using the word "bogus", and instead chose an alternative which is less of an intensifier. Let's just move on from that and focus on how to add these numbers to the article in a balanced way, good? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 12:35, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is there nothing about these theories in Stephen Hawkings books&#160;? After all, that's what he's working on.. unified theory</p>

<dd>Burkhard Heim's work is not an accepted part of mainstream physics.

<dd>Illobrand Von Ludwiger told me that Hawking had been approached and asked to look through Heim's work, but he had refused as the 3 volumes are in German, which he does not understand sufficiently well. That's where Hauser and DrÃ¶scher are improving on the situation - they are prepared to publish in English. Already they've 'taken the world by storm' with their AIAA papers and the New Scientist publicity. Next year will see peer reviewed papers with more technical backround that given in the aerospace presentations. And don't poo-poo that please - the enemies of Heim-theory must eat humble pie for a while after their humiliating defeat in the attempts to delete the theory page&#160;:-) . --<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 16:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
