<p>As this food is of Turkish provenance, and it appears to be the same as Turkish börek, I suggest it be merged with that page under the title "Börek" or "Borek". I am not trying to promote Turkish naming over others, but it seems appropriate here. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinawhitecotton_30ce.html" title="User:Chinawhitecotton">Chinawhitecotton</a> 10:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmmmmmmm... now, you are right. "Börek" and "Burek" (<b>caution</b>: common spelling error! It is not B<b>o</b>rek but B<b>u</b>rek) are closely related and are probably the same thing (never been to Turkey, so I don't know). But, we could have a problem since for people from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Former_Yugoslavia_190f.html" title="Former Yugoslavia">former Yugoslavia</a> burek is pretty important cultural icon, and merging it with börek could produce complaints...</dd>
<dd>This is what we can do. We can merge it, but preserve to separate sections. One section named Börek, and one section named Burek. Common properties of burek and börek can be merged, but I insist on having a "Burek" section because, burek in ex-Yu and börek in Turkey are not in relationship in which pizza in USA and pizza in Italy are. Burek is of Turkish origin, but it has a life of it's own in western Balkans, so it shouldn't just be drowned into Börek article.</dd>
<dd>Lets wait for a few days and see if anybody else discusses here, and if not, the merge can be executed (although I feel like selling out my own children by allowing the article about burek to reside under name of Börek&#160;:-| Yes, I'm terribly emotionally bound to burek, I eat it every time I get drunk&#160;;-) ). --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 13:08, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nicola, what do they call this food in Persian? And, out of curiosity, how do you know it is Persian? What if we found that they ate it on the steps of Central Asia, then we would have to call it something else...--<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinawhitecotton_30ce.html" title="User:Chinawhitecotton">Chinawhitecotton</a> 10:30, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't speak for him, but there's probably something in his words; <a href="../../../b/i/e/Bierock.html" title="Bierock">Bierock</a> and Russian <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirogi.html" title="Pirogi">Pirogi</a> appear to be cognates. So, it's possible that something similar was eaten in PIE (proto-indo-european, not pie&#160;:-) ) days. I'd suggest something like "Origin of the food is usually attributed to the Turkish cuisine, but blah blah suggests that the word is even older." in the intro. This does seem to be kind of against <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, but let's try to dig something out.

<dd>I searched the word in a dictionary of Turcisms, and it was written that it has Persian origin (meaning simply "pie" IIRC).</dd>
<dd>I didn't want to say that we should call it differently depending on its origin, just noted that correct origin should be in the article. And, we won't discover that they ate it on the steppes of central Asia. Nomadic cultures usually don't carry around large quantities of wheat, milling stones so that they could mill it, large tables so that they could make phyllo, and ovens so that they could bake it (this is a bit of exagerration, but you got my point).

<dd>Two, it seems to me from some searches that börek means simply "pie", or at least "pie made of fillo" in Turkish, is that correct? <a href="http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/TravelDetails/Food/borek.html" class="external text" title="http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/TravelDetails/Food/borek.html" rel="nofollow">These things</a> aren't bureks.

<dd>Based on my experience (about 1.5 years in Turkey) börek really is the same as what is in the photo on the burek page. I don't know about that link, but it might have been some type of home made or specialty borek - does not normally look like that, at least at the typical borek restaurant in Istanbul. I think "pie with phyllo" is just a attempt at translation. Pie in Turkish is <i>tart</i>, which , like <i>kek</i> (cake) is probably of European origin. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinawhitecotton_30ce.html" title="User:Chinawhitecotton">Chinawhitecotton</a> 18:26, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally a Turk here as well. I guess there aren't many in wikipedia *sigh*. I didn't know borek was that popular is ex-Yugoslavian countries too. It is very very popular in Turkey I can say. There are many types of it, but basically it is always something filled into laters of pastry. It is so popular every house always has the pstry in the fridge ready for any occasion&#160;:) And it is totally different than pie - we got pies too but they are pies, very different. As for the spelling this is how it is spelled and pronounced like now by almost all people - still I'm sure in some corners of the country there would be slightly different pronunciations. Hope this answers some of your questions here - so it's not like the US pizza and the Italian pizza. For more info just do a Google image search for borek. Cheers... 30 Jan 2006</dd>

<p>The description of burek is essentially the same as Bulgarian 'banitsa'. Since I have been living in Bulgaria, banitsa is very popular - I have eaten it made with sirene (feta cheeses), and with spinach added, or with nettles added - all called banitsa.

<p>It'sa common misconception that burek originates from turkey or Bosnia. The turks wrote all financial matter in "tefter" those were used as a log book for a town. One of those tefters clearly states that burek was patented in the city of Nis in 1498. There was a celebration in Nis a couple of years ago and it was named:"5 centuries of burek".

<dd>If you want you can come to Nis. I'll take you to every burekdzinica in town and there are more than 100 burekdznicas here. I'm not authorised to take any papers out of the historical archive of Nis, or to make any copies of those papers. But here goes the rough story:</dd>
<dd>In 1498 a renowned baker from the city of Istanbul came to Nis and opened a bakery. That baker's name was Mehmed Ogluh and in that same year he and a couple of his aprentices made the first burek. In 1998 a manifestation called "Five centuries of Burek(Pet veka bureka)" was held in Nis. And since than yearly manifestations are held on the bank of the river Nisava, the name of that manifestation is"The days of burek(Dani Bureka)". The original turkish burek is very different from the one we now eat in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia... So we cant really claim that the Burek was invented in Istanbul.</dd>

<p>Would you guys say that rekbu is a traditional breakfast? Many (ok, two) people in US asked me what's traditional breakfast in Serbia, and I only came up with burek. Is that true or is it just a reason for my poor health? --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 07:27, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rekbu is burek in slang, like vutra 'trava'&lt; (daj) travu, Dzoni&lt; NIdzo (vocative of Nidza), tebra&lt; brate ans so on</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_cuisine.html" title="Serbian cuisine">Serbian cuisine</a>, Serbs traditionally did not have breakfast. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Filo is the Greek name for a dough of many paper-thin layers separated by films of butter...Although known to Europeans and North Americans by a Greek name, the dough is clearly of Turkish origin. The medieval nomad Turks had an obsessive interest in making layered bread, possibly in emulation of the thick oven breads of city people. As early as the 11th century, a dictionary of Turkish dialects (Diwan Lughat al-Turk) recorded pleated/folded bread as one meaning of the word yuvgha, which is related to the word (yufka) which means a single sheet of file in modern Turkish. This love of layering continues among the Turks of Central Asia...The idea of making the sheets paper thins is a later development.</p>
<p>---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 299)</p>
<p>This is the pastry Borek is made from.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Russians and Poles ("pieragi" in Polish) borrowed the piroshki from the Kazan Turks. The origin of the word piroshki is borek. The Turks of Anatolia and Rumeli have hundreds of variations of this savory pastry. Depending on the dialect the word is pronounced borek, burek, bura, etc. For example my grandmother loved making "su burasi" for us. The root for borek is "bur-" (twist).</b></p>
<p>The etymology of the word is Turkic, bur and ek are Turkic root words, bur = twist, ek = to add, every time the pastry is twisted, more is added layer on layer.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of variations of this dish across Central Asia to Turkey, its a common dish to Turkic communities.</p>

<p>I am sorry if you guys already discussed this before (I can't be bothered to read the entire page, but skimming revealed no discussion), but should Albanian byrek be included in this page? Especially the link to the recipe.</p>
<p>The reason I ask about this is that it seems to me byrek is just a pie, or at least it's a likely possibility; there is a clear difference between regular pies and burek. E.g. "sirnica" is not a burek, nor is "pita s mesom" a burek, since both are made with philo dough.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sve su pite pitice, samo je burek pitac.</i> (All pies are just pies, but burek is the pie)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, is it the same thing? Of course, Albanian bakers traditionally make the best burek that I've ever tried, but our semantics might be screwed up&#160;:) --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 08:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I follow you -- <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byrek.html" title="Byrek">Byrek</a> redirects to here. As far as I know, in most of the world except for Bosnia, b*rek denotes any type of phylo pie; in Bosnia, it is reserved only for meat variant. We opted for the "ubiquitous" nomenclature in the article, with note on usage in Bosnia. Not sure why you refer to Albanian bakers (I presume the ones you met used the same nomenclature as in Bosnia), but maybe it's because they were from Bosnia? As for Byrek as made in Albania (and perhaps Kosovo), it should be described, but we need an Albanian editor for that. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 09:30, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, let me try again. Not all pies are burek&#160;:) E.g. gibanica is made with phylo dough, but it's unanimous that it's not a burek. So, I'm saying that perhaps Albanians use word "byrek" for any kind of pie, including things that are not burek. E.g. the article links to: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Albanian_vegetable_pie" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Albanian_vegetable_pie" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, which doesn't seem to be a recipe for burek at all. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 23:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Unanimity is in the eye of beholder&#160;:-). While you and I will certainly agree that gibanica is not a burek, a Turk or Albanian will likely say "what a nice b*rek it was"&#160;:-). The point is really moot. There are also articles <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banitsa.html" title="Banitsa">Banitsa</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibanica.html" title="Gibanica">Gibanica</a>, and <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyropita.html" title="Tyropita">Tyropita</a>, which describe similar meals accross Balkans.

<p>Seems like this article got a rewrite by <a href="../../../l/u/z/User%7ELuzzifer_dcae.html" title="User:Luzzifer">User:Luzzifer</a>. Which is fine.

I tried to fix the article, but my English is not so great after all, and I'm doing this in quite a hurry, so someone please go and see if I missed something. The article still needs a lot of copyediting, but I've got to run now...</p>
<p>And, regarding the Niš legend. Is there any way to obtain the article which is used to support the idea that burek was invented in Niš? I mean, I recieved that info in a form of legend, not fact... --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 17:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Burek is not invented in Nis. It's a Turkish dish. One of it's modalities was made in Nis in 1498. Nis was importent city during the Otomman empire. However, the recipie was adjusted, developed, and after all preserved in Nis. One of main caracteristics of trditional burek is pork fat (which is today supstituted by vegitable fat, oil) and it was certanly not used by Turks, as theye are Muslims. Later burek was spread by Serbian, Macedonian and Albanian bakers that all came from theritory which was part of Serbia till 1916, and Nis was administrativ center.</p>

<p>I really think that we should leave Skaljic's etymology out. Persian word is borrowed from Turkish not viceversa. Skaljic's etymologies are really often wrong, just cf. the Etimoloski recnik srpskoga jezika. He is not an exepert on Turkish etymology, he is expert in Serbocroatian etzymology. Etymologies that he made on his own are often really paraetimologies.</p>
<p><br />
I also think that it's completly unneccesary to quot some article, when all relevant sources are listed in Tietze.</p>

<dd>Skaljic is presenting a theory that the word may be from Perisan. The article says "may be", not "is". I think it is a valuable piece of information, if we keep in mind the "may be" part. I don't see why removing it if it is not balantly wrong (you haven't submitted any sources which says "there's no way burek comes from persian"). If you still request that valid source be removed, I will put the thing on vote. So, what is it going to be? --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 08:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does it matter? Tietze claims that Burek entered Persian from Turkish while Skaljic claims otherwise.

<dd>Yes, it does matter. If he doesn't have the source, we will just return the Skaljic reference. If he has the soruce, we add that "Burek comes from Turkish or possibly from Persian, but the former is disputed", and reference both claims&#160;:-) I trying not to enter an edit war over a piece of burek, that would be most hilarious reason to engage in edit warring&#160;;-) But, sooner or later, we will return that information back since it is legitimatly sourced. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 09:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the problem is that there is no definitive definition of burek. In Greece alone, boureki can refer <i>both</i> to the kind made with filo and the kind made with pastry dough. The North African version uses a different procedure for the pastry, true, but like the other versions, keeps the Ottoman name (short vowels in North African Arabic are often dropped). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
