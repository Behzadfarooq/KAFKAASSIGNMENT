<p>Thank you for your efforts and reply. No problem with your formatting advise, etc., and copyright questions, I admit I had uploaded one item discovered by THUE as a breach, this was a legitimate error and was immediately rectified. (please delete it). I appreciate such astute observations and critisism, which have compelled me to read several Wikipedia help pages, still trying to get a feel for it. Must be a nightmare tring to police such a bold project. Keep in touch.</p>

<p>If you take a closer look at it, I did not revert your changes. I altered things again to a third format which is a compromise between the abbreviation NAS and the expanded Naval Air Station. It may sound picky but the correct way of naming a naval air station is to put the naval air station part before its name. It's the same with RAF bases which are always RAF <i>Base</i> never <i>Base</i> RAF. By way of contrast, if dealing with a USAF AFB the correct way is to put AFB after the name. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 07:59, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for the delay in replying to your question. One thing that I do as well as spot checking a user's edits is to click "what links here" on their user page. This will give you a list of pages where they have signed their name. As sysops have the tasks of deleting pages, and dealing with vandals, I often expect to see that they have contributed to VfD or <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">vandalism in progress</a>. If you follow those pages, you may well have seen their name in those places already, but if not, the fact those pages are on the "what links here" list can be a good sign that the user is interested in the areas that sysops have most of their abilities. I also check some of the talk pages linked to from the list to see if they have been involved in any conflicts, and if so, how they have dealt with that. The sorts of questions a user is asking or answering on the village pump, or on Wikipedia talk pages can also give you a good idea of how well they understand various aspects of Wikipedia. Again, this is easier to find from "what links here" rather than going through their contributions list. I tend to think that the way a user acts on talk pages may well be a better sign of how they will handle adminship abilities than simply basing it on what sorts of edits they make to articles. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 04:13, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion re: category naming, but honestly, I guess I didn't know where to look to find evidence of these styles, because category-wise, the U.S. State categories (and I have categorized <i>way</i> more than just a bunch of NYC articles) were a blank slate&amp;mdashthere was nothing there, no guiding structure. I'm indifferent as to naming convention preference (though I do appreciate consistency), but I think the organization I have been setting up within the state and city categories is a very good one. Is there a way to do top-down reorganizing of a category, to change the name and consequently change the category name tag within each article that linked to it? Maybe a bot is the only way...know anyone who can do that one here? Otherwise, I think it's wasted time to go through changing everything that's been done so far article by article if the category names are totally functional, and creating duplicative categories with the "proper" headers is obviously even worse. I also was wondering if the admins were eventually planning on making the category listings collapsible/expandible—having the capacity to see every article at once within the sub-categories of a given category would obviate disagreements about how specific categorizations should be (i.e., state by state v. undifferentiated national listings of airports). Do you have any info on this? The only FAQ I found on categories wasn't too helpful. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 2:06 9 June 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have taken your advice on subcategorizing the CITD companies. I agree this may enhance a drilling-down user's exploration of the core concepts in the parent CITD category, by reducing the number of "oh, that's just another company" experiences when clicking through the CITD category's entries. As with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_War_II_dc2f.html" title="Category:World War II">Category:World War II</a>, once you get enough entries, subcategorization is inevitable, anyway. As an aside, I wonder what that magic number is for moving into subcategories. Fifty to a hundred listings seems well handled by the category display page, but if you got to a thousand that page would probably reduce to a noisy mush. Thanks for your input! --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_302c.html" title="User:Gary D">Gary D</a> 19:28, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I moved the "Shannon International Airport" article because the airport is not generally, or officially, called "Shannon International Airport." Everyone calls it "Shannon Airport," including Aer Rianta (which does use the "Shannon International" designation on their website, but only once, and alongside a bunch of mentions of "Shannon Airport"). No Irish person would ever look for SNN under the title of "Shannon International." Just because it <i>is</i> international doesn't mean that it's <i>called</i> international. -- <a href="../../../s/e/k/User%7ESekicho_869d.html" title="User:Sekicho">Sekicho</a> 00:32, Jun 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>DBA means "under as" - It is hardly "ambiguous". It tells which major carrier "umbrella" the regional airline operates under. For instance, Skywest operates under the name Delta Connection for some of its flights (e.g. such Skywest flights are booked through Delta). <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 17:13, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Burgund: There is already a category <a href="../../../i/s/r/Category%7EIsrael_372b.html" title="Category:Israel">Category:Israel</a> which has a subset of Category:Israel geography and I thought that is where Ben Gurion Airport should go as well as under the Israel category as it's the main gateway to Israel.

<p>Hey... You messaged me about copyrights in regards to my New York Subway articles. I realise the either similarity or near identical-ness (sorry, it's late, my words are failing me) to articles on nycsubway.org and the articles here. I am friends with David Pirmann, the webmaster of the site and helped to contribute to the writing of most of the original articles. I will also cite www.nycsubway.org once I get everything done. If you think this is still a problem, I would be happy to take everything down.</p>
<p>Well, my English is better than David's, and most of the content about individual subway stations remainds from 1998, and a loit has changed in the interim so I'm trying to update the text to read better for an interface without photographs. I like your suggestion about Melbourne, my only problem with it is the sheer number of stations is different from Melbourne to NYC. NYC has 486 stations, where as I am sure Melbourne has far fewer. If you have any suggestions for how to incorporate the two, I would love to hear/see them. I plan to make a Wiki for every station in NYC.</p>
<p>I don't mind doing all 486 stations on my own, it's not a big deal. Good luck on your own project! If you have any questions about Copenhagen Kastrup Airport or JFK or LaGuardia, I'd be happy to help out.</p>

<p>Your work on changing the naming convention on the subcategories of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Category%7EBanks_2528.html" title="Category:Banks">Category:Banks</a> from <b>XX banks</b> to <b>Banks of XX</b> might be commendable, but do you intend to follow through on the work you began? The convention that you implemented has its pros and cons, but it is at least closer to the established convention used for the naming of Wikipedia articles. What is harder to understand is why you intentionally destroyed one of the established category sub hierarchies in that process. Replacing <b>XX companies</b> with <b>Companies of XX</b> might have been systematic, but if you don't create and convert those categories, your work has been more destructive than productive. Are you, right now, in the process or recategorizing the various companies categories and articles or do we need to start reverting parts of the effort?

<dd>Yes, I am going to move all the those today. I meant to do it yesterday but I was really tired and it was quite late. There are a lot of categories that follow the XX banks style, which I was given to understand wasn't really a naming convention. I put that down to a lot of people just creating catgories without thinking. Sorry about the confusion, as I am sure I flooded you watchlist.

<dd>I do believe that using the same or a smiliar naming convention as for the Wikipedia articles has a slight advantage. If the change is going to be made it is better to do it relatively early, rather than to wait until all categories for all countries has to be changed. I would hate to see an effort of this magnitude disbanded half way, but if there is a comprehensive effort to implement a complete change over I would only be happy to help.

It is a big uphill fight.

<dd>That's the reason why I am hesitant to take it on myself. Currently there are two competing conventions and it will need to be resolved at some point. Either system works and I see a greater value in having a single system, than over which system is used, even if one of them may be preferred. -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMic_85bd.html" title="User:Mic">Mic</a> 10:47, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Well the problem with the existing system is we cannot use American for US. And US banks sounds horrible. Nor can we really use British. So the other system can be more consistent. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 11:06, Jun 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I propose that if we've applied <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countries_3570.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries</a> to an article, then it should be given individual categories tags. These categories will then be subcategories of the parent country. There's a general discussion at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_31e1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization">Wikipedia talk:Categorization</a> and this should probably go there.</p>
<p>For ROC, as I've said before, the best way to go about this is using politically neutral terms for non-political topics (Taiwan + mainland China vs. ROC + PRC ). People from either side of the conflict share the same definition of what <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> means. For the other cases, I'm not sure. Northern Cyprus can definately be considered part of Cyprus as it considers itself the legitimate Cyrpriot government. The question to ask is whether we've treated it as a country. If we start an article with "Puntland is a region in northeastern Somalia" then we imply that it's part of Somalia. Maybe create a separate category and make it a subcategory of Somalia... --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 07:44, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your message. Yes, I'm completely new to Wikipedia, so pardon me if I have made a few mistakes. I will do my best to correct them and am figuring out the formating thing. Sorry about the "auto-biography," yes, I did confuse it with the "user talk." I hope I'm actually posting this right, by clicking the "+." Anyway, thanks for the welcome.</p>
