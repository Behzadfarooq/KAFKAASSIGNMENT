<p><b>Bury Mount Castle</b> is a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towcester.html" title="Towcester">Towcester</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. It is similar to the local castles at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northampton.html" title="Northampton">Northampton</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham.html" title="Buckingham">Buckingham</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Houghton_e8ef.html" title="Little Houghton">Little Houghton</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_Pagnell_b1e5.html" title="Newport Pagnell">Newport Pagnell</a> in being strategically placed to control primary transport routes and river crossings. Towcester Castle controlled the junction of Watling Street and long distance route from <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamford%2C_Lincolnshire_8876.html" title="Stamford, Lincolnshire">Stamford</a> which went through <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester.html" title="Winchester">Winchester</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackley.html" title="Brackley">Brackley</a> and Northampton. It comprised a small bailey and a tall <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motte.html" title="Motte">motte</a> surrounded by a large ditch. The motte may not have been of the standard conical mound form.</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Bury_Mount_8ee3.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The most likely period for its construction was the ‘<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Anarchy_aa33.html" title="Great Anarchy">Anarchy Period</a>’ from 1135 to 1152 when country was divided between the supporters of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Stephen_817e.html" title="King Stephen">King Stephen</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Maud_230c.html" title="Empress Maud">Empress Maud</a>. It was about the time that the Manor of Towcester passed from the Crown to the St. Hiliary family. The castle would have been used as a symbol of power, been the residence of the lord of the manor’s bailiff or reeve, an encampment for troops and cavalry raised during periods of hostility and offer hospitality to the lord and his retinue whilst travelling. It was to be dominated by a large motte surrounded by a ditch and topped by a tower which created both a stronghold and a watch tower</p>
<p>Documentary evidence shows that in the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_century.html" title="Fifteenth century">fifteenth century</a> there was a gate at the junction of the two lanes leading into the bailey. In this area would be living quarters for the constable of the castle and the small permanent garrison, detached kitchens, a brew house, barns and sheds for storage of food and equipment, stabling, privies, a well and accommodation for livestock. It would have been tightly packed with buildings and would have bustled with activity when fully garrisoned.</p>
<p>The traditional view is that earth mottes had <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palisades.html" title="Palisades">palisades</a> around the summit of the motte which was approached by a ‘<a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_bridge.html" title="Flying bridge">flying bridge</a>” or ladder and within this well defended upper section would have been a tall timber tower. The few excavations of mottes that have occurred show they varied considerably in form. There is the possibility that Bury Mount does not follow the ‘standard’ form. In <a href="../../../1/3/9/1392.html" title="1392">1392</a> it was described as a mound tower within a moat, which suggests that it would have had a stone tower as a wooden tower is unlikely at that date. Shortly before 1824, possibly whist they were excavating away the south-west section of the mount to construct a cottage, a ‘subterraeneous arched passage fifteen yards in length” was found. These two documentary sources suggest that the motte may have been of a similar type to the motte excavated at <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Mimms_110a.html" title="South Mimms">South Mimms</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> in the 1960’s. Although the South Mimms motte looked like a typical castle earthwork they found that “the tower was set within the motte, and the entrance to the castle was gained via a tunnel through the motte into the tower”. Most of the mound at South Mimms had been revetted so that little of the motte was visible. It was probably built around <a href="../../../1/1/4/1141.html" title="1141">1141</a> by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Essex_9dad.html" title="Earl of Essex">Earl of Essex</a>. If the Towcester motte is of this form then it would be rare survival.</p>
<p>In 1392, during the ownership of Reginald de Grey, Baron Grey of Ruthin, a record of the manor in Towcester was made. Within the castle site was the manorial hall aligned north-south, which would have housed the bailiff and important guests and also be the place where the manorial court was held. It had chambers at both ends. The southern chamber, facing towards the gate appears to have been principal 1st floor chamber, usually called a solar, which like the Hall had a stone slated roof. The other chamber was thatched, suggesting that it may have been the bailiff’s accommodation. Adjacent was a detached kitchen which with a stable attached. Both were thatched with straw. There were two great barns which were ‘at a distance’ plus an oxhouse with stable and carthouse under one roof, a dovecote and a sheepfold for 200 sheep.</p>
<p>In the late 15th century the Manor castle appears to have been vacated and a new Manor House constructed in Park Street Towcester. Part of this building still survives and is known as the Mint House.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1643/4 Towcester became the winter headquarters of the Royalist Army under <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rupert_5295.html" title="Prince Rupert">Prince Rupert</a>. The town was re-fortified and Bury Mount was converted into a platform for 2 canon which was probably slighted when the Roylaists left in the spring of 1644. From then on Bury Mount was used as an orchard and then as gardens for a cottage built at the foot of the mound.</p>
<p>The cottages have now been demolished but access to the Mount can be obtained from Moat Lane which is to the east of the Market Square.</p>
