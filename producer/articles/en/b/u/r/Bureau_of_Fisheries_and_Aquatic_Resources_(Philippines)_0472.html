<p>When the Civil Government was established on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippine</a> Commission proposed the creation of an Office under the Department of Interior to take charge of the conservation, promotion and development of the country's fishery resources. This was not carried out, due to limited funds. The Secretary of the Interior continued to stir interest in the development of fisheries and, finally, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, studies in fisheries began following the arrangement made by the Secretary of Interior for the services of the U.S. Fish Commission research fishing vessel "<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albatross.html" title="Albatross">Albatross</a>" to work in Philippine waters for eighteen months and the employment of an American specialist in fisheries in the Bureau of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a>, formerly known as Bureau of Science to take charge of all work pertaining to fisheries. This Division remained under the Bureau of Science until the end of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, by virtue of General Memorandum Order NO. 4 dated <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> of the Secretary of <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">Commerce</a>, the Division of Fisheries and Division of <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoology.html" title="Zoology">Zoology</a> of the Bureau of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a> together with the Division of Forest <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauna.html" title="Fauna">Fauna</a> and Grazing of the Bureau of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forestry.html" title="Forestry">Forestry</a> were fused into one special division known as the Fish and Game Administration, which was placed under the direct administrative jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Under this arrangement, the fish and Game Administration operated under the provisions of the Fisheries Act (Act No. 4003) and Act No. 2590, entitled "An Act for the Protection of Game and Fish." By subsequent reorganization effected on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_27.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, the Fish and Game Administration was returned to the Bureau of Science. The reason for its return was to strengthen the office through the use of equipment,personnel and appropriation of the said Bureau.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, under the provisions of General Administrative Order No. 15, the Fish and Game Administration was reorganized as an independent unit under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and renamed Division of Fisheries. The functions pertaining to forest fauna and grazing was returned to the Bureau of Forestry and those of the Division of zoology to the Bureau of Science.</p>
<p>The Divisions of Fisheries as a special division under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce functioned up to the outbreak of the war in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>. During the early days of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Division of Fisheries was fused with the Bureau of Forestry and then known as the Bureau of Forestry and Fishery. In the latter part of the enemy occupation, however, the Division of Fisheries was converted into an independent office known as the Bureau of Fisheries.</p>
<p>Taking cognizance of the increasing importance of effectively administering and conserving our fishery and other aquatic resources in our efforts to rehabilitate our prostrate economy, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_Philippines_d14d.html" title="Congress of the Philippines">Congress of the Philippines</a> enacted <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_Acts_of_the_Philippines_83a3.html" title="Republic Acts of the Philippines">Republic Act</a> No. 177 creating the present Bureau of Fisheries which took effect on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>. The Division of Fisheries and all sections, field districts, experimental stations and all activities and agencies of the National Government connected with fishery work have been incorporated in the Bureau of Fisheries.</p>
<p>As organized on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, the Bureau of Fisheries had seven functional divisions, namely, (1) Administrative Division, (2) Division of Fish Culture and Fisheries Biology,(3) Division of Commercial Fisheries, (4) Division of Fisheries Technology, (5) Division of Licenses and Regulations, (6) Division of Investigation and Inspection, and (7) Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology offering a 2 1/2 year course in fisheries on collegiate level. Subsequently, branches of this Institute offering a 4 years secondary course in fisheries were established in the following 7 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_the_Philippines_45e8.html" title="Provinces of the Philippines">provinces</a>: <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samar.html" title="Samar">Samar</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu.html" title="Cebu">Cebu</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albay.html" title="Albay">Albay</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/o/Iloilo.html" title="Iloilo">Iloilo</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamboanga_City_d4f4.html" title="Zamboanga City">Zamboanga City</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antique.html" title="Antique">Antique</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Batangas">Batangas</a>.</p>
<p>The entire <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> was divided into ten fishery districts with a District Fishery Officer as head of each District. The headquarters of the ten fishery districts were located in strategic places in the different fishing regions as follows; Fishery District No. 1-Aparri, <a href="../../../c/a/g/Cagayan.html" title="Cagayan">Cagayan</a>; 2-<a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagupan_City_bfec.html" title="Dagupan City">Dagupan City</a>, 3-<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>; 4-<a href="../../../n/a/g/Naga_City_9ef4.html" title="Naga City">Naga City</a>; 5-<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catbalogan%2C_Samar_9c0c.html" title="Catbalogan, Samar">Catbalogan, Samar</a>; 6-<a href="../../../i/l/o/Iloilo_City_aca2.html" title="Iloilo City">Iloilo City</a>; 7-<a href="../../../c/o/r/Coron%2C_Palawan_1cd4.html" title="Coron, Palawan">Coron, Palawan</a>; 8-<a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu_City_3bc2.html" title="Cebu City">Cebu City</a>; 9-<a href="../../../d/a/v/Davao_City_826b.html" title="Davao City">Davao City</a> and 10-<a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamboanga_City_d4f4.html" title="Zamboanga City">Zamboanga City</a>.</p>
