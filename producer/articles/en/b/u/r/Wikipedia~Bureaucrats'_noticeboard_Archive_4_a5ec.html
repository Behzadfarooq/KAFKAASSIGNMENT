<p>To me, I think the above proposals and call by John Reid is akin to somebody holding a gun to my head, and asking me to don my national colours to prove my patriotism. I refuse to get drawn into petty politics, which is what the RFA has now turn into. Nevertheless I shall come up with a detailed report of what's going wrong with RFA and how we can remedy it. If you would like to know my statement on promotion, please read my RFB, I refuse deviate from my original action plan. As for commitment to the project, please check my contribs and userpage. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 18:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, and will explicitly not support this measure. If we need martyrs, it isn't bureaucrats, it's the RfA. And the RfA can be reformed after <i>well reasoned discussion</i>. Demanding bureaucrats to do this is counter-productive. We're not stupid. There is only one implied correct answer to the question and if the bureaucrats don't want to answer the black &amp; white question in exactly the right way, then they might as well resign. Afterall, there is no room here for nuanced answers. In fact, bureaucrats should just skip answering the question and just resign immediately if they refuse to answer it correctly. Would detractors accept the following: "I agree that bureaucrats serve to community consensus except when such consensus violates the core policy of Wikipedia"? I couldn't endorse that statement myself, because there are times when community consensus is wrong. Period. Jimbo has on a <b>few</b> occasions overriden such discussion in order to maintain the spirit, purpose, and core policy of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>If answering in opposition to the community is akin to serving your own head on a platter, then it would seem the community has a very, very strong expectation that the bureaucrats follow what they say in conferring adminship on people. If that is the case, then the bureaucrats need to do a much better job of explaining why this expectation is a false one, and show how RfA really is supposed to work <i>and start doing it, unflinchingly</i>. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:07, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>John, before you ask us to swear allegiance to what not, I'd like you to dig up statistics on the number of sucessful/unsucessful nominations that you felt were running contrary to the community spirit. Secondly, I'd like to give you a case study (this was also discussed on WT:FAC) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Ambuj.Saxena_3ed5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ambuj.Saxena">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ambuj.Saxena</a> as to what you can deduce from the oppose votes. I'd like your views on the failed RFA. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 11:16, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You have fun with that. I'll start by dissenting. If Willy on Wheels gets community consensus to be an admin, I will fail it. Just an obvious example why your false dichotomy is ludicrous. It's just too black and white. And I'm not surprised you're not getting many people to line up for your firing range. It's just not helpful for the community. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:47, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>You may not appreciate John's style, but John is directly addressing the schism that has generated. So far, the response has been generally to ignore the schism. Taxman notes that consensus <i>could</i> get it wrong if consensus decided to promote Willy. Strawman. Nobody in their right minds at RfA would vote in favor of Willy. Regardless, what Taxman highlights is simply the schism; the notion that "getting it right" is not always the same as "consensus". That's the root of the schism. Carnildo was promoted on "getting it right" not on "consensus", in one of the few cases where "getting it right" and "consensus" did not concur. John is most emphatically <i>not</i> trolling. He is rather symbolic of the frustration that a set of users feel at what has happened. You might not like that these people are upset. You can attempt to marginalize them as supposedly not in keeping with the goals of the project. You can attempt to marginalize them by calling them trolls. At the end of the day, the reality is that a schism has generated. To date, the bureaucrats have been unwilling to address it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:03, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I generally feel that having a community is important, I do have to remember that having a community is the means, not the end. The duty of all participants in this project (including bureaucrats) is to make an <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedia</a>.

<dd>This is it, basically. We have bureaucrats using consensus to determine the best administrator candidates.

<p>Instead of the above, I would ask the 'Crats a more neutral question. The frequent dissent on RFA's talk page seems to stem from the problem that nobody really knows what an 'admin' is supposed to be. Is adminship "no big deal"? Are admins "held to very high standards"? Does adminship require the "trust" of anyone? If so, of whom? And what would happen if the trust is lost? Answers on such questions vary on whom you ask.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you. Would some (or preferably, most) of the Bureaucrats please briefly state what they think being an admin entails? I'll immediately add that this is not any kind of official proposal, not set in stone, and not an oath you are being sworn to. I would simply like to hear your opinions. Non-crats please refrain from commenting here for the time being, to avoid convoluting. --<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 19:36, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've always liked to put forth my views on this subject and I'll restate it once again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adminship means that the candidate should have <u>good judgement</u> to carry out his duties above all else.</li>
<li>An admin should be the face of the encyclopedia: be fluent in understanding core wikipedia policies and processes such as keeping a cool head in disputes, copyright understanding, NPOV, NPA, and notability criteria. Please note: Edits to the wikipedia namespace are *not* an accurate metric for this criteria.</li>
<li>Experience. Some amount of staying experience needed to gain adminship. (3 months to 1,000 non-minor edits should be a defining criteria). Also some experience in participating in ongoing discussions are needed, as an admin may be required to play a role of a mediator from time to time.</li>
<li>Some experience in editing articles. Knowing about how articles are supposed to be written as this is our primary purpose of existance. From my experience, those who absolutely clueless with how articles are supposed to be written tend to make B-grade admins and this reflects when they participate in discussions on talk pages and AFDs.</li>
<li>A history of civility, more so in the last 2-3 months. Unless very serious, a one-off incident shouldn't be used to oppose a candidate.</li>
<li>A candidate should be willing to share his/her knowledge to newcomers and also be willing to mentor inexperienced wikipedians if asked.</li>
<li>I do not consider a history of RC patrol to be mandatory. To me, fighting vandalism should be the duty of each and every wikipedian. RC patrol, or reverting through watchlists are equally important.</li>
</ul>

You've given a list of criteria similar to what people might use to "vote" support or oppose on an RFA, whereas what I'm really looking for is a more fundamental definition of what an admin <i>is</i>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:30, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think Radiant's neutral question is helpful, but misses the point. All of us who are regulars at RfA have standards of one sort or another on what makes a good admin. The core issue here is not what our standards are. The core issue is the schism that has recently generated between the RfA regulars and the bureaucrat corps. John Reid's question, though apparently regarded as insulting, is more directly aimed at addressing the schism. The bureaucrats have largely been silent of late in this debate. Now is not the time to be silent, to hope this problem will go away if enough silence is given. I'd strongly welcome a concerted effort on the part of the bureaucrats to address the schism that has generated. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 12:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I've always been a staunch supporter of the bureaucrats, but I agree in this one that silence at this point is *not* constructive. As I recently discovered, being a bureaucrat is different from being an admin. While an admin may be "no big deal" to many people, a bureaucrat position is considered a "burden", one with a lot of work associated with it. My point here being that the issues raised recently should be addressed by bureaucrats, as interaction with the community is an important part of being one. Radiant's question was very helpful, I believe. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 13:57, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I've been following all of the discussions here. So far, it seems to me like an enormous generalization. All of this has been generated by a decision made in Carnildo's RfA, not by any kind of decision making pattern on the part of the Bureaucracy in general. Taxman has been addressing the criticism that the decision (and its process) sparked. He has even admitted that <i>the way</i> in which the decision was made was perhaps not ideal. I have no reason to believe, given all that, that this situation would be repeated in the forseeable future.<br />
To derive from this situation a conclusion that Bureaucrats could be looking to "ignore community consensus [and rule RfA with an iron fist]" is completely unjustified. Everyone who is a regular in RfA knows how the old saying goes: "we elect Bureaucrats to make the tough decisions, determine consensus in difficult scenarios", etc. Well, sometimes, in order to do our job, we need to think outside the box, try new solutions -- as former Bureaucrat Cecropia did in putting forward the 75-80% margin of discretion for promotion in troubled RfAs. Most of the time, it works. Sometimes, it doesn't. People have spoken in the sense that the solution that Taxman tried did not suit them. We hear you. It is, after all, a human process.<br />
Without going into any specifics of Carnildo's RfA, since I wasn't involved in the process of closing that RfA, let's also not forget that those difficult RfAs can yield complicated scenarios: in extreme cases, an <i>apparent</i> consensus in the neighborhood of circa 60% could, in theory, result in promotion, assuming a scenario where a RfA has been spammed by sockpuppets and bad-faith or bandwagonning&#160;!votes. After going through all the participants, a Bureaucrat could arrive at a real consensus, amidst the good-faith, well-reasoned participants, that would be sufficent for promotion -- and as a matter of fact, whenever people feel that we have not done that, they protest as well, asking if all we ever do is just count votes. At the same time, if a user is promoted whose RfA had an apparent consensus of 61%, people also protest, saying that we are overlooking consensus and doing as we please. It's almost a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" kind of situation. But that's fine: addressing people's concerns and answering questions as to how decisions are made (or how they were made) is part of the job -- and Taxman, as the principal Bureaucrat involved in closing Carnildo's RfA, has been doing it: he has not refused to answer questions as to how or why the decision was made as it was. It comes with the territory.<br />
However, I'm sure you will agree that it is not possible for us to do our job as you yourselves would want us to do it if, whenever a controversial decision is made, people start asking us to line up and renew our "vows" to the project officially. The bottom line is: we are here to make those decisions. The community is not only free, but in fact expected to protest if it feels that any of our decisions were not in keeping with its expectations. But to go from there to suggest that Bureaucrats could be looking to ignore consensus altogether and take over RfA entirely is a giant leap, and one that is completely unjustified by the big picture.<br />
Let's not confuse things: the Carnildo decision was not appreciated. That's one thing. Questioning the Bureaucrats' commitment to the project, that's quite different. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 14:28, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a>'s post above is the best that I've read in the torrent of words that has been written since the closing of the Carnildo RFA. I have posted in several messages on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> a call for the bureaucrats to "address people's concerns and answering questions as to how decisions are made" because, IMO, Taxman's failure to do this adequately is part of the reason that the discontent has been so high. I think the more extreme reactions have been "over the top" but I also think that it is inappropriate for bureaucrats to say "get over it, it's done, let's move on". If there is a significant discontent, it is incumbent on the bureaucrats to make an earnest effort to address the reasonable basis of that discontent. Redux's post is a first step in that direction.</dd>

<dd>John, you seem to have missed my point completely. Understand that the Bureaucrats will not line up and take new "oaths" because you're telling us to. As I said, all of this started as a questioning of the method used to close and decide the outcome of a specific RfA. Questioning the entire Bureaucracy, and especially whether or not we are willing to abide by consensus, is a long, long way from that: also as I said, it's a giant leap that is completely unjustified by the big picture. Understand this: <b>no</b> Bureaucrat believes that s/he is above consensus, but our job consists precisely of determining consensus within the context of RfAs, as well as acting on it in the best interest of the community. That is what we were appointed to do; that is what we do. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 20:25, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually it <i>was</i> posted on that page, but no one picked it up until I posted it here. Then it happened almost immediately. Perhaps others don't care about speed, but the difference of minutes or an hour or especially a day make a huge difference to the process. Flagging bots is just one more bit of bureaucratic overhead. Perhaps the bot owner isn't ready to use the bot, but perhaps they are. A lot of bot owners have been frustrated with the speed of the process; how long it takes. There are a lot of bureaucrats who perhaps have *not* watchlisted the page. The fact is, we don't know unless they explicitly tell us. But everyone has this page watchlisted, which is why it works so quickly. The bot was flagged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FRequests_for_approval&amp;diff=75809037&amp;oldid=75794503" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FRequests_for_approval&amp;diff=75809037&amp;oldid=75794503" rel="nofollow">105 minutes</a> after it was approved.

<dd>I meant to say but forgot, that I saw it on that page and flagged it, then I saw your post here and responded. It just happened to be when I pulled up my watchlist. In the past it seems the approvals group wasn't as active or at least was very sporadic and requests sat out for a long time. Also it seems asking a bcrat on IRC was the preferred method to grab someone fast. Now that the approvals group is more active, I plan to be too. I really do check my watchlist several times a day most days except weekends so there wouldn't usually be a significant delay even if I was the only one looking. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This problem has been around for a while, even before the approval group added new members. During my RfB, there were those who treated the bot flagging as of "lesser importance" to the other bureaucrat tasks. Is that the case? I don't think it is less important, as it often has a direct influence on real wikipedia articles. I'm not pointing fingers at you, but there are a lot of inactive and semi-inactive bureaucrats who are not following this discussion and perhaps other active crats who don't have the page watchlisted. I know you do, and probably so does Redux. But I'm not convinced that the others do. And again, my point is that I think that bot flagging should be treated like closing an RfA in importance. My annoying posts here are intended to speed up the process and I think you can appreciate my intentions at least. Anyway, from now on I'll see what happens posting it just to that page. But if an approval request stays idle for longer than a couple hours or the bot owner gets restless, then I'll post a message here. Now granted I'm bickering over a couple hours, but I would be inconsistent (re: RfB comments) if I didn't think that was important anyway. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 12:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my own experience, I can say that I take all 3 Bureaucrat tasks (RfA closing/promoting, renames and bot flagging) seriously. I don't view any of them as minor or undeserving of attention. Until we get the WP:CHU-like forum running, I would have to say that a quick post to our Noticeboard is still the most effective way of getting a bot flagged.<br />
You might have noticed that Nichalp has just announced that he will be on Wikibreak until sometime in late October. Essjay has been away since mid-August. This means that, at least until late October, Taxman and I are the only Bureaucrats who are consistently active (unless Essjay returns before that). Recently, we have had Angela and Dan (Rdsmith4) do some work sporadically, but they are still not active on a regular basis -- although Dan has been taking care of renames for the last couple of weeks, so we can consider him active on that specific front. This situation may lead to a slightly prolongued delay in our tasks, so whenever necessary, it is useful to call our attention specifically to anything that might be overdue. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 13:33, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I suppose that there is no way around this. You and Taxman are basically right. The bottleneck right now is the number of Bureaucrats, not where the request is posted. And for the record, I made it sound like bureaucrats don't care about bot flagging. I doubt that matches with reality, and I certainly don't have a problem with bureaucrats who specialize in one area over another.

<p>Barring any strong objection, I propose to grant the username "Encyclopedist" (previously used by a reformed and then relapsed vandal/troll who is now banned) to a respected contributor to the Chinese Wikipedia who goes by the same name. He has some four thousand edits to his local wiki, while our banned Encyclopedist has eight thousand to this wiki, which means that zh's Encyclopedist is set to lose his username when <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SUL" class="extiw" title="m:SUL">m:SUL</a> is implemented.</p>
<p>I intend to rectify this unfortunate situation by renaming en's Encyclopedist to "Encyclopedist (banned)" or some such, and renaming zh's Encyclopedist (who has an en account, "Millionaire") to his own name. As this appears to be without precedent, I welcome comments. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">talk</a> 03:05, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't think anyone should be using the username "Encyclopedist", just like no one should be using the username "System Administrator" or "Project Leader". It conveys a false sense of authority on a username basis alone, as if Wikipedia somehow has some official encyclopedist. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 05:26, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, another problem is all on-wiki comments referring to the banned Encyclopedist (such as signing on talk pages, mentions in RfAr cases, etc) will now point to the new one. Unless you're willing to use something like AWB, write or get someone to write a bot to fix all those links and get a consensus on how they should read, then usurping an account with so many edits isn't a good idea methinks. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must point out, also, that we have denied all requests to usurp usernames in recent history. The most common cases where people who wanted a taken username that, although registered, had never been used by whoever "took" it. And there were also rarer cases of people who wanted usernames that had been banned or blocked because they had been used to vandalize. The point is, we didn't cut anyone any slack, because we don't have a specific policy for allowing a username to be usurped. If we were to finally draft said policy, it would be one thing, but making private exceptions does not sound like a good idea to me. Furthermore, I would also have to wonder if the Chinese contributor is willing (or if he already does, of course) to start contributing regularly here or if he just wants to establish a "Wikimedia-wide" identity, since, in light of what Taxman said, and what I've just said, it just sounds like a lot of trouble just to link his Encyclopedist-named user page to his userpage on zh.wp and do minor work every now and then.<br />
Here's a possible alternative solution: although we normally reject renames where the selected new name is too close to existing accounts, in this particular case he could be renamed to something like "Encyclopedist zh" (not the most creative, I know, but you get the picture), which is close enough -- and plus he's going to be highlighting his main identity as a respected contributor with the zh.wp anyways. Technically, this wouldn't be usurping the existing username, and it would save a lot of trouble (mainly that of going through what Taxman described). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 22:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the problem is that when <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SUL" class="extiw" title="m:SUL">universal login</a> comes along, because Encyclopedist on zh has less edits than Encyclopedist on en, he will lose his username across all projects, including his home of zh. Unfortunate, but I don't think we need to worry about it just yet. Universal login has been delayed and the plans changed for a long time (the notice saying a final push was underway was added in July), and it would probably be best to wait until we <b>know</b> it is going to happen. The current plan provides plenty of time for resolution of conflicts. By that time we may have a more developed usurping policy anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 14:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>John I think that's <s>a bit of</s> an overreaction. Encyclopedist doesn't infer, imply or assert any superiority at all over our users, its not compariable with System administrator or Project leader as Cyde has stated either to my mind.

When I was made an administrator I requested my username change from <tt>GIen</tt> to <tt>Glen</tt> so they'd be no confusion (and <tt>Glen</tt> was registered years ago with zero edits, and the crats werent terribly keen about doing it despite the legitimate rationale for the request... Another user have his request so readily accepted over another user with contribs is a tad discouraging, and I'd imagine other users would/will feel the same way.

<dd>I think there's general consensus that truly uncontroversial voluntary de-adminnings can be re-adminned without an RfA. For Wmarsh, as I said in making the promotion I was too tired when he asked to feel like I could make the judgement when there was a tiny bit of controversy. The problem is that good admins are bound to irritate some people even when correctly applying policy. Perhaps that could be solved by lowering the threshold in RfA for re-adminning. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If someone was de-adminned for cause, lowering the threshold is the last thing we'd want to do.

<p>Per <a href="../../../c/r/a/WP%7ECRAT_3381.html" title="WP:CRAT">WP:CRAT</a>, bureaucrats may grant administrator access "only when doing so reflects the wishes of the community". That goes for resysopping too. For bureaucrats to know the wishes of the community, the community must have a chance to express those wishes. A full-blown RfA is not necessarily needed for every resysopping, but some form of community input is a requirement. Even when the specific circumstances under which a former administrator was desysopped were uncontroversial, the user may still lack consensus due to broader, more longstanding concerns, or due to events since the desysopping. Bureaucrats can check for specific controversies, but cannot reliably gauge the overall wishes of the community without actually consulting it.</p>
<p>As noted above, one user who gave up his adminship shortly before being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Doc_glasgow" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Doc_glasgow" rel="nofollow">blocked for disruption</a> was later resysopped just <a href="../../../r/a/u/User_talk%7ERaul654_d9a5.html#Re-sysopping" title="User talk:Raul654">two hours</a> after requesting it on a bureaucrat's talk page, with no community consultation whatsoever. <a href="../../../c/r/a/WP%7ECRAT_3381.html" title="WP:CRAT">WP:CRAT</a> does not allow bureaucrats that level of discretion. At a minimum, the community must have the opportunity to see and discuss every resysopping request. One approach would be for such requests to be made in a public location—perhaps here at the Bureaucrats' noticeboard, or in a separate section at RfA—for all to see. If after a week there are no objections, the user can be resysopped; otherwise, they must pass an RfA. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 16:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know you don't have the tools, but my understanding of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Steward_policies" class="extiw" title="m:Steward_policies">m:Steward policies</a> is that stewards aren't allowed to make the call. They can only desysop according to the result of an election or consensus. So we'd need someone to determine that, and it makes sense to get a bureaucrat to do that if they are willing. As you can probably guess, this is the first piece in the puzzle towards getting a consensus for some de-admin process. However, there's no point taking it any further if no-one is prepared to close the debate, so I thought I'd start at the beginning and work my way to the end. If there was community consensus behind a process, would bureaucrats be prepared to close such debates and declare where the consensus lay?

<p>I agree that our bureaucrats would be the right people to decide whether there is a commmunity consensus in this context, and trust that they would be willing to pick up that baton.</p>
<p>I have written before that I think we need to relax our admin standards - admin tools (such as they are) are not gold-plated, nor weapons of mass destruction, nor in short supply, nor a shiny badge (nor fez and small car): they just make it easier to edit and defend the encyclopedia. So, any editor with, say, 3 months and 1,000 main space edits could ask to be promoted seven days after request, unless someone has a material objection, with the materiality of objections to be judged by the bureaucrats. This would make <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> a bit like <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, only with the presumption being to promote a candidate.</p>
<p>However, in that world, we would need a simple de-admining process too. It would make sense that, say, five admins in good standing could require another admin to have their adminship confirmed in a similar fashion at any time, provided that the confirmation could not be started until, say, 6 months have passed since the previous one (and not counting the initial promotion). -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:08, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way I was thinking of going was like an RFC, where it had to be certified within 24 hours or it was deleted. I figured the numbers and user type to certify could be hashed out in the details, but my basic idea was to have a 24 hour certification period and then a ten day discussion, with a bureaucrat closing discussion and declaring consensus, and then listing at the stewards page if the consensus was to remove powers. I agree there should then be a six month period during which no request to regain the powers or no request to have the user re-confirmed could take place. The only worry I have on this is that the discussions could turn ugly. I think we would have to make it a very clear principle that discussions should not become a battleground and that if a discussion becomes too fractious there is a right to close it early as fractious, or something. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:16, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is any process for deadminning is likely to bring out of the wordwork all the people who have been rightfully sanctioned by an admin. There would almost be guaranteed to be ugliness in any such process. That's why it's been opposed so much in the past. I'd like to see something, because I think it could actually help make it a lower risk to promote, but I'm not sure it's reallistic.

<dd>We should keep the promotion process separate from the demotion process. RfCs don't lead to adminship, sometimes they do lead to ArbCom cases. We shouldn't have the oppotunity arise for venue shopping. For example, if someone wanted admin X desysopped, should they be able to choose whether it is more likely for admin X to be desysopped in an ArbCom case or more likely by a process of community de-adminship discussion? Obviously, they would choose whatever process looks better to achieve their goal. We should leave desysopping to ArbCom. If ArbCom wants to invite community input, that would be OK, but it should still be conducted by ArbCom. We don't need to create a situation where ArbCom and bureaucrats have overlapping jurisdictions.

<p>Previously, bureaucrats would not change usernames for users with few or no edits. I suggest this needs to change now since users can no longer simply make a new account for themselves if the new name they want is too similar to their current name. For example, The14thgGOD made a typo in his name but was not able to create an account with a new name due to this error:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Login Error - The name "The14thGOD" is too similar to the existing account "The14thgGOD". Please choose another name."</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, I believe we need to be more accepting of such requests from now on, even for users with few edits. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>At the moment, we are getting an increasing number of these requests, and I've been rejecting them, as new users can easily choose a completely different name. If we're going to change all these, we need more people working on <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a>. I wonder if the software could be altered to permit similar names to be created, provided that the request came within a day or two of the first name being created, and from the same IP address? <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 03:48, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is also blocking completely valid names, like saying omes is too ornes. Since ornes isn't especially active here anyway, I see no need to block the name omes. Maybe this change is a good reason to get some more bureaucrats. People often refuse to support new bureaucrat applications because we apparently don't need any more, but that's not the case right now. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 13:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another suggestion to deal with the situation while the software's still refusing similar names: we could amend the instructions on WP:CHU (even though we often get cases where people clearly didn't read the instructions before posting their request) to indicate to people that, if they have created an account recently, edited very little or not at all with it, that they should simply create a new account with the desired name. We would include a reference to the fact that, if the name is too close to the existing account (e.g. typos in username creation and the like), than the user should request the rename, including this reasoning in the "reason" line of the request. If we could confirm what Tizio just said as a normal event, and not just a stroke of luck, then this should go into the instructions; we wouldn't have to rename accounts with too few edits, and my previous suggestion would not be necessary.<br />
On another note, I have been leaving renames to Warofdreams and Pakaran recently (although Pakaran hasn't been around recently), but if the page's traffic is starting to become a little overwhelming, I will return to attending to requests.

<dd>To help clarify: The only way to have a sysop flag removed is for the user to voluntarily request it, or for the Arbitration Committee (or Jimbo, who outranks the AC) to order it done. A steward would then remove it from the user. If a user is desysopped by the AC, there is generally a provision in the decision that directs how the user may regain the flag; it may be decided they are not permitted to regain it without special permission from the AC, they may have to go back to RFA, or the adminship might be restored automatically at a certain point in time.</dd>

<dd>It wasn't so long ago that you requested Kimchi.sg be renamed to the current account. Now you want it changed back? You do reallize they are murder on the servers right, with thousands of database hits? Would you consider just keeping the current name since you've asked to be changed to that already? Also, the last time I renamed an existing account to clear it as a target for another rename, it didn't work. The contributions got split between the accounts. You can always sign as Kimchi.sg. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Normally, when a username violates policy and the user is unresponsive to requests for him/her to request a rename for themselves, the account suffers a temporary block, until the user does request a rename — the account is unblocked when the user acknowledges the need for a rename and requests to be unblocked in order to post at WP:CHU. We can try another time, let the person know that the account would be blocked until the owner compromises to requesting a rename. See what happens. Except for usernames that are created as a serious offense themselves, which are changed forcibly, without consulting the owner (and usually indefblocked), that's how we get an unresponsive user to ask for the rename, since we still need the user to select which username s/he would like (or we might have to do another rename later).

In the case of Bhouston, I think it was a simple admin error to delete a page that consisted of a redirect. In the case of Homeontherange, apparently someone changed his username after his user page had already been deleted. Because of that, hundreds of Homey signatures linked to a page which had no "User contributions" link at the side.

<dd>A former user who left under unfortunate circumstances asked to have his accounts renamed and his user and talk pages deleted for privacy reasons. Jimbo agrees (per e-mail) and Angela applied the name change. It is true that old talk page comments will now direct to a user with a blank user page and no contributions, but how often would someone need to contact an editor about 9-24month-old talk page comments?

<dd>It's not a question of contacting the editor. It's a question of making the record of community decisions transparent. The community has an interest in knowing what kinds of contributors have been granted sysop status, what kinds of contributors have been sanctioned, etc. People reading through comments in old article talk pages, and user talk pages also click the links in signatures to evalute what the person's biases may be. You lose some of that transparency when you break links to the list of user contributions. However if we feel that privacy concerns take priority over the loss of transparency, I have no problem with that. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 20:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I opened an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_PMA_a74c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/PMA">RFC</a> on Admin <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> for misuse of blocking; he has decided to voluntarily resign the sysop bit.

Arbcom established in the <i><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Giano</a></i> case that admins who resign their mop "under controversial circumstances" must go through RFA to get it back. Would you consider this RFC to be "controversial circumstances?" If so, please note this somewhere.

<dd>I would, yes. Normally, we only forgo a new RfA if the user resigned for personal reasons, without any kind of incident (burnout, wikibreak, etc.) or, at the very, very least, if the user resigned the status without anyone even complaining about anything (although that would still depend heavily on the circumstances immediately before the resignation). In a case such as this, however, I would only contemplate reinstating sysophood without a new RfA if the RfC turned out to be completely bogus. But that happens when trolls start the procedure, and that is not the case here, so the existence of a RfC for misuse of the tools definitely makes this a controversial circumstance, precluding the regaining of sysophood without a new RfA. It's not a question of opinion, there is no legitimacy for reinstating without the community's sayso. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 14:50, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not against policy to "advertise", although we discourage it because it is really frowned upon. Normally, doing it will attract more opposition than it will support. Making a public announcement in an open forum is <i>not</i> the same as rallying people to vote any specific way by going to their talk pages and "drafting" them personally. The latter is not tolerated; the first is, at the most, a potentially harmful, albeit "legal", strategy. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 13:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the heads up. It's not policy to remove admin rights from inactive accounts because enough people don't feel it's a problem I guess. I don't happen to agree, but such as it is. So all I did was remove bot status. If he wants it back he won't have any problem asking I'm sure. The AWB checkpage is up to them if they want to do anything. Maybe it would be worth looking through all those with bot flags to look for indefinitely inactive users. Perhaps a bot could do that?&#160;:) - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This desysopping was fairly controversial, as Everyking never actually divulged such content. Also, the Arbitration Committee was never very clear as to whether this desysopping was temporary or not. Now that the "emergency" has long passed, would it be appropriate to speedily resysop Everyking?

<dl>
<dd>It looks to me like the only person to describe it as an "emergency" desysopping was an opponent of it. The decision at the time was that Everyking would be desysopped and would be able to seek community approval to regain adminship (that is, an RfA). <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 01:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, one of the arbitrators stated at the time that Everyking had been "immediately desysopped" based on a perceived loss of trust. Normally, the ArbCom would desysop only after an actual arbitration case was filed and completed, which was never done, so this indicates that the desysopping was ordered by ArbCom on an emergency basis rather than in the regular course, although that terminology may not have been officially used.</dd>
<dd>As I understand it, Everyking could seek resysopping either through RfA, or by application to ArbCom itself (although I think the latter would be unlikely to be granted). Note that Everyking did try an RfA soon after the desysopping, which was closed as unsuccessful. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Speedy re-sysopping would not be appropriate. The formal and informal guidelines for that are that the circumstances of the de-syopping were uncontroversial. That is clearly not the case here. I had the same understanding of the various discussions as Warofdreams; community approval through RfA would be required. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 05:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are now over <b>10,000</b> words used in response to oppose votes.

<dd>As someone who has contributed many of those 10,000 words in the oppose section, I would just like to point out that it is my <i>right</i> to discuss the issues on RFA and to participate in the consensus discussions. I question of what value it is to talk merely about how many words were used in the discussion. As far as I can tell, the more discussing that is going on, the better. I also question the use of the term "de facto canvassing" — so no actual canvassing has occurred? This was already examined at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and I think we mostly agreed that whatever Dragons flight said did not meet the guidelines of what canvassing is defined as on Wikipedia.

<dd>Only a handful of the Bcrats also have CheckUser access — of the <i>active</i> Bcrats who have never been on ArbCom, it's basically myself and Essjay. The tool is not part of the Bureaucrat access level, but rather distinct. Arbitrators are the ones more commonly given access to the tool, so this note would probably be more effective if posted to the talk page of the ArbCom project page, where it might draw the attention of a larger number of users with access to the tool. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:00, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
<p>There is no Changing Username Review, so I'm bringing this up on this page.</p>
<p>This user was forced to change their username due to a misguided en.wikipedia policy that previously stated that non-latin usernames are not permitted. However, this is the same user across many wikimedia projects:</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions#User:.E3.81.A3" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_permissions">m:Requests_for_permissions#User:っ</a></p>
<p>Note that this username is perfectly correct on this user's home wiki (ja.wikipedia).</p>
<p>Consensus on meta between several wiki communites has it that this forced name change should not happen. Bureaucrats and stewards on other wikis have stated that they are loath to accept it. When Single User Login is introduced, the SUL system and policy will -among many things, as part of its normal function- enforce reinstatement of this username on en.wikipedia <i><b>in software</b></i>. We are in the process of revising en.wikipedia policy to bring it in line.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the old username should be reinstated as quickly as possible, if only because otherwise the SUL-changeover will make a change harder at a later date. <small>(IIRC it would create a new account っ, but leave all edits attributed to Qzzz, if that account still existed at that time).</small></p>
<p>I think that we should not accept any further requests based on the now hopefully deprecated non-latin name policy, as per the request by Aphaia to all wiki-communities on meta.</p>

<dd>To be honest, I would like to see policy amended properly first. The discussions on Meta and on Foundation-l had sparked a discussion on the talk page of the Username policy page. It seemed to be going in a direction, but the discussion seems to have died off while people were still discussing a few options. Following that (or rather, still during the discussions, towards the later stages), there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96132752&amp;oldid=96090711" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96132752&amp;oldid=96090711" rel="nofollow">back</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96412036&amp;oldid=96132752" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96412036&amp;oldid=96132752" rel="nofollow">forth</a> in the policy page, which is not ideal, and that ended with one user's unilateral alteration, presumably reflecting his own take on the issue, which happened to stay on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96421919&amp;oldid=96412036" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsername&amp;diff=96421919&amp;oldid=96412036" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<dd>I must protest your characterization of that edit. There are several people on the talk page supporting the idea of "avoiding non-latin usernames" rather than a strong prohibtion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Username&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95994902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Username&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95994902" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Username&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95984194" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Username&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=95984194" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AUsername&amp;diff=95983537&amp;oldid=95980725" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AUsername&amp;diff=95983537&amp;oldid=95980725" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Many other people on that page supported any softening of the policy. It is hardly an unilateral action reflecting his own take on the issue. If you still believe it was, however, inappropriate, I would expect you to warn the editor and rectify it. I understand many people choose to stay away from criticizing others and making policy edits, but I think such choices are out of line from a b'crat. I think any b'crat who was watching that edit, believed it to be inappropriate, and did nothing; should seriously reconsider their position. Obviously people such as myself, and of course the editor in question, believed it to appropriate and in line with the consensus of opinions expressed on the talk page. If we are deceived in our thinking, how can a b'crat sit by for weeks on end, not only allowing our self-deception to continue, but also allowing us to inadvertently deceive the countless people who are reading that policy as it stands? If a b'crat will not correct such an error in thinking both about how a particular policy should read and also about how policies should be amended in general, who can be to expected to speak-up? Perhaps all the b'crats who were following this issue have been on a long holiday wikibreak. I certainly hope none who believe the amendment inappropriate have been aware of it for very long.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 18:26, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, my edit was <i>not</i> unilateral, and that was a rather unreasonable thing for you to "<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">presume</a>," Redux. The talk page discussion showed not only that that there was no consensus for the previous for the previous setup, but that there was more opposition than support. Several users commented that it was too strong, and <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> suggested relocating the text (which is all that I did, incidentally).</dd>

<dd>Take it easy, people. I understand that this is a sensitive subject for many, but that really doesn't help. Since you mentioned, Birgitte, I really only noticed the events on the Username page itself when I reviewed the discussions recently, because of your post here. I had been aware of the discussions, but as a Bureaucrat, that is to say someone who would be charged with carrying it out, I preferred to stay out of this, and let the community work it out.<br />
Now, my understanding of what had happened was as I wrote above, my apologies if I misunderstood something. However, it still appears to me that the discussions went stale while there were still things up in the air, and in the end, what happened is that someone (David) implemented a specific viewpoint, which wasn't necessarily an agreed-upon direction to take — as I said, discussions died out while options were still being discussed, as it often happens on Wikipedia, unfortunately. And I'll repeat, that's not the way to amend policy: if the discussions had gone silent, you could have asked something like "so nobody opposes us doing it <i>this and that way</i>", so as to rekindle it and possibly go ahead with the change. And the context, with a previous change to the policy which was reverted to the <i>status quo</i> only to be yet again changed to reflect another understanding of what should be in there, didn't make it look any better.<br />
Please do not mistake this for a "manifesto" for the return of the original wording. My job is to do as policy directs in this matter, not to judge single-handedly which direction should this be. In fact, this thread could even suffice to legitimize, if it be the case, the change. If all we will see here will be support for the change, we can just copy this into the talk page of the Username policy and that would be it. The bottom line is: when amending official policy, we need to be more particular, and engaging in a back and forth in reverting and re-reverting the policy page never, never helps. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 21:09, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. As noted on the talk page, the policy was edited over time in a manner for which no consensus existed, and this slipped under many users' radars. The "status quo" was far from sacrosanct, as the onus is on those who advocate such restrictions (not those who oppose them) to establish consensus. Otherwise, unless and until Jimbo or the Board hands down such a decision, this cannot be regarded as policy.</dd>
<dd>2. As BirgitteSB mentioned, my edit was a compromise (suggested by <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> and backed by several others). The only thing that wasn't established during the discussion's course was whether consensus even existed to retain the wording at all. What was demonstrated was that editors on both sides of the issue were willing to accept a middle-of-the-road arrangement. Since when is a discussion-derived compromise considered inappropriate?</dd>
<dd>3. I don't understand why you're lumping me together with other users. I made a good-faith effort to engage in productive discussion and edited the page in a manner that I honestly believed reflected the opinions expressed. I didn't edit-war, and <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> (who advocated retaining the restrictions) acknowledged this on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>4. If you disagreed with my interpretation of the situation or objected to my edit in any way, you could have contacted me, expressed your concerns, and inquired as to my reasoning. Instead, you "presumed" that I had acted unilaterally and declared this in a discussion of which I wasn't aware (until BirgitteSB kindly informed me via my talk page). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure you meant well, but the entire ending to the discussions, as I have mentioned repeatedly, was conducted in a flawed manner — which, just to be clear, I'm <i>not</i> saying was your fault.<br />
And please, don't post replies in the middle of an ongoing thread. At this point, I'm not even sure if you read my latest remarks. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:27, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Again, my edit was suggested by another user and backed by several others. Yes, I "meant well" when I implemented a compromise that was discussed and approved on the talk page, thereby halting an edit war. That's how things are supposed to work.</dd>
<dd>The fact one of us (I believe you) misinterpreted the situation is <i>not</i> an excuse to "presume" that my edit was unilateral and declare this behind my back without any attempt to discuss it with me. Frankly, I'm surprised that you've apologized only for a possible misunderstanding on your part (and not for the lack of common courtesy that you demonstrated above).</dd>
<dd>2. I did <i>not</i> "post replies in the middle of an ongoing thread." I read your remarks and typed my reply in the correct location (below BirgitteSB's earlier reply with +1 indentation). I'm baffled as to what you're complaining about. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I will now emphasize further the completely wrong context in which this all happened: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABirgitteSB&amp;diff=96133032&amp;oldid=96132379" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABirgitteSB&amp;diff=96133032&amp;oldid=96132379" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>, on Birgitte's talk page. With all due respect to Gurch, who does good work for the project, that is absolutely not at all the way to do this: we don't make changes <i>we expect to be reverted</i> so that for the day and a half it stayed on the people concerned will "have done nothing wrong". And the edit was indeed reverted, only to be changed yet again 3 hours later. Do you see what I mean? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 21:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that edit reflects poorly on Gurch. But seriously I think you are giving far to much weight to the inappropriatenes of previous editors. The compromise was supported by many comments on the talk page. Tha lack on objections in so long a time further supports it. There are still people in both extremes who would rather see the policy read differently but they are not so dissatified with the compromise that they wish to continue the debate. It is hard for me to believe that David Levy would not have made the same edit had Gurch never edited the policy.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 22:12, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concerning David's edit, it's just a ground rule: if the page has been changed, reverted, and so on, don't re-revert right away (except if it is clear vandalism). It only helps create a context where your (whoever edited) edit may be questioned or even misunderstood. If we all did that, problems such as 3RR violations would be exclusive to vandals, and not something good editors get blocked for all the time. And this should really go doubled if the page we're talking about happens to be an official policy page.<br />
It is, of course, rather unfortunate that even an issue about which people cared about seemingly a lot was allowed to go stale on the talk page before consensus on how the policy should be amended could be reached — or at least that is what it looked to me had happened upon reviewing the discussions: people were discussing options, and "suddenly" there was no follow up to the proposals —. All in all, context wasn't really painting the best picture for the final parts of this policy amendment discussion.<br />
As I said, if we will see only support for the present outline of the page, we can copy and paste this thread into the Username talk page and it should suffice, which is absolutely fine with me, and I'm sure, would be with all the other Bcrats. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <i><b>didn't</b></i> revert anything, let alone "right away." I discussed the matter on the talk page and implemented a widely supported compromise. As BirgitteSB noted, the discussion subsequently died down because most people were satisfied with the outcome. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I said, the way I read it, people were making suggestions, then there was no follow up. At the same time, the policy page was changed, reverted, and changed again, the last time by you. That <i>is</i> what happened. What you and Birgitte claimed is that <i>context</i> was different from what I had understood it to be. And also like I said before, my sole intent here was to make sure that policy be amended properly, not to advocate what exactly the amendment should be, so if you an Birgitte are saying that it was done right, and that I had misinterpreted the events on the policy page, all the better. However, all of this could have been easily avoided if you had not: 1) edited almost immediately after the page had been through a back and forth, <i>seemingly</i> adding to it; 2) used the edit summary more accurately, by writing something like "altering per discussions on talk page", instead of <cite>It's okay to encourage people to make things easier for others, but the implication that non-Latin usernames are "inappropriate" reflects neither by consensus nor the actual text in question.</cite> — which implicated a response to Nichalp's reversion to the original version, rather than the implementation of a concerted decision on the talk page — adding to this appearance was the fact that you did not edit over Gurch's 2-day-old, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABirgitteSB&amp;diff=96133032&amp;oldid=96132379" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABirgitteSB&amp;diff=96133032&amp;oldid=96132379" rel="nofollow">admittedly</a> inaccurate edit, but rather only (figuratively) immediately after the page had been reverted to the original wording. So you see, a <i>context</i> was created that didn't help, and it was easily avoidable.<br />
Finally, this discussion needs to be transferred to the talk page of the Username policy. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 11:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. You implied above that I "re-revert[ed]" the page. That is false. I did not undo anyone's edit. I merely relocated some text from one section of the page to another.</dd>
<dd>2. Upon reading the talk page discussion, you surely noticed the comments by several users that the text in question belonged elsewhere on the page. Why, then, did you refer to my action as "unilateral," and why would you expect "follow-up" to the implementation of the most widely supported solution?</dd>
<dd>3. "Back and forth" edit wars frequently are resolved via prompt compromise. By stating that I shouldn't have edited the page so soon, you're basically arguing that the edit war should have continued.</dd>
<dd>4. In my edit summary, I explicitly cited "consensus" (by which I meant that which was established on the talk page). My statement that the implication didn't reflect "the actual text in question" was a reference to the talk page comments that it didn't mean what was contextually implied by its presence in that section.</dd>
<dd>5. Yes, context was different from what you understood it to be, but I find it incredible that you blame this misunderstanding on <i>me</i> (listing all of the mistakes that you believe I made). <b>Had you simply inquired on my talk page</b>, "all of this could have been easily avoided." Instead, you declared behind my back that this was a "unilateral alteration" on my part. (And I wouldn't have even learned of this and been able to respond if BirgitteSB hadn't informed me.)</dd>

<dd>I've explained things repeatedly, and quite frankly, clearly enough. Your previous comments and Birgitte's served to explain context. So much so that I renamed the user concerned originally in this thread myself.<br />
The only reason why this thread became some sort of review of yourself specifically is because you decided to make it so. The original intent was not to rebuke you directly, but rather to explain that it was my understanding that the policy had not been altered properly, despite the discussions that were going on that particular direction — so much so that your edit was only mentioned after I had commented on the back and forth that had happened previously, and since it was not the intention to focus on user review, I didn't even name names in my comment, even though I provided diffs to the edits in question. The main purpose was to legitimize any changes and prevent it from being challenged at some time in the future. That was it. So again: I said the discussions were going on that particular direction (consistent with your edit), but they looked like they had gone stale before a final version of the wanted changes could be agreed upon (my interpretation at the time). Then the page was changed, reverted, and changed again without any rekindling of the discussions, which, to me, at the moment, given what I understood had happened, would have been the correct course of action. Your edit summary indicated to me that you had reacted to Nichalp's revert of Gurch's edit in accordance with your own understanding of what the policy should be: again, read my previous comment on how a better use of the edit summary could have prevented that.<br />
Had I inteded to bring you, David Levy, into review directly, you can rest assured I would have notified you beforehand, and I wouldn't be doing it here, on the Bureaucrats' noticeboard. I'm sorry that you didn't like being criticized, but welcome to Wikipedia. I brought attention to an issue that I felt was important in light of Birgitte's inquiry regarding a rename that would only be possible by amending policy; and indeed notice, very importantly, that I was responding to another user's inquiry, not starting a thread myself. I've apologized for misunderstanding context, which is what happened, but I would have been remiss as a Bureaucrat if I saw a situation that looked the way it looked <i>to me</i> and just looked the other way and pretended that I never noticed it.<br />
Now, after all the explaining that I've done, if you still can't see how a moderatelly different procedure in actually editing the page could have prevented all of this, then I must say, it's getting very difficult to make it clearer, especially after my previous comment. Put yourself in an uninvolved party's shoes, such as mine: Gurch edited the page, he admitted that the changes he made were not ideal, and that he even expected them to be reverted. His changes stayed on for almost 2 days. Then Nichalp reverted him, as he himself predicted; then less than 3 hours later, you changed the policy page again, with an edit summary that indicated a response and a reaction to Nichalp's edit (see my previous comment) — your edit was meant to change the exact passage in the policy (the non-Latin character part) that had been the object of the previous edits, so even if your edit was not to restore Gurch's exact words, the situation, as I was interpreting it, remained the same. In the discussions, I saw people still proposing possibilities to amend the policy, and then the discussion went stale, and to me at least, seeming that it had fallen short of arriving at a final version of what needed to be changed exactly. That is quite common on Wikipedia. And then the editing of the policy itself began.<br />
Although perhaps my original words fell short of representing accurately my understanding of the situation: when I said that "a user (you) edited unilateraly, representing his own take on the issue", what I meant was that someone had edited before the discussions concluded, and in accordance with their own understanding of what the outcome should be. So 1) Yes, I know now that this is not exactly what happened, but it was my interpretation of the history and talk pages at the time — all of which could have been avoided with a few simple precautions, as I have already explained; 2) It doesn't mean that I thought that you were implementing an idea exclusively of your own. Even if my interpretation had been absolutely accurate, you'd still have implemented something that had been discussed previously on the talk page, but it wouldn't have been a valid implementation, since it would have happened before the discussions had concluded and in response to the previous back and forth in the article. <i>(you did notice my use of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_mood.html" title="Conditional mood">Conditional mood</a>, right?)</i><br />
Now, I hope this finally clears it up, since at this point this thread, aside from being gigantic, has become a poor allocation of time, both mine and yours. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 19:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, too, have clearly explained my position.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, my implementation <i>was</i> valid. It addressed changes that were made to the policy without consensus (id est changes that shouldn't have been made in the first place). At that point, the only unresolved issue was whether the text in question would remain at all. (And of course, I didn't remove a single word.)</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I'm <i>not</i> blaming you for your honest misunderstanding. I'm criticizing you for <b>not bothering to discuss your concerns with me</b>. I'm sorry that you didn't like being criticized, but welcome to Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>You referenced your responsibility as a bureaucrat to investigate the situation before proceeding. I agree, and that only makes it <i>more</i> difficult to understand why you didn't simply <b>ask me</b> about the edit before posting an assumption. This is a common courtesy that I would expect from <i>any</i> experienced user, bureaucrat or not. I realize that I was not the focus of this discussion, but you nonetheless publicly condemned my action.</dd>
<dd>You've continually stressed that this "could have been avoided with a few simple precautions," and I'm pointing out that it could have been avoided with <b>one</b> simple precaution: informing me that you disagreed with the appropriateness of my edit and/or inquiring as to what my reasoning was. I don't mind being criticized, but it's only constructive when I know about it. If you believe that someone has erred, shouldn't this be brought to his/her attention? Otherwise, how is he/she to know that a mistake was made (let alone learn from it)?</dd>
<dd>I certainly didn't expect this to balloon into such an enormous thread. I honestly expected you to simply apologize for neglecting to contact me regarding this matter. Instead, you've apologized for the original misunderstanding (which I don't blame you for) while simultaneously blaming <i>me</i> for causing it. In hindsight, I probably <i>could</i> have been clearer in my edit summary (and I'm sorry that I wasn't), but I would have gladly elucidated the situation for anyone who had simply asked me to. Until BirgitteSB informed me of your comments, I had no idea that my edit's validity had even been called into question.</dd>
<dd>And again, please explain what you meant when you claimed that I replied to this discussion incorrectly. As noted above, I want to know if I made a mistake (so that I may avoid repeating it in the future). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 04:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
