<p>When I stumbled upon <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">Template:UsernameBlocked</a>, I found it quite silly to put up a request when you are blocked (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AUsernameBlocked&amp;diff=61645103&amp;oldid=57656025" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AUsernameBlocked&amp;diff=61645103&amp;oldid=57656025" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), so I have created a new template, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsername_change_request_f9c0.html" title="Template:Username change request">Template:Username change request</a> (along with <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_username_changes_when_blocked_c91d.html" title="Category:Requests for username changes when blocked">Category:Requests for username changes when blocked</a>), for the use of people who are blocked for username but still have enough contributions to matter. (Otherwise, they could simply create the new account.)

<dd>The wordings of the two templates are akward. The <i>If you are not blocked...</i> clause could be very confusing for a new user. And the page history link points to the template history.

<dd>Indeed. There are, however, two problems with doing so here:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Renaming an account removes it from the system, allowing it to be recreated. Thus, every renamed vandal username is a username they can recreate and use to vandalize again.</li>
<li>The rename policy on en.wiki does not allow forced renames; no consent, no rename. A dramatic change in policy, and consultation with counsel over the GFDL effects of forced renames of accounts with contributions, regardless of the contributions' merit, would be required.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of the two, the second is a much bigger legal issue, but the first is a far worse technical issue. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 00:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In terms of the first problem, I think that doing this to <a href="../../../d/o/p/Wikipedia%7EDoppelganger_account_823e.html" title="Wikipedia:Doppelganger account">imposters</a> would be a good way to make way for Doppelgänger accounts. I think the rename policy is the same on <a href="../../../o/r/t/OrthodoxWiki_8874.html" title="OrthodoxWiki">OrthodoxWiki</a> but with just that one exception. I'm not sure what you mean by the GFDL effects, however, that wiki does operate under a dual GFDL and Creative Commons Attribution--ShareAlike 2.5 licensing. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a> 08:48, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the GFDL effects, the GFDL requires that users be credited for their work; that's why we keep edit histories, and why we make such a fuss about anyone messing with them. If you rename a user without their consent, you move thier contributions to a username other than the one they specifically released those contributions under. I'm not an attorney, and I don't represent the Wikimedia Foundation, but it has been said previously that doing such changes could be seen as violation of the terms of the GFDL, and could expose the Foundation to legal liablity. Any such policy change would have to be cleared by the legal department first. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 20:16, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then the policy in <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Changing_inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username#Changing_inappropriate_usernames</a> should be changed.

<p>"The rename policy here is this, exactly: An account can be renamed when the user makes a request to do so while logged in to that account. Period." And I don't undestand what that word is doing after the full-stop, and anyway, the policy is probably exaclty the same but with that one exception I mentioned earlier, who needs to repeat to make a point? "...but it has been said previously that doing such changes could be seen as violation of the terms of the GFDL, and could expose the Foundation to legal liablity." Well, considering the points mentioned above, how exactly does OrthodoxWiki get away with it?

<dd>A period is a full-stop. It's there to emphasize that there are no exceptions to the rule Essjay stated, although Taxman seems to indicate otherwise based on the username policy (and he's absolutely right).

<dd>What the OrthodoxWiki does is thier business: This is not OrthodoxWiki, this is the English Wikipedia, and it operates under it's own set of policies. We have a full time attorney on staff, and a legal department full of experts; it's really not that difficult to get an opinion on whether we're likely to get sued for attributing contributions to the wrong name. That is <b>exactly</b> what a forced rename does: It is no different than a publisher deciding to change the name of an author without the author's consent. Forcing renames is the online equivalent of changing "Written by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmon_Rushdie_c678.html" title="Salmon Rushdie">Salmon Rushdie</a>" to "Written by John Smith" and then putting "We decided to change "Salmon Rushdie" to John Smith without his permission" in 0.5px font, upside down, in Greek, on the back side of the page glued to the front cover. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 20:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the glued page comment referes to the fact that although we do LOG EVERY USERNAME CHANGE, where to go to look for that log is not simple to get to. We seem to have 2 issues up in the air here: 1)Does legal have any reasons why this shouldn't be done? 1a)If the users have no edits (e.g. all deleted), where does GFDL come in to play? 2)If there's no reason why we must not do this, then we need to form a heavy consensus for why we should do it. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:58, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the love of Jimbo: It was <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>, pointing out how difficult it is for the average user to find any record of a username change. You have to be pretty savvy with Wikipedia to know that usernames can be changed at all, and more so to know where to look. It is, for all intents and purposes, hidden to the vast majority of readers, just like tiny print, upside down, in a foreign language, on the back of a page glued to another page, would be in a print book. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm one of the handful of admins on OrthodoxWiki. The reason why some usernames are changed is because they belong only to vandals (so none of their contributions are kept) and because, as an Orthodox Christian site, we don't want what we define as obscenity hosted on our site, not even in the list of users. We only change usernames we find offensive, and we block all vandals indefinitely.</p>
<p>We're small and nowhere near as active as Wikipedia, and we also have a different focus, so our policies are designed to work for us in that context. I would not recommend that our policies be used to influence or determine Wikipedia policies. We use the same software, but that's really where the similarity effectively ends. We have our own legal counsel, and those issues are handled by the site owner. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<p>A closing bureaucrat will most likely close <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Catamorphism_9cfd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Catamorphism">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Catamorphism</a> shortly. I am posting here due to great concern about the preponderance of "votes" (I know they're not really votes, but have we thought up a better replacement word yet? <b>;-)</b>) within the RfA that seem to oppose the admin nominee simply on the basis of their stated preferred gender identity, a semi-rare choice of being gender-neutral. First, it strikes me as something fundamentally wrong: would we ask a gay Wikipedia editor to not make a big deal out of it if someone labeled them as straight, and continued to label them as straight despite their continued indication they were gay? Would we ask an African-American Wikipedia editor to not make a big deal out of it if someone labeled them as white, and continued to label them as white despite their continued indication they were African-American? I think it's out of line to be asking a nominee to suggest that they would be a better admin if they alter the gender identity they present to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Catamorphism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65571560" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Catamorphism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65571560" rel="nofollow">as a voter suggested to the nominee</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, all that is moot, since my second point is that the nominee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Catamorphism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65241687" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Catamorphism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=65241687" rel="nofollow">has already indicated</a> that they will not make a big deal out of small mistakes obviously not made in bad faith, and will be quite reasonable in other cases ... yet the oppose votes still remain unwithdrawn. I am posting here simply to ask the closing bureaucrat, whomever that individual might be, to consider this factor when examing oppose votes and coming to a judgment regarding consensus upon closing the request. From my brief research, I know the concept of RfA consensus is different than, say, AfD consensus (such as, for example, the 75% figure coming into play), but I would hope that the determination of RfA consensus still allows an examination by the closing bureaucrat of the validity of the various editors' reasoning.</p>
<p>If the closing bureaucrat doesn't believe my concern is valid, then such is life, but given the circumstances, I <i>did</i> feel that it very much needed to be brought to your attention. I am not certain if alerting you to this compromises the process or not; I assume not (since others appear to come here to advise you of certain elements of RfAs they are concerned about), but I assure you in any case that I am making this post well-intentioned and in good faith, despite my recent advocacy in Catamorphism's RfA (whom I had never interacted with prior to the RfA).</p>

I'm just saying if it's close <i>enough</i>, the closing bureaucrat may want to take the above into account when making the call one way or the other.

<dd>You are correct; Pegasus is not a bureaucrat. But I don't see how that's relevant (you're not one either). But in all honestly, as Pegasus hinted, if you take a look at the oppose votes, you'll see that they are not based entirely on gender pronouns. Some comment on civility or Catamorphism's controversial views and how they affect his/her editing. I understand that opposing based on the fact that he/she is a stickler with gender pronouns would be absurd, but that's not what's going on here. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> <small>(joturner)</small> 13:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My last comment in this thread: Just like ANI isn't the place to work out a difference of opinion, this noticeboard isn't, either. Just like ANI, this is a place to advise bureaucrats of concerns. I've done so. The debate itself's already being well-fought out in the threads on Catamorphism's RfA. If in the closing bureaucrat's judgment I'm wrong, so be it. But I'm not going to refight the concern here and clutter up their noticeboard as a result. And, for the record, I certainly don't have any problem with oppose votes based on the polemical political material on Catamorphism's page, although I myself wouldn't vote 'oppose' simply because of it. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a> 14:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since he doesn't speak English, and being that I'm aware of the situation, all he needs to write there is the username he wants and sign the post -- basically, I require the verification that the account owner wants the change (which a post at CHU will provide) and the specification of which name he wants. Naturally, once the account verifies that a namechange is disired, I will proceed to the usual verification of the user's history, in order to determine if the namechange can be performed (the request is <i>not</i> granted in advance), but that's nothing out of the ordinary. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:41, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't have any one Bureaucrat who is reponsible alone for any particular duty, Nichalp just prefers to focus on username change. This [small] waiting period in answering the requests is happening because we only have 4 Bureaucrats who are active on a regular basis, and two of them are temporarily inactive. Don't worry, Taxman and I will get around to answering all of the requests. We always try to answer requests as soon as possible, but a waiting period of 48 to 72 hours is not uncommon in those cases.

<p>I don't recall approving bureaucrats to hand out arbitrary lengths of adminship service because they don't really know how to make the decision. Adminship has <i>never</i>, <i>ever</i> been handed out for 8 weeks at a time as a result of an RfA. Did you actually tell anyone anywhere taht you planned to do this if they supported Carnildo? Or are you just making it up as you go along? You don't own RfA, you merely implement its decisions, and no part of its decision referred to two months. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 13:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also object. I did not comment on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Carnildo_3_c13a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 3">RfA/Carnildo3</a>; I can't recall having anything to do with this editor; so perhaps I'm neutral on him. I have been occasionally active on RfAs. This editor may be rehabilitated, a fine admin -- or not; I have no idea. I do see that the RfA was contentious and the tally borderline. My instinct in such matters is to err on the side of caution; I would invite the candidate to reapply in a few months and see if community sentiment changes. Guesstimating from the change since <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Carnildo_2_c1b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 2">RfA/Carnildo2</a>, clear consensus may well form in favor -- then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely <i>don't</i> like the precedent set by "temporary" adminship. Has this ever been done before? Has the community expressed any desire for this measure in general? Where does this door lead? B'crats are expected to make tough judgement decisions; it's routine. Is this a creative solution or a failure to make the call? Also, exactly under what circumstances and by what method will Carnildo's sysop privs "expire"? Who will make the decision to revoke or extend them? Sorry, but evaluating admin performance is <i>not</i> a b'crat function; it is ArbCom's or a steward's, if not the community's. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 15:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I was not involved in the decision that led to Carnildo's resysopping, but to clarify: his adminship is not temporary exactly. It is under probation. This means that, after a given period of time (two months), the <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EArbCom_eb42.html" title="WP:ArbCom">ArbCom</a>, not the Bureaucrats, will review his record as an admin for this period of time and decide on whether or not to remove his admin bit again or let it stay.

<dd>It's worth noting that RfA doesn't own bureaucrats either.

<dd>There is no precedent for probationary adminship and I dislike to see it set by fiat. I object to the term "own"; it is an inappropriate straw man. RfA <i>determines</i> who will and who will not become an admin; b'crats are empowered only to implement community will -- not to paternalistically watch over the community and do what's best for us. If we want a probationary admin, we'll ask for one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a very old, well-established principle: Power is divided between the rank-and-file on one hand and Jimbo and the Board on the other.

These classes of users exist solely to implement community will.</dd>

Discussion has also reached <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html#Resign_your_adminship" title="User talk:Carnildo">User_talk:Carnildo</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html#Carnildo.27s_re-promotion" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">WT:RfA</a>.</p>
<p>The role of bureaucrats is to gauge community consensus. <a href="../../../c/r/a/WP%7ECRAT_3381.html" title="WP:CRAT">WP:CRAT</a> says that bureaucrats may grant administrator access "only when doing so reflects the wishes of the community", <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a> says that bureaucrats "review the discussion to see whether there is a general consensus for promotion", and <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a>, one of the three bureaucrats behind the decision to promote Carnildo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=72907696&amp;oldid=72902539" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=72907696&amp;oldid=72902539" rel="nofollow">acknowledges</a> that "As a bureaucrat it is my job to determine consensus in RfAs." Yet the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Carnildo_3_fd7b.html#Promotion" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 3">decision</a> makes no mention of consensus, and only references community opinion to say that while many users oppose Carnildo's adminship, he is being promoted anyway.</p>
<p>The threshold for consensus was not met here. Although RfA is not a rigid vote, consensus tends to be gauged by percentage, with bureaucrats "generally held to a 75-80% discretionary zone", in Taxman's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bureaucrats%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=52264220&amp;oldid=51614012" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bureaucrats%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=52264220&amp;oldid=51614012" rel="nofollow">words</a>. Carnildo's RfA closed with 112 supports and 71 opposes, a 61% ratio. The true ratio may be even lower due to users (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=73971573&amp;oldid=73969503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=73971573&amp;oldid=73969503" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=73976275&amp;oldid=73976255" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=73976275&amp;oldid=73976255" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) not bothering to oppose when they saw that the RfA was already well below the threshold for promotion.</p>
<p>There has arisen a dangerous misconception that when deciding whether to promote, bureaucrats are permitted to "weigh the arguments" or make arguments of their own at the expense of community consensus. Neither <a href="../../../c/r/a/WP%7ECRAT_3381.html" title="WP:CRAT">WP:CRAT</a> nor <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a> gives them such authority. Rather, it is the job of the <i>community</i> to make arguments and weigh each other's arguments during the discussion. The job of bureaucrats is strictly to gauge consensus. Of course, they cannot do so by mechanically counting supports and opposes, but must watch carefully for sockpuppets and other consensus-obscuring factors. And of course, bureaucrats are part of the community too, and in their role as community members, may participate in the discussion themselves. But in their role as bureaucrats, when deciding whether to promote, they are bound by the community's will.</p>
<p>In addition to lacking consensus, this decision had other problems. First, although bureaucrats may participate in RfA discussions, it is best for impartiality that they not close discussions in which they have participated, unless the outcome is uncontroversial due to an obvious consensus or non-consensus. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a>, who supported the RfA, nonetheless holds "primary writing credit" for this very controversial decision. Second, transparency requires that bureaucrats discuss issues of promotion or non-promotion openly. Taxman pledged to do so when he became a bureaucrat, but now <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html#Taxman.27s_RfB_promise" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">admits</a> that with respect to the current decision, of which, as far as I know, not a peep was made prior to its surprise announcement, he "did different from what [he] said [he] would", a "mistake", in his words.</p>
<p>In short, the decision to promote Carnildo was made without transparency and without consensus. If the bureaucrats believed that "special consideration should be given to the extenuating circumstances of this case", they could have presented that view to the community and sought consensus in the ensuing discussion. Instead, they issued a highly irregular decision without public consultation. It is disappointing and worrying to see trusted users exhibit such disrespect for the community which granted them their positions, and I urge them to recant. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 14:37, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think what transpired is that Carnildo was put up for RfA by <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">User:UninvitedCompany</a>. Word rapidly reached the members of ArbCom, sparking a discussion on what to do. Three members of ArbCom that voted to have Carnildo's sysop powers removed subsequent to the pedophilia userbox war came out in support of the RfA in the first day. As the RfA's time period waned, it became obvious that the RfA would not pass. Discussion ensued between some bureaucrats and some members of ArbCom on what to do. A decision was made to promote Carnildo, and use the closing RfA as the vehicle for doing so. I could be wrong in some of the above; it's speculation.</li>
<li>In my opinion, what should have happened is the RfA should have been allowed to fail. Subsequent to that, a case should have been submitted to ArbCom re-opening Carnildo's role in the pedophilia userbox war, to re-evaluate whether the desysopping should have been permanent, or temporarily suspended.</li>
<li>What should happen now, and so far (to my knowledge) has not happened is a full accounting of exactly what transpired. This is a highly controversial case, and transparency is being demanded by a number of users. If the case can not be presented in a convincing way that the community can support, then it would seem there would be basis for overturning the decision. Mistakes can and do happen. In the least, some statement by the bureaucrats as to why this case should or should not be a precedent for future considerations and what impact this decision has on future (and some would ask for) past RfAs should be made.</li>
<li>The bureaucrats didn't just make a controversial decision. They shattered the mold that RfA has held to for years. To date, this has been without satisfactory transparency or explanation. I am not going to say the bureaucrats made a mistake. I've been witholding personal judgement on that pending explanation by the bureaucrats. However, such explanation has not been forthcoming. This is...disappointing. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:50, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Durin's speculation as to the chain of events is interesting but not wholly accurate. Please note that Carnildo's nomination was offered by UninvitedCompany, a former Arbitrator and a member of and regular participant in the Arbitration Committee's private discussion list, the same as I. UC specifically raised the issue in our discussion list, and the matter was discussed at some length. UC's nomination was after this discussion and the Arbitration Committee was appraised of, and generally not opposed to the nomination, in advance of it being made. The nomination was not a surprise to the Committee, as Durin suggests. Several of us (acting as individuals, but with the gravity that a members or former member of the Committee has) deliberately supported the nomination early on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The decision to promote him was made by the three bureaucrats who claimed to make it. The Committee was not (as a whole) consulted on the question as to whether he should be promoted. One member of the Committee objected after the fact to the promotion, although that member's opinion appears (from the discussion that followed) to be a minority of one within the Committee. I was present for the tail end of the discussion to promote Carnildo, but by the time I joined the discussion the decision had been made; I played no role in that decision. I did not represent the ArbCom in that discussion. I am not, at this time, at liberty to name who else was present, although I will state that at least one member of the current ArbCom was present at the time I joined the discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is my belief that if the ArbCom were asked to consider whether Carnildo should be returned to sysop status, prior to the RfA, the Committee would likely have agreed to do so. Even after the RfA was completed, I believe the Committee would have done so. I believe that I am not alone in this evaluation of the Committee's likely action, and that any member of the Committee would likely come to the same conclusion after reasonable consideration. I believe the three bureaucrats who decided to promote Carnildo, were advised of this state of affairs by representative(s) of the Committee, and concluded that promoting Carnildo on their authority, rather that on the Arbitration Committee's, was in the best interests of the project at that time.</dd>

<dd>I see that someone above has made some starkly legalistic argument about bureaucrats and sysops not being delegated their authority from the Board and therefore restrained to act only as agents of consensus or some such folderol. That is, frankly, nonsense. Sysops and bureaucrats, as with all editors on the English Wikipedia, are charged to act in the best interests of the encyclopedia. Consensus is a tool we use to gauge the best interests of the project, but it is not an end in and of itself. I applaud these three bureaucrats for having the moxie to break from the stifling expectations of the pseudoconsensus that typically erupts from any given Request for Adminship and instead evaluate the broader picture and make a decision that reflects more than merely the shifting moods of a fickle and ill-informed populace. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:09, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I'm that someone. There is nothing "legalistic" (i.e, BS) about my position; community control of admins and b'crats is a core principle. B'crats do not have the power to decide who will be promoted to adminship or b'cratship; neither does ArbCom. Only the community has that power. ArbCom <i>does</i> have the power -- granted by an unsteady meld of community consensus and Board fiat -- to <i>deadmin</i>; they exercised that power in this case. Other admins involved in this case were temporarily deadminned; Carnildo was simply deadminned and invited to reapply in due time. That's all. ArbCom is out of this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a growing trend among admins to assert authority within this community. Yet it is a core principle of our community -- our social model -- that admins have no authority, only the responsibility to carry out community will. Their authority, such as it is, is strictly limited to understanding and interpreting general expressions of community will and applying them to specific cases. When the community speaks directly to a specific case, admins have <i>no</i> latitude to ignore us. I object in the strongest possible terms to the creeping arrogance infecting the admin group. This threatens to destroy the community and convert it into a hive of worker bees controlled by straw bosses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What goes for admins goes double for b'crats. The least sign of autocracy among the b'crat group must be stamped out, lest admins be promoted against community consensus who themselves lean toward autocracy. Consensus does <i>not</i> come before the encyclopedia; it is not a mere tool but a core principle of our little society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my last comment I called upon dissenting b'crats to come forth and so state. Kelly Martin is not a b'crat so I will not hold her to this higher standard of accountability. Now I call on <b>all b'crats</b> to formally state that they continue to serve community needs by acting in accordance with expressed community consensus. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 09:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Admins serve the encyclopaedia, not the community. They are charged with acting in the best interests of the encyclopaedia, not the community. The fact that they are selected by the community does not mean they have a community-given mandate which may be withdrawn as the community chooses. The community is merely expressing its view that the candidate concerned will be able to act in the best interests of the encyclopaedia; community consensus is meant to be a practical and pragmatic solution to the problem of selecting the best-qualified admins. Recall that prior to RfA, we selected admins only based on the views of a few people equivalent to 'crats. Today, for reasons of scalability, we have RfA.</dd>
<dd>If we must compare WP to a democracy, as some people seem to enjoy doing, let us recall that representatives in Congress/Parliament and the President/Prime Minister are not charged with enacting the will of the people, but doing what will best serve the people. Congressmen do not vote on motions as they think their constituents would, but vote as they think would best serve their constituents. The analogy breaks down, of course, when one considers that in a democracy, the government is subordinate to the will of the people. Wikipedia is not a democracy. It is closer to an encyclopaedia publishing company, and there is a clear hierarchy which must be followed. The fact that the shareholders elect the board of directors doesn't imply that the board of directors must hew to every whim and fancy of a majority of the shareholders. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I think we need to pull this back and constrain the discussion to bureaucrats and RfA. We've extended the discussion to be a debate about the entire project. This is really not the place for such a discussion.</li>
<li>There seems to be two sides to this; bureaucrats are charged with either (a) implementing the will of the community as expressed by the consensus garnering mechanism known as RfA or (b) acting in the best interests of the encyclopedia, even if that act is contrary to community will. At a guess, I would venture to say that the majority view is the former, and not the latter. There's the divide. The divide is further exacerbated in that the people who advocate (b) are generally regarding the opinions of the people who advocate (a) as worthless. Further, the people who advocate (a) regard the people who advocate (b) as power mongering and cabal creating people. Both sides are right, and both sides are wrong. At this juncture, neither side seems interested in the possibility of compromise. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:09, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, this is the usual division within Wikipedia: the division between the people who view Wikipedia as an encyclopedia being written by a community and the people who view Wikipedia as a community that happens to be at the moment writing an encyclopedia. The problem with the people in the second group is that the Wikimedia Foundation has a charter that really rather prohibits Wikipedia from turning into (for example) a K/S novel, no matter how much the community may wish for such a thing to happen. The encyclopedia is and will always be paramount, and any wishes the community should have, no matter how strongly held, that are inconsistent with that are simply wrong and must be ignored. The community is not empowered to decide to stop writing an encyclopedia; or, rather, if it should do so, it will no longer be welcome to participate in the project. We are all servants of the project, not of the community.</dd>

<dd>Every debate about the proper role of editors, including that administrators and bureaucrats, ends up being a reflection of this fundamental division.

<ul>
<li>Nobody is wishing it away. To conclude the people who advocate (a) as being in opposition to the goals of the project is improper. Both groups are interested in the success of the project.

<dd>No, you're wrong about that. People who advocate (a) are not committed to the project. They are committed to the community. The fact that the community at this time happens to be writing an encyclopedia is merely a coincidence, and if they are truly advocating (a), then they will happily go along when the community decides, by consensus, to instead change goals and start writing K/S fanfic. Now, you can, of course, argue that "well, of course the community will not do that", but that's not the point. The point is whether your committment is to the encyclopedia, or to the community. And I argue that the people advocating (a) are committed to the community and to whatever the community, in its ever-shifting moods, decides it feels like doing, rather than inerrantly committed to writing an encyclopedia no matter what butterfly the community decides to chase this week. And to that extent I am convinced that the people advocating (a) are not merely simply wrong but actually harmful; not only do they dilute our focus and encourage us to waste time on irrelevancies, but generate friction when they refuse to allow the car to be steered back on the road simply because the community has decided to go drive off after pretty flowers. Simply put, the people advocating (a) are only committed to writing an encyclopedia because currently the community still has something of a consensus for doing so. However, that consensus is fading fast and will continue to fade as the community grows.</dd>

There's a segment that is writing a sports gazetter (masquerading as encyclopedic coverage). There are segments that are writing a social networking site. I shouldn't be surprised to find out that there's a segment somewhere that is writing interactive fiction somewhere in some corner of Wikipedia. Our community is absolutely not unified in its desire to write an encyclopedia. Anyone who thinks it is simply is not paying attention, or is stuck in 2003 (when there really was such a consensus).</dd>

<p>It is helpful that a knowledgeable participant has shed some light on the murky internal machinations behind the recent debacle, rather that us being left to speculate for ourselves. From <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>'s first reply above, it looks like she is saying that the ArbCom had decided that Carnildo should be re-admined, and thought the RFA process was the least painful way to achieve it (the alternative being to recind part of an earlier ArbCom decision). Certain former and current members of ArbCom piled on the support votes "in a personal capacity", but with their customary "gravity", to achieve that result. When the RFA went pear-shaped, there was a discussion between certain bureaucrats and certain members of the ArbCom, informing the bureaucrats that the ArbCom would be minded to re-admin Carnildo anyway, at which point the bureaucrats decided bite the bullet to re-admin him, notwithstanding that the balance of opinions expressed in the RFA fell outside the usual range within which they would, based on past practice, have decided that there was consensus for the RFA to pass.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an application of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, with the ArbCom and bureaucrats know the "right thing" when they see it; perhaps the views of current and former members of the ArbCom have a heavier weight (or "gravity", should I say) that us common-or-garden peons; perhaps this is just an exceptional case and no conclusions should be drawn from it.</p>

<dd>I've been active here for a shorter time than most who will be reading here, but I have to comment on what's been written above, although I'm not sure whether this essay belongs here or not, but it was spurred by Kelly's comments so I'll go ahead here.</dd>
<dd>From what I have seen since I've been here and what I've read of past disputes and decisions, on balance "the community" has gotten a lot more right than it's gotten wrong. I define "the community" here as the group of people who participate in both the article-writing and the decision-making functions -- the people who <i>are</i> writing the encyclopedia while also participating in some of the meta-decisions about how it should be written. There are times when leadership is needed, and there have been times on AN/I when I (a non-admin but an interested bystander) have commented that a given sensitive situation is something that should be resolved off-wiki. Those situations exist, and mechanisms are needed for dealing with them, but they are rare.</dd>
<dd>On balance, community decision-making means decision-making by those users who care to participate in a given process. Those who choose not to participate are putting their trust, generally safely, in those who do. I don't participate, for example, in choosing featured pictures. That doesn't mean that I am indifferent to whether the picture on tomorrow's main page will be attractive and informative or ugly and useless; it means that I think there are other users more qualified than I to make, and more interested than I in making, that particular decision. I don't seek to participate in bot approvals, because I know nothing about the technical aspects of bots. On the other hand, I do participate in RfA, because I believe that my individual abilities lead me to be able to provide useful comments in that particular arena. People say that there isn't enough participation in RfA, but I don't think we want one million casual users weighing in on admin candidates -- nor do we want them chosen by a small committee. Editors who are choosing featured articles, or commenting on AfD's, or just to do their editing, have made their own choice about where their talents and interests lie.</dd>
<dd>I will also mention in passing that I've seen no evidence that we have a problem with people becoming administrators "because it's cool." To be sure, users may spend their time in areas such as XfD and RC patrol because participation there is significant to many RfA voters; I've debated whether I wish to be an admin at some point (I'm not sure), and I know that if I do, I will have to get involved in those areas even though they are far from the major contributions I can make to this encyclopedia with my own interests and abilities. But the net result, if my efforts were to be redirected in those directions, would be that I would be attending to responsibilities where the encyclopedia needs more resources. Who's to say that pushing the type of intensive user who is considering adminship in those directions is a bad thing. Similarly, I disagree with 1FA voters but if the net result of their position is more FA's, I don't see that as a threat to the project.</dd>
<dd>The distinction between "the community" and "the encyclopedia" may have a kernel of truth to it, but as it's been presented, it is an entirely false dichotomy, and needlessly divisive. I think of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia that is written by a community -- a community that I am proud to be a part of, that is working together in a grand experiment of volunteer effort to do something that has never been done before. Building such an effort requires teamwork, comeraderie, and a sense that the participants are valued and, collectively, have significant input into the future of the enterprise. It also requires, as Jimbo recently noted, that the contributors be having fun.</dd>
<dd>One individual decision, on a promotion or anything else, is insignificant in the bigger picture, and I have not joined with anyone who's claimed that if the bureaucrats are allowed to do X or the community doesn't overrule decision Y, the project is worthless and we must all down tools. I'm willing to accept that once in awhile, there may be something that the rank-and-file users don't know. But if highly experienced members of the project, who esteem themselves and present themselves as leaders, proclaim that support for the general principle of community decision-making is a rejection of the project of writing an encyclopedia, I suggest that they could not be more wrong. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:03, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, maybe. You are right in what you say, that in the end we can't have a cabal running things, but actually I think most people may have forgotten that adminship "should be no bog deal". If Carnildo abuses the tools - and he will be watched like a hawk - then the tools will surely be withdrawn again, just as we allow tendentious editors to be unblocked and have a second chance, but we block them if they abuse the privilege. I see plenty of possible benefit to the project from Carnildo being able to delete images. Carnildo is one of the best-informed in regard to copyright issues, and most copyight violators have no intention of paying our nlegal bills if their invalid fair-use claim gets us sued. I don't see much <i>disbenefit</i> of Carnildo having the sysop bit. Not now the userbox wars are over. So: give Carnildo a second chance.

<p>I agree with Tony Sidaway and indeed I'll strengthen it: We <i>do</i> and even <i>must</i> trust b'crats to implement community consensus. Perhaps Tony and I part ways over his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_is_not_a_vote_177f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship is not a vote">essay</a>; I read it as a call to give b'crats greater latitude, which I do not endorse. But I do agree that RfA is not a vote and b'crats need to use wise discretion in sorting the puppets from the people. That said, there is a certain standard set for promotion. With obvious puppets discounted and reasonable participation, RfA outcomes above a certain percentage pretty much demand promotion; RfAs below a <i>lower</i> threshold forbid it. It is <b>only within the gray area</b> between thresholds that we ask b'crats to go <i>beyond</i> combating "election fraud" and make a close call.</p>
<p>The particular RfA that sparked this thread fell well under acceptable limits for promotion. The fact that ArbCom members lobbied in favor <i>contaminates</i> the discussion, rather than enhances it. That is to say, the suspicion of undue influence requires the closing b'crat to cast a particularly critical eye on an outcome so weighted.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompeia_Sulla_3620.html" title="Pompeia Sulla">Pompeia Sulla</a>. Precisely because b'crats are entrusted with such an important privilege and with the community mandate to exercise it with discretion, no b'crat can afford to appear biased or subject to pressure from <i>any</i> direction. Admin promotions come at the behest of our community <i>only</i>.</p>
<p>No personal offense intended, but remarks such as <i>We are all servants of the project, not of the community</i> make me shudder.</p>
<p>Each one of us <i>in his role as editor</i> is a servant of the <b>encyclopedia project</b> and I hope that no experienced editor will disagree. We have many different viewpoints on just what an encyclopedia may be; personally, I say that the word itself is becoming self-referential, since for most purposes, Wikipedia is the only general-reference encyclopedia most human beings will ever use. But that's another topic. Those of us fortunate enough to have spent considerable time with printed, bound, multi-volume encyclopedias have a very clear idea what is meant by the word and we hope to pass this value along to the next generation of editors. It is a core value, a foundation issue, and absolutely non-negotiable -- although very difficult to define.</p>
<p>The Board serves our project directly and is empowered to ignore our community, for good or ill. Jimbo is above any law, at present. Those of us who have been promoted to positions of trust -- admins and b'crats -- <i>do not serve our project</i> in these capacities. They serve our community; our community serves our project. There is no value conflict whatever.</p>
<p>The danger is that our trusted servants may decide to serve our project directly, bypassing our community. This is in direct conflict with <b>Sidaway's law of Wikipedia:</b> <i>Wikipedia is cleverer than you are.</i> We do our best to elevate our wisest members but b'crats are still flawed humans. We trust them to interpret and implement community consensus. We <b>do not trust</b> them to be smarter than our community as a whole.</p>

<dd>Seconded. It is notable that the discussion on one side seems to be led by Tony (and, to a lesser extent, Kelly), neither of whom is a bureaucrat, whereas the bureaucrats have remained almost silent.

<dd>I've added a section heading here, to improve continued editing. I disagree with your assertions that the Admins and Bureaucrats serve the community and not the project directly, nor do I feel it conflicts with <i>Wikipeida is cleverer than you are.</i> In fact, it's precisely that reason I trust them in the positions they're in to act for the project first and community second. I don't believe their actions, even the Bureacrats, are completly irreversible - which is the underlying flexability of Wikipedia which allows it to survive. Whilst flawed humans they may be, they're not without oversight, so I don't expect them to outthink the community as a whole - I don't expect anyone to, even Jimbo.</dd>

<dd>The historical role of bureaucrats is to promote candidates for adminship when authorized to do so by the community. Speaking from a standpoint of roles, <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed Poor</a> was the first to do this, and carried out his responsibilities for a considerable span of time using SQL queries before a user interface was constructed and the term "bureaucrat" applied. As such, the role predates RFA, it predates voting and percentage thresholds, and predates consensus (the original standard being no significant objections). I don't think the role has changed significantly, though it has been formalized, and the community has made the means by which it authorizes promotion clearer and more objective. The role has expanded somewhat with time, in that bureaucrats now are the sole closers of RFAs, and the matter of bots and name changes has been added. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 04:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of months ago I called for the bureaucrats to suspend RfA. I'm renewing that call. I am asking all bureaucrats to refrain from promoting new admins until such time as the community develops a process for promoting admins that isn't broken. The current process is too capable of promoting unqualified candidates, excludes qualified candidates for thoroughly irrelevant reasons, and often generates hostility and bad blood. But as long as it functions at all, there's no incentive to change it. An agreement by the bureaucrats to suspend promotions would force the community to actually deal with the issue, instead of blithely ignoring it. The Sean Black and Carnildo RfAs are great examples.</p>
<p>At least give it some thought. Don't dismiss it out of hand, the way you did last time. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 08:15, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>strongly agree</b> that RfA is broken and that it needs replacement. I <b>strongly disagree</b> that <i>this</i> is the place to propose turning it "off".

It is the job of the <i>community</i> to determine the best interest of the project by making arguments and weighing each other's arguments during the discussion. The job of bureaucrats is strictly to follow community consensus. Of course, they cannot do so by mechanically counting supports and opposes, but must watch carefully for sockpuppets and other consensus-obscuring factors. And of course, bureaucrats are part of the community too, and in their role as community members, may participate in the discussion themselves. But in their role as bureaucrats, when deciding whether to promote, they are bound by the community's will. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 16:23, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's also keep in mind that the sampling on RfA is not very reliably a "consensus" of the community. The largest RfA I've seen had some 175 votes. There are over 10,000 active editors on the English Wikipedia. Frankly, I think a sampling of less than 2% of the community can't really be characterized as a "consensus". I know that I don't participate in RfA not because I think it's unimportant or that I don't care, but because I find the toxicity of RfA sufficiently unpleasant that I don't want anything to do with it. My opinion is not counted because I find the process unpleasantly repulsive, not because I don't care. I wonder how many other editors are avoiding RfA because they find the process distasteful; I doubt I'm the only one. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 17:28, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Consensus on Wikipedia—about an article, an adminship, or anything else—rarely involves a sizeable percentage of active editors. In practice, because RfA is open to the community, the consensus of editors in a discussion is taken as a proxy for the consensus of the community. It's true that sampling irregularities can skew the result, and bureaucrats must watch carefully for such consensus-obscuring factors. But their job remains to gauge and implement community consensus.</dd>

<dd>To address Tony's example, different people have different standards of suitability for adminship. If community consensus is to promote, then the candidate is suitable in the eyes of a large majority, and unsuitable only in the view of a small minority. In that case the closing bureaucrat may indeed promote. In fact, that commonly happens. If the bureaucrat decides instead to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> and not promote, then they must answer to the community for doing so. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 21:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

An alternative to this would be for bureaucrats to routinely close out RFAs in a more conscientious manner, instead of just counting up sacks of me-toos from the RFA groupies.

My point is <i>not</i> that they're not conscientious (they are), but that perhaps routinely increasing the amount of work being put into closes, distinguishing good reasons for oppose or support from poor ones, listing editors who contributions are against the spirit of RfA (such as those who always vote support), might be an alternative to Kelly's proposal.

<dd>Angela, I certainly do not believe that the bureaucrats are acting unconscientiously. Rather, I think the current structure of RfA itself engenders harm to Wikipedia, and that bureaucrats should refuse to participate in it in order to put an end to that harm. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there's consensus (that word again!) that there are times RfA isn't working smoothly, though no consensus at all about how to improve it. But this suggestion is not a solution to anything. We have a pending RfA in which the <s>votes</s> expressions of opinion are running something like 90 to 0. Are you suggesting that the closing 'crat should refuse to promote, in a clear case where RfA worked fine, to draw attention to the fact that in other cases it doesn't?

<dd>Kelly's suggestion was that the bureaucrats "refrain from promoting new administrators" and "suspend promotions" until the RfA process is revised, to "force the community" to come up with a new process. If that is done, then even the uncontroversial promotions in cases where there's no dispute about application of the RfA process at all will be held up. I still don't see the value to that. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 15:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of the "uncontroversial" candidates are uncontroversial because nobody asks the right questions.

<p>Kelly, closing the RFA is not the best solution. I agree with you that the RFA has become a mess, and the quality of admins in the past are much better than some of the present day ones. So why is this happening? I have a few thoughts: Well, power corrupts and as the size of admins increases it's becoming more of a cabal and we find many users shooting down valid candidates on really flimsy reasons. I've noticed that the RFAs that have the highest chances of passing are the ones which have been nominated by well known wikipedians. Calling and end to the process without proposed solutions is certainly not the best way to move ahead. Why don't you give 'crats the mandate some more elbow room in subjectivity? Either way if we go ahead (as Splash has put it above), we're accused of being partial or not considering 'legitimate' concerns. My concerns are mainly the fact that if just *one* well known user objects, you're going to get a whole army of mechanical "nodders" agreeing with the editor, without going in the reasons why the candidate may have acted in that fashion and the opposer could be wrong. What do we do then? I know that the candidate may have just got a little hot one incident, so can it be integrated for all instances in the future? I certainly don't feel so, but if we do promote, there are accusations of us having ulterior motives and what not. Please do suggest some alternatives before calling for a suspended session. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 18:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here’s an alternative that makes sense to me. Most of the comments/concerns are centered around voting and unreasonable oppose rational, and many are suggesting giving Bureaucrats more discretionary power. Instead of turning RFA off, why don’t we try something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_Adminship#Proposal:_RFA_is_not_a_vote-_Tony.27s_section_on_RFA_talk_today" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_Adminship#Proposal:_RFA_is_not_a_vote-_Tony.27s_section_on_RFA_talk_today" rel="nofollow">this</a> for the next 5 nominations?

<dd>Having contributed to the current language, I'd like to say that I consider it a reflection of the existing system and not a license to expand bureaucrat discretion. In my opinion bureaucrat discretion is and should be narrowly construed except when exceptional circumstances exist. It is important to the sense of community involvement and fairness that the closing of average/normal RFAs be handled in a way that is transparent and predictable. Also, I would be very dissappointed in any Bureaucrat who felt that RFA should be suspended in the absence of a community mandate to do so. Bureaucrats are trusted to implement community standards and expectations; they are not empowered to force their own views upon the community. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 19:44, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The brokenness of RfA is directly connected to our failure to communicate our core values to new editors. This is such a massive failure that most of us are unwilling to address it in the whole. Indeed, this may be impossible; perhaps all we can do is chip away on the edges. The explosion of policy proposals is another effect of an influx of editors who are poorly informed or unwilling to uphold core principles and foundation issues. This failure threatens to overshadow every other issue.</p>
<p>The UBX war is a case in point. Some anti-boxers feel that pro-boxers are only amusing themselves or that they come here in order to shove their biases in total disregard of neutrality. Unfortunately, far too many kiddie editors are here for just such purposes and they do create and use kiddie boxes to serve these ends. My personal belief is that <i>sometimes</i> UBX serve important social roles; they act as a social binder, an occasional lubricant, and are a practical tool for <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reputation_management.html" title="Reputation management">reputation management</a> -- they are small change in our <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ReputationEconomics" class="extiw" title="meatball:ReputationEconomics">reputation economy</a>. However, this viewpoint of mine is overshadowed by the hordes of kiddie editors slapping kiddie boxes everywhere <i>because we can and it's free speech, man</i>. The discussion of whether UBX serve community needs, thus indirectly but importantly serving the project, has tended to degenerate into the question of how to deal with kiddie boxes. Those of us trying to promote a moderate policy are caught in the crossfire between flesh-eating zombies and exhausted, embattled shooters.</p>
<p>Thus, our community has been infected with two opposing camps of internal enemies. The first are those who join up and start editing without any grasp of core values -- and who are taught all the wrong lessons and none of the right ones. The second are editors who understand these core values all too well but who, in reaction to the first, determine to abandon some values in order to protect others. When one group or the other have killed out all the moderates (<i>if you're not with us, you're against us</i>), there will be nothing left except total war and destruction of the project. Choose your nightmare: MyWiki, NuNupedia, BoardWar, Invasion of the Lawyers, WP Brand Inc., or Jimbo Goes Postal.</p>
<p>I do not have a solution to this most pressing of all issues. <i><b>Sorry.</b></i> Heck, I'll admit it: I <i>do</i> consider myself smarter than the average monkey. But this has me stumped. I tend to think that our foundation principles are internally inconsistent, that at least one <i>must</i> be abandoned to accommodate inevitables. But I also suspect that to remove even one such brick will be to bring the whole house down. I just don't know.</p>
<p>So long as editors in general either do not embrace core values or willfully abandon them, naturally admins will do no better -- and a lifetime of experience tells me that bad apples tend to float up in hierarchies. No method of promoting admins can draw gold from straw.</p>
<p>I do not think RfA can be fixed. I think it works <i>now</i> as well as it can <i>now</i>. If this failure to communicate our core values to new editors -- to attract and retain editors who share core values -- is reversed into success, then existing process will start working again. If this failure persists and worsens, then it really doesn't matter what else we do. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 02:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well put. Clearly there needs to be a better process for RfA than the one that is in place now (there seems to be community consensous for a change), however, how to go about re-factoring RfA is probably not going to be an easy nor agreeable task. // <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pilotguy</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF">Have your say</font></a>) 20:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ha ha, Pilotguy. You say my comment is "well put" but then you go on to disagree and say RfA can and should be fixed. No offense taken or, I hope, given; I can see the other side, too. But I'm afraid that any fix will, by the law of unintended consequences, do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I'm wary even of floating ideas (<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>) but I can think of a few band-aid fixes that might allow the current situation to stagger along for a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make RfA a straight vote with explicit suffrage requirements. I like 1 month. Forbid discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make it a secret ballot, so nobody can earn brown-nose points for supporting candidates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create Wikipedia:Requests for Deadminship. 'Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deadmin (and de-b'crat) <i>everyone</i>. Let Jimbo and the Board choose 3 b'crats to their own taste. For a limited period of time -- say, 1 month -- allow these new b'crats to elevate anybody to adminship they personally feel worthy. This new class of admins is limited to, say, 100 members. When this class fills or the free time frame elapses, we simply return to the old system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Establish the rule that new admins are always temporary; at the end of the (3 month?) term they are automatically deadminned...
<ul>
<li>... and cannot reapply for adminship for another year. <b>OR</b></li>
<li>... unless they pass a <i>second</i> confirmation evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Abolish elevation-by-merit or by discussion. Admin all editors who maintain some minimum level of contribs for 1 year without getting blocked for more than a day or two or being banned by ArbCom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dissolve RfA as a page and as a process. Create a subpage for <i>every</i> user, e.g, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_Review_4d6e.html" title="User:John Reid/Review">User:John Reid/Review</a>. Encourage all editors to comment on this editor's performance <i>there</i>. When an editor feels this page looks favorable "enough", let him apply directly to any b'crat for elevation. Same general guidelines for elevation but there is no open or close time. Editors who whine and repeatedly reapply pointlessly are hung by their thumbs from Main Gate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create a secret guideline that prevents anyone from becoming an admin who has <i>never</i> been blocked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class of admin-candidates. These do not get any special new powers but are required to serve under the mentorship of an existing admin for 3 months, during which they do dog work. The mentor gets a veto at RfA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Require admins to prove legal majority. Seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I get any more wacky ideas, I'll add them later. But I really don't think any of these will bring lasting improvement. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 01:03, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If RfA is suspended, it will be viewed by some elements in the community as the existing corps of Admins trying to close ranks and prevent anyone new from joining them. I'm not saying that I believe that this is the intention of the suggestion to suspend RfA - just that it will be perceived this way in some quarters. That will lead to immense pressure for a new system to be devised and implemented extremely quickly - and thus may well lead to a poorly thought-out new system which may well have more problems than the exitising one. If someone has a clear proposal on how to replace the existing RfA system, they should put it up for discussion like any new process proposal. And the existing system should stay in place until a clear decision on how to replace it is reached. In the meantime, discussing the vague idea of replacing the system without a proper proposed alternative is getting us nowhere. Utimately any new system is probably only going to draw the active involevment of a small percentage of users. If those are the only users who take an active interest in the role of adminship and evaluating the people who wish to hold that position, I don't see that as a problem. At least the people who are involved take it seriously. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 00:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think the occasional bad admin has really much to do with problems at the RFA stage. There are people who have turned out to be (in my opinion) unsuitable admins who got a unanimous pass at RFA. Furthermore RFA was <i>right</i> in giving them a unanimous pass because up to then they hadn't shown any indication that they would be problematic. No process on earth can detect problems before they actually occur.</p>
<p>I do think we could do with some RFA simplification. For example I like the way we do things over at no: There are certain minimum requirements before someone can be nominated and there are certain (very generous) suffrage requirements. After that it's a simple straightforward up-or-down vote on the candidate - if she gets &gt;75% of valid votes (and no-one is shy in calling them votes) a bureaucrat gives her the bit. It's simple, fair and cordial. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 12:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A refreshingly interesting idea. Adminship is, after all, meant to be "not a big deal" (I think the "big deal" in the recent cases arise mostly from people's surprise that their clear understanding of a mature process was apparently quite mistaken).</p>

<dd>There was a "vote for deadmin" structure on&#160;:no: which was used a couple of times but it has fallen into disuse and was removed from the process pages on the understanding that rogue admins were so rare that they were better handled on a case-by-case basis than through a standardized process.

<li>Certainly... on the Dutch wiki, it works like this: Suffrage for candidate = 3 months, 300 edits. Suffrage for voters = 1 month, 100 edits. Strict vote, 75% support required to pass. Adminship is subject to yearly reconfirmation via the same procedure <i>but only</i> if there are significant objections to the admin.</li>
<li>German wiki: suffrage for nominator = 2 months, 200 edits; it is implied that suffrage for voting is likewise, whereas suffrage for candidate is "significantly more than that". Strict vote, 67% suport required to pass. Lengthy comments and rebuttals are strictly discouraged. Wheel warring or breach of protection policy is grounds for <i>immediate</i> deopping, which is temporary while the community decides how to deal with the person. Aside from that, in case of substantial complaints against an admin (for abuse or incivility), a motion can be made to deop the admin for up to three months. In a strict vote, the admin needs 67% support to not lose his privileges.</li>

<dd>What you've proposed is pretty much what I did for one when that happened. Once there's an open request for username change, that name is taken as of then in my mind.

<dd>Thank you for the note. I'm adding another step in assessing a request: if the name is taken, and if the circumstances justify it, I will check the new account log, and if it turns out that the account was created shortly after the request was made, I will consider it to be an attempt to disrupt Wikipedia (and probably to pester the users requesting renames) and deal with it accordingly. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

One of the editors who has supported the candidate has been campaigning for the candidate. In particular he is attempting to rally white supremacists in favor of the candidate; see particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mitsos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81782886" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mitsos&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81782886" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit.

So have fun with your adminliness again, and have a re-read through the policies to catch back up on them please. Also, would you consider restoring your talk archives? I reallize they are in the history, but for ease, etc. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks very much. I will make sure I'm caught up on everything, and I've already seen that a few things have changed (all for the better, from what I've seen). The talk page archives are restored, and of course I took off the bit about not being an admin.

<p>I was directed to here from the Admin Incidents Noticeboard.</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that someone has created an account using my real life name (Adam Gawronski) and proceeded to vandilise the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Pius_X_College_c407.html" title="St Pius X College">St Pius X College</a> article with offensive edits. Although these have since been reverted, the username (and hence my real name) still exists in the history. As you can imagine, I do not wish to have these comments under my name as they can be used against me even though I am not at fault. It appears that the same has happened under the username Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire (<a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_9192.html" title="User talk:Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_3f9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">contribs</a>), which is in fact the real name of a staff member at the school. As these users are both 'joke' users, obviously created exclusively with the intention of vandalising the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Pius_X_College_c407.html" title="St Pius X College">St Pius X College</a> article I do not believe that prior warning is required / would have any effect.</p>
<p>I would request that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire (<a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_9192.html" title="User talk:Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leonie_Miller_-_St_Pius_X_Administrator_Extraordinaire_3f9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leonie Miller - St Pius X Administrator Extraordinaire">contribs</a>) and Adam Gawronski (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adam_Gawronski_f01b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adam Gawronski">contribs</a>) have their names changed so they are not impersonating anyone then blocked (so that their names do not appear in the history of the article, as I gather that deleting history of an article / deleting evidence of specific posts is not permitted/possible).</li>
<li>I would then request to have my current username Gawronski (<a href="../../../g/a/w/User_talk%7EGawronski_2fc0.html" title="User talk:Gawronski">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gawronski_bf47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gawronski">contribs</a>) changed to Adam Gawronski to protect my online identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankyou for your consideration. Gawronski 02:53, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both accounts reverted and blocked, they just need a bureaucrat to perform the rename. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 02:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thankyou very much for your quick reply. If you require specific names to rename to, you can use SPX Contributor1 and SPX Contributor2. Gawronski 03:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the "Adam G." account has been blocked, it can't edit again, so there's no need to change your username to protect it, though you certainly still can if you want to. The bad edits can be deleted from history by any administrator (meaning that thereafter only administrators could see them), or even oversighted by a bureaucrat with Oversight access (meaning not even admins could see them). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:23, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a note that apparently some bureaucrats have volunteered to be involved in enforcing this mechanism.</p>
<p>"Administrator recall" and related proposals have all been overwhelmingly rejected by the community whenever they are voted upon. The present list is tolerated only because it is voluntary, both from the standpoint of one's inclusion in it and from the standpoint that currently, any actual desysopping must be requested of the stewards by the admin being desysopped.</p>
<p>I see the present direction as being an end-run around community consensus on both fronts. Admins are being pressured to agree to be "open to recall" in the course of the RFA process, and there is this effort to make the "recall" process itself enforced by us. This is policymaking by fiat and should be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>One thing we all should have learned from the Kelly Martin fiasco is that there are a number of very active editors, who meet any reasonable numeric threshold for sufferage in such votes, who dislike substantially all admins as a group, and who will support any recall-related petition even when its merits are weak.</p>

<dd>If you look at the statement in general, it is fairly clear it is correct. There are users that have stated they feel that way.

<dd>No it's not fairly clear that it's correct. What people are you talking about? I can't think of any.

<dd>I clarified there what I had said. His version was a little different, and above yours seems a little more so. But thats fine. I don't see where admins are being pressured to join the category, and if they are, it should be noted it has not gained consensus. Agree with your last point in general. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
