<p><i>Burnt Offerings</i> continues the adventures of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Anita Blake">Anita Blake</a>, as she attempts to solve a series of arsons and other crimes, and deal with a threat to her lover, the <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#Vampires" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">vampire</a> <a href="../../../v/a/m/Undead_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_525b.html#Jean-Claude" title="Undead characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Jean-Claude</a>, as he fends off a political challenge from the <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Vampire Council</a>. As with the other later novels in the series, <i>Burnt Offerings</i> blends elements of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural_fiction.html" title="Supernatural fiction">supernatural</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_procedural.html" title="Police procedural">police procedural</a>, and <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_literature.html" title="Erotic literature">erotic</a> fiction.</p>

<p>As with previous novels, "Burnt Offerings" refers to a location within the novel itself. In this case, "Burnt Offerings" is a vampire-themed <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_restaurant.html" title="Theme restaurant">theme restaurant</a> where some of the events of the novel take place. (The fictional restaurant is itself named after the real-world 1976 haunted house movie, <i><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Offerings_%28film%29_8c36.html" title="Burnt Offerings (film)">Burnt Offerings</a></i>.)</p>

<p>As in the previous novels, <i>Burnt Offerings</i> requires Anita to balance her romantic life with her roles as supernatural police consultant, vampire executioner, zombie animator, human servant and lover to the vampire <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#Vampire_society" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">Master of the City</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Lupa" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">lupa</a> to the local werewolf pack. In this case, Anita is quickly confronted with several problems that ultimately prove to be interrelated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Captain <b>Pete McKinnon</b> wants Anita's help with a series of <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arson</a> incidents that he believes to be the work of a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#pyrokinetics" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">pyrokinetic</a>.</li>
<li>The local <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Wereleopards" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">wereleopard</a> pard needs leadership and protection after Anita killed its "alpha," <a href="../../../v/a/m/Lycanthrope_Characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_724d.html#Gabriel" title="Lycanthrope Characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Gabriel</a> in the previous novel, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Killing_Dance_%28novel%29_d4ca.html" title="The Killing Dance (novel)"><i>The Killing Dance</i></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Thronos_Rokke" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">Thronos Rokke</a> pack of werewolves needs clear succession and protection, particularly while <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Zeeman_c8da.html" title="Richard Zeeman">Richard</a> is out of town studying for his master's degree.</li>
<li>A vampire has been set on fire at the vampire owned and themed restaurant, "<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Offerings_%28novel%29_ed9f.html#Explanation_of_the_novel.27s_title" title="Burnt Offerings (novel)">Burnt Offerings</a>." The woman who did so claims that the vampire tried to bite her against her will, and alleges self defense. This attack later proves to be the first in a series of attacks on vampires and vampire businesses.</li>
<li>Most threatening, the <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Vampire Council</a> has sent representatives to Jean-Claude's territory in an attempt to investigate and possibly destroy Jean-Claude. The Council is threatened by Jean-Claude's ability to destroy one of its most powerful members, <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Mister_Oliver" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">The Earthmover</a>, and by Jean-Claude's refusal to take The Earthmover's place on the Council himself. (Jean-Claude will not do so because he is not strong enough to hold the position against challengers; but the Council, based in Europe, fears that Jean-Claude is setting up a rival council in the United States). The Council has sent representatives of four of its six remaining members, as follows:
<ul>
<li>Council member <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#The_Traveler" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">The Traveler</a> has arrived personally, or at least in spirit (one of his powers is the ability to possess other vampires, and the location of his actual body is never revealed). The Traveler is accompanied by <b>Balthasar</b>, his <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#human_servant" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">human servant</a>, and has also recruited one of Jean-Claude's vampires, <a href="../../../v/a/m/Undead_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_525b.html#Liv" title="Undead characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Liv</a>, to leave Jean-Claude's service and swear fealty to the Traveler.</li>
<li>Council member the <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Padma" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Master of Beasts</a> has arrived personally, accompanied by his son, <b>Fernando</b> and the other members of his <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#triumvirate" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">triumvirate</a>, <b>Gideon</b> and <b>Captain Thomas Carswell.</b></li>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Belle_Morte" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Belle Morte</a> does not come personally, but is represented by <a href="../../../v/a/m/Asher_%28Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter%29_6af0.html" title="Asher (Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter)">Asher</a>, Jean-Claude's former lover and current mortal enemy.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Morte_d.27Amour" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Morte d'Amour</a> is represented by the vampires <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Yvette" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Yvette</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Warrick" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Warrick</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anita is forced to put the mysteries aside as she participates in a series of confrontations between Jean-Claude's followers and the council. Ultimately, Anita's combination of loyalty, ruthlessness, and naiveté allows her to triumph over each of the delegations of vampires.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Master of Beasts and Fernando attempt to seize control of as many of the city's lycanthropes as possible, but are ultimately stopped by Anita, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Zeeman_c8da.html" title="Richard Zeeman">Richard</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/m/Lycanthrope_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_44ea.html#Rafael" title="Lycanthrope characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Rafael</a>. Anita assumes control of the leopard pard and fully assumes her role as <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Lupa" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">lupa</a>, rescuing all of the local shapeshifters with Richard and Jean-Claude's help, but not before the Master of Beasts, Fernando, and Liv torture Rafael and Fernando and Liv torture and rape Sylvie and <a href="../../../v/a/m/Lycanthrope_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_44ea.html#Vivian" title="Lycanthrope characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Vivian</a>.</li>
<li>Anita shares Jean-Claude's love for Asher, notwithstanding Asher's scars and his hatred of them both. Ultimately, their love wins Asher over, and he decides to leave Belle Morte's service and remain in St. Louis with Anita and Jean-Claude.</li>
<li>Anita offers friendship to the Traveler, and challenges him to be a worthy ruler when she discovers that his power is causing local vampires to become feral. Intrigued, he accepts.</li>
<li>As she and Richard confront the Master of Beasts a second time, the Master lets Anita get too close. Anita draws on the power of <a href="../../../v/a/m/Lycanthrope_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_44ea.html#Raina_Wallis" title="Lycanthrope characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Raina</a>'s <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Munin" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">munin</a>, using Raina's powers to threaten harm rather than healing. With the Master's heart in her metaphysical grip, Anita threatens to kill him unless the Master leaves St. Louis and turns over Liv and Fernando to suffer the punishment for raping a member of Anita's werewolf pack. The Master is loath to give up his son, but ultimately agrees, and Anita turns Liv and Fernando over to Sylvie and the pack, winning their loyalty as their <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html#Lupa" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">lupa</a>.</li>
<li>Yvette then reveals her plan, solving the remaining mysteries. Like <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Mister_Oliver" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Mister Oliver</a> before him, Yvette's master, <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Morte_d.27Amour" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Morte d'Amour</a>, fears the US experiment with vampire legalization and wishes to sabotage it. Yvette, together with <b>Harry</b>, the owner of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Offerings_%28novel%29_ed9f.html#Explanation_of_the_novel.27s_title" title="Burnt Offerings (novel)">Burnt Offerings</a>, has been provoking <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#Anti-vampire_groups" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">Humans First</a> to attack vampires and vampire businesses, and plans for Asher to kill Jean-Claude, seize control of the city's vampires, and provoke them into a murderous rampage. Asher, won over by Jean-Claude and Anita, refuses. Yvette then reveals her back-up plan -- at her instructions, <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Warrick" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Warrick</a>, a <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#General_master_level_powers" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">pyrokinetic</a>, has been setting the arson fires, and will burn down a stadium full of people. Warrick, a former <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusader</a>, announces that he has rediscovered his faith in God and refuses to assist Yvette. Yvette then announces that she personally will go on a rampage, but is stopped by Warrick, who uses his powers to burn both Yvette and himself to ash.</li>
