<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Brian raabe1998card2.jpg. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Iekessinger.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BurmaShaver_72b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/BurmaShaver">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. If you have any questions please ask them at the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Media copyright questions page</a>.

<p>Hello, I notice that you have been adding pictures of baseball cards to articles. Baseball cards do not fall under the fair use category.

<p>Hey there, the above article was tagged for speedy deletion as an implausible typo, and I deleted it as such. However, in looking through the history there is still a lot of content that got deleted with it, and I was wondering where this content should belong--if it was copy and pasted from somewhere, if you need it in your userspace, etc. Please reply either here or on my talk page.

<p>Hi, you seem to be continuing to upload baseball cards and putting them into articles for the players. As said above, baseball cards do not qualify for fair use outside of commentary about the card. More information at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FU">WP:FU#Counterexamples</a>, and in discussions at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Archive_2_2d11.html#Fair_use_of_baseball_cards_images" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Archive 2">Wikipedia talk:Fair_use/Archive 2#Fair use of baseball cards images</a>.</p>
<p>In general baseball cards do not fall under fair use because the copyright is still held by Topps, Fleer, Upper Deck, etc. Posting images of their cards would probably be considered to be in violation of their copyright. Older baseball card from the 1800's early part of the 20th century can sometimes be used as the images have fallen into the public domain because of their age.</p>
<p>I will start working on removing the incorrect copyright tags on the images and they will soon be deleted. <strike>However, if you continue to upload baseball card images, you will be blocked.</strike> Sorry, I read your response at <a href="../../../n/o/_/User_talk%7ENo_Guru_6323.html" title="User talk:No Guru">User talk:No Guru</a>, and I was way too harsh with you. I do think that policy is clear now at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FU">WP:FU#Counterexamples</a>, point 6. I'm going to hold off and wait for a response from you. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 06:08, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your point, but it does look like (from the counterexamples link I give) that policy has cleared up. However, I'm going to look further into things and see if we can get an explicit statement, policy-wise. Now, all I did was put notices on the last three images you uploaded and I'll stop. If you want, you can revert it back to the fairuse tag or just let things go. I don't want it to seem like I'm singling you out, so if unless it's clear, I'll just let it go. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 06:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello BurmaShaver. Wikipedia policy, which is often quite conservative with respect to the law, only allows for the use of copyrighted works such as baseball cards, paintings, and magazine covers to be used as a part of critical commentary about that particular work or publication. The <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_Archive_2_2d11.html#Fair_use_of_baseball_cards_image" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use/Archive 2">discussion at Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a> lead to the addition of the explicit counterexample for baseball cards, so that there would be no misunderstanding. That discussion ended three months ago. If you disagree with the outcome, and have an argument to make, then you should start a new topic, challenging the guideline at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, you are correct, there are many images throughout the encyclopedia that violate our fair use policy, including some baseball cards. The problem is so large that the process of cleaning them all up is going to take a long time, and unfortunately, in the meantime, these images set a very bad example and inspire imitation. Preventing the influx of new violations, such as your cards, which are being used solely as portraits for the men in the photographs, is equally important to cleaning up the existing instances. There is no favoritism involved.</dd>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">WP:POLICY</a>, <i>"a guideline is something that is: (1) actionable and (2) authorized by consensus."</i> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> is a guideline. If you do not choose to follow Wikipedia guidelines, others may bring your contributions into compliance, including deleting the images that you have uploaded. Copyright is not an issue to take likely, and a consensus of editors have devised these guidelines to protect the Wikimedia Foundation from legal threat. If you disagree with the guidelines, then you should begin the process of having them changed. If you are unsure about whether your contributions conform to the guidelines, then you should ask other users at a central location. In either case, as I suggested before, you should open a new discussion at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a>.</dd>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that it's pretty informal and fairly non-npov to say that someone has "passed away" instead of "died" for someone's death. Saying someone "passed away" takes the formalness out of the encyclopedia entry and also creates a non-npov statement, in that it implies that someone has went to heaven, or that there is an afterlife. Just keep that in mind when you create articles on notable baseball players and I will assist in changing "passed away" to "died" on your articles to help the process. Just look at all the major biographies, and not one of them says that the subject had "passed away". 68.79.132.216 04:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off I'd like to thank you for your contributions to the pages of baseball players - it seems like you have worked hard on creating an number of new articles. However, I have an issue with the inclusion of some of your "trivia" on a number of players' pages. For instance, on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lary_7426.html" title="Frank Lary">Frank Lary</a>'s page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Lary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84955599" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Lary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84955599" rel="nofollow">you wrote</a> that he <i>was the first strikeout victim of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> right-hander <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Heman_9971.html" title="Russ Heman">Russ Heman</a>. {<a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Stadium_630e.html" title="Cleveland Stadium">Cleveland Stadium</a> -- April 20, 1961}</i>. On <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_Chamberlain_f432.html" title="Elton Chamberlain">Elton Chamberlain</a>'s page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elton_Chamberlain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79495894" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elton_Chamberlain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79495894" rel="nofollow">you wrote</a> that <i>He was the starting pitcher in the only game that his teammate <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Mathews_9843.html" title="Bob Mathews">Bob Mathews</a> ever got into. {Athletic Park -- September 25, 1891}</i>. Do you think this information is important enough to warrant inclusion on each of these player's entries? I removed both of the sentences because I feel that this trivia is <i>too</i> trivial. If either Russ Heman or Bob Mathews was a notable athlete (or notable at anything) I wouldn't have a problem with it. Please reply to let me know your opinions on this issue, however if you agree with my position I ask that you refrain from adding non-notable "trivia".

<dd>Thanks for your reply on my talk page. To answer your question, I feel that the above examples detract from the quality of the articles. I'm not against trivia completely - however, I feel that it's better form to incorporate information directly into an article rather than having a specific 'trivia' section. I made a number of changes to <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_Chamberlain_f432.html" title="Elton Chamberlain">Elton Chamberlain</a> - notice how now there is no trivia section, but his nickname and the fact that he was ambidextrous are both included a little more gracefully. This is a matter of opinion, but I would recommend trying to incorporate any trivia without using a trivia section, although I understand that sometimes this can be difficult. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattingly23_58f5.html" title="User:Mattingly23">Mattingly23</a> 04:30, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
