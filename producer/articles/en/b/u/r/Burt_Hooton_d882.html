Burt Hooton (1970s)</div>

</div>
<p><b>Burt Carlton Hooton</b> (born <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_Texas_61c9.html" title="Greenville, Texas">Greenville, Texas</a>), nicknamed "Happy" (by former manager <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lasorda_c1a9.html" title="Tommy Lasorda">Tommy Lasorda</a>), is a former right-handed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starting_pitcher.html" title="Starting pitcher">starting pitcher</a> and coach in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who played most of his career for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. His career began auspiciously with a <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-hitter.html" title="No-hitter">no-hitter</a> in his fourth major league game for the Cubs, but he gained perhaps his widest recognition for his several playoff performances with the Dodgers. He completed one of his best seasons with four <a href="../../../w/i/n/Win_%28baseball%29.html" title="Win (baseball)">victories</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_baseball.html" title="1981 in baseball">1981</a> postseason, and was the named the Most Valuable Player of that year's <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_National_League_Championship_Series_214b.html" title="1981 National League Championship Series">National League Championship Series</a>. He is currently the pitching coach of the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round_Rock_Express_e2ec.html" title="Round Rock Express">Round Rock Express</a>.</p>
<p>Hooton attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_at_Austin_7a6d.html" title="University of Texas at Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where he posted a 35-3 record including two no-hitters, and was selected by the Cubs with the second pick of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_in_baseball.html" title="1971 in baseball">1971</a> amateur draft. He made his major league debut with the team on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a> of that year, but appeared in only three games before the end of the season, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeout.html" title="Strikeout">striking out</a> 15 batters in one of them. He began <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a> in outstanding fashion, pitching a 4-0 no-hitter against the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> at <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley_Field_d92d.html" title="Wrigley Field">Wrigley Field</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>, the second day of the strike-delayed season. But he was unable to win consistently as the team's fortunes declined in the early 1970s, and he was traded to Los Angeles in May 1975 after compiling a 34-44 record with a steadily increasing <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">earned run average</a>. The Dodgers were headed in the opposite direction from the Cubs, and Hooton was 18-7 with a 2.82 ERA over the remainder of the year, winning his last 12 decisions for a team record. After a disappointing 1976 season, he used his strong <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckle_curve.html" title="Knuckle curve">knuckle curve</a> to become a valuable member of the pennant-winning teams of the next two years, leading the staff with 153 strikeouts in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_baseball.html" title="1977 in baseball">1977</a> and with 19 wins and a 2.71 ERA in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_baseball.html" title="1978 in baseball">1978</a>. He finished second to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaylord_Perry_85f2.html" title="Gaylord Perry">Gaylord Perry</a> in the 1978 <a href="../../../c/y/_/Cy_Young_Award_f830.html" title="Cy Young Award">Cy Young Award</a> voting.</p>
<p>Hooton started Game 3 of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_National_League_Championship_Series_a257.html" title="1977 National League Championship Series">1977 NLCS</a> against the Phillies, but was pulled after issuing three consecutive bases-loaded <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_on_balls.html" title="Base on balls">walks</a> in the second inning; the Dodgers came back to win 6-5. In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_World_Series_9c9d.html" title="1977 World Series">World Series</a> against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, he pitched a 6-1 victory in Game 2, allowing only five singles and retiring 14 of the last 15 hitters to tie the Series at one game each. But in Game 6, he left in the fourth inning with the Dodgers behind 4-3 after giving up a 2-run <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Jackson_fe23.html" title="Reggie Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a> â€“ Jackson's first of three in the game, all on the first pitch. The Yankees won 8-4, taking the Series in six games. The 1978 playoffs were rematches; in Game 1 of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_National_League_Championship_Series_8d3f.html" title="1978 National League Championship Series">NLCS</a> against the Phillies, Hooton left after allowing three runs in the fifth inning, although the Dodgers still led 7-4 and went on to win the game. In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_World_Series_f43d.html" title="1978 World Series">Series rematch</a> with the Yankees he won Game 2, leaving in the seventh inning with a 4-2 lead as Los Angeles held on for a 4-3 win to take a 2-0 Series edge. But Game 5 was another crushing defeat as Hooton was yanked after allowing four runs in the third inning for a 4-2 Yankee lead, with New York romping to a 12-2 blowout and their third straight win. The Yankees won again two days later for their second consecutive title.</p>
<p>After solid but unspectacular years in 1979 and 1980, Hooton enjoyed an 11-6 campaign in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_Major_League_Baseball_strike_6576.html" title="1981 Major League Baseball strike">strike</a>-shortened 1981 season, posting a career-best 2.28 ERA and being named to his only <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> team. He began the playoffs with a win against the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a> in Game 3 of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_National_League_Division_Series_0e90.html" title="1981 National League Division Series">Division Series</a>, allowing only three <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">hits</a>, including an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Howe_25af.html" title="Art Howe">Art Howe</a> solo homer, through seven innings. After the Dodgers won the series in five games, they went on to face the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Nationals_035f.html" title="Washington Nationals">Montreal Expos</a> in the NLCS; Hooton won Game 1, allowing only six hits before leaving in the eighth inning with a 2-0 lead. Returning in Game 4 with the Dodgers behind two games to one, he allowed only five hits and one <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run.html" title="Earned run">unearned run</a> before leaving in the eighth inning with a 3-1 lead; the Dodgers went on to a 7-1 win, and won Game 5 to advance to the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_World_Series_d951.html" title="1981 World Series">World Series</a>, again meeting the Yankees. Hooton was named the NLCS MVP for his two wins and perfect 0.00 ERA. He started Game 2 of the World Series, but took a tough loss after leaving the game in the seventh inning, behind 1-0 on an unearned run; the Yankees went on to win 3-0 behind the pitching of his former Dodger teammate <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_John_f81e.html" title="Tommy John">Tommy John</a>. But he came back with another strong outing in Game 6, leaving with an 8-1 lead in the sixth inning as the Dodgers won 9-2, taking their first World Series title since 1965.</p>
<p>Hooton remained with the Dodgers for three more years, but with a combined record of just 16-21; he spent most of 1984 in the bullpen. He played his last season in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_baseball.html" title="1985 in baseball">1985</a> for the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a> after signing with them as a free agent, going 5-8. In a 15-season career, Hooton compiled a 151-136 career record (.526) with 1491 strikeouts, a 3.38 ERA and 29 <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shutout.html" title="Shutout">shutouts</a> in 480 games and 2652 <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings_pitched.html" title="Innings pitched">innings pitched</a>. He served as the pitching coach of the Astros from 2000 to 2004.</p>
