<p>I hope I did not overstep my bounds here, but the candidate withdrew, and I was the nominator, and there were two post-withdrawal opinions (one whom self-reverted), so I placed the close tags around it. I apologize if I stepped on any toes. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 21:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You did just fine. Once they're withdrawn, they're fair game to tag as closed and remove from WP:RfA. I probably would have reverted the post withdrawal votes/comments too, but since there weren't closing tags on it at the time the comments were made it's a judgement call. There's no major need to do it now. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:05, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've closed Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/coltsXLI, seeing as the user was indef blocked while the rfa was in process, and, per a request by some bureaucrat on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a> to mention such things here, I have. In fact, I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you guys are okay with it.

<p>I would just like to add a note expressing my misgivings about the way this has been closed despite the lack of consensus in the discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 07:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to say I agree with these misgivings. I expected more of a closing reason than "I like" him with a controversial close, and it smacks of caballism. I think that this promotion should be reviewed, and that at the very least a much better reaso should be given to the community. Preferably one that addresses the concerns raised by the oppose "side".

<p>Having not participated in the discussion and not known about it had I not had this page on my watchlist I would also like to voice my misgivings that there was not a clear consensus in this case and it therefore in my view should not have been closed as a sucessful RfA. It certainly did not meet the arbitary standard for RfAs these days (80% support) and many if not all of the oppose views were from respected editors expressing their views, not socks/meats or disrupters. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, bureaucrats in the English Wikipedia are not the same kind of bureaucrats that come with the default installation of MediaWiki.

Bureaucrats here have access to <a href="../../../m/a/k/Special%7EMakesysop_f398.html" title="Special:Makesysop">Special:Makesysop</a>, which is a rather limited interface that allows users to go "up" the user groups hierarchy, but not down. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 21:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and in addition, we can only do two kinds of "upward" promotion: from "no special rights" to admin, and admin plus Bureaucrat. This means: we can't make a user with no special access level a Bureaucrat without making him or her also an admin. We can't give any othe rights (checkuser, oversight, developer, boardvote, etc) and we can't remove any rights, not even the ones we do grant. All of those tasks (promotions other than +sysop and +bureaucrat and all removal of access) are done by Stewards. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Stewards can do it though. They can grant Bureaucrat access without activating the sysop flag as well. But that's because the "adjust user rights" tool used in the Steward interface if far more complex than the Makesysop used by Bureaucrats. If we checked the "make this user a Bureaucrat" box (and we must write the username in the only field available, in order to inform the system who to promote, be it to adminship or to bureaucratship) when changing the rights for a "regular" account, that would result in a "double promotion". <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I knew Stewards could, but didn't know about the Bureaucrats.

<dd>Just to note: the image for the bureaucrat interface linked above is the one for Meta. On the English-language Wikipedia (this is <i>not</i> standardized for all projects), the box for bureaucratship reads, as I wrote above, "Make this user a Bureaucrat". And yes, both tools are Special:Makesysop in their root, but the Bcrat flag will yield the link "Make a user into a sysop" on Special Pages, whereas the Steward flag (on Meta) yields "edit user rights". Also, as a curiosity, even if one is a Steward and a Bureaucrat on Meta at the same time, one does not have access to both tools. The Steward flag overrides the Bureaucrat flag for user rights adjustment, and the Bcrat/Steward will only see the Steward tool. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a poll ongoing at Requests for adminship talk, that proposes measures that would reduce bureaucrat discretion, and reduce the strength of consensus.

<ul>
<li>Er, no, it has no effect on bureaucrat discretion and no effect on estimation of consensus. All it asks is that when the <i>raw</i> vote percentage is less than 75% that another bureaucrat be involved in the decision to promote. Bureaucrats still have all the discretion in the world to decide whether to promote or not. It provides no limitations if two bureaucrats want to promote a candidate who had 2 supports and 50000 opposes. Likewise, the reverse. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is there a good reason why bureaucrats are in charge of name changes?

Is there any reason a Special:Renameself couldn't be added to Mediawiki to allow most users to change their own username?

<dl>
<dd>First of all, Df, welcome back. Special:Renameself would be <i>wayyyy</i> too easy for vandals to abuse to bring the servers to their knees. Allowing any administrator to put a name-change through might be plausible, however, if a need to expand the number of people with access to this function were established (I don't know that it has been). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My general thinking isn't exactly that there is a problem with the current process, but rather that there isn't any compelling reason to burden Bureaucrats with such a role if it could be more widely shared.

<dd>[edit-conflict]Good point. However, it may make renames more common, and they can be disruptive, if a well known user, such as yourself, suddenly changed their name, that would be a problem. The same with vandals, since renames mess up logs, you could clear your block log. Plus if they are more common, then the load increases. It might not be a problem to give this (or just the whole renameuser) to admins though. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 02:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This decision was not made in terms of this Wikipedia. It came from the Foundation, actually. Basically, the access level of Bureaucrat had been created to localize something that used to be done by developers/Stewards: promotions. Renaming users was then a developer task. The decision was then made to have those handled locally as well. As such, access was given to Bureaucrats, which was the position created to take over locally functions that used to be done from a Foundation-wide position. I don't see how it would be feasible, from a practical point of view, to extend this to admins on this Wikipedia particularly. If the tool is "Rename<b>self</b>", then the admins would only be able to rename themselves, something that doesn't serve much of a purpose (admins can rename themselves, while other users can't, and for what special purpose?), and if the ability to rename anyone else was extended to over a thousand admins, this could create a rather chaotic situation, I believe. As Prodego said: renames affect the logs, put strain on the servers, they can make block logs confusing and affect a user's entire Wikipedia identity. It is not something that should be handled by more than a thousand people at once. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Would it put a strain on the servers if, hypothetically, all revsions by users were identified by their User ID number, and then the username only called if a page containing the ID is loaded? Then you could change the master, rather then every one. Of course, the real question is: are history pages, diffs, and logs cached? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 15:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I understand the first portion of the question, but if I read it correctly, you are asking about storing the user id of the user who made the revision <i>instead</i> of the user name? If that is the case, then certainly, as it would require a separate query to the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/user_table" class="extiw" title="mw:user_table">user table</a>, not just the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/revision_table" class="extiw" title="mw:revision_table">revision table</a> and the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/recentchanges_table" class="extiw" title="mw:recentchanges_table">recentchanges table</a>. There is no real reason not to store <i>both</i> the user id of the user and his or her username, though, and I think the developers are considering that for changes to the logging interface. (Again, poke them for confirmation.) As for the second part, the answer is probably, but probably not enough to cause a noticeable reduction in server load. All squid caches store the cached pages in memory, but serve them to anonymous users only. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 03:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that is it, except what I really mean would it put a prohibitively large load on the server. Are you sure about that only anonymous users receive cached versions of pages? There is an option on the last page of the preferences about that. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 03:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Prohibitively huge? I'm not sure. It would require twice as much database lookups in pages such as history pages, contributions pages, etcetera. That may not be double our load, but I don't have any way to quantify that (and developers likely don't have any way either, for now). As for the caching, I'm pretty sure about Squid caching; Apache server cache may be a different thing.

<li>The general rule of thumb is that non-bureaucrats should not be closing any RfA that has more support than opposition. This RfB falls into that category. I just recommend you constrain such closes to those that have less support than opposition. It's not a hard fast written rule, but it's the rule of thumb that tends to be followed. Also, in closing an RfB or an RfA the "Voice your opinion" link needs to be removed. You did add "Final" which is good.

<dl>
<dd>Meta didn't start out that way. They used to sysop people indefinitely upon request, as long as they were a sysop on another project (which is easy to become on a tiny project). The inactivity standard was adopted in large part to have an excuse to desysop someone they didn't want to remain as a sysop. Of course, that goes back a few years, and we have an active ArbCom here on enwiki, so that motivation to change the policy wouldn't apply here. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 15:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This has been discussed many times at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a>, check the archives.

<dd>No my point was that the tools should be taken away only "temporarily" just until the missing admin comes back to edit - like how the powers of the current president of Israel were taken away until his court case ends or his term ends.

<dd>I don't know what exactly would be the new system to decide on whether or not to grant sysop rights to bots, but I don't suppose it could be based on a system wherein only a small, predetermined number of users could participate. I'm basing this on my knowledge that Jimbo himself declined to grant permission for a bot to gain sysop status (I believe it was Tawker's bot), despite his personal liking of the proposal, if it failed to gain community support. The pivotal question to be asked is: would the community at large be prepared to defer to BAG members and/or Bureaucrats the prerrogative to decide whether or not any given bot will be given sysophood? In theory, having a new <i>system</i>, that is not RfA, doesn't mean a new type of suffrage, or the [severe] limiting of the right that each member in good standing of the community has to be heard on whether or not anyone (or in this case, "anything") will become an administrator. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as your average, bot-clueless community member, I endorse the idea that adminbots are better in your hands. As long as the operator has already been granted admin-status in their own normal rfa, I think its fine for such bot proposals to be between the bot approval group members and the bureaucrats. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 03:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Looking at an <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_impact_statement.html" title="Environmental impact statement">Environmental impact statement</a>, an ugly piece of bureaucracy, I got a few ideas about this. First, before proposing an admin bot, one could ask whether people agree on there being a need for an adminbot in the first place. That would remove one step in the grilling process. If approved, I'd rather have the bots run through RFA <i>after</i> its code was exhaustively reviewed by the BAG (to eliminate issues of "I don't know if the code will work" and "Bots are evil and will kill us all"). Therefore, the only thing left to argue is whether the community trusts the user running the adminbot or not. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 03:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The whole thing would be much easier if there was granularity in the granting of admin rights. If we could split out blocking, deleting, editing protected pages, protecting, etc, we could give just what was needed. I have no idea how hard that would be to code up. On a side note I think that would really solve a lot of other backlogs too. As it is, if we go with a full community input process we might as well just send it to RfA. The only difference with an admin bot and a human is the account is getting admin rights and it's not a person. The technicality there could be solved by simply making it clear that's what RfA would also be for now. I think protection bot would have been successful at RfA largely because it showed a clear need, the BAG basically signed off on it, and the bot's owner was trusted. So the next proposal that met the same criteria would likely be successful too. But that alone doesn't say we should go through the whole rigmarole, and I do think it was clear a large number of people didn't want the bot to go through RfA, they wanted us to handle it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:33, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I just reviewed all of the relevant discussion I could find, including the ANI discussion, the RFA itself and the talk page and WT:RFA, and there were clearly many more people saying it shouldn't have gone through RfA than those saying it should have. There were only about 6 or 7 people that came out and said it should go through RfA. I was sort of one of them but that was only based on not having a consensus not to go to RfA based on the ANI discussion that was about 50/50 <i>before</i> the RfA. But once it had been run, the comments ran much more strongly to not repeating going through RfA for a bot.

<p>Somewhere in the volume of material related to ProtectionBot, several users including one dev objected to modifying Mediawiki if the effect was to create a new user group for the specific case of ProtectionBot. Essentially the objection was 1) changing the software to address unique issues is bad policy, and 2) the restriction would accomplish little since the bot operator already had all the admin tools. In light of this objection, I would suggest that any proposal about granularity aim to address the issue broadly and not be focused on the needs of individual bots. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the protection bot rfa, it seems to me that a large number of the 'dont put this on rfa' camp were those who's argument is that the bot should never be an "administrator", not that the bot should not have the set of "sysop rights". "Administrators" by nature have to be sentient, as their roles deal with a lot more then clicking buttons (e.g. most cases of user-unblock requests, non-vandalistic protection/unprotection debates, the handling of the staggering XFD work.) Idealy I'm all for having the permissions be granted granularly as a concept, but from dealing with rights management IRLm it comes at a high administrative (guess <i>bureaucratic</i> here) cost to manage. In addition to community support, we would likely need to have buy-in from the bulk of crats that running RFRollback, RFDelete, RFviewdeleted, RFblock, RFUnwantedpages, RFMediawiki, RFeditprotected, etc systems would be able to be supported; or that they should be granted ad-hoc without process soley by crat discretion. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, it wouldn't need to be nearly so complicated. Some of those could be given out only with full admin rights, and others as groups. Deletion and blocking would be the two highest value to split out. Rollback perhaps not so much given how many scripts are out there. The less extra overhead created out of the gates, the more likely it would be supported. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Granularity has been suggested before, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_rollback_privileges_419d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for rollback privileges">Wikipedia:Requests for rollback privileges</a>. This was a much simpler proposal, granting only rollback separately, and failed to gain consensus.

<dl>
<dd>I think it's the other way around. The full granularity has much more value, and thus may be easier to implement. And we don't need to have separate processes <i>now</i> to dole out the individual rights, but it would be of extreme value to be able to do for bots. Bots can get a large number of edits done and work faster. Then we could decide in the future if we ever decide to have separate processes for the rights, and of course it doesn't need to be as complicated as the above. In addition we have another year of data that admin promotions aren't keeping up with the backlogs. Besides overhead and people wanting to know exactly how the systems would work upfront, I can't think of any significant grounds for opposition. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>With all due respect, I don't think the inability of Requests for rollback privileges to gain consensus was because so many people were opposed to it <i>in theory</i>. Many of the objections were procedural (instruction creep, bureaucracy creep, developer time) and others were philosophical with the idea of voting on granting rollback privileges (automatic granting, intermediate user level, give them adminship). Only a very small number of objectors actually said that granting non-administrators access to the rollback tool would be a bad thing. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 16:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was very deeply involved in RFR when it was proposed. In fact, it was brought up in my RFB as a reason for opposition. I dare say that most of the opposition was to the system in which it was going to be handled; there were not that many users opposed to the concept of a separate permissions system. The issue here is figuring out how to assign <i>and revoke</i> privileges, not about how to code it.</dd>
<dd>By the way, from the title of the thread: "What is an admin"? It is to MediaWiki an account with the ability to perform certain tasks not allowed for anyone.

<p>I would like to observe two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The typical RFA voter doesn't understand bots -- who writes them, how they are managed, how much effort is involved, how they benefit the project. The burden of educating the RFA voter base is great given the extensive drive-by voting that forum suffers and the lack of opportunity to discuss an RFA prior to opening it for votes.</li>
<li>I believe that it is grossly unfair to the bot writers to expect them to follow the lengthy process to develop a bot and get it approved only to find that the necessary rights to have it run effectively aren't granted due to politicization of the matter at RFA.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe we need some sort of policy on this because of the increasing importance of bots to the project and the ever-growing ratio of editors to admins (when casual editors are included). <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 04:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmm... too many "we need a policy", but we need some actual ideas, and ideas on how to implement the ideas, put on the table... what <i>should</i> the process be? <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 04:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Run it much the same way as AfD, closed by a 'crat on balance of arguments.

<dd>Ok, but for future reference: the seven-day period starts from when the candidate (nominee) accepts the nomination (not applicable if it's a self-nom) <i>and</i> lists it on the main RfA page. Both have to take place, and any&#160;!votes cast before that are cancelled, since the page must be reset — it <i>is</i> ok, of course, to inform people, who may well have participated in good faith, that their input has been removed because the RfA was not yet active.

<dd>Yeah, that's basically what I would have said. The enthusiasm is good, but people should save it until the nomination has actually started.

<dd>Agree with Taxman (and to Redux to the extent his comments are not inconsistent with Taxman's). Major issues with over-early support (or opposition) should be addressed, but it would exalt form over substance to strike&#160;!votes if there are a couple of early supports registered, typically from nominators or co-noms, before the RfA has been officially opened. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 13:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the wikiEN-l mailing list, as some of you may know, there's been a lot of discussion the past day or so about how we're selecting admins as a community. The general opinion there seems to be very strong that the current system is broken and, as I would characterize it, equal parts too bloated and too stringent.</p>
<p>I'm approaching the bureaucrats specifically because they regularly evaluate requests for adminship, and are thus best placed to evaluate the system. I think if the bureaucrats can produce a reasonable consensus for change among themselves, it may be possible to enlist wider community support for it.</p>
<p>Let's assume you were collectively assigned to redesign the system. This should not attempt to alter the nature of adminship (values like trust and "no big deal"), only the process by which it is handed out. You can redesign from scratch if necessary, with the primary condition that adminship should not come simply at your whim. What parts of the system would you keep? What parts would you scrap? What information do you as bureaucrats need in order to recognize that a candidate is qualified and has community support? What kind of system would more effectively provide you with that information? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People have been saying RfA is broken for years, and discussions on how to "fix" it have consumed megabyte after megabyte of space on talk pages... but the net change in the past two years? The questions are at the top of the template now, instead of the bottom... nothing else has changed, other than the people involved in individual RfAs. I'm just saying, I know people mean well, but these "drastic changes needed to RfA immediately" things are basically much ado about nothing. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:12, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In theory, I agree with Michael: RfA could use some revamping. From a pragmatic point of view, however, marsh is right. And I should know, I proposed numerous alternatives and ideas to redesign RfA in the past, none of which came to fruition. And I wasn't the only one either. All that has been done really are a few structural rearrangements (as mentioned: questions at the top) and a few rewordings (mainly in the header: "voice your opinion", "scheduled to end") designed to better illustrate the nature of RfA. The Bureaucrats are always attentive to community feeling and the changes brought by it, but so far the only changes that we've seen have been in interpreting the existing system. We've been nowhere near a place where we could effectively restructure RfA in any way.<br />
That being said, I don't believe any of the Bureaucrats would oppose making changes in RfA, especially since our job (specifically as Bureaucrats) is not to rule, or control, the process, but rather to operate it. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 11:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats%27_noticeboard_Archive_5_e418.html" title="Edit section: Redesigning adminship: the issue of scale">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Redesigning adminship: the issue of scale</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>As many people have observed, and a number of graphs I have produced have shown, standards at RfA have and continue to slowly rise over time. Similarly, there are frequent complaints of people using strange rationale for opposing such as the recent debate about namespace balance as a basis for oppose. These sorts of concerns keep arising. The reality is there is no ready way to prevent such problems from arising in any open system where any passerby can comment on an RfA. Yet, a non-open system is antithetical to the wiki way.</li>
<li>The root problem though is not really open vs. non-open system. That's a consequence of the current environment. That environment has generated because of scale issues. When RfA regulars were a smaller set of people, gaining consensus and focusing a group towards sets of standards was considerably easier. Cohesion was achievable, standards stayed low. Now, there's been more than 300 people who have been active contributors to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a> just in the last 3 months alone. I don't know what the number of unique people who are voters on RfAs in the last three months has been, but I strongly suspect it is higher. Now, there are simply too many people in the process to get the group to move in a direction, regardless of how good or bad that direction is. As noted by another above, the changes in recent history have been incremental, not substantial.</li>
<li>Two things that are very worth reading in regards to this core problem; <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunbar%27s_Number_b7d5.html" title="Dunbar's Number">Dunbar's Number</a> and <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" class="external free" title="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>. In particular when reading this, think of their relevance to RfA (many thanks to Kim Bruning for bringing these to my attention). I think most of you will be amazed at the strong correlation between these and RfA. The latter reference is long, but <i>very</i> worth the read. Without readings like this, we're down in the forest complaining about "well this is wrong" and others saying "no it isn't" and nothing ever happening. With such readings, more global understanding of the core nature of the problem begins to evolve.</li>
<li>en.wikipedia is a trailblazer vs. other language wikipedias. There are a number of reasons for this, but one of the chief reasons is that this language wikipedia runs into the scale problems long before any other language does. There's small and obvious examples of this, such as the division of orphaned fair use images into dated categories to more rapidly identify those that have exceeded the seven day limit. There also happen to be considerably more subtle but quite large examples. RfA happens to be one of them. There are other areas at this language wikipedia that suffer from similar problems.</li>
<li>In sum, it is highly unlikely that whatever problems RfA has can be cured by the group working towards a group solution. Every proposal that has been made has been shot down, some multiple times. <a href="../../../d/f/a/WP%7EDFA_c57d.html" title="WP:DFA">WP:DFA</a> is one such example. My gut feeling on how to reform RfA had been that we needed to focus on determining what is wrong with RfA, analyzing its strengths and weaknesses before we ever considered revamping it. Without such effort, we could just as easily cause harm (in fact I think more easily) than good. Since reading the above noted things, my opinion has changed. Even though such a process would be good, it would not work. The outcome of it, even if perfect in evolving RfA, would never be accepted.</li>
<li>This is a big problem. Recent studies have shown that admin load (as shown by number of admin actions per admin per day) has doubled in the last two years. See <a href="../../../r/f/a/WT%7ERFA_66f4.html#Charts_on_admin_activity" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA#Charts_on_admin_activity</a>. This is confirmed also by statistics kept by me showing that the number of edits made by all editors as a ratio to the number of admins has also doubled during the same time period. A number of tools have come online in the two year time period to help contend with these increases, but these are bandaids. They are not cures for the problem.</li>
<li>To go even deeper into the "RfA" is broken problem, the core problem lies in the ability to effectively manage Wikipedia. As time goes on and Wikipedia continues to increase in popularity (we're now breaking into the top ten of all websites), our ability to manage is eroding. There's simply too much going on for the tools we currently have available. Something will have to change. Whether it be now or two years from now, it will change if only because it will become so apparent the system is broken that it <i>must</i> change in order to survive.</li>
<li>en.wikipedia will be (and is) the first to run into these problems. What we do here is pivotal to the success of the project. RfA is but a symptom of the problem. What solutions we apply here, if they are going to be relatively permanent fixes, must address the scalability issue. The system will need to be able to work when there are thousands of people participating in RfA. The current system is failing because of a lack of scalability. Standards continue to rise, but due to the size of the group there is no effective way to reverse that trend. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. Very well said, Durin. The path to solve this, however, is not mysterious, just unpopular. At least to the larger portion of the community — although more experienced users usually understand and accept it.<br />
There is a widespread misconception that nobody is running Wikipedia save for consensus. That is not true. There are people who ultimately run this project, and whose word will, if made necessary, be final. I'm not one of them, but one of them is rather obvious, it's Jimbo — and quoting from his user page, right after he states his principles: <cite>I should point out that these are my principles, such that I am the final judge of them. This does not mean that I will not listen to you, <b>but it does mean that at some ultimate, fundamental level, this is how Wikipedia will be run</b>.</cite> (I bolded that passage). Other people who do have power of decision: members of the Board of Trustees (Wikimedia-wide, which includes this Wikipedia) and, on enwiki specifically: Danny (when using WP:OFFICE prerrogatives) and arbitrators (as a group that makes binding decisions in a number of instances).<br />
If we accept Durin's argument that the environment has become (or will become) unmanageable due to scale, ultimately we would need to ask some of these people, as a group or even individually (if it's Jimbo), to decide if something needs to be fixed regarding RfA — and if he/they say "no", then the discussion is over — and, if he/they say "yes", then decide what needs changing and how. And that would be final.<br />
There's no need to tell me how unsavory this sounds, but ultimately there might be no alternative. And it <i>has</i> happened before: Jimbo implemented the 3RR by means of an executive decision. If the 3RR, an established policy, were put up for discussion today, as something new, it would have the same fate as "Requests for Rollback Privileges", that is, neverending discussions that yield no consensus, much like it has happened to every suggestion to revamp RfA.<br />
I know nobody wants to hear that, but it needed to be said. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 14:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. But, if we suggest a revamp of RfA that is not agreed upon by the group, we might as well slather ourselves in gasoline, string ourselves to an unlit bonfire and hand WT:RFA the match&#160;:) Witnessed what happened to Linuxbeak and Ilyanep when they tried to implement a version of <a href="../../../d/f/a/WP%7EDFA_c57d.html" title="WP:DFA">WP:DFA</a> without running it through WT:RFA first. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I wouldn't expect that there wouldn't be any discontent voices — as I said: the concept is not at all appealing — but noticing that I mentioned certain, very specific people who would have legitimacy to make a binding decision as a group; or individually, if it is Jimbo. A Bureaucrat, or even a group of Bureaucrats, does not have such legitimacy, which is why what happened to Linuxbeak and Ilyanep came to pass. But if Jimbo were to declare something like <cite>"<i>this</i> is how new administrators are to be selected from now on"</cite>, then this would be final, and this would be how RfA would be run from then on. Jimbo is extremely genereous in listening to the community, and factoring community feeling into his decisions (hence the "benevolent dictator" thing), but ultimately his decision <i>will</i> stand. That would clearly <i>not</i> be the case if I, Redux, were to say suddenly: "this is how things will go". I'm a member of the community just like everybody else, whereas Jimbo is...well...he is Jimbo!&#160;;-) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 15:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point made by Durin, rather truthfully, is that regardless of whether or not there is a need for a change (which would mean that there would be something wrong with the current system, at least on some level), the evergrowing scale of the project makes consensus impossible to attain. And this means that we are forever stuck in the process of a group of people constantly claiming "there's something wrong, and we need to do something about it asap", and another group that always replies "no, there's nothing wrong with it" — and even those who think that there's something wrong can't even agree on what it is exactly that is wrong, and what to do about it. It's a vicious circle, made perpetual by the unmanageability of the environment. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 16:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever our system was, we would always have some saying "there's something wrong" and others saying "there's nothing wrong". I hear the same division of opinion about the US Presidential process, and I'm sure the same is said in just about every other country with an electoral system of some sort too (and talk about scaling - these countries have millions of voters). There will never be a perfect solution. Having what in the final analysis is a simple process is not so bad. And if you boil it down, our process is very simple... you pass if you get a supermajority of support, all the additional guidelines and procedures are just bells and whistles. A simple process is flexible because nothing is stopping the participants from changing the basis of when they will support a candidate. So the new consensus will come from below instead of imposed from above. If we truly need more admins, the consensus from below to promote will suddenly develop, and our simple process allows for that to happen. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 16:26, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There's something I've been thinking of asking Jimbo for some time now: Does he still believe adminship is no big deal? He made that much quoted comment years ago, a lot has changed since then. There is a lot of disagreement over how big a deal adminship is - knowing Jimbo's opinion (and his reasons for it) would probably settle a lot of those arguments. I think asking Jimbo that specific question would be better than asking him a general "is RFA broken?" style question. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe not. Or maybe Jimbo could say "I don't see any need for a reform in RfA" (which means: no changes are needed), or maybe he'd defer the decision to a think tank formed by some of those people I mentioned way above. The point is not <i>necessarily</i> to reform RfA, but rather to break the vicious circle. And this would respond to one of NoSeptember's points: yes, there will always be people that are dissatisfied with whichever system, but ultimately we wouldn't need to write 11 pages worth of comments in order to get the same old result: "no consensus to do anything". We'd be able to say "this issue has been addressed and resolved", something we are utterly unable to do at this point.<br />
Our ordinary process of consensus-building discussions hasn't been working for the larger issues, those that get the attention of a larger morcel of the group — <i>I'm not talking about the consensus-building discussions within any given RfA, but rather I'm referring to the discussions on the topic of whether or not RfA needs a reform. I'm not defending either at this point.</i> With over 300 people participating in RfA and RfA talk (as Durin said), we will not be able to work up to consensus on anything that is controverted to a certain degree. It will always come down to a "no consensus to do anything" situation, which, in a way, may be conceding control of the system to a group that doesn't necessarily represents the larger community, but is populous enough to always split the discussion to a point where consensus, which <i>isn't</i> the process of ascertaining a simple majority, will not be possible.<br />
I'm not saying that those in favor of the <i>status quo</i> are wrong: I'm not advocating for either side at this point. But it is relevant to point out that there is no possible resolution through ordinary community discussion. We will just find ourselves writing pages and pages to no avail again (how long is this thread already??). So again, it is not the best prospect to contemplate, but there simply may not be an alternative to resolve this situation: someone (or a group of people) with legitimacy might just have to make a binding decision. And if they say "let's change nothing", then we will ask that people stop posting every now and then to propose changes in the process, at least for some time, until context again changes to a point where revision becomes prement.<br />
In closing, notice how other high-profile decisions made by the community (enwiki or Wikimedia) are actually votes — such as Board elections, Steward elections or ArbCom elections, and not by a consensus-building discussion — they'd be unmanageable as well. One might say "so let's decide whether or not RfA needs change by means of a vote", but then we'd need to get consensus in order to decide whether or not this should be decided with a vote, and then we are righ back to square 1...<br />
This is not about changing the wiki way: articles have a much lower traffic, sometimes only a handful of users. The system works just fine on them, and there's no reason to imagine that this will change in the forseeable future. And articles are in fact the essence of this project. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 21:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The steward elections are pretty similar to RfA, everyone over a certain percentage passed, similar to the supermajority of RfA. Even ArbCom isn't much different, although with a fixed number of seats (well sort of, depending on Jimbo's choice of the number) the cutoff is not predefined, but Jimbo again pretty much passed those with the highest percentages. All of these processes are supermajority processes now, whether we call them elections or consensus building exercises. Btw, I am not an advocate of the current system per se to the exclusion of new alternatives, I just think we will find that a new system will have just as many complaints and endless discussion as the current one does. I am always game to try them though. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 23:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>RfA was and is, at least supposed to be, a consensus building mechanism. However, in the current environment much of what happens is driven by the declaration of a supermajority, whether there is consensus or no. The current reality is that RfAs themselves routinely exceed the upper bounds of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunbar%27s_number.html" title="Dunbar's number">Dunbar's number</a>. The notion that such RfAs really adhere to any sort of consensus is fairly flawed; people aren't agreeing that a candidate is such-and-such. People are just voting. Few people openly declare any particular statement when making supporting votes. Consensus is what evolves from discussion. It is not what evolves from a vote. As a voting mechanism, RfA works in so far as it derives a metric by which we say yes or no to nominees. As a consensus mechanism, RfA is currently fatally flawed. It just doesn't work very well as a consensus building operation. Consensus can readily evolve in groups of 10-20. In groups or 150-200, which is hardly uncommon on RfAs any more, the notion of consensus is inconceivable in reality. People aren't reaching a joint decision on the character of a candidate. They're just voting. We keep dancing around this issue over and over again at WT:RFA. Some Wikipedias have simply given up on it and just work on a strict voting basis. But, such a system has its shortcomings too.</li>
<li>What is the goal of RfA? On the surface, to approve/disapprove of candidates for adminship. But, that's just one goal. Another goal is to ensure that enough admins are promoted to properly maintain Wikipedia. Yet another is to ensure, in as much as possible, that no harm come to the project from the giving of admin privileges. There may be other goals as well, but those are the biggies I think. To the second goal, that of promoting sufficient admins, we can apply metrics. We've done a few of late and shown that admin load has doubled in two years. If that pattern persists, in another two years it will have been a quadrupling of admin load in four years. At some point, we will have to step back and say "we need more admins" or "we need alternative tools or processes that reduce the load per admin" (or both). As RfA continues to promote fewer and fewer candidates and continues to raise standards of acceptable candidates, it is likely that "we need more admins" will become a signficantly loud concern. Yet, as I noted above...WT:RFA is, I believe, incapable of responding to this concern.</li>
<li>Many times, people refer back to Jimbo's comment from 2003 that adminship should be no big deal. That concept <i>still</i> exists and is quite pertinent here. At core, there really isn't anything that's developed that changes that concept. In fact, quite the opposite. All admin functions are reversible now. All of them. So, where is the harm in giving admin tools? People say they would reduce their standards if it were easier to de-admin people. But, the reality is, whether a person is an admin or not they can have a very negative effect on the project. Being an admin has really little do with that. In fact, if there is anything that makes it have more to do with it, it is the perception that admins are a special class of user. They really aren't. It's just some extra tools, and that is all. Eventually, as the standards keep rising at RfA and the need for more admins becomes more and more apparent, there IS going to be change decreed from above. This is starkly unavoidable for reasons noted before; standards keep rising, promotions keep decreasing, and consensus to change is impossible to achieve. Eventually, there will be a decree from above. We can choose to do something about it now, to be better prepared for that decree and help contribute to what that decree says, or instead have no say in it in any way. Regardless, the decree is coming.</li>
<li>I'm not saying "the sky is falling!". I think when the decree happens (and it will), there will be huge complaints about it for ~2 weeks. Objections will die down when people grow weary of complaining about the change and nothing happens to reverse the change. ~2-3 months after the change, it will be accepted as old hat...the way we do things now. RfA will then percolate along with little trouble. Admins will be made and wikilife will go on as before. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 04:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You say:<br />
&gt;"WT:RFA is... incapable of responding to this concern" (of "we need more admins"). and,<br />
&gt;"Eventually, there will be a decree from above".<br />
I disagree. The community can respond when the need to change becomes obvious to more people in the community. Nothing is stopping us from nominating and deciding to promote more admins. And no decree will be needed to make us do so. Just this past week there was an effort to find and nominate overlooked candidates, and the result of that effort can be seen in the current list of candidates. The truth is, while we talk about how short of admins we are, as long as the admin-tool only backlogs are as low and as managable as they are, it is hard to sell that to some people. For example, we talk about a CSD backlog, yet every 2 days or so we run the list down to 0. If we can consistently run the list down to 0, it is hard to say we have a "real" backlog problem. We may be burning out some of our active admins in the process, but we are not really enduring a too-big backlog as long as admins are stepping up and clearing them. We haven't got to the point where our admins can't handle it, and this gives an excuse for tend-to-oppose voters to be selective about who they will support. When a true crisis of a shortage of admins comes, the votes to pass more admins will be there, because fundamentally the people who vote at RfA (including the frequent opposers) do value the best interests of the project. It doesn't need to be done by decree, we just haven't come to the moment of true crisis that will sway the community to act.<br />
Don't get me wrong, I too would like to solve this before we get to a true shortage crisis, but I also know that our current system will handle it when it comes, without Jimbo's intervention. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 11:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>The community can respond when the need to change becomes obvious to more people in the community</i> - I can't believe that someone could read the suggested readings by Durin (<a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunbar%27s_Number_b7d5.html" title="Dunbar's Number">Dunbar's Number</a> and <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" class="external free" title="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>) and still make this argument. The second reading is <i>full</i> of examples of communities that failed - of communities that didn't scale and couldn't agree within themselves on how to change themselves so they didn't fail. <i>Failure</i> - at least failure by the community to fix itself - <i>is an option</i>; it's quite possibly the <i>most likely</i> option.</li>
<li>If nothing else, the "community" is an ever-changing (as well as ever-increasing) group of people. It's simply an assertion of faith that somehow a "community" that hasn't been able to agree on any change to the RfA process in the past two years (except to move the chairs around on the upper deck, so to speak) is going to act differently in the future. Wikipedia policies <i>are</i> capable of incremental changes. But even something as minor as reusing old accounts with zero edits (see <a href="../../../u/s/u/Wikipedia%7EUsurpation_e0d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Usurpation">Wikipedia:Usurpation</a>) took, what, a 'crat to grab everyone by their scruffs and force the process along? Suffrage, for example, is something that many, if not most of the other major language Wikipedias use, and something that might help this Wikipedia with RfAs, even though only for year or two of time before increasing scale again takes its toll - but I doubt that it could ever get any serious consideration here. Rather, I think it's pretty clear it would have to be something that Jimbo mandates, if its going to happen at all. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(♫♫)</a> 19:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>NoSeptember is a rational person, with a very significant involvement in WP:RFA. He and I have differing opinions on the ability of the community to respond to the question and issue of reform. I think he is wrong, and my stance is right. But, it doesn't really matter. Looking at the long view of this, I think it is inevitable that the pressures on RfA will become so apparent that a stance that RfA is not fatally broken and that the community can effectively respond to this problem will be untenable. We are not there yet. In that sense, NoSeptember is right. But, in the long view, that position is untenable.</li>
<li>The process for RfA was put in place to manage RfA when it began in June of 2003 and has been largely unchanged since. This process has undergone cosmetic changes during the three and a half years since, but the essential process is the same; nominees are put forth, they are supported and opposed, and someone evaluates whether that person is considered acceptable or not. The metrics have changed somewhat, but the process has not. Take a look at what it looked like in June of 2004, just a year after creation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;oldid=4319996#User:Davidcannon_.286.2F0.2F0.29_03:11.2C_3_July_2004_.28UTC.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&amp;oldid=4319996#User:Davidcannon_.286.2F0.2F0.29_03:11.2C_3_July_2004_.28UTC.29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That's basically what we have now. Sure, we transclude RfAs now, and the headers for each RfA are different. But, other than that, what's changed? Nothing really. Meanwhile, we've had ideas of reform dating back at least to March of 2004 when the idea of no self nominations was proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_15#Self-nominations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_15#Self-nominations" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Since then, there's been a huge number of calls for reform, reform proposals, discussions of reforms, polls and surveys, and more. Yet, nothing has changed. As the RfA community, we've never been able to agree on any significant change.</li>
<li>Now, it could readily be argued that the process hasn't been changed because it is as close to perfect as we can expect to achieve. That might be a reasonable argument. However, given the seemingly ever increasing debate on how to reform RfA, this position seems increasingly untenable. I myself held this position for quite some time. My opinion (and true, it is an opinion) has since changed. See my comments on scalability issues earlier on this page. While RfA remained small, the problems it had were also small. As it grows, as standards increase (see <a href="../../../a/v/e/Image%7EAverageEditCountatRfA-2006.png_fb49.html" title="Image:AverageEditCountatRfA-2006.png">Image:AverageEditCountatRfA-2006.png</a>, as admin load increases (see <a href="../../../a/c/t/Image%7EActionsperadmin.png_6064.html" title="Image:Actionsperadmin.png">Image:Actionsperadmin.png</a>, the pressures on RfA to achieve its goals will continue to mount. It's inability to meet the goals will become increasingly apparent. It's simply a matter of time. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 19:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt specific numerical minimum requirements for edit counts and duration of involvement to prevent the constant inflation of standards.</li>
<li>Require objective, high minimum standards for voters. I would be in favor of limiting voting to only those Wikipedians who have themselves been admins for at least three months, because it would break up the now-overinfluential caucus of upcoming and recently promoted admin candidates. Absent such a change, I would still be in favor of limiting voting to only those Wikipedians who have, for example, 1000 edits and three months' participation.</li>
<li>Split the RFA process into a "discussion" and a "voting" stage similar to that proposed at "discussions for adminship."</li>
<li>Encourage the bureaucrats to utilize a more liberal standard than the current 75%/80% one for promotion when large numbers of votes have been cast, using a sliding scale. For example, the ratios could be lowered to 70%/75% when over 50 votes are present and to 65/70% when over 100 votes are present.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any combination of these would help, and I believe we would benefit from implementing them all. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None of these take the scaling issues that Durin has pointed out into account, so mileage may vary.</dd>

<dd>Well designed lightweight consensus processes are typically faster and more pleasant to work with than comparable committee or majority based systems, so adoption isn't the biggest problem.

<dd>I would disagree in very strong terms with attempts to introduce suffrage requirements for voting in RfAs.

<p>I agree with Michael that the sytem needs an overhaul. Nothing concrete has materialised in the past few months quite a number of people have something or the other against a new system being set up. Agreed, no system is perfect, but I strongly feel some of the problems facing RFAs such as editcountitis should be cleared up. One way to deal with it is for bureaucrats to tune in to good suggestions made by the community, and then collectively (the 'crats) debate and come to a consensus regarding the proposal. If consensus has been reached, it could be perhaps be referred to Jimbo/Arbcom for an endorsement. For example I would like to see the editcountitis issue be dealt with once and for all. Also it could reinforce the concept that adminiship is based on the aptitude, experience and skillset of the candidate, not superfluous parameters such as high editcounts, excessive RFA patrol, and daily AFD participation. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 07:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

It raises hackles for some people but may be worth considering. At any rate, if the problem is too few passing nominations and/or too stringent standards, an obvious solution would be to lower the requirement. It seems we're already doing that; I seem to recall that it used to be "about 80%", then it became "75%-80%" and now it's more like "70%-80%". Of course, changing the bounds will give the appearance of not being impartial - <i>but</i>, note that the English Wikipedia is the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdminship_in_other_languages_2cb3.html" title="Wikipedia:Adminship in other languages">only one</a> that doesn't simply have a cutoff point.

<p>The current RFA method tends to "throw away" most of the data collected in an RFA, and also does not manage to develop as much information. When less people were participating, more of the information got incorporated in the final decision. In short, RFA has not been scaling very well, as far as efficiency goes.

<p>I think another problem with RFA participants is expecting admin-candidates to be "All-in-Ones" expecting them to take care of vandalism, AFDs, blocks and what not. One may prefer to edit articles, and as such his usage of the tools will differ. So, one way of breaking the scaling issue is to make sure that a person seeking admin privileges (as per his outline for justification of tools), does not result people&#160;!voting against a niche rather than a jack-of-all trades user. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 14:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think (correct me if I'm wrong) what Nichalp is getting at is that RfA contributors are expecting nominees to be jack-of-all-trades type admins. Reality is there is no one size fits all editor or admin.

<dl>
<dd>Actually it has indirect dealings with scalings. The moment we do away with the requirement that admins should be all-in-ones, lesser people will participate in the&#160;!vote. People who do choose to participate would take a closer look at how the candidate has performed as AFD-admin and accordingly vote. To answer Durin's question on touching bases, I agree yes, the candidate should have a fair understanding on basic adminship duties policies before seeking adminship. This can also be tested through AFD questioning. After all all candidates must go though a manual before applying, don't they? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 13:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Not that it matters in the grand scheme of things, but why doesn't my neutral vote in Crum375's RFA show up in the summary above? I checked and it is formatted correctly. Obviously, this particular&#160;!vote doesn't really matter all that much, but if the bot could be miscounting or failing to find duplicates elsewhere, that could matter. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You should probably ask Tangotango directly about that. And, everyone should remember, we use the bot summary as a convenience, a reminder of what RFAs are due to need closing, and a general idea of how they are doing. When actually closing an RFA, we look at the actual&#160;!votes on the actual page, so it never matters what the bot reports. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 05:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the&#160;::: at the start of Crum375's reply confused it. I've fixed the markup there to #: (not only to unconfuse the bot, but so that any future neutral votes will be correctly numbered), and the bot recognizes the vote now according to the 'details' link (so your vote should show up next update). Hope that helps! --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:29, 20 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<p>Please see <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeadaphaia_3d95.html" title="User talk:Deadaphaia">User talk:Deadaphaia</a>. The user in question is remarkably similar to a blocked user on ja:wp with the same name who was blocked there shortly before this account as created. The ja user was obviously trolling and hoping to offend <a href="../../../../ja/a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" class="extiw" title="ja:User:Aphaia">ja:User:Aphaia</a>, a user who left en:wp not long ago for a different class of username reasons (see <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" title="User:Aphaia">User:Aphaia</a>).</p>
<p>After rebuffing a few requests by different people to change username, the user is currently stalling. I would recommend a temporary namechange until the user decides on a new name; hoping the user is not a troll but expecting that s/he may be and not wanting to waste more time.</p>

<p>I don't get why this is a rename issue. If the user is not willing to undergo a rename, and the username is inappropriate, block them. They will either decide to undergo the rename and be unblocked, or will remain blocked; either way, the probelm is solved. It's the same process we've been using for years, and I don't see any reason for setting a bad precedent of performing renames without the user's consent.

<p>The talk page of Chacor's failed nomination - <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Chacor_2_7fa8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Chacor 2">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Chacor 2</a> - has been the location of some minor soapboxing this evening. The talk page of a failed RFA is not the place to continue the discussion nor is it an open forum to be used as a soapbox. Would anyone see a problem with removing the thread in question, which was added several days after the RFA was closed, and protecting the page? I'm going to be bold and remove the thread myself ... but I don't want to step out of line on protecting the page. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aha! Now I see how you guys just HAPPENED to coordinate the fact that it was blanked and protected within seconds without it LOOKING improper. If you read WHAT I ACTUALLY WROTE, it in no way constituted "soapboxing"--at least not as represented by the Wikipedia page on the matter. I made it clear that all I wanted to be able to do was make my thoughts on the nom--and any future noms--for this user known, which violates no policy whatsoever. It was tag-team blanked, putting me at risk of 3RR had I reverted the inappropriate blanking, while--conveniently--allowing the ones doing the blanking to not be under any similar risk. Oh well. You all have enforced your censorship of a perfectly reasonable comment. Well-played. I'd still be interested to know the specific part of the soapboxing guideline I violated with my comments.<a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKscottbailey_c4a9.html" title="User:Kscottbailey">K.

<dd>The title isn't meant to be taken so literally. I know that SlimVirgin wasn't calling you a name. The point is be nice, and your comments on a closed RfA's talk page were hard to construe as constructive. They were essentially kicking a guy while he's down.

<dd>Actually the talk page of the failed nom is the place to continue conversation about that nom. The talk page should be unprotected and the user's comments replaced. If and when the conversation gets out of hand, turns into personal attacks or worse, then it should be protected. But this did not rise to that level. Just because you disagree with someone's comments does not mean you should remove them and prevent them from being made. I won't revert the protection and blanking of the comments without discussion, but if there is no discussion I will after some time for review. Now Mr. Bailey, you should also work to keep your comments as constructive as possible. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:09, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the comments shouldn't have been deleted, but I also don't see how they can be kept "constructive" if the page is unprotected. To be constructive, criticism needs to promote positive development or somehow advance the situation. Since the RfA is closed, there is no further development. There are no further advances to be made. And saying that he'll <i>never</i> support Chacor in a future RfA (the crux of the statement) can't possibly be twisted into anything constructive. He wasn't there to discuss anything; he was there to make a declaration. But he already had his chance to speak his piece, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Chacor_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113708737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Chacor_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113708737" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>That's hardly a chance to "speak my piece", Kafziel. It was simply a one sentence statement of my opposition. After further review, I wished to extend my remarks, but as the RfA was closed, I extended them through the discussion page, as per protocol. I was then tag-teamed (intentionally or not) and put at risk of 3RR if I had simply readded my completely appropriate comments, while those tag-teaming me, conveniently had only one reversion each. Then, the page was reverted once more, immediately protected via a request placed here, disallowing any further discussion on a page DESIGNED for such discussion. Whether you consider it a "declaration" or whatever, it was my right to publish it there. The page protection was inappropriate, given the facts at hand, and should be reversed, even if the famous SlimVirgin thinks I'm a "dick."<a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKscottbailey_c4a9.html" title="User:Kscottbailey">K.

<dd>You didn't need to be at risk of violating 3RR. Your position is much stronger if you simply stop and discuss instead of reverting. And don't say you were because you could have not reverted the material in and discussed it's removal there or elsewhere instead. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure where I could have "discussed" it--or even how--as the thread I would have done so in was being blanked, which was the source of the mini-controversy.

<dd>Good grief, there's no vast conspiracy against you. I didn't&#160;!vote in the RFA, because it was closed by the time I got around to it and if I would have, I would have opposed for the same obvious reasons that you opposed and 40-something other people opposed. Nobody reverting you was working together ... nobody is a part of a clique. I can't speak for any of the others involved, but I noticed your comment because the RFA was on my watchlist. There was no conspiracy - we all independently felt your comments were inappropriate. After reverting, I was inclined to protect the talkpage, but I posted a message here asking for a second set of eyes to validate that decision. The RFA is over - further posturing serves no purpose. If you would like to be sure to be able to oppose any future RFAs, add Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Chacor 3 to your watchlist. (You can watch pages that don't exist yet.) That way, if this page is ever created, you will be notified and will be able to offer your opinions. But as of right now, there is no RFA. There is no controversey over the manner in which this one was closed. In short, there's nothing to discuss. With all due respect to Taxman, I disagree with his view that discussion on talk pages of closed RFAs is appropriate. Unless there is some kind of meta-RFA issue to discuss (improper closure, sockpuppets, whatever), it's just a bad idea. Once an RFA is over, it's over. Rehashing the arguments serves no purpose except to create unneeded drama and get people upset. Wikipedia is not a battleground. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:10, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The standards at RfA are ever increasing. They never stop increasing. You put it at 1000 now, and people will go around making random AWB (or other scripted) edits to pump up over 1000. Any time you put in a bar, it's going to go up. Put it in now, and two years from now you'll be seeing complaints about why the bar isn't at 5000.

I understand the the pevious MediationBot, operated by Essjay, was also operated flagless, and as the use the same code.... <tt>:)</tt> <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 20:24, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bot edits can be turned off in watchlists (although they're on by default). Also, <i>minor</i> bot edits to usertalk pages don't trigger new-messages flags, although I don't think that's relevant here. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 14:08, 20 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>I'm not sure of <b>exactly</b> why the bot should be defalgged, except that I have been informed that the old mediation bot was. I suspect that many users, after a while, turn off bot edits in their watchlists, but mediators in particular often take great interest in the edits made by the bot to both case pages and the listing pages. I suspect that the underlying reason is that the bot is doing the job of an editor, and that its edits are often important to people when they see them on the watchlist (especially as it should be the only editor to the pending cases page, where new cases are stored). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 17:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The bot's page states that it is operated by the Mediaton Committee. I take it from that that the MC makes concerted decisions regarding the bot's functions. So the question would be: does the MC wants this to be left without a flag? If someone specific is responsible for operating the bot, then the question is directed to whomever it may be. This is only limited by one aspect: as Xaosflux mentioned above, if this is going to be left without a bot flag, then the pace of editing has to be limited. If this would not be desirable, then the bot would have to be flagged, unless some kind of understanding can be reached with the BAG, which are the people responsible for the technical decisions regarding bots. The fact that the previous bot was not flagged would not seem like sufficient reason, especially since MC members can still view bot edits on their watchlists simply by adjusting their preferences, unless they would like to see only this particular bot's edits, but not any others' (which doesn't seem like something that would cover every single member). If that were to be the case, we would just have to reconcile the individual preferences with the technical/policy-related limitations. But the decision can be very much of a practical nature. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 19:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I personally operate the bot, for the mediation committee. Personally, I have no problem with there being a bot falg in place, but have requested that it be removed on the request of the committee's chair, <a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a>. To get a wider consensus from the mediators on the issue, I'll make a post on the mailing list, pointing here to the valid points raised. The bot does have a fairly low edit frequency, and is throttled by the pywikipedia framework, so it is easy to restrict the edit rate, especially as the tasks are not really time critical. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 19:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reason we ran the original without a flag was because of that very issue, some people do have bot changes hidden on their preferences. Now, as to the speed of the bot...the bot is only set to run at various intervals, it's not running constantly, so the issue of "x number of edits within a minute" is rather irrelevant. The bot might make 5-6 edits max within a 2 minute period, then not edit for a good number of hours, if not a day or so. I had brought up the point of flagging the original MedBot with Essjay at some point, and that was his justification. If consensus is against what we have done previously, and the BAG does not agree to this, then we can flag it, but I would prefer leaving it unflagged, if at all possible. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">^</span><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">demon</span></a><sup><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User_talk%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User talk:^demon"><span style="color:red">[omg plz]</span></a></sup>&#160;<em style="font-size:10px;">19:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</em></dd>

<p>De-flagging this bot seems like a good idea to me. The MediationBots aren't very active, from what I have seen, but do spread important announcements around from time to time.

<li>Just a point in respect of office protected pages: we have some pretty clear guidance that we can proceed with due caution, as long as we make sure Foundation is kept informed. It's expected that people will be extra conservative with changes, and that the articles remain protected at least for now, but if we can expand an article within policy and the expansion is unassailably correct, then we can do so. This is not to be undertaken lightly, though, and I agree it's difficult when you can't contact the original office protector. You can find that your work is undone. But as long as the change is made in good faith, and from the very best sources, there is no reason not to proceed with rewriting. Or at least that's what Jimbo told me. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think this is a serious breach of process. BetacommandBot has many different task, and they are ongoing, the only task to be "withdrawn" is the newest task and that BRFA was done so due to an error in communication. the only "unapproved" task is the one that had a pending BRFA and that task was limited to <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a> subpages. revoking the flag is un called for. BCBot has over 80,000 edits and every issue that has been brought up with the bots actions have been addressed rapidly and effectively. My edits are not linked to the bots task. I did not run anything unauthorized under <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">User:BetacommandBot</a> check its contribs or its talk page. there have been no real issues with it other than very minor errors on <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUBST_6f53.html" title="WP:SUBST">WP:SUBST</a> or at categorization error in a wikiproject tagging run I ask that BetacommandBot be given its flag and alwoed to contiune with what it has been approved for, and if there is a request for a de-flagging we have a discussion about it. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 15:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

You still haven't got approval, but it's been mentioned that you can use the bot account to run in semi-auto mode (which is presumably what you were doing with those substs; this is pretty much what you've linked above as the Archive2 link). The Archive3 link you give is still only approval for a semi-auto bot. Will you confirm that all your edits with the bot, apart from those approved in the three newer BRFAs (including the approval-withdrawn one, because it was approved at the time), were semi-automatic? (I notice that none of the approvals so far seem to mention <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_Log_405c.html" title="User:Betacommand/Log">User:Betacommand/Log</a>, which seems to be for AIV-related work, but as that's in your userspace it doesn't matter so much.)

<dd>The flag can be removed if the bot has no remaining tasks that need a flag, surely (but you're right that it should be flagged at the moment, I missed the Archive3 request for semi-auto substing, because it wasn't linked anywhere relevant to the bot).

<p>A request has been made to restore the bot flag. I have been watching this flurry of activity and trying to help make sense of it. Temporarily blocking a bot and/or removing its flag seemed like a resonable thing to do at the time, and it's not that serious. There is apparently a misunderstanding as to what tasks the bot was approved to do, and some others made the good faith assumption that since the latest task was not denied that the bot no longer had any approved tasks. Given the above discussion, that is apparently not the case. I have not taken the time to look into it deeply (lack of time mainly), but the arguments on the surface seem reasonable. That said, the correct result of the controversial actions by Betacommand should have been to block Betacommand's main user account (and as a result also the bot) under bot policy. If anything, Betacommand was given a lighter reprimand by only having his bot disabled. At the moment I'm not willing to unilaterally authorize the restoration of the flag unless another BAG member agrees that it is a good idea. Taking some extra time to review the previous approvals will not hurt anything. The current bot tasks are not mission critical. As I have time I'll review the evidence and perhaps change my somewhat neutral position. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 17:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict; this comment is in reply to Nichalp's) I think the point is that the bot was approved for more than one task (only one of which has been unapproved; there's still an approval for semi-auto substing), and was also running some unapproved tasks that also need a bot flag (such as full-auto substing). So to answer your question above, yes, the bot's doing lots of different things. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:47, 22 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>(edit conflict; this reply was aimed at Ram-Man to aid research, but also serves to answer Eagle 101 as it happens) A summary of my research into the last month's and early contribs of BetacommandBot suggests that the bot has been used with approval to add WikiProject tags, stretching its approval to add {{infobox needed}}, with now-withdrawn approval to update subpages of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, without approval to update <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_Log_405c.html" title="User:Betacommand/Log">User:Betacommand/Log</a>, without approval to update external links to Google's IP, and to subst templates automatically when the bot was only approved for semi-auto substing. (I'm not sure whether the CSD work was approved or not.) The bot also exceeded edit rates (managing 51 in a minute at one point). --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:53, 22 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<dd>(ec)And at the moment I am unclear as to whether those various tasks that bot are currently doing are all approved. But in any case, the link that Nichalp shown does suggest that approval for the entire bot was removed, not just for that task, however, yes, asking would be appropriate here. I did not authorize the removal of the bot flag and will not authorize its reinstatement either. But the fact is, the main user account was editing very fast, bot like, and under bot policy should have been blocked <i>immediately</i>. If a main user account gets blocked, we always block its associated bots.

<dd>The bot is currently <i>not</i> blocked as far as I know, hence why I'm wondering about this whole removal of bot flags. —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101"><font color="navy"><b>Eagle</b></font><font color="red"><b>101</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">Need help?</a></sup> 17:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The bot <i>was</i> blocked for a short time. But whether the flag is removed or it is blocked is essentially the same thing: It is not authorized to run. If it does run without approval, it will be blocked. Now, the post above clearly indicates an <i>allegation</i> of the bot having acted without approval. As a result, temporarily deauthorizing a bot while we research the allegation is a perfectly reasonable and normal thing to do. The flag was removed because User:Mets501 <i>appeared</i> to have totally deauthorized the bot (not the task). Perhaps this was mispoken, but we don't know that at the moment. <b>Correction:</b> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABetacommandBot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABetacommandBot" rel="nofollow">block</a> was for a different date.

<p>With the above discussion in mind, I will authorize that the bot flag be restore <i>but only if</i> the bot is immediately blocked, since blocking is the more appropriate solution in this state and any administrator can remove the block when this problem is resolved. The fact of the matter is that both betacommand and the bot should have been blocked, and the main account only restored when Betacommand ceased his activities (which as Eagle 101 pointed out has been done). So if policy had been followed, the main account would be unblocked and the bot still blocked pending review. The bot should not be unblocked until the concerns raised by ais523 and Mets501 are addressed. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, since Mets501 <i>may</i> have totally deauthorized the bot, the block is justified as a replacement to removing the bot flag until he clarifies his action.

<dd>Yes, I think the original deflagging was based on incomplete information on my part (Nichalp came to the same conclusion as me based on my original evidence, but may have come to a different decision based on the evidence available now).

<dd>As I see it, a block would be justified without your additional concerns over unapproved operation, but with both issues, it is more than justified.

<p>To clarify things: Mets had posted this notice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FApproved_bot_requests&amp;diff=116872708&amp;oldid=116860744" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FApproved_bot_requests&amp;diff=116872708&amp;oldid=116860744" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. There he had mentioned that the bot needed a flag. However Essjay had already flagged the bot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=makebot&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABetacommandBot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=makebot&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABetacommandBot" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and I had initally assumed that it was an oversight on Mets part. After ais523 posted the message to unflag the bot here (first thread of this section 09:18, 22 March 2007), I had assumed that Mets could not have possibly approved the bot, and instead he probably wanted it revoked, and it was a typo on his part. And so I unflagged it. The re-flagging can alway be done if needed. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 18:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have blocked this bot for now as a formal bureaucrat action. Please do not unblock till all bot issues are resolved. To resolve this dispute, I would like at least *three* BAG members to have a look at the bot's working and confirm if it needs a flag or not. As for blocking Betacommand, that could be posted on WP:ANI, but I'm against it for now so that he can reply to posts here. I'm logging off for now, and will be offline for the next 10 hours or so. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 18:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to keep everyone waiting for so long for clarification. When I made the edit unapproving the bot, I was in fact only unapproving edits related to suspected spam and link removal. I do support the blocking of this bot for now, until all issues are worked out. I am going to go through the history of Betacommandbot's edits now and compile a list of all the problems I can find with it that need to be resolved. —<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 18:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not in favour of blocking Betacommand; that would be punishment not damage prevention. His bot is a different matter. However, there are obviously several issues which need to be addressed fairly urgently (approval of his other bots, approval of clones for the fairly uncontroversial task of simply <i>listing</i> possible spam, BAG membership). I prefer to keep wiki business on-wiki ordinarily, but I've emailed some other members of BAG to point out the issues we need to deal with and to make some suggestions; at least one of them is a little sensitive. Just to say we are discussing it and will report back soon. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. It seems that this user, Sango123, is not being very active as a sysop for more than 6 months. She might probably retired from editing Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. If possible, please desysop Sango123 because of her inactivity. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Admins don't get desyopped for inactivity. And there are admins who have been gone much longer than Sango, not quite sure why you picked her out. <b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><span style="color:blue">Majorly</span></a></b> <a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><sub style="color:green">(o rly?)</sub></a> 00:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, z.e.r.o., that is not helpful. To the contrary, there are no policies and there probably will never be polices to support that. <b><a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023"><font color="green">Cbrown1023</font></a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../c/b/r/User_talk%7ECbrown1023_2bb6.html" title="User talk:Cbrown1023"><font color="#002BB8">talk</font></a></b></small> 00:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>z.e.r.o. — what purpose would it serve to desysop inactive admins? It's not like we have a limited number of accounts we can give the tools to. Plus, if someone hacks into her account and abuses the tools, it's a quick fix. This is just excessive process. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 01:22, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not for removing sysop tools from inactive users, but is there any way the number of inactive sysops could be tracked? The reason I'm applying is because there seems to be a big need for new admins. Maybe if regular users had a way of knowing lots of admin were inactive they might self nominate on the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>. I'm pretty sure my nomination isn't going through, but there could be editors who would but aren't trying because they don't see the need.

<p>Hello, I'm sorry to have to bring this up but a rather ugly situation has developed proximate to my <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>. To save your time I think the fairest way to sum up the issues in as brief a manner as possible would be to say: The accumulation of concern for <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother's</a> behavior on the part of myself and several others causes me to worry about whether or not it is appropriate for me to continue my RFA. I realize my approval looks pretty dismal as it is, but I had planned on letting it run it's course because things could change in the next couple of days. Thank you, and again I'm sorry to be the cause of any trouble. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I think that, unfortunately, it's too far gone to succeed. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 23:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess my question was more about whether the conflict between myself and <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> is something that has created an unusual situation. I know it might look like stubbornness but unless the whole community has voted, there is no reason to give up until time runs out because there is a slight chance of a change. (Of course I won't give an overdue reminder in that eventuality, I'll remove it then myself.) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:30, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bureaucratship has always been an extraordinarily difficult thing for a user to achieve. Yet more than half with the tag never use the tools after getting them. There should be some standard, like with stewardship, that if you do not use it, you loose it. The last time I broached the subject, fifteen months ago, certain inactive crats complained that they are never around when an RFA closes. But there is always a small backlog at WP:CHU that needs work. I really believe inactive crats, like those above, should have the tag removed. One could argue that it doesn't hurt to have the tag and not use it, but that doesn't work with Stewards and it should not apply to Crats either. Thoughts? --Jeffrey O.

<dd>I would agree to this. It does not make any sense that they have the tools, yet never use them. It's different to administrators because admin tools tend to be given out more freely than 'crat tools, and bureaucrats require extra trust than admins in general.

<p>I'm confused as to what this accomplishes.

<dd>There is no way to tell. But certainly, the first six, all who still have the flag except Eloquence were hand-picked, not by community, but by Eloquence. We benefit that we have bureaucrats who are active in community discussions - certainly a 'crat inactive since 2004 would be astounded at <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">WP:100</a> RfAs, but they are a regular thing. They also hold powers that could be used more efficiently by someone else, who would actually use them to benefit everyone else. It just seems odd to hold such powers and not use them. If they are of no use to the user, I'm sure they would be willing to give them up. <b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><span style="color:blue">Majorly</span></a></b> <a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><sub style="color:green">(o rly?)</sub></a> 15:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I know crats handing out bot flags is fairly new, how long have they been able to rename users? If there are crats that haven't done anything since those 2 abilities were added, then they likely are not familiar with the relevant policies.

<p>On reading this, I was frankly surprised by how many bureaucrats we have that I've not only never encountered, but never heard of (or only heard of within the last month when a few 'crats who had not been using the 'crat tools seem to have gotten more active again). Notwithstanding that, I generally agree with the comments in this thread to the effect that this is not a big problem. To me, the greater problem—perhaps the biggest problem we have—is not that bureaucrats and administrators stop using their tools, but that they leave the project and stop contributing altogether. Turnover is normal in any web project as in any part of life, but the rate at which we burn out and lose many of our most dedicated people has become a huge concern. I'd be interested to know <i>why</i> the people on this list have reduced or stopped their work as bureaucrats.</p>
<p>I also think it is important not to put bureaucrats who have pretty much stopped editing Wikipedia in the same category as those who may simply be playing a slightly different role. A list like the one above certainly should not include Tim Starling, who is a major developer (and may need the ability to work from all the different access level interfaces to do his job), or UninvitedCompany, who does dozens of checkuser runs each week (and checkuser status was probably conferred on him based on the community trust reflected in his election to 'cratship, so in a way it <i>is</i> a bureaucrat action, though not recorded as such) and is a member of the Arbitration Committee. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 15:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A nice analyisis. Bcorr and Linuxbeak both appear to have left the project, or are on long wikibreaks, and Cprompt has made fewer than 100 edits in the past year, and no logged admin actions either. I would agree tim Starling and UninvitedCompany are still very much active, just not in this particular area. <b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><span style="color:blue">Majorly</span></a></b> <a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><sub style="color:green">(o rly?)</sub></a> 15:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Hmm. I can see why some users would think that bureaucrats should be de-bureaucratted (is that even a word?) if they appear to have left the project, but then, the same arguments apply towards admins, and that has never picked up steam. At the same time, almost all bureaucrat nominations have one or two cases of users indicating that there is no more need for bureaucrats, that there's too many inactive ones, so... I don't know. Heh. Perhaps a middle ground is in order? Similar to voluntary adminship resignations, allow bureaucrats desysopped due to inactivity to "speedy request" the bit back to a bureaucrat if they want it? <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">cool stuff</a>)</sup> 18:16, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An addendum to that: they can be re-crated after they're active in the community again for x amount of time. Personally, I went on a sudden wikibreak for a full month, and only came back a couple weeks ago, and I've been <i>extremely</i> hesitant to start using my mop again, as I know some policies and whatnot have probably changed in that time, but I haven't kept myself up-to-date with them yet. If someone is gone for such a long time, I'd like to see them be back and active for a while (and show a strong understanding of <i>current</i> policies et al) before jumping right back in. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 18:48, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I think the problem is that you are trying to take a more general policy established at Meta and apply it to the English Wiki which has its own process called ARBCOM. Your question is hypothetical because it presumes that a consensus could be built via "reverse RFA". The problem with this hypothetical is that it presumes the consensus could be foremed without a massive vote against the process of "reverse RFA" itself. Many editors would oppose the "reverse RFA" on the grounds that it was "out of process".</p>
<p>If you really want to do this, you need to make a proposal out of the "reverse RFA" process that you have in mind, get consensus for that proposal and only then worry about whether or not there will be a bureaucrat that would participate. If you're looking for a b'crat to give you a generic "yes, I would participate in that process" type answer, I suspect that you would really need to spell out how the "reverse RFA" process would work before you could get an answer.</p>
<p>Even then, I suspect that most if not all bureaucrats would want to see that the new process was based on consensus, not something you thought of at school one day (oh, sorry, that means something else, doesn't it).</p>

Requiring Arbcom to do this does not appear to be a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="meta:foundation_issues">foundation issue</a>, so a clear consensus could change the policy here pertaining to administrators (it is afterall "no big deal"), but the way to do that is not via a test case, but by using the policy process. Recent debates (such as the ones over RFA Reform) have made it pretty clear that the administrator status policy is unlikely ready to change. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype">xaosflux</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A "trial by fire" of this nature would have two problems: the sensitivity of the issue at hand itself, and additionally, the opposition of users to using a different method to desysop a user. We can remember <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Stevertigo1_0ec7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Stevertigo1">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Stevertigo1</a>, and how the community <i>loudly</i> opposed intermingling one process with another.

<li>The problem is this: if there is a recent major incident that calls the trust of some admin into question, then the atmosphere becomes too heated to discuss a community deop process, because people on both sides will believe the other side to be biased and this will heat a lot of tempers. If there is <i>not</i> a recent major incident of that sort, then there's nobody to test the system on. So we have no feasible way of implementing this suggestion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#0000DD">&gt;<font color="#0066FF">R<font color="#0099FF">a<font color="#00CCFF">d<font color="#00EEFF">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed, without a change in policy, we cannot hold a "reverse RfA" and then ask a Steward to desysop based on that. Current policy on the English-language Wikipedia is that desysopping only happens in very specific circumstances — and in the case of involuntary desysopping due to inappropriate behavior, current policies establishes that it takes a decision by the ArbCom for it to happen. A policy change would be required beforehand if something like this were to be done.<br />
However, I would note something that has been upheld even by Jimbo himself: this kind of procedure, given the current state of affairs around here, could be detrimental to the role of Administrator. If all it were to take for a&#160;!vote to be held on removing someone's adminship, and usually in a badly charged environment, as noted by Radiant, were to be for someone to cry "witch!" then administrators would have a very difficult time making the more difficult decisions, and taking actions that are certain to annoy, or even anger, certain people. We should not force admins to chose between doing their job and keeping their job. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 14:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly? I don't think it had a chance in hell of passing (and had I participated in it, I would have&#160;!voted "Oppose"). Your attitude about the entire situation strikes me, a complete outsider to the whole thing, as a very <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">pointed</a> issue, to be perfectly honest (hell, even one of your supporters told you to ditch the chip on your shoulder).<br />
I don't think it was particularly horrible thing to leave it open, but I don't think it served much purpose, either; basically, I think you need to just accept the fact that you didn't have community support (regardless of what a Foundation staff member's opinion is).<br />
If you <i>really</i> want to show up all those who&#160;!voted oppose, I'd suggest dropping this and <b>concentrate on improving the encyclopedia</b>; your next RfA will then be able to pass on your actual merits, rather than people admiring your guts in not answering questions. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 19:59, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First and foremost, I'm not a bureaucrat; I'm merely an administrator (while I'd like to run a successful RfB at some point, I'm not convinced that now is the time). Just want to make that abundantly clear so that my opinion doesn't hold more weight or authority than it should (incidentally, it shouldn't hold any more or less than any other editor; admins and 'crats aren't above other editors, necessarily; they merely have access to additional tools, which is both a blessing and a curse...).</dd>
<dd>I'm not suggesting that people were opposing you because you don't do any encyclopedia building. What I'm saying is that if you actually work on the project for a substantial period of time, there will be all the fewer reasons to oppose you (if you'd like, I'd be more than happy to explain my hypothetical opposition to your RfA on your talk page; here is not the place for a largely unrelated matter). I also wasn't suggesting that your edits be for the <i>express</i> purpose of "showing up" people; it was more of a statement of what behavior modifications I think you need to make if you earnestly want to run a successful RfA.</dd>

<p>It could be interpreted as meaning they are already an admin by the time the crat gets there because the crat doesn't make the decision, they just recognise it and implement it in the software, so you become an admin as soon as your RfA reaches consensus. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:20, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
