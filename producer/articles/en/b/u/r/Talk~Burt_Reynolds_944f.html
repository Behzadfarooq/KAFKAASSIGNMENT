<p>Reynolds, on the Dinah Shore Show in the late 1970's, told a very poignant story about the one person who changed his life the most- Watson B. Duncan III- a professor at Palm Beach Jr. College. Reynolds attended FSU right after high school but was kicked out. He then came back to Palm Beach County, and enrolled in Palm Beach Jr. College. Reynolds stated that Duncan befriended him and changed his life. He then went back to FSU on a football scholarship. I had edited the article to tell this story but unfortunately someone edited it out. I would like to ask that person why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Find a source and I'll put it back up. There is no "Palm Beach Junior College", though there is a "Palm Beach Community College". I, for one, have never heard of him getting kicked out of FSU. Also, sign your discussions with ~~~~, so we know who is saying what. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 20:17, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your articles are wrong, Burt himself says he is from Waycross, if you watch the old Dinah Shore show, he stated it clearly on there, on Carol Burnett, he stated he was born in a small town in georgia ((not to mention his birth certificate is on file in waycross, georgia.)) While it is true his parents were living in Lansing prior to his birth, they were on there way to Florida when his mother went into labor and the stopped in Waycross at the local hospital for his birth. Although he only lived in Waycross a short period of time, he was born there. Forget, newspaper articles or biographies written by other people. If you watch any of his old interviews like i stated Dinah Shore, Carol Burnett, Mike Douglas, Johnny Carson and so on he clearly staes he was born in Waycross, but did not live there. Even in the movie (Stroker Ace) he had them add to the script a line where they are announcing him as "the man from Waycross, Georgia...Stoker Ace" not to mention his connection over the years to Ossie Davis which he felt a special bond to as fellow person born on the edge of Waycross(Cogdell) and alot of his earlier film being made around Waycross, or having to do with the Okefenokee Swamp, such as the theme song to "Gator" He has never made any comments about being from michigan.<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_Gremlin_ee91.html" title="User:Rogue Gremlin">Rogue_Gremlin</a>Feb 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, you have not consulted his autobiography. His family lived in MIchigan until he was several years old, so the story about him being born in Waycross while his family was on the way to Florida does not make any sense. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 23:45, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mr. Albury please provide the link to the page in his autobiography stating he WAS BORN in Lansing. If this cannot be done for any reason then there is NO valid proof over the links i provided, TY again, Oh and look down I added a few more links, and also would like to mention the word "birthplace" which is associated with where a person is born NOT a place where a childhood is spent. Not to mention a CONSENSOUS of 100% of the websites that are non-editable by users ( or that users cannot submit changes to be added)say his birthplace is Waycross.[User:Rogue_Gremlin | Rogue_Gremlin] Feb 11 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>The part that doesn't make sense is that he lived in michigan as a child, because of all the information ever recorded, he did not, "I can tell you I lived in michigan as a child in my autobigraphy that doesn't mean I did or even if I did, that doesn't I was born there". Plus this is an exact quote from Burt about his autobiography <a href="http://boomers.msn.com/articleES.aspx?cp-documentid=377192" class="external text" title="http://boomers.msn.com/articleES.aspx?cp-documentid=377192" rel="nofollow">"My autobiography is a good book, considering it was written in three days."</a> One thing though, Birth Certificates don't lie. Speak to the man himself as I have. Tons of autobiographies are ghostwritten in which wrong information is included, my suggestion to you is, speak to him as I have or if you can't do that, get the old tapes of the shows I mentioned sit back and watch the man himself say with his own mouth were he was born, or better yet call lansing and inquire about his birth certificate, then call the ware county health department, do some REAL research most of my research on Burt came by traveling to such places long before the WWW was around. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_Gremlin_ee91.html" title="User:Rogue Gremlin">Rogue_Gremlin</a> Feb 11 2007</dd>

<p>Try contacting the Waycross Health Dept. and inquiring about his birth certificate. Then try Lansing's, I can tell you for a fact it is on record in Waycross. Not to mention when I met him at a taping of "Evening Shade" and asked him personally if he was from Waycross, he clarified my question by saying "I am from Jupiter, but I was born in Waycross." And by the way I would just like to let you know I am not from Waycross, but from Florida and a very avid Burt Reynolds fan so I am a neutral party to his birth but upon visitng his birthplace and paying a visit to where birth records are held there, Waycross Health Department and inquiring they indeed stated his birth records are indeed on file there, I tried to buy a copy but was told it was not possible since I was not a direct family member. To verify their process, I called them later in the week inquiring about getting a friends birth certificate so I could make a plaque for her on her birthday, I was given the same response. Oh and the only proof I have seen from you was a link to your own site or to a site that can be edited by users. try the links i provided most notably the georgia encyclopedia and take a good look at where they get their information from ""A project of the Georgia Humanities Council, in partnership with the University of Georgia Press, the University System of Georgia/GALILEO, the Office of the Governor, and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education.""<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_Gremlin_ee91.html" title="User:Rogue Gremlin">Rogue_Gremlin</a>Feb 8, 2007</p>

I have several articles from the Lansing State Journal newspaper, that mention he was born here in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansing%2C_Michigan_86b2.html" title="Lansing, Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>.

<li>In his autobiography "My Life" (1994) on pages 5 thru 15, it pretty clearly states he was born in Lansing, Michigan. Which is my home town. I have links to information that i've found.

<li>With all due respect, this is not an article, but a biography with no sources. My guess is that Mr. Reynolds, early in his career wanted the image of a southerner, so he may have said he was born in Georgia. But his roots are in the north in Michigan. He wrote his autobiography after his mother Fern passed away in 1992, and probably got in touch with his roots again after this. Here's a link to a web page of mine of Lansing city directories that I compiled. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lugnut215/reynolds-family/directories.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/lugnut215/reynolds-family/directories.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../l/u/g/User%7ELugnut215_05db.html" title="User:Lugnut215">Lugnut215</a>, 10 May 2006</li>

<li>Don't know why his birth place keeps getting changed back to Waycross, Georgia from Lansing, Michigan. Does anyone have any real proof that Burt was born in Georgia, other than I saw on other web pages? I put listings of Lansing City Direcrories that people can verify. And below is a link to an index of mine of newspaper clippings and other stuff for more proof.<a href="http://www.geocities.com/lugnut215/reynolds-family/index.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/lugnut215/reynolds-family/index.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../l/u/g/User%7ELugnut215_05db.html" title="User:Lugnut215">Lugnut215</a>, 15 May 2006</li>

<p>Yup, I checked a book bio and the IMDB blew it again. His mother was described as coming from a WASP family, and his father wasn't Italian either. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 06:25, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Watching the History Channel the other day, it stated that it was " a misconception that Burt is of Native American decendancy, reinforced by the film Indian Joe" . This is in contrast to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>What are the facts?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well, I consulted a decaying, 80's book bio from my public library to find out about his supposed Italian mother. The book bio, which seemed pretty reliable and well researched, said his mother was of Anglo-Saxon stock and his father was Cherokee on his mother's (i.e. Reynolds' paternal grandmother) side. The Cherokee thing is mentioned in tons of sites all over the net, I'd imagine it is true. (Just search for something like "Burt Reynolds"+Cherokee on Google) <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 23:14, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Palm Beach Jr. College changed its name in the 1980's to Palm Beach Community College. I think almost all of the public Junior Colleges in Florida did so at this time.</p>
<p>The best source is his autobiography. He talks at length about Watson B. Duncan III turning his life around and getting kicked out of FSU (the first time).</p>
<p>Burt describes this as the seminal moment in his life. It would be a shame to leave it out.</p>
<p>Also, Burt was known back then as "Buddy" Reynolds. That's significant and I didn't see it mentioned in the article. Burt has called Sally Field the "love of my life". I didn't see that mentioned either. Also Palm Beach High School was in West Palm Beach Florida (not Palm Beach) at the time Burt was a student there. Also Burt was married to Judy for 18 months not three years as the article suggests. Hokeman</p>

<dd>If you want to use his autobio as a source, go for it. Just make sure you note it. (Funny you should mention his college nickname, I actually know people that still call him "Buddy".) And the Sally Field thing could be thrown in there if you want to. I don't get involved with the tabloid type stuff in articles.

<p>While PBJC was in Lake Park when Reynolds dropped out of FSU, it may have moved to Lake Worth before Reynolds returned to FSU. PBJC opened on the Lake Worth campus in 1956, the same year that Reynolds returned to FSU, but I don't see dates for the two events within the year. I have seen pictures of Reynolds around that time rehearsing for a production at the Lake Worth Playhouse (a community theater). -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 09:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reynolds stated in his autobiography that he was born in his parents' home on Donora Street. Which is the street he was born on in Waycross,Georgia. Coincidentaly there is a Donora Street in Lansing,Michigan too.

<dd>Have you read Reynold's autobiography? He makes it very clear in there that his family lived in Michigan until they moved to Florida when he was about ten years old.

<p>There is disagreement on the proper way to indicate that sources differ on where Burt Reynolds was born. Burt Reynolds has stated in several venues that he was born in Waycross, Georgia. In his autobiogaphy, <i>My Life</i>, Burt Reynolds does not mention Waycross, but strongly indicates that he was born in Lansing, Michigan. there are reliable published sources for both birthplaces. 20:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Everytime I have ever seen an interview he says Waycross, he even talks about that being a huge bond for him and Ossie Davis. Also the stuff you added about his dad being drafted in 1941 is total bull, if you can get access to the military records database you will see as i can that yes a Burton Reynolds did enter the Army then, BUT it was Burton M. Reynolds NOT, Burton Leon Reynolds. plus in a interview after his book was released he talked about his book being made, and that he all he did was over the course of 3 days he told all his stories into a tape recorder, and turned them in for a big paycheck, Because at that time he needed the money. The book was ghost written.68.16.11.98 17:57, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have never seen anything from a reliable source indicating he was BORN in Lansing (it does NOT say he was BORN in Lansing in his autobiography), in fact until I started coming here I had never even heard that, and shortly after was when someone submited to IMdb(IMdb lets users submit changes) to have there's changed. I have been a devout follower of Burt's career for well over 30 years. One person on here included a link once saying it was in a newspaper interview with Burt saying he was from Lansing. But if you paid to join that newspapers website, It was NOT an interview with Burt, It was an interview with someone about Burt. I have almost all of Burt's interviews on VHS, He always states he was born in Waycross. In the movie "Stroker Ace" he had a line changed, to say; "The Man from Waycross, Georgia, STOKER ACE". If you call the Waycross Chamber of Commerce the will tell he was born in Waycross and is on record as such. If you call the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce the will tell you they heard it as a rumor but they have nothing on record. That alone should dispell the myth. not to mention, All the major encyclopedia's credit Waycross as his birthplace.

<dd>This is a source of heated debate amongst editors on Burt's page. There are a couple of seemingly reliable sources in cyberspace that list Lansing, Michigan as his birthplace, but overwhelmingly by more than a 10:1 margin Waycross, Georgia is listed as his birthplace in references. In the late 1970s, I remember seeing Burt on the Dinah Shore show talking about growing up in Palm Beach County. <b>I distinctly remember him saying that he was born in Waycross, Georgia</b>; and that his dad had been the police chief in Riviera Beach, Florida and prior to that was a high ranking officer in the Waycross Department. I don't remember him ever mentioning anything about living in Michigan as a youth - only Georgia and Florida. That's my two cents on the subject.--<a href="../../../h/o/k/User%7EHokeman_4f7d.html" title="User:Hokeman">Hokeman</a> 04:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not hiding anywhere. As I've seen lately there are more and more people who are seeing the bullyiness (for a lack of a better word). I guess in a certain person's mind I'm to blame for any edit that contradicts theirs. /// As I've tried to mention before, it's a matter of <b>Image vs. The Truth</b> of where Burt was born. He tells in interviews that he is from the south, which is fine. And has said he likes to reinvent himself. But there is much <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogical.html" title="Genealogical">genealogical</a> evidence in Lansing, Michigan, that supports that he was born there. How can someone just dismiss the scans of the Lansing newspapers as false? And that his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> as false too, he put his name on it, so he approved of the book, no matter if you believe he wrote it or not? Don't you think he would have or had someone else mention "Georgia" at least once in this book that has his name on it? And why in 1936, in the middle of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, would his family move to Florida. This makes no sense. I support any third party mediation. Good Luck, Mr. Albury! <a href="../../../l/u/g/User%7ELugnut215_05db.html" title="User:Lugnut215">Lugnut215</a> 20:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The link to that Lansing Newspaper was NOT and interview WITH Burt. It was an interview with someone else talking about Burt. Not to mention it was NOT an article conducted by the Lansing newspaper, it was an interview in a Palm Peach newspaper used on the Lansing Newspapers website. Furthermore neither of those are genealogical evidence. And like most people out there, I'm willing to bet you Burt did not have final editorial approval on his book.(Which by the way NEVER says he was BORN in Lansing. The book does not say where he was born. Also Burt never tried to re-invent himself by saying he was from Waycross, he has in every interview on TV said Waycross his only refernce to Michigan is that is where his parents where from, and when you see the man say he repeatedly he was born in Waycross, where as I know you did not she him write it. You may have read his book, but did you watch him write it? I think not, therefore I will beleive what I saw him say. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_Gremlin_ee91.html" title="User:Rogue Gremlin">Rogue Gremlin</a> 22:37, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also Lugnut I went to your website which is all wrong, all your references are to Burton Milo Reynolds which was not Burt's dad, Burt's dad was Burton Leon Reynolds and just incase you try to say there couldn't be 2. In just one random birth search on 1 site I found BURTON A REYNOLDS, BURTON C REYNOLDS, BURTON H REYNOLDS, BURTON H REYNOLDS, BURTON H REYNOLDS, BURTON K REYNOLDS, BURTON K REYNOLDS, BURTON L REYNOLDS, BURTON M REYNOLDS, &amp; BURTON REYNOLDS 6 of them over 70 <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_Gremlin_ee91.html" title="User:Rogue Gremlin">Rogue Gremlin</a> 04:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please note that Reynolds does not mention Waycross at all in his autobiography. He talks about his parents meeting and marrying in Lansing, about being born in his parent's house on Donora Street, about his father's parents living on the street behind them, and about returning to Lansing from Fort Leonard Wood after his father was shipped off to Europe. Burt Jr., his mother and his sister spent most of the time Burt Sr. was in Europe at his mother's grandparents' farm, but they met Burt Sr. in Lansing when he returned from the Army. The move to Florida came early the next year, and Burt Jr. describes the car ride down without making any mention of Georgia. He does say that they crossed the Smokies and took U.S. 1 down to Florida, so they presumably traveled through Waycross, but he doesn't mention anything about it. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 23:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is also a discrepancy as to when Burt Sr. became a police officer. Reynold's autobiography states that his father first became a police officer two or three years after they moved to Riviera Beach, Florida, and that he became the police chief when the previous chief, who had recruited Burt Sr., died. Reynolds says that his father was stoking boilers when he met Burt Jr.'s mother. He apprenticed as a toolmaker, but lost a finger in a lathe. Reynolds also says his father "dug ditches, unloaded steel, worked in the automobile factories". His first job in Florida was building houses. Burt's parents were running a lunch stand when Burt Sr. joined the Riviera Beach police department.</p>
<p>We have here two quite different, often contradictory, versions of Reynold's early life. As both versions come from Reynolds himself, and can be attributed to reliable sources, we are not in a position to pick one over the other. We need to cover both versions in the article. We need to do so in a neutral manner, and we need to be sure that every single statement is attributable to reliable sources.</p>
<p>I intend to add more material to the article from Reynold's autobiography. As this material covers his life after he started Jr. High School, there should be little controversy about it. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 00:43, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
