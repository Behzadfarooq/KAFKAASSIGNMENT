<p>The article comes off as an amateur brochure. This is a place for encyclopedic information. Most of it was clearly written by people who have been and are excited about it (which is fine, but you shouldn't be able to tell that from the contributions) One of the most obvious offenses against encyclopedic content is the "advice" sprinkled here and there. Please leave that kind of stuff out. I'm going through, and taking out the most obvious unencyclopedic information, but the whole article is written in a tone that is not appropriate for a encyclopedia article. I'm not even going to get into the citing problem.</p>
<p>I would like to see this one day become a featured article (at its current state it should have never even been considered). This isn't going to happen if people excited about the event come here and write in a way that makes it obvious its coming from a participants point of view. This isn't a place to learn what to do and what not to do on the Playa. Its a place to learn <i>facts</i> about burning man. It is not a place to get advice, or to initiate the uninitiated. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 23:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is well known that those are some of the few things on sale at BM. I'd be suprised if the BM website doesn't have info on that. But in this case I'm prepared not to object because the article needs so much work, and its been languishing in this poor state for so long, and it is so prone to being altered by enthusiastic burners in a laudatory or brochureish style. Maybe its good to make an exception for this article about lack of sourcing not being sufficient grounds for deletion for now. At least until the article improves and the cited information starts to outweigh the uncited information. There are so many published articles about BM that there is really no excuse for things not being sourced. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 07:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My take is that by moving content to the Discussion page, it isn't being deleted as much as it is giving people an opportunity to find a source which makes it acceptable for inclusion in the article...

<dd>Burning Man participants often call themselves "burners". <i>Although this usage may vary with region, a burner is an annual denizen of Black Rock City, and anyone who embraces Burning Man as an expression in sync with their own identity is a burner. In general, the term's use is only practical in contexts outside of the event itself. A burner is usually someone who has been to the event and aspires to return, even if only in spirit. The concept also implies the sentiments and values inspired by the event itself, including a high regard for creativity, especially radical self-expression, and willingness to participate in a gift-based economy.</i></dd>

<p>Does anyone know a good published article about sexuality at burning man? I bring this up because the reference to BMs reputation for sexual promiscuity was in the <i>Policing and Regulation</i> section, where it doesn't really fit in because it has nothing to do with policing or regulation (aside from public sex). I moved it to the "Community" section, where it barely fits in really (along with the clothing optional bit, which also barely belongs in the community section), but I would think that a section on Sexuality would be good. But I would like some published material to reference before I create a whole section. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 07:27, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not a lab experiment. It's a community experiment. Of course it should go in community. This no longer reads like a bad travel guide. It reads like critics who haven't visited BRC.</p>

<p>The bit about it being related to Wicker Man should be sourced too, since Harvey has disavowed it. But I guess it can slide for now since it says it says he has disavowed it.

<p>This article is partly very well-written, but it sure does need cleanup. I have removed the misleadingly titled section "Decommodification" (!) along with its low-value footnote links: some are mere spam (advertising), some fail to address the claims made, some are to pure how-to pages like bus timetables and ticket sales (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to guide). Also nearly the whole "Travel" section--sorry, but how to get there and how to get around in there, and so on and so forth, just aren't fit topics for an encyclopedia article.

<dd>I put a bit of time into reworking the decommodification section. The links aren't footnotes, they're references. They're not there to advertise, they're their to demonstrate the level of decommodification that Burning Man holds itself to. It's certainly open to criticism, but the fact of the matter is that it's <i>not</i> travel brochure information... For these reasons, I've put the decommodification section back. Please rework it, if you care to, but don't just delete it. I can support the removal of the travel section. <b>—<a href="../../../x/s/g/User%7EXSG_e8da.html" title="User:XSG"><span style="color:#F08000;">X</span></a><a href="../../../x/s/g/User_talk%7EXSG_cf91.html" title="User talk:XSG"><span style="color:#400040;">S</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xsg_d6a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xsg"><span style="color:#800080;">G</span></a></b> 06:29, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see what this company have to do with Burning Man. Isn’t this company a capitalist venture...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Burning Man is not a money-free workers paradise. GT gives shuttle rides to and from the event from various cities and to and from Gerlach during the event (yes, for a price). It could be argued that its not a significant thing to put in, but lots of things at BM are "capitalist ventures"--ice, coffee, and ticket sales for for example. (as an aside the no commodification thing isn't a political stance on BMorg's part, its simply a way to keep the event from being overun by vendors. The event isn't a promotion of some Utopian vision of a workers paradise--hehe more like a temporary bourgeoisie paradise if anything. ) <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 23:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BM itself is a capitalist venture - it's run by a for profit LLC <a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJpettitt_4202.html" title="User:Jpettitt">Trapper</a> 07:58, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please keep see also section limited to directly related articles. Famous attendees (Harrod Blank) and festivals having some remote similarity to BM (e.g. Rainbow Gatherings) don't count, as there is no direct relation between the two events, other than having a few people that probably attend both. The see also section would get out of hand if we included every festival that was remotely like BM.<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 23:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean this article isn't supposed to be all things to all people?! &#160;;) You've done a great job monitoring and maintaining, Brentt.
