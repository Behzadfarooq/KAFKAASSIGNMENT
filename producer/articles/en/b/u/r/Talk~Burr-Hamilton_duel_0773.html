<dd>how do you justify that? are you expecting it all to be revealed as a hoax? that has to be the only situation that can make the connection between the hamilton-burr duel and the cheney accident irrelevant. since cheney is the only vice president to have shot someone while in office since burr, i can't see how it's <i>not</i> relevant. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupine_ec8e.html" title="User:Supine">supine</a> 00:14, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since Cheney's accident had no impact on Burr's duel, it doesn't belong here. Likewise, Burr's duel also had no impact on Cheney's accident. Even so, all the information you might want to document regarding the accident has a place in Cheney's article. Personally, I'm wondering why this topic isn't relegated to Wikinews. It hardly seems encyclopedic. If you want to study murderous VPs, then you'll be keen to research the traitor who joined the confederacy and fought many battles against the U.S. Spending time trying to related Cheney and Burr puts you at risk of falling into the "trival things for trivial minds" trap. More important issues are afoot these days. Have you noticed what the MSM has stopped covering lately? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to the previous comments (and to clarify my initial note), I simply believe it will be difficult to assess the Cheney situation with respect to the Hamilton-Burr duel until there's been time to reflect on its historical significance. That is, as the details are revealed, and the Cheney accident moves beyond the headlines and into history, we should be able to get a better grasp of the relationship of that situation with the Hamilton-Burr entry. <a href="../../../u/c/s/User%7EUcsbalan_58ef.html" title="User:Ucsbalan">Ucsbalan</a> 03:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dick Cheney was the first sitting Vice-President since Aaron Burr to shoot a person. That warrants inclusion in the Hamilton-Burr duel article. The details can be referred to the Dick Cheney hunting incident link.</p>
<p>Now that the Burr article includes a category about VP's shooting people, we can remove the Triva reference here - a reference that actually had nothing to do with the Burr-Hamilton incident in the first place. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 02:43, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removed Cheney reference per reasoning at the Burr article. Community consensus, as well as common sense, is clearly against it. It confuses the issue and isn't relevant. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 05:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the best features of wikipedia is that you can start reading an article about <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples.html" title="Apples">Apples</a> and end up in an article about <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja_rocks.html" title="Ninja rocks">Ninja rocks</a>. See <a href="../../../b/u/i/Wikipedia%7EBuild_the_web_9cc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Build the web">Wikipedia:Build the web</a>. I for one am sick and tired of single users deciding that events which get huge amounts of coverage in mainstream media are simply not notable. Perhaps it is true that you personally do not care about them. But that does not mean that they should not be included in the project. I dare you to propose <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident_579d.html" title="Dick Cheney hunting incident">Dick Cheney hunting incident</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Whittington_84d1.html" title="Harry Whittington">Harry Whittington</a> for deletion. It won't happen. There is an obvious connection between these events. A Vice President shooting someone is inherently notable; we don't need to wait 10 years to figure that out. There should be some mention of this in the article. I propose a simple, "See also" section. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 04:51, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make many good points. The easiest way to handle this would be to go with a category. This would allow easy to follow cross-links between a variety of articles. However, when you look at the RCD voting record for the VP Shooting categories, it is clear that the majority of voters don't agree, with some expressing very strong feelings against the idea. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 06:11, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the creator of this article, I'd appreciate if you at least <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a> and stop making personal attacks by calling other editors "adolescent" (leaving aside the fact that younger editors frequently make quality contributions). In any case, the current events related vandalism has stopped entirely. I added a much popular culture section to the article and I feel that is the appropriate place for a link to the Dick Cheney hunting incident. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 19:55, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the Cheney thing was hashed out months ago. Most editors agreed not to screw up articles on historical people with contemporary matters.

<dd>Please don't be a historical imperialist. This is clearly notable. The duel is one of the most recognizable events in popular culture and this is a perfect example of this. The category is obviously not necessary for only two entires. One of the main features of Wikipedia is the ability to link between articles. One of the things that many people (me included) love is that you can start out reading about one thing and end up somewhere else. What I added is notable and sourced. And it comes with a nice image. It's not "screwing up" an article to add information about its current relevance. I suppose it would be screwing up the article on Isaac Newton to note that Stephen Hawking holds the same professorship that he did—what trivia! The consensus that you refer to was not clear cut at all and most editors were referring to vandalism by Dick Cheney hunting incident enthusiasts, not my edition. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 20:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems like a good example. There is no reference to Hawking in Newton's article. There exists a reference to the <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucasian_Professor_74b8.html" title="Lucasian Professor">Lucasian Professorship</a> in the Newton article, but Newton actually held that chair, so it makes sense. Hawking holds that chair now, so it's appropriate that both men should appear in the Lucasian professorship article. The article in question here is the Hamilton/Burr duel. Following the Newton/Hawking logic you brought up, there is no need to mention Cheney in the Hamilton/Burr's duel article. Cheney wasn't there. Cheney wasn't dueling. Cheney and Hamilton were both Vice Presidents, so it seems appropriate that both Hamilton and Cheney should appear in the U.S. VP article - and I assume they do. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, I didn't check that article before posting. It comes and goes in both of those articles. My point is simply that the plural of trivia of history. There are many history articles with "popular culture" sections, several of which are featured. I don't think that anyone supporting the addition claims that Cheney was president...perhaps another example: <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a> was the first Cardinal Secretary of State to become pope since <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_IX_55fe.html" title="Pope Clement IX">Pope Clement IX</a> (this time I actually know its included!). The daily show is just one example. A lot of media coverage equated the two events. I think that this can be done tastefully without degrading the quality of the article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 20:39, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's another great example and reason for omitting the Cheney material from this article. Pius XII does not appear in the Clement IX article except in a box listing all Popes. Clearly Hamilton and Cheney belong in a box together listing all VPs - and that's pretty much it. Trivia equals non-notable - and we really don't need to junk up perfectly good articles. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theres nothing non-notable about the fact that two and only two vice presidents have shot people while in office. What's more, this is not just about the facts currently in the article but about the larger issue of the depictions of the duel in popular culture. From your comments here, it seems like you want to omit all of that, which I feel is a big mistake. That having been said, I will not stop you if you remove it. It was not my intention to get into a lengthy dispute over this issue and I feel that I can do a lot that is uncontroversial to improve the article instead. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 22:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aside from the edits in question above, I think you've made some really nice improvements to the article. The disputed edits revolve around adding an incident that occurred 200 years after the duel to the duel article. The fact that the two examples you provided make excellent illustrations against your case should convince you that the edit in question should be removed. Your unwillingness to discuss the matter and your threat to undo any changes is entirely inappropriate in this media. As an experienced editor, you know this. I suggest you sleep on this and reconsider. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:29, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Slept on it. Let me first clarify that I meant no threats. I intend to improve this article to featured article quality no matter how this small matter is decided. I think it should be included, but it is so low on my priorities compared to the imcompleteness of the events of the duel that I am willing to overlook it for the forseeable future. To be honest: I thought only hard-core Republicans would oppose linkages between the two articles. Having found out that its not the case, I have decided to fight my battles elsewhere. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 06:54, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Savidan. Ideally, the source of a good idea isn't relevant to the idea. However, we don't live in an ideal world, and I would hold an idea suspect if I knew its source had strong biases. In short, it's hard to assume good faith from a strongly biased editor. Past performance is a good predictor of future behavior in humans, and it certainly justifies an idea's closer scrutiny. I don't think this means Savidan would have blindly opposed the edits had he thought they came from a biased source. I do think it means that he would have gone to greater efforts to ensure that the edits were appropriate. I also think this is fully appropriate.</dd>

<dd>I also think neutral (well, all) editors should be able to answer a challenge to their ideas. Occasional concession is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of learning. It is also the mark of a trustworthy peer. If I know an editor will concede a point when he or she has seen it in some new light, I am likewise willing to trust that the arguments they make are dedicated to learning and not to obstinacy or ego, though academia sadly runs rampant with both. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 17:59, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well clearly, good sirs, this calls for a gentlemens duel. The winner shall be entitled to either insert or ban the said remarks as it relates in our present time to the aforementioned fiasco of our good Vice President, Mr. cheney.

<p>I've passed the GA nomination for this article. A few comments toward future FA consideration: the introduction is much too short. It ought to summarize the context and significance of this duel, which is arguably the most significant in United States history. A good introduction for this article would be three to four times longer than the present introduction. I also doubt the "contemporary" illustration really is contemporary since the clothing depicted in the sketch is more in the style of the 1780s than the early nineteenth century. That looks like the kind of mistake an illustrator from several generations later would make. Finally the citations to online sources ought to include an access date so that readers can view the appropriate material on the Internet Wayback machine in case the referenced site changes. Other than that, good work and best wishes toward future FA status. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 16:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added a good deal of information off some excellent primary sources I ran across. If anyone else wants to check them out and help get this article to FA status, please read them and add in relevant facts. Here they are: <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/learning_history/burr/burr_duel.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/learning_history/burr/burr_duel.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/learning_history/burr/burr_duel.cfm</a></p>
<p>Also something that needs to be added is the role of women into this purely male occurance. Such as Hamilton's wife not even knowing of the duel taking place until after his death. I'll look for sources on that later.</p>

<li>Perhaps, too, a discussion of whether Hamilton actually alleged that Burr slept with his daughter Theodosia (H called B' <i>Savius</i> a vague Roman reference to that point).—<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 21:11, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A few edits on my part to correct what I feel is a pro-Hamilton bias and give this article a more neutral tone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The original section on the press statement claims that both Van Ness and Pendleton agreed that Hamilton fired first. This is simply not true, as original statement shows. The seconds DO agree that the shots were fired "within seconds of each other" (presumably instantaneously) than that Hamilton fell.</li>
<li>I moved the section about Burr's regrets about the duel away from the "aftermath" section into the "Burr's Intentions" section, as that section was previously entirely negative and concluded with one of Burr's acquaintances labeling Burr a "murderer."</li>
<li>In the "Hamilton's Intentions" section, I added in the detail that Hamilton chose a pair of dueling pistols which had very nearly killed Burr 5 years earlier in a duel with Hamilton's brother-in-law, and added in the fact that Hamilton specifically put on a pair of spectacles before the duel, and practiced sighting down his weapon.</li>
<li>I still need to add in a section about Burr inquiring about Hamilton's health upon returning home from the duel.</li>

<p>The founder of the above society wrote several works regarding this matter, for fairly obvious reasons, I think.

There is just cause for speculating, as I remember reading earlier, that Hamilton may have intentionally provoked the duel as a way to effectively commit suicide after he suffered serious financial reverses. I did myself have to write a theme in my first year at college on the subject, and as I recall the reconstruction of events could easily support that hypothesis. Don't actually know of any sources which make that point, though, but some might be found at the website above or by contacting the association. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 00:57, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not to play sides, but most academic sources (books, articles, monographs, historic signs, television documentaries) refer to Burr first in titling the duel. Typically duels are named challenger-challengee. Google is about even...785 for B-H, 782 for H-B, but many of the sites have both names, so it's largely a case of inconsistency.

<dd>Good luck with the article. Personally, I also heard of it as the Burr-Hamilton duel, maybe because Burr survived?

<dd>"Burr-Hamilton" is the more common name in my experience, which is admittedly much less than comprehensive. Whether it's the more common overall is another matter entirely. I do note however that Burr-Hamilton Duel seems to be the way it is referred to by libraries, given this entry in the St. Louis Public Library online catalog <a href="http://catalog.slpl.lib.mo.us/web2/tramp2.exe/authority_hits/A002j6pf.003" class="external autonumber" title="http://catalog.slpl.lib.mo.us/web2/tramp2.exe/authority_hits/A002j6pf.003" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 00:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's try to find a source comparing the two (Hamilton-Burr vs. Burr-Hamilton) before moving this. I seem to recall reading a few articles which have at least had footnotes comparing them. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:34, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I just noticed the move, and am astonished. I've always seen it referred to with Hamilton first-named, following the natural tendency to emphasize the more famous person. Of course, the usage, "Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr" is probably the most common formulation in books, but I am certain that the 200th Anniversary re-enactment and the historical sign in Weehawken both use "Hamilton-Burr". I had to miss the anniversary, so I will check with someone who may still have the program. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 06:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disapprove of the move as well, at least before clear consensus is established. I've always heard it Hamilton first, but I think such anecdotal concerns are irrelevant. The generic pattern of referring to the challenger first need not dictate Wikipedia's conventions, especially for famous duels. I'd ask ExplorerCDT to provide us with some more sources than St. Louis Public Library to vouch for the claim that Burr-Hamilton predominates in scholarly literature. When I get a chance I'll look over the Weehawken Historical Commission documents again, as I'm sure one of them addressed this issue. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 17:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's in one of the Weehawken Historical Commission articles.
