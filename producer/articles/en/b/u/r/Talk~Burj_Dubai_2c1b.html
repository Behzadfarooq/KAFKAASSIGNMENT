<p>I removed the portion that claimed that the design of the bulding is inspired by the flower Hymenocallis. The article described it as a native desert flower.

<dd>The 160 figure is probably the best estimate at the moment. It's been stated that they increased the height but never added more floors.Rahmalec 19:00, 23 January 2006 (GMT)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There have several interivews and lectures given by the Architect Adrian Smith as well as the structural engineer (whose name escapes me at the moment) which have quoted the building at "around 160 stories." In addition, the leaked building elevation on this page shows 160 or so and has been 100% accurate thus far, as the only part of the building that was altered was the superstructure above the occupied floors, as quoted in the article and its source.</p>

<p>I think the Image in the infobox (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Burj_Dubai_02.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Burj_Dubai_02.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) is NPOV. Yeah, a strange claim at first (yet it's an <i>artistic</i> rendering). My point: The clouds, their composition and the skylights on its side (normally not visible in broad daylight) make the building look overly dramatic, as if painted by Michelangelo himself. Can't we choose a less emotional pic? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:33, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is an architectural rendering, presumably created by the developer. Such renderings invariably showcase the best and most dramatic aspect of a building, and quite often at the expense of realism. However, they're also the only renderings which are generally ever made of any building, at least in advance. (The only exceptions I can think of are renderings made by anti-development advocates, which <i>certainly</i> cannot be construed as NPOV). Unless Wikipedia were to adopt a blanket "no renderings" policy, which I believe would be ill-advised, I think that this image should stand. I hope that the public is discriminating enough to understand that <i>any</i> rendering should be taken with a bit of salt. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 08:20, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are indeed less dramatic, but I do feel that they're less realistic as well -- and thus a less-true representation of what the final building will look like. Showing <i>no</i> lighting, sky reflections, or perspective, does not seem preferable, to me, to showing somewhat unrealistic versions thereof. And really, the current rendering, although certainly <i>idealistic</i> isn't <i>that</i> unrealistic. You're correct that the skylights on the side wouldn't be visible during broad daylight, but they would become visible at dusk, and a compression of several events into a single image is pretty standard artistic fare. And in any case, I'm quite certain that (provided I desired to show the building in a very good light) I would be able to take a photograph of the final building that would be every bit as emotional. (Part of my living is as an architectural photographer...) <i>Any</i> kind of artistic representation will contain this kind of emotion.</dd>

<dd>That said, I would certainly support putting a caption under the image, something to the effect of "Artist's interpretation of the completed Burj Dubai," to make it clear that this is an <i>interpretive</i> image, and not a literal one. And as the building becomes more recognizably complete, in perhaps six months or so, I would support giving the under-construction photographs more primacy in the article. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 18:51, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are WAY too many pictures relative to the size of the article. It is difficult even to properly read the text since the pictures clutter up the page so much. Despite that, I like all of these pictures and think that they're all relevant to the article. However, until the article is larger, I think we shoudl just move, shrink, or completely remove one of the pictures to make it less cluttered.

<dd>Another option is to use the &lt;gallery&gt; tag to create a series of small thumbnails that can be enlarged at the reader's discretion. If the images are free, we can also link to the commons, which would contain all images availabe.

<dd>It's usually best to remove pictures that don't really add much to the article. Any free images should be moved to the commons, and this page should link to them there, not display them.

<p>Does this question of necessity section strike anyone else as pointless? It would be surprising if any very tall building were built out of "necessity". In such cases the residences in the buildings (if there are any) are, as in this case, luxury appartments for the very wealthy, hardly a way of making extra space for those who are in need of a home. Such buildings are created and occupied for reasons unrelated to limited space, such as prestige. -- <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesoid_ffa2.html" title="User:Cesoid">cesoid</a> 18 November 2005</p>

<dd>Actually, many skyscrapers are built out of necessity, if you use a more colloquial definition of "necessity". They may not provide the essentials of life, but especially in major cities like New York or Chicago, skyscrapers are one of the few reasonable ways of adding more offices or residences to already highly developed areas. Those places have a very high population density and a similarly high demand for office space, and building new skyscrapers is usually the most effective way to satisfy that demand, so they could be considered necessary in that sense. I can see there being legitimate questions about whether a skyscraper of this nature satisfies any similar demand in Dubai. - <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooey_27ae.html" title="User:Flooey">Flooey</a> 09:08, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Maybe the term "necessity" is a bit too strong, but most big buildings have been built (in America at least) because of a strong demand for office / residential space and a limit on new building locations. Growth then <i>necessitates</i> building up. Not so in Dubai, they have plenty of empty desert in every direction and a small population (again, by US standards), and no real need to increase population density. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 19:45, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To me, the whole 'question of necessity' seems a bit of a question of necessity in itself, driven by a citizen of the US (perhaps residing in the Portland, Oregon Metropolitan area?!). Rather than just remove it, I believe it should be expanded and renamed as the section is correct in that the project is borne out of the UAE's desire to diversify from their core income (oil).--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Atkinson_6895.html" title="User:Dan Atkinson">Dan</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan_Atkinson_f691.html" title="User talk:Dan Atkinson">(Talk)</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Dan_Atkinson_a439.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Dan Atkinson">@</a></sup> 02:12, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the "Question of Necessity" section, the numbers that are being used are 10 years out of date. This seems inappropriate to me, particularly when the souce that is cited provides a more up-to-date estimate of the population (almost 3.5 million in 2002). Furthermore, the population of Dubai in particular has rather obviously been growing like crazy since 2002, so even using that figure would be something of a distortion. Finally, I must question the honesty of making this argument using the total population density of the UAE as a consideration, since most of the UAE's land area is completely uninhabitable. If there are third-party sources for this argument that we can cite, then I would support keeping it intact; otherwise, I'm sorely tempted to delete it under "original research" policy. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 20:22, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to adjust the population statistics, but I would recommend using actual census statistics rather than estimates when possible. (How often does Dubai have a census?) It's also important that the numbers are consistent with other wikipedia articles, which use the same numbers as this article. So you might want to correct those numbers first.</dd>

It believes that the tower, complemented by surrounding structures, will make an attractive proposition for not only the developer and residents, but also bring tourism inflow to Dubai and the country."</li>

<dd>All of the articles and discussions above, as well as others that I have found via Googling, contain vague, single-sentence questions, pertaining not so much to the Burj Dubai's necessity, but to the necessity of <i>any and every</i> super-tall building. In comparison to any of these sources, the "Question of Necessity" section is far more detailed and Burj Dubai specific, and as such constitutes unsouorced original research. Therefore I have deleted it.

<dd>Yes this is pretty important since the tower was redesigned and its height increased from 705m to something around 800m. I remember reading an interview with Adrian Smith and according to him it was redesigned in order to give a sense of acceleration. I also remember reading that the floor count has remained the same and that only the top has been redesigned. This is pretty clear from the new render since it looks exactly the same as the old one up to a certain point.Rahmalec 15:30, 22 January 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<p>...However, I do feel very strongly that the "Question of Necessity" section does <i>not</i> belong in this article. The "sources" which are mentioned above contain <i>absolutely none</i> of the information which is detailed in the "Question of Necessity" section, aside from a general apprehension about supertall skyscrapers. As such, it constitutes original research. Secondly, because this general apprehension is something that is expressed about <i>every</i> supertall skyscraper, it is relatively non-notable. Finally, identical "Questions of Necessity" have been directed towards the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai_World_Financial_Center_6530.html" title="Shanghai World Financial Center">Shanghai World Financial Center</a>, for example, or <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei_101.html" title="Taipei 101">Taipei 101</a> or the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petronas_Towers_2484.html" title="Petronas Towers">Petronas Towers</a> back in the day (especially the latter). Yet none of their articles mention that fact. It smacks of extreme POV to single out the Burj Dubai for such criticism, when its presence is otherwise not considered noteworthy in similar buildings.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the information of this section is 1.) Not sourced, 2.) Not notable, and 3.) Not NPOV, it doesn't belong in this article.<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 04:48, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While the information in the articles are not identical, this section is based on the same themes with different facts. Wikipedia will never have identical information to its sources, that's not even the point. The fact that I provided to sources in just a few minutes from major news sources makes the notion that this section isn't sourced highly suspect. You're suggesting that this isn't a, well, unique or controversial building in anyway, which simply isn't the case.</li>
<li>There are more references out there and I've seen entire discussion boards with architects (some arm chair and some otherwise) questioning why this project is being built. The two I quoted above were the first two I could find given a few minutes. We could find more, but that's not the point, the BBC mention should be enough by itself.</li>
<li>Your note that we should have to add this section to all previous tall structures (most of which are well less than half as tall and in much more dense cities) falls flat. If you think they all need this section before we can add it here -- then by all means go ahead and add them. Nobody is singling out Burj Dubai for criticism, it just happens to be what's happening <i>now</i>.

<dd>By the way, you seem to only be concerned about sources for this section (for which I've already provided two), why aren't you removing other sections such as "race for the top." This all started because you seemed upset that I removed speculation about the height based on nothing but a new rendering with a different vantage point, so you seem to be very biased in your application of demanding lots of varied sources.</dd>
</dl>
<p>--</p>
<dl>
<dd>The discussion of necessity has evolved quite a bit since I wrote the first comment about it. I'd like to clarify at least my own criticism of that section. In general what I meant to question was the internal logic, not something that you can get from research. While it is easy to argue whether there is a real reason to build the tower, and it would be pertinent to note such arguments if they exist, it would not be useful to reconstruct arguments that fail on terms of simple logic (unless you point out the logical shortcomings). As that section currently exists, I would have to agree that it's much better than before, but there are still some points that make it look more like idle speculation than a serious debate.
<ol>
<li>There are virtually no countries where the population density of the entire country has any bearing on the need to build skyscrapers. This article compares UAE to the UK, which, at a density of 246 people per square kilometer, could easily have it's population spread out into sparse one-story buildings. If there is more to this argument, it needs to be further explained in order to make any sense.</li>
<li>The population of Dubai as a total is pretty irrelavent without including the size (and therefore density), and other building restrictions of the city (geographic or otherwise).</li>
<li>The word "necessity" is far too ambiguous. It lumps together questions of profitability, space limitations, "economic necessity" (long term and short term), which are blurred together rather than separated as they should be.</li>
<li>The first sentence tries to link the decision to build the building directly with United Arab Emirates' attempts to diversify the economy, which seems an oversimplification. In reality many decisions by many entities lead to the beginning of its construction, and there could be (and most probably are) different reasons behind the decision to fund it, the decision by the government to approve it, the decision to market the idea in the first place, etc.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In addition to the above, I can't help but offer my personal opinion: The fact is that we're not just talking about the question of necessity for building a skyscraper, but for building a <i>very tall</i> skyscraper, which, despite all arguments presented, still seems difficult to justify in <i>any</i> city on terms of "need for more space". Maybe, for example, New York or Tokyo could gain a lot of space by having many tall buildings, but you have quite a bit of space to use up before you need to build a 160 story building, and, as you are likely to build only one or two of them, it really would hardly add anything to either of those city's total floor-space, relatively speaking.</dd>
<dd>If we can agree on the points above, I think it would be best to recast this section from an objective question of necessity, to a comparison of Dubai vs other cities with very tall buildings. No doubt there is some significance; Dubai has many projects underway (and some completed) that break world records and could be viewed as "extravagent". But any discussion of "necessity", it seems to me, can only survive if we include discussion of, or reference to, the known debate over whether there is any "need" to build such a building anywhere.</dd>

<p>I just like to add some point not raised yet: There is a necessity, and it's to "put Dubai on the map". It will make it as notable as Kuala Lumpur got thanks to the Petronas Towers. And another necessity is "to foster tourism in the region". Just my 2 cents. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 14:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I know I'm asking for trouble here, but the incorporation of population density as part of an argument for tall buildings is proving ludicrous. I'm thinking about this quote "due to the population density of Dubai, 293.94/km², many feel that there is a justified need for such skyscrapers to be built in the city". As comparison, the city I live in, Somerville, Massachusetts, USA, has a population density of 7,278.4/km², <i>it is 25 times more dense</i>, and yet seems to be doing just fine having mostly buildings of 3 stories or less, and no buildings at all that could be described as a skyscraper. Just try to imagine 293 people in one square kilometer for a moment, they have so much space that if you spread them out evenly they would barely be within shouting distance. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesoid_ffa2.html" title="User:Cesoid">Cesoid</a> 04:40, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes but <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerville%2C_Massachusetts_2253.html" title="Somerville, Massachusetts">Somerville, Massachusetts</a> has a population of only 77,000 and a total land area of 10 square kilometres. --<a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibran1_3d5a.html" title="User:Jibran1">Jibran1</a> 18:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, the argument is that the low population of 77,000 somehow renders the population density irrelavent? Population density is independent of size and total population, and so are the effects of crowding. Perhaps, because Dubai has a lot of land that is impossible to develop (like water or protected nature reserve), the population is crowded much more densely into one area, but simply arguing that a population density of 293.94/km² merits skyscrapers does not make sense on its own. To put this as simply as possible, it is not dense at all, in fact, it is so not dense that I'm skeptical about the number in the first place. I'm removing that argument.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, the discussion of the total population of UAE and comparison to the USA is almost incoherent in terms of relevancy, I can only imagine some very paper thin arguments as to why the total population of a country merits the building of a skyscraper. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesoid_ffa2.html" title="User:Cesoid">Cesoid</a> 00:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for pointing the quotes in that article out. You should integrate that first quote, in particular, into the "Labor Controversy" section, since it indeed contradicts the other information that is out there (including the title of the article: "Strike halts work at Dubai tower"). This counter-evidence, however, does not definitively refute the hundreds of other articles which claim that work on the actual tower was interrupted by the protests, so the section itself should certainly remain.</dd>

<p>Where is the strike on burj dubai tower itself? There is no such thing. Strike is by Al Naboodah workers (not involved in burj dubai) who are buildings surrounding buildings and dubai mall 72.129.170.249 20:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<i>"By the way, even if it is the case that the tower construction was unhindered while the surrounding Burj Dubai complex experienced riots, they are all integrated parts of the same development, and I think it's within the scope of this article to touch on issues that aren't 100% tower-related.

I feel that it is relevant enough for us to include the labor controversy information in the Burj Dubai article. However, I feel that it should be noted in the article that, (if proven to be correct), that this has not halted the construction of Burj Dubai, and the the following sentence should be changed till it can be verified: The labor practices used in the construction of Burj Dubai has caused controversy--<a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibran1_3d5a.html" title="User:Jibran1">Jibran1</a> 20:06, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I posted the reference from two newspaper (not</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>mention eyewitness accounts!) that this information is incorrect. These confusion by papers is due to the fact that Dubai mall (built by totally different company) is next building to burj dubai tower. By the way, where is your proof that Burj Dubai workers are getting $4 a day and no overtime? That fact also relates to Al Naboodah company whose workers are at strike. Al Naboodah is not building burj dubai tower! Basically everything in the paragraph is incorrect. Move this to the right relevent article -- which would be Dubai Malll 72.129.170.249</p>

<p>As reported by BBC and Khalij Times (plus eyewitness accounts), the work never stopped on burj dubai and is still continuing. The claim by most of these papers are just flat out wrong. Some of these papers who were reoprting that work at the tower was halted has correccted that claim (example: BBC). The confusion was due to the fact that workers at nearby buildings went on strike -- not on burj dubai itself. How many times do you have to be told this before it sinks in your head?</p>
<p>"The labourers have since returned to the construction site, but have refused to pick up their tools, <b>halting work at building surrounding the Burj Dubai</b>.

<p>What part of that do you not understand? Confirm eyewitness account has reported the work was never halted on the tower for any period 72.129.170.249 04:58, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yet again: when hundreds of news articles say one thing, and one or two articles say something else, it is inappropriate to simply declare that the overwhelming majority is "flat out wrong", without much more substantial proof. Actually, in any contentious issue like this, it is not the role of Wikipedia to decide which side is correct. Rather, the article should report <i>what people are saying about the issue</i> rather than <i>what "the true facts actually are"</i>. I have added some verbiage to the article which does this. Does this satisfy you? If not, then this is an issue for arbitration. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 06:18, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>72, thanks for your attention to this page, but please understand that what your friends see and reported back to you is not permissable on a wikipedia. It is considered original research. Right now the majority of evidence points to the labor issues as having happened at the Burj Dubai -- a few articles to the contrary is not sufficient to overturn dozens of other articles.</dd>
<dd>As for the article being biased -- there are several sections that are highly positive, one section that is neutral (questions of necessity), and one that points out some of the troubles with labor at the site. It seems to me you insist that this article be nothing more than an advert for the Burj. -<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 07:58, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article has anti-dubai bigotry. Where are the sections "Questions of necessity" for all other tallest towers that have articles on Wikipedia? If no other article has that section, why this article? Also, as pointed out, there was no strike on the tower itself but adjacent buildings (also confirmed by people who see the tower daily) -- but, as we see, the guy insist that that must be included in the article just because newspapers have incorrect reports. Basically, he claims that Wikipedia must not report the facts but whatever is reported by the newspaper, regardless whether it is true or false 72.129.170.249 06:50, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not feel that this article has 'anti-dubai bigotry'. There was a time that I did feel this in the 'Questions of necessity' section, and so made some changes to the article to attempt to make it more neutral, like adding the statement "<b>However, due to the population density of Dubai, 293.94/km², many feel that there is a justified need for such skyscrapers to be built in the city.</b>" This would give a more round view, in my opinion.<br />
Also, with no offence meant and in all due respect to you, I don't think personal eye witness accounts are a legitimate source of information on Wikipedia, as it would fall under the category of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The other two sources that you have mentioned seem to be noteworthy. But the fact is that there DO exist many other reputable newsworthy sources that have provided seemingly contradictory information, and I feel that it is vital that we include that information too in order to give a more round view, and so that the article includes all sides of the story.<br />
As for the neutrality, I would just like to mention once again that the article seems fair to me as it is including both sides of the argument (which is mandatory, according to Wikipedia's policies if both arguments are supported by a considerable amount of people), and giving fair representation to each side. I, on a personal note, have lived in UAE for 19 years ((11 years in Sharjah, 9 years in Dubai) and still visit it occasionally, and feel that I have a strong bond with the place. So if there was anything non-neutral about the article, I would be one of the first ones to put a NPOV tag on it.<br />
I truly hope hope that we can resolve this issue in a more amicable manner&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibran1_3d5a.html" title="User:Jibran1">Jibran1</a> 07:31, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I dont see any POV statements in the section. All claims are cited accordingly. No wehere in the section is it definitely claiming that the construction of Dubai was interrupted.<br />
Also, I urge you to please read through the 'Questions of necessity' section carefully. It is actually more in justification of the tower being built and less criticism. Thanks --<a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibran1_3d5a.html" title="User:Jibran1">Jibran1</a> 18:49, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>The main attraction of Madinat al-Hareer, the Mubarak al-Kabir Tower will stand at 1,001 m tall, almost twice the height of the current tallest building in the world Taipei 101, which is 509m tall, and considerably taller than the world's tallest land structure, the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, which is 629m tall. However it would not overtake the Magnolia Tension-leg Platform, an oil rig under construction in the Gulf of Mexico, which at 1,430m will be the -world's tallest- structure.</p>

<dd>The Madinat Al-Hareer is estimated to take 25 years to complete, after they start construction and they're still consulting with the Kuwaiti government regarding the construction.

    The actual figures from last year state that the number of expatriates is led by Indians, followed by Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and then more in smaller numbers from other Asian countries.

<p>in SkyscraperPage.com burj dubai had 162 floors.</p>
<dl>
<dd>nobody knows for sure, any true figure is like to just be speculation. We've also heard figures of up to 200 floors. They've said that there will be useable space up to floor 160 so that means there must be a few mechanical ones above that to hold elevator equipment, etc.</dd>

<p>in SkyscraperPage.org the burj dubai is 808 m (2651 ft). please change the heiht.</p>

<p>This pages lists the topout at December 30 2008 and the opening February, 2009. So, according to this, they are going to add all of the finishing to the building in 2 months. This would be unheard of for a normal sized skyscraper... how can this be? -<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 15:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your incorrectly stating that they will add ALL of the finishing during that time. However that isn't how skyscrapers are built. While they are adding floors onto the top, they are advancing construction on the bottommost floors. They add in the walls, glass, plumbing, insulation, and other construction materials and needs. So it is completely possible for them to accomplish this, if they top it out when about 90% or more of the building is already finished. --<a href="../../../k/c/m/User%7EKCMODevin_ae8a.html" title="User:KCMODevin">KCMODevin</a> 11:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Probably because it would structurally be impossible. Your talking about something that will be over 800m tall. No helicopter or crane could easily reach the top and raise it's height. And being so tall and slender, you can only go so high without effecting the building's weight and sway too much. THey would have designed it to hold it's spire at a certain height, to go any higher would probably be risking/pushing it's structure. --<a href="../../../k/c/m/User%7EKCMODevin_ae8a.html" title="User:KCMODevin">KCMODevin</a> 11:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Burj Dubai will not be over 800m tall. Sources below. --Magpie1892</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>Dubai, 21 Oct 2006.</p>
<p>The final height of the Burj Dubai will be just over 700 metres, not 808 metres, or the frankly ridiculous 900+ metres suggested by one of the subcontractors.</p>
<p>A phone call to builders Emaar confirmed this target height.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Upcoming article in UAE daily newspaper 7DAYS will confirm that Emaar confirms final height of Burj Dubai tower at just over 700m. So, sources: Emaar (the builders) 7DAYS (the article). Will alter height on main page after the article is published. --Magpie1892</p>
<p>- The evidence is plain as day that it has been upped from 705m to around 800. First of all check the burjdubaiskyscraper site, there's an article where Adrian Smith (the architect) himself says so. Also Check the renders, it's obvious the height of the spire has been increased.Rahmalec 17:30, 27 October 2006 (GMT)</p>
<p>Emaar, who are constructing the building, have confirmed that the Burj Dubai will be somewhere in the 'early 700s' in terms of metres tall. This, I would suggest, is plain as day, as you would imagine the builders to have pretty much a 100% say on how tall they are likely to make the project. When the article confirming this is published, the relevant changes will be made on the main page to correct the erroneous figures currently there. --Magpie1892</p>
<dl>
<dd>They confirmed the 700m figure 2 years ago. Since then the top section of the tower was redesigned as was mentioned in the interview with Adrian Smith. Also the 808m figure was taken from a contractor's website. The first actual renders of the new design were released around december last year. By the way here's an article where someone from emaar specifically says they've gone beyond the 705m height: <a href="http://www.cityscape.ae/PDF/CityScape_Review2.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.cityscape.ae/PDF/CityScape_Review2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityscape.ae/PDF/CityScape_Review2.pdf</a> . If that upcoming 7days article prints a 700m figure it should be quoted from an emaar official, otherwise the article means nothing. We've had plenty of articles, I remember a gulfnews one mentioning a height of 940m and that it'll have 200 floors.Rahmalec</dd>
</dl>
<p>As I understand it the article mentions both an official Emaar spoked person confirming final height of 700-ish metres. Additionally, the premise of the article is that a memorandum was circulated earlier this month between ALL of the subcontractors on the project which indicated that Emaar wished it to be known that the final height of the building had been revised to the original figure of just over 700 metres for a number of reasons. These two facts make the likely final height of the Burj Dubai just over 700 metres and when the piece is published I'll alter accordingly. As a rule of thumb, you're not likely to get accurate reporting on matters UAE from any of the government owned papers (i.e. all of them in the UAE bar 7DAYS) for obvious reasons. When the Burj Dubai is complete at 700-odd metres, it's almost a certainty that Emirates Today or Gulf News will report the height as 'just under 800 metres' or somesuch. You know it, I know it! --Magpie1892</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you're saying they're redesigning it again and bringing it back to the original figure? If that's true then it's pointless arguing about this, the only thing is to do is wait for official confirmation. If 7days do print such an article then emaar will definitely have to make a statement. That's not to say I'm disappointed if it does happen though since 700m is still huge. You can be sure there'll a fuss when that info comes out (if it's actually true) so somebody will edit this article quicklyRahmalec</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, like I said, I will wait for the article and this is why I have not altered the 808m figure on the article page itself. There is no point in arguing, as you correctly point out, and yes, 700m is still huge. Magpie1892</p>

<p>There's a new image found recently that reveals a whole load of information about the steel structure. First of all, the height is confirmed at 808m and roof height at 643.3m. Also the height of the concrete core is 585.7m. There's a good bit of info on how it will be constructed as well in this image. I'll update the heights but won't upload the image to wikipedia since the height is still supposed to be confidential and someone may complain.

<p>Actually, it is at 90 floors, confirmed by multiple ppl in Dubai, as well as the estimate that says 1 floor every 2-3 days. It's been about 6 days since it was around 88 floors. You can also tell it's at 90 floors from daily photos being taken.

<p>I am just wondering where the updates are coming from on the height. The Burjskyscraper.com site does not indicate any new height increases since reporting that construction has reached supertall proportions. If I am missing the sited source please let me know otherwise I am curious as to how the update for December 12 at 94 stories came to be. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaska%2Byukon_ab56.html" title="User:Alaska+yukon">Emperor</a> 09:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm getting it from various people in Dubai. I'm not entirely sure of their connections, however their numbers are found to be accurate, even if you use estimates to figure out it's height. We'eve been updating the height for several weeks now. The floor count is also accurate even if you count the floors in the updated pictures, and even if you use the estimate for 2-3 days per floor. --<a href="../../../k/c/m/User%7EKCMODevin_ae8a.html" title="User:KCMODevin">KCMODevin</a> 12:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I certainly appreciate the effort put into providing up to date coverage on the tower's height, but we must always be wary of putting our own personal research onto Wikipedia as it weakens the article as a whole. I have no doubt the folks in Dubai can clearly look up and count the number of floors as well as triangulate the height but we must source all data. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaska%2Byukon_ab56.html" title="User:Alaska+yukon">Emperor</a> 18:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It isn't personal research... And that isn't how they are figuring it out, many have friends in the construction. --<a href="../../../k/c/m/User%7EKCMODevin_ae8a.html" title="User:KCMODevin">KCMODevin</a> 20:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>These friends need to create primary sources such as labeled and dated pictures or statements from the builders that they have reached a certain floor, otherwise it will be precieved as personal research. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaska%2Byukon_ab56.html" title="User:Alaska+yukon">Emperor</a> 02:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why the hell do you feel the need to question this information anyway? Not only can the floor number be confirmed by people on the ground, it also can be confirmed by counting the floors, as well as using the average of 2-3 floors per day. Also, most of the residential floors are about 3.6m, when they reach the commercial section that will increase to about 6m per floor. You also fail to recognize that a large portion of information on Wikipedia IS unsourced, but that in no way means that we shouldn't trust it... And a lot of the time, the sourced information/statistics are not accurate. It's better to have this currently unsourced information than to eliminate it just because it isn't sourced. --<a href="../../../k/c/m/User%7EKCMODevin_ae8a.html" title="User:KCMODevin">KCMODevin</a> 03:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can see that this has been a sensitive issue so I will drop it. My original purpose was to identify where I could see this updates as well and be part of this exciting race to the top. My passion is buildings and national expansion not debating little mute points. If more serious Wikipedians come along and try to delete unsourced data I will help you defend it if only to find out the day to day progress of construction. Good luck on your continued progress on this article, but as <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burj_Dubai_5174.html" title="Burj Dubai">Burj Dubai</a> gets closer to completion the expectations for the article will increase as well. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaska%2Byukon_ab56.html" title="User:Alaska+yukon">Emperor</a> 05:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sounds like personal research to me...when asked to source the info, he refuses, and says 'I'm getting it from various people in Dubai. I'm not entirely sure of their connections' and 'many have friends in the construction', then gets entirely too defensive when asked again to source the info. I disagree with the suggestion that it is better to have this unsourced info than to eliminate it. 162.136.192.1 20:10, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thats your own opinion, and besides, I've stopped updating it, other people are adding it as well, so you should use your brain and figure out that the information is coming from somewhere other than personal research. Use your brain on the issue... Also before you comment on Wikipedia rules, you need to abide by them, looking through your IP's talk page, it doesn't look like you do.
