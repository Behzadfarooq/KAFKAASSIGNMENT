<p>Burkina Faso is a landlocked western African country. Its inhabitants are known as Burkinabés.</p>
<p>Burkina Faso is surrounded by six countries. Mali to the north, Niger to the east, Benin to the south east, Togo and Ghana to the south and the Côte d'Ivoire to the south west.</p>
<p>A former French colony, Upper Volta gained its independence in 1960. The current name of the country (Burkina Faso) dates from August 4 1984. It means <i>the land of upright people</i> in the local languages - <i>Mooré**</i> (Burkina = upright) and <i>Bamanakan**</i> (<i>Faso</i> = land). It is a combination of two of the country's prinicipal languages (<i>Mooré**</i> spoken by the <i>Moosi</i>, the ethnic majority of Burkina Faso, and <i>Bamanakan</i> or "language of the Bambara" or of Dyula spoken in the west African subregion). The word <i>Burkinabé</i> which means someone from Burkina Faso is in <i>Fulfuldé**</i>, the language spoken by the <i>Peulh**</i>, nomadic herdsmen who also live in man western African countries.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>see also <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_du_Burkina_Faso" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_du_Burkina_Faso" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_du_Burkina_Faso</a> (worth translating, most of the history is pre WW2 and doesn't all overlap with the English article)</p>
<p>Prehistory</p>
<p>Like all of the west of Africa, Burkina Faso was populated early, notably by hunter-gatherers in the north-western part of the country (12 000 to 5000 BC), and whose tools (scrapers, chisels and arrowheads) were discovered in 1973. Settlements appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC with farmers, the traces of whose structures leave the impression of relatively permanent buildings. The use of iron, ceramics and polished stone developed between 1500 and 1000 BC, as well as a preoccupation with spiritual matters, as shown by the burial remains which have been discovered.</p>
<p>Relics of the Dogon are found in the centre-north, north and north west region. They left the area between the 15th and 16th centuries BC to settle in the cliffs of Bandiagara**. Elsewhere, the remains of high walls are localised in the south west of Burkina Faso (as well as in the Côte d'Ivoire), but the people who built them have not yet been definatly identified.</p>
<p>The pre-colonial era</p>
<p>[blank]</p>
<p>The colonial era</p>
<p>In 1896, the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou became a French protectorate. In 1898, the majority of the region corresponding to Burkina Faso today was conquered. In 1904, these territories were integrated into French West Africa in the heart of the Upper-Senegal-Niger [**Haut-Sénégal-Niger] colony.</p>
<p>Its inhabitants participated in the First World War in the heart of the battalions of the "Senegalise Infantry" [**Tirailleurs sénégalais]. On March 1 1919, François Charles Alexis Edouard Hesling became the first governor of the new colony of Upper-Volta, which was broken up September 5 1932, being shared between the Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Niger.</p>
<p>On September 4 1947 Upper-Volta was recreated with its 1932 boundaries. On December 11 1958, it became a republic and member of the Franco-African Community [**la communauté franco-africaine] and gained independence August 5 1960.</p>
<p>The post-colonial period</p>
<p>[blank]</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>The constitution of June 2 1991 established a semi-presidential government with a parliament (Assemblée) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The parliament consists of two chambers: the lowwer house (l'Assemblée Nationale) and the upper house (la Chambre des Représentants). There is also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative.</p>
<p>Subdivisions</p>

<p>Burkina Faso is divided into 45 provinces.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Bfcarte.gif">Image:Bfcarte.gif</a></p>
<p>Geography</p>
<p>Relief</p>
<p>Burkina Faso is made up from two major types of countryside:</p>
<p>The larger part of the country is covered by a peneplain which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a precambrian massif.</p>
<p>The south-west of the country forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak is found: Ténakourou** (749m, 2,450 ft). The massif is boardered by sheer cliffs up to 150m (490 ft) high.</p>
<p>The average altitude is 400m (1,300 ft) and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than 600m (2,000 ft). Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country, with a few localised exceptions.</p>
<p>Hydrography</p>
<p>The country owed its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: le Mouhoun** (formerlly the Black Volta), le Nakambé** (the White Volta) and le Nazinon** (the Red Volta). Le Mouhoun**, along with la Comoé** which flows to the south west, is the country's only permanent river.</p>
<p>The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface. Its tributaries (le Béli**, le Gorouol**, le Goudébo** and le Dargol**) only flow for 4 to 6 months a year but can cause large floods.</p>
<p>The country also contains numerous lakes. The principal lakes are Tingrela**, Bam** and Dem**, and the large ponds of Oursi**, Béli**, Yomboli** and Markoye**.</p>
<p>Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the county.</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>Burkina Faso has a tropical climate with two very distinct seasons: the rainy season with between 600 and 900mm (24-35 inches) of rainfall, and the dry season during which the harmattan** blows, a hot dry wind from the Sahara. The rainy season lasts approximately 4 months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country.</p>
<p>Three large climatic zones can be defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Sahel zone in the north: less than 600mm (24 inches) rainfall a year and high temperatures (15-45 degrees C, 60-110 deg F)</li>
<li>the Sudan-Sahel zone between 11°3' and 13°5' northerly latitude. An intermediate zone with regards to rainfall and temperature.</li>
<li>the Sudan-Guinea zone in the south: more than 900mm (35 inches) rain a year and relatively low average temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world. This can be explained by its population growth and the arid soil. Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product, and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of livestock but also, especially in the south and south west, of growing sorghum, millet, maize, peanuts, rice and cotton.</p>
<p>Lack of work causes a high rate of emmigration, for example three million people from Burkina Faso live in the Côte d'Ivoire. According to the Central Bank of Western African States [**la banque centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'ouest], these migrants send tens of billions of CFA francs back to Burkina Faso each year. Since the 1967 expulsions from Ghana, this situation has provoked tensions in the destination countries. The most recent crisis occured due to the events of 2003 in the Côte d'Ivoire which lead to the return of 300 000 migrants.</p>
<p>A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.</p>
<p>Mineral exploitation should also be mentioned, of copper, iron and above all gold.</p>

<p>While I believe that Burkina Faso's administration was among the most efficient in West Africa I'm not conviced by the current hierachy&#160;: State; Province; Région, Département...

<p>In the article, the name of the people of Burkina Faso is consistently written <i>Burkinabé.</i> (Rhymes with André.) This is consistent with the way that French write accents and the way that the word is pronounced in Burkina.</p>
<p>However, I have usually seen the word written <i>Burkinabè.</i> I remember the unusual orthography because it seemed wrong. The explanation was that it was to annoy the colonialists.</p>
<p>Are there any Burkinabè who can verify this?</p>
<p>On écrit-il le mot <i>Burkinabé</i> ou <i>Burkinabè</i>? Je me souviens le deuxième.</p>
<p>--Rajah9 18:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I don't know... After looking to a source from Bukina Faso, I've found this&#160;: <a href="http://www.fasofoot.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.fasofoot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fasofoot.com/</a> Compare the windows title and the page. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 16:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the accent was changed to annoy the colonialists, then I guess either would be acceptable. It is written as Burkinabè here: <a href="http://www.primature.gov.bf/" class="external free" title="http://www.primature.gov.bf/" rel="nofollow">http://www.primature.gov.bf/</a>. Is it definitely pronounced Bur-ki-na-bay and not Bur-ki-nab? <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENev_633d.html" title="User:Nev">Nev</a> 17:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After googling the subject, it seems that it is spelled both ways. I have seen a number of websites which use both forms interchangeably, so if you want to make note of it in the article, that's cool. We should just be consistant. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChemica_a88d.html" title="User:Chemica">chemica</a> 03:57, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While searching for citations for climate information, I stumbled upon the exact words of the wikipedia climate section, at <a href="http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&amp;CID=18" class="external free" title="http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&amp;CID=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&amp;CID=18</a>. Anyone who is interested should check. Since I am working on the references of this page, someone else needs to go over the section and re-write it. Keep the citations I made, as they are accurate. Oh, to explain why I will not sign with 4 tildes, I forgot to log in, so I shall link to my user name. Also, to answer Lincher's question, it means "land of upright people", I will add this to the page.<a href="../../../e/s/o/User%7EEsoltas_056f.html" title="User:Esoltas">Esoltas</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.141.214.35 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.141.214.35.html" title="User talk:69.141.214.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.141.214.35_0b12.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.141.214.35">contribs</a>) 17:20, 5 August 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Looks like the sim.org page was based on the Wikipedia version. The edit history shows that the version on Wikipedia started here, as there is a long evolution of copy-editing in that section. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 04:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure if this section can be improved / made more neutral. It reads like an indictment rather than an encyclopedic article. Even if true, I think it would be better if this were couched in language that didn't express opinions like "poor" human rights record. Perhaps an external link to a site that details such violations would be OK, IMO. 19:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichAromas_ad9d.html" title="User:RichAromas">RichAromas</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichAromas_dcc6.html" title="User talk:RichAromas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RichAromas_0840.html" title="Special:Contributions/RichAromas">contribs</a>) 19:33, 3 March 2007.</small></p>
