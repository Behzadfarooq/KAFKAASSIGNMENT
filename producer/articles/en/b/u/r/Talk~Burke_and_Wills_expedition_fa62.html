<p>Im confused about how many times they returned to Coopers creek.. obviously there was 1) when they camped there on their way north, and 2) when they returned and found the dig sign.. but I'm not sure if they came back a 3rd time - they headed south west through the desert but did they turn back? the state library of victoria says that only Wills returned to the camp: "Burke later sent Wills back to Camp LXV for another 'last look'."<a href="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/burkeandwills/expedition/lastdays.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/burkeandwills/expedition/lastdays.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> whereas here it says that all three of them went back: "Meanwhile Burke, Wills and King realised they could not make the long trip. Their supplies were running out and the last camel had died so they returned to Coopers Creek." <a href="http://www.davidreilly.com/australian_explorers/burke/robert.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.davidreilly.com/australian_explorers/burke/robert.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, while a number of other sources dont mention a 3rd arrival at Coopers creek by Burke &amp; Wills at all. <a href="../../../c/f/i/User%7ECfitzart_a3fb.html" title="User:Cfitzart">Cfitzart</a> 13:34, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cooper Creek timeline; B&amp;W returned to the Cooper on 21 April 1861 to find Brahe had left. Burke decided to head for Mt Hopeless and they followed the Cooper downstream as A C Gregory had done in 1858. They left the Cooper on 17 May 1861 and headed into the Strzelecki Desert. They returned to the Cooper on 22 May 1861, having been unsuccesful in their attempt to reach Mt Hopeless. They then remained on the creek untill their deaths, although they did move camp several times. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocketfrog_5aca.html" title="User:Rocketfrog">Rocketfrog</a> 00:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article has miles in some places and kilometres in other places. Somebody should standardise these (my brain won't function well enough to do the conversions). Australia is metric now, but we used miles back then. We should probably go with miles. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 06:47, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed mention of the "police outpost" at Mt Hopeless from here and the biographies of Burke and Wills, because I've been doing some research into the history of the Flinders Ranges, and it's clear there was no such thing. A police outpost was briefly established at Angepena station (some 100 km southeast of Mt Hopeless) in 1857. Only in 1869 was a more permanent station was opened at Mount Freeling, some 40km east of Mt Hopeless. Since I had also always known the Burke and Wills story as setting out for a police station at Mt Hopeless, I checked Alan Moorehead's <i>Cooper's Creek</i>, and found that he indeed only refers to "the homesteads which they believed existed near Mount Hopeless" (p 110). As John Baker had established a station on the extreme frontier at Blanchewater in 1858 (very near Mount Hopeless), it's undoubtedly that station which Burke had heard of before they left, and what they were heading for. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsonlyme_4236.html" title="User:Itsonlyme">Itsonlyme</a> 15:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mind you, I note Moorehead does write on page 94: "Mount Hopeless, where they knew there was a police-station". Perhaps it all has to do with the fact that the police-station at Angepena was on Baker's chief property, Blanchewater/Mount Hopeless was an outstation of Baker's, and so it all got confused, and perhaps even Burke was confused. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsonlyme_4236.html" title="User:Itsonlyme">Itsonlyme</a> 18:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>Burke's instructions from the Royal Society required him to keep open communications with the Expedition Committee either via Menindee, or if he saw fit, by way of the South Australian Police Station at Mount Serle (Angepena). In 1858, A C Gregory had travelled down the Cooper and Strzelecki Creeks and, near the hill named Mount Hopeless by Eyre, had found a cattle station.</p>
<p>A C Gregory - 26th June 1858 "As we approached the range of hills tracks of cattle and horses were observed, and eight miles beyond Mount Hopeless came to a cattle station which had been lately established by Mr. Baker."</p>
<p>John Baker had established this station in 1857 on a lease of 518 kmÂ². Baker expanded the property to over 3000 kmÂ² and upon his death in 1872 it was aquired by Thomas Elder. Elder had his homestead at Manuwalkaninna and turned Baker's Station into a horse breeding enterprise known as Blanchewater Horse Stations which covered around 10,000 kmÂ². In 1890 the property was turned over to sheep and the homestead moved to Murnpeowie (Mumpy) and Baker's Station became an outstation (Blanchewater)which was damaged by floods in 1944.</p>
<p>So in 1860 when Burke left Melbourne, he would have been aware of the small hill named Mount Hopeless by Eyre, the station established by Baker near Mount Hopeless (which is now called Blanchewater) and the police outpost at Angepena, near Mount Serle. When Burke left the Cooper on 17 May 1861 he was attempting to follow Gregory's track and therefore would have been heading for Baker's Station and then presumably Angepena and the settled districts of South Australia. There was no police station at Baker's Station, there was no police station at Mount Hopeless, and the station that later became known as Blanchewater, and which is now a ruin, was not an outstation of Baker's in 1858 but his main run. While Moorehead wrote an excellent novel on the subject, his research has been questioned and he often does add to the layers of myth attached to the expedition and maybe he should really be regarded as a secondary source. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocketfrog_5aca.html" title="User:Rocketfrog">Rocketfrog</a> 12:35, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
