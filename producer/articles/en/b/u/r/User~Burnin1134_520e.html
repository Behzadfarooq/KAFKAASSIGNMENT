	    <p>hi, my name is Paul. i love runescape, a masive role playing game, any ways, I named my account after my runescape account name, if you do do runescape, please add and message me. also i think you should know about my pets, and old pets, but please pardon the spelling...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
                                                 My Pets 
</pre>
<p>My Cat, Midnight (A.K.A Stinky) is a super violent cat that at this time is almost 2 years old, he loves chasing things (even humans!), and he will climb up your leg scratching it all the time, he is not all that cute and snugly, But some times you can get him to sleep or nap with you (but normally you have to catch him off guard, or when he is sleeping, or he will maul you!). ‘Stinky’ is not a friendly Cat, unless you are feeding him at the moment. Really we have no right to call him stinky, because he does not really stink at all unless we have like, just fed him, which makes his breath smell like cat food.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I also have two male horses named Prince (A.K.A Stinker) and Sa-Javol (but we always call him Joval A.K.A Joe) ‘Joe’ and Princey always try to race to the gates, Joval mostly wins, but he still has to wait for Prince to catch up, do to the fact that Prince always has to go in the gate first, other wise there is a small brawl. Also Prince almost never lets Joval hang with the herd, he always herds him away. Prince and Joval are never allowed to eat off the big round bales, so we have to sometimes tear off hay for them and put it some where else to they can eat, but still Prince and Joval mostly will not share hay piles, though even though they have some rivalry, they are still friends, it is just a matter of dominance and of course Prince is higher then Joval, because he like, no manners at all and is more aggressive, even to some people (depending on who).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before he got Kidney stones and we had to put him down, we had a male rodent (a guinea pig) named Stanley Manly, A.K.A Weekers or Fatso Ratso. Stan was kind of funny, cute, happy, and even snuggly (more snuggly then Midnight, our replacement [to put it blankly]) we would give Stan cardboard boxes and shoe boxes as little houses for him to eat, sleep in, or hide in, but the boxes would not last long, because he would eat them in a week or two, but it was alright because we had plenty of boxes, and it was good for his teeth, it kept them at an O.K length. If they got too long, we would have to trim them with toenail clippers. Some times his toenails got way to long; we would have to trim them too. We fed him guinea pig food, carrots, lettuce, and alfalfa, when he was hungry you could hear him squeaking from down stairs, he lived in my sister, Lara’s room, that was upstairs.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We used to have a horse named Saunta (really we just took care of her). Now, my Mom’s Friend, Val, owned Saunta, by ‘owned’ I mean that the was the one you bought Saunta, but my Mom took care of Saunta, and did a darn good job of it too! Saunta was an old, grumpy mare, but on off occasions she was very friendly and nice, when she was in a good mood. Now, when she was not in a good mood… she would pin her ears back, and bite at you (on rare occasions [and she never actually bit you, she just bit at you in a threatening way]), also she would give you a death glare, and just really make it clear she was mad. But over all, she was a really funny, and nice horse. When Saunta died, it was because of heart troubles, and she died peacefully, and when she was eating one day, she just… lay down and died... no pain at all, she died comfortably, doing some thing she enjoyed.</p>
