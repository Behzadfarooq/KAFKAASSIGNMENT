<p>Lets be honest, no school is perfect, this site looks like an advert for the school, that is not what wikipedia is about, its about realiable truth, leave it to the school website to advertise it. The OFT investigation is a good example of somthing that could improve and add more truth to this wiki page. I don't want to change it to make the school look bad, I think its a good school, I just want to make the site more truthful. If anyone has any good arguments for this not to happen I'll listen, if not I'll change it in the next few days.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggstar69_e4a5.html" title="User:Wiggstar69">Wiggstar69</a> 18:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having just read the article myself, I do agree with the above. I just want to put forth my support for the idea for the article to be re-written, in a less advertisement-like fashion. 80.229.16.243 19:33, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The information concerning the OFT in relation to the school is just not true and I have deleted it. I'm not sure where you have got this information from but just google 'OFT and public schools' to get a list of schools affected.</p>

<dd>I don't understand what you mean, you cant just claim the OFT investigation never happened, even if they didn't realise they were doing somthing illegal it still happened, this school like 49 others were caught price fixing with each other (despite them knowing or not knowing the rules), it happened and it was a major thing. This is why its important to meantion it, this is part of my effort to make this a more interesting and truthful page, because anyone could filter out all the bad things and be left with the good. As for your comment on just going onto google and copy pasting I think anybody could do that, but this peice of information is not re-used other then on pages for other affected schools on wikipedia.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggstar69_e4a5.html" title="User:Wiggstar69">Wiggstar69</a> 08:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that the OFT investigation happened. Burgess Hill School was not one of the schools involved. You are mistaken. I was not suggesting copy/paste, I was showing you where you could find an accurate list so that you could satisfy yourself that Burgess Hill was not on it. Please delete this totally misleading article.</p>
<p>I have listed all schools invloved in the OFT investigation. You will note that Burgess Hill School for Girls is not amongst that list. I have therefore deleted this entry on the page. This is the list in the Times article - see link <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article588318.ece" class="external free" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article588318.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article588318.ece</a></p>
<p>The full list of schools: Ampleforth College, Bedford School, Benenden School, Bradfield College, Bromsgrove School, Bryanston School, Canford School, Charterhouse School, Cheltenham College, Cheltenham Ladies College, Clifton College, Cranleigh School, Dauntsey’s School, Downe House School, Eastbourne College, Epsom College, Eton College, Gresham’s School, Haileybury School, Harrow School, King’s School Canterbury, Lancing College, Malvern College, Marlborough College, Millfield School, Mill Hill School, Oakham School, Oundle School, Radley College, Repton School, Royal Hospital School, Rugby School, St Edward’s School, Oxford, St Leonards-Mayfield School, Sedbergh School, Sevenoaks School, Sherborne School, Shrewsbury School, Stowe School, Strathallan School, Tonbridge School, Truro School, Uppingham School, Wellington College, Wells Cathedral School, Westminster School, Winchester College, Woldingham School, Worth School and Wycombe Abbey.

<dd>Your completly correct I thought this school was on the list, very sorry, although I still feel as if this site acts as an advert I admit I was wrong and Burgess Hill was not one of the 50 schools.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggstar69_e4a5.html" title="User:Wiggstar69">Wiggstar69</a> 13:42, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
