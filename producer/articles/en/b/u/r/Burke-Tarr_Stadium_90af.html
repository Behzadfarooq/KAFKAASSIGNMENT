<p><b>Burke-Tarr Stadium</b> is a football stadium located in <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_City%2C_Tennessee_3cda.html" title="Jefferson City, Tennessee">Jefferson City</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> on the campus of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson-Newman_College_1ae4.html" title="Carson-Newman College">Carson-Newman College</a>. The original structure, consisting primarily of concrete-supported wooden bleachers and a small press box, was constructed in 1966 to serve as the home for the then-<a href="../../../n/a/i/NAIA_d5b6.html" title="NAIA">NAIA</a> Carson-Newman Eagles football team. This stadium's construction was the catalyst for the meteoric rise of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson-Newman_1985.html" title="Carson-Newman">Carson-Newman</a>'s football program into one of the most well-known and respected small college programs in the country. The stadium's proximity to Mossy Creek, which served as the starting point for the college itself in 1851, and the bad luck that has befallen many visiting teams over the years, led to the buildup of a mystique known as Mossy Creak Madness during football season. The most rabid students became known as the Mossy Creek Maniacs, a colorful group who constantly yell the most non-vulgar insults at opposing players at both home and away games, and have developed many special traditions, which include running the school flags down to the endzone after an Eagles touchdown, and pouring water from Mossy Creek onto the field before each game. From 1967-2004, the Eagles compiled a 192-37-2 record at the original stadium, which hosted three of the team's five <a href="../../../n/a/i/NAIA_d5b6.html" title="NAIA">NAIA</a> National Championship victories in 1986, 1988, and 1989. After the team moved to <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_e914.html" title="NCAA">NCAA</a> <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_II_587c.html" title="Division II">Division II</a> in the early 1990s, the team ran off an impressive home winning streak that stretched from a 62-31 loss to [New Haven in 1993], to a 38-28 loss to conference foe Presbyterian on October 6, 2001, a span of 36 regular season games (Northern Colorado defeated the Eagles 30-29 in a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_II_587c.html" title="Division II">Division II</a> semi-final game in 1997). Since that loss, the Eagles have run off another 22-game home winning streak (discounting a 2005 loss at Jefferson County High School), including two playoff games against <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayetteville_State_University_9c76.html" title="Fayetteville State University">Fayetteville State</a>. Since moving up in classification, the Eagles are 63-2 at Burke-Tarr Stadium. <a href="http://www.cn.edu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cn.edu" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> After the Eagles won a 2004 first-round playoff game against <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayetteville_State_University_9c76.html" title="Fayetteville State University">Fayetteville State</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson-Newman_1985.html" title="Carson-Newman">Carson-Newman</a> administrators became concerned that the stadium was growing old and might not be entirely safe. A safety inspection team was called in shortly thereafter to evaluate the 37 year old stadium's superstructure. The administration's concerns soon became warranted, as the inspection revealed that the stadium could only be stabilized and made safe again by a mandatory $2.5 million structural renovation, which would result in little improvement to the outdated facilities themselves. Fortunately, local donors and supporters of the college's athletics had already begun to recognize the need for improvements to the football facilities, which were rapidly fading in stature to other schools in its league such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian_College_951d.html" title="Presbyterian College">Presbyterian</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tusculum_College_661c.html" title="Tusculum College">Tusculum</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catawba_College_d2d7.html" title="Catawba College">Catawba</a>. By mid-January of 2005, the Eagle Foundation had received enough funds and pledges to proceed with the demolition of the original Burke-Tarr Stadium in preparation for a new, state-of-the-art facility that will eventually consist of a 5300 seat stadium, a football operations center to house locker room and weight-training facilities for the football players behind the south endzone, and an indoor practice facility located on the present site of the Eagles' practice field. Because the primary benefactor chose to remain anonymous, the stadium was able to retain its original name.</p>
<p>The new Burke-Tarr Stadium was erected within 9 months of the original's demolition, and was dedicated on October 22, 2005 during Homecoming festivities as the Eagles defeated <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenoir-Rhyne_08f8.html" title="Lenoir-Rhyne">Lenoir-Rhyne</a> 33-6. The facility's main stands consist primarily of steel and aluminum, as concrete prices at the time of construction made it impossible to afford a concrete structure. The metal design allowed for four additional entrances to the main stands via stairwells from the ground level, in addition to the entrances on either end of the stadium. The stands support a very large and modern press box supported by two steel and brick columns, leaving a great deal of space underneath for concessions stands, merchandise booths, and restroom facilities.</p>
<p>Although the new stadium incorporated the visiting side bleachers from the original stadium (erected much later on in the facilities' life) a late donation by a local businessman enabled the college to replace the battered bermuda grass field with <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a>, a modern artificial surface that is largely similar to grass. Due to the proximity of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson-Newman_1985.html" title="Carson-Newman">Carson-Newman</a> baseball complex, a nearby road, and the space needed for the operations center, the stadium was unable to hold a regulation track, so none was installed. In July of 2006, construction began on the football operations center, as well as the completion of the brick fencing in the North endzone and around the visiting side's bleachers. This phase of the project should be completed in time for the 2007 season.</p>
<p>The Eagles completed the 2006 season with an 8-3 record, and ran their record at the new Burke-Tarr Stadium to 7-0. Their overall home winning streak now stands at 27 games, with the closest win coming in 2006 against Mars Hill, 10-7.</p>
