<p>I changed the "worn by Muslim women in Afghanistan" etc. to "worn by most women in Afghanistan", since most women in Afghanistan are forced to wear the burqa regardless of whether or not they are Muslims. Also I clarified the current situation in Afghanistan a bit (it hasn't actually changed all that much yet), and I added some more details about the Netherlands. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlKenner_0362.html" title="User:CarlKenner">Carl Kenner</a> 05:53, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Burka, Burqa. This ia not limited to Afghanistan, It was also the Bengali term used in East Pakistan (Bangladeish) when I lived there (1965). It (to me) refers to the fully-sewn fully-enclosing (head and upper body or longer) womens clothing. Most have an eye port, usually covered with a lace fabric flap. Some are rather elaborate; though now used by poorer women, many are severely worn and tattered. In 1995, I was shocked to see almost no burqas (except worn by old women in Old Dhaka or remote villages). I was told that this was due to the revolutionary social reforms since the split from West Pakistan. Young girls, typically wore school uniforms in public.</p>
<p>See also the term Chador, which (in Iran, Farsi) was the simple (usually black and unsewn) sheet, thrown over the head, clasped at the neck, extending to the ground.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on these things by any means, but isn't a chador different from an (afghan) burka? The article seems to suggest that it's just another word for it, but I don't think that's the case - or is it? -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> 11:18, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are correct, per my experience in the late 1960's. In Iran, the Farsi term "Chador" referred to a usually black {sheet-like} cloth, thrown around the body over the head, clasped at the neck, like a flowing full body cape. Some women liked it as they could go out without "dressing up."</p>
<p>Whereas, to my experience the "Burka" was a sewn tan-colored garment enclosing the head and upper body, with a minimal face or eye opening, coverable with a lace flap. The Burkae-type garment was common in East Pakistan, (posssibly West Pakistan) and Afghanistan. I'm not sure of the Urdu (Pakistan) or Dari (Afghanistan) name. Perhaps someone more familiar with Mideast/Asian clothing and language can clarify these terms.</p>
<p>It is possible that the distinction in some areas may be based on class; with the Burka worn by poorer, less educated, more (rural) conservative women, and the Chador worn by more urban, educated upper class women. -- Visitor 23Oct04</p>

<p>I've herad that the Burqa has only actually been around since 1996. Is this true? If so, i think it should be included on the main page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I've found references to it in 19th century British works re India. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:55, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about the Middle Easterners that have been wearing burqas for a long time? You'd see movies, books and internet websites regarding the women during the Ottoman Empire, Arab countries, Iran and those in the Arabian (1001) Nights wearing burqas. So, I'd disagree on the statement that it has only been around since 1996. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantastic4boy_3dc2.html" title="User:Fantastic4boy">Fantastic4boy</a> 06:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the article should say that "majority" of Muslim women do not wear burqa and that it is mostly restricted to certain societies such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, UAE, Qatar. It is non-existent in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Malaysia, Indonesia. Alot of people these days seem to think burqa is required by Islam or that all Muslims wear this (or even that Quran dictates this clothing), but this is not true. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 11:03, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. I completely rewrote the article. Whoever had written it had confused burqa with hijab, of which there are many different forms. I erased all the links to "Cultural conflicts" because those are better discussed in other articles, and because I suspect that none of them referred to burqas. I'm guessing it was either jilbab and khimar, or abaya and niqab. You just don't see burqas in the West.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I should probably add the El-Guindi book as a reference here too, but I'm tired. If you want to do that, it would be appreciated. So far, it's the best academic reference on hijab that I've found. Not that I've read all the relevant books. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm new to Wikipedia so if my entry here isn't right, please let me know. From my understanding, another use of the term burqa is for a piece that is only covering the face. It has three layers, the bottom one of which has a string between the eyes and the other two can be flipped up or down. An example is here: <a href="http://www.alhannah.com/products/ni133.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alhannah.com/products/ni133.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alhannah.com/products/ni133.html</a>. So should this be included in this article? Thanks.</p>
<p>PS Are we allowed to link to pages like that Al Hannah page I did? Thanks&#160;:D</p>

<dd>Someone who isn't all that familiar with English translated that ad. Burqa has always referred to a garment that covers the whole body, not just the head. The Afghan burqa has a grille; I think other South Asian burqas had slits for the eyes. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Isn't face veil forbidden in Muslim prayers too? As far as I am well-aware off, Muslim women are only required to cover all parts of their bodies except their hands and faces (<i>see</i> Aurat). So, I'm just wondering, for the Muslim women that are wearing burqas, why bother covering your faces up? After all, the Koran requires that Muslim women cover their heads, NOT faces, as a sign of protection against men that are not related to her by blood. I understand that his exception goes for women wondering around the desert to cover their faces from the sandstorm. So, I think it's silly that the Afghanistan government is implying laws that force all women to wear the burqa. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantastic4boy_3dc2.html" title="User:Fantastic4boy">Fantastic4boy</a> 06:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What about laws that force people to wear clothes in public? Should there be laws about clothing at all? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
