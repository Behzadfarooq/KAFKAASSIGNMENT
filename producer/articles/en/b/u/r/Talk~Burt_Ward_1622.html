<p>Burt Ward and his wife run a non-profit that is the subject of controversy. They recently lost a lawsuit in which they sued owners of websites that discussed the controversy. This lawsuit is important because of the implications for any unmoderated discussion boards or sites like Wikipedia, since it would have established precident showing that the owners of the sites were responsible for all content, and the information that was added regarding this appears completely factual and without unnecessary or unreasonably biased content. I checked the information that was removed and as best I can tell, after some effort, it is valid. The sites of which the owners were sued have been victims of repeated vandalism and disruption, which is why I checked this entry for accuracy and vandalism.</p>
<p>I am concerned that the intentions of the editor who removed the information were to prevent anything negative from being included and limit free speech themselves, which would be both dishonest and vandalism. If I am wrong about this, please make your intentions clear - lets avoid any silly editing spats, and if I misinterpreted the intentions of that editor, I apologize. I consider the less flattering information just as important as the positive information on his career, as is the case with any topic, especially public figures and historic events. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigdoglover_c47d.html" title="User:Bigdoglover">Bigdoglover</a> 00:39, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Talk%7EBurt_Ward_1622.html" title="Edit section: Your changes to the Burt Ward entry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Your changes to the Burt Ward entry</span></h3>
<p>I wanted to discuss your changes to the Burt Ward entry. I had just made a revision to an earlier version and you removed some sections. I am new to this and realized I had not signed in, so I created an account and went back to re-save so my changes would be signed, which is why I noticed your changes. I did leave an explanation on the talk page, but that was also not signed until just now (also a mistake due to ignorance of the system).</p>
<p>Rather than change your changes again, I'd like to discuss them.</p>
<p>I agree with some of them, but the part "on the grounds that the lawsuit was designed to chill their right to speak freely and petition government agencies about a matter of public interest." that you removed is, in my opinion, why the lawsuit is worthy of mention. Other than the biased word "chill" I think it is factual and important. While these may seem like small points, the case has some pretty big significance since they were suing, amoung others, the owners of unmoderated forums for the content other people had posted. That is just like suing the owners of Wikipedia for the edits you or I just made, a precident I am glad was not set.</p>
<p><br />
Less importantly, I also think the words "with prejudice" are important and significant since they are the legal term for the way the case was resolved, though your version does remove some unnecessary redundancy and I do not dispute its accuracy.</p>
<p>However, I checked the page because I DO have an opinion on the issues the case brought up, which is how I found and I checked the page because other sites mentioning the lawsuit have been targets of heavy vandalism and disruption. I was making sure that was not happening here. Because of this (the fact that I am not a wholly unbiased editor) I wanted to talk to you about this and ask you to look over the changes while considering my points. I will defer to your decision on the matter since the last thing I want to do is engage in the behavior I am trying to prevent, even unintentionally. From the nature of your edits it seems pretty clear your intentions are to keep wikipedia accurate and unbiased and not to remove the negative but unbiased content. Hmm, just checked your user page (I did say I'm new to this, after all) - pretty clear you have wikipedia's best interests in mind.</p>
<p>I hope all that makes sense and my intentions are clear, and I would appreciate a response. Thank you</p>

<li>While "with prejudice" is the legal term, it is easily mis-interpreted by the public, so it is better to simply state what the phrase means, than to use the phrase. As for "right to free speech", if I recall correctly, the defendants ran a website claiming that Burt Ward sold sick dogs. That is potentially slanderous. The judge's dismissal of the case does not imply that the defendants are right, or that their website's statements were true, just that Ward's company over-stepped its lawsuit. Regardless, the current form of the page is more neutral than it has been. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-03-25 01:32</small></li>
</ul>
<p>I see your point about the possible misinterpretation and also the other phrase. Thank you for explaining your view - I think you are right that is is best left the way you had it to avoid people getting the wrong idea. The case details would belong in a seperate entry, were cases typical entries, which doesn't seem the case.</p>
<p>Another user, Zanimum, also with vastly more experience than I, has removed all these discussed changes. Once again I will defer to more the experienced. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigdoglover_c47d.html" title="User:Bigdoglover">Bigdoglover</a> 16:00, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The information was from PDFs on the GGNews website, from Ward's Demand for Jury. Honestly, I don't think we ever can have a perfectly factual article with the sources we have now. No news source has really followed this whole thing, besides the involved <i>Press-Enterprise</i>. Everyone else is getting second-hand info from them. Ward is acting on his family/company's behalf and best interests, and most everyone else caring is highly dog-minded, thus they might just be playing favourites. The only acceptible route I can see (as we can't just not talk about it) is to have Wikinews do an indepth investigation with Ward, the neighbour, the Committee, the people who charged Ward, the judge, etc. Do they really want to do that? Probably not. So we're stuck in a dead place where we can't do a thing. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 22:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>The above heading is true, and the discussion above speaks to the fundamental principle involved in Mr. Ward's case. While I understand the concern about the purported one-sidedness, when one side has posted evidence in support of a true and verifiable account (i.e. that the case was dismissed as a "meritless SLAPP" intended to chill free speech), and other people have simply removed that information, it seems to me that the assessment of which side is being intellectualy dishonest is perhaps a distorted one. Mr. Ward lost his libel cases against the newspaper and against the individuals in the second suit because he sued them for making negative comments that he failed to prove were untrue, and he was forced to pay attorneys' fees for having filed a frivolous lawsuit to chill their truthful free speech on a matter of public interest. This is not a matter of debate, but a statement of fact based on the legal requirements necessary to win an anti-SLAPP motion. Unless Mr. Ward were to appeal the case and win on appeal, then there should be no controversy over the veracity of the statement that his suit was FOUND TO BE frivolous and in contravention of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>As to verifiability, it seems to me that providing reference to case numbers and judges should be sufficient when PDFs do not exist, although I would love to see more documents posted, rather than taken down, in this instance and on Wiki in general. As to "independent" sources such as newspapers, this is ultimately a small story, albiet one that involves a big principle, and most papers did not cover it.</p>
<p>A "smear" is different from a truthful statement about a controversy that invokes the First Amendment. I think that the interests of Wiki are better served by including more information rather than less.</p>
<p>If someone in Orange County were willing to go to the court and scan the judge's order, would that satisfy you?</p>

<dd>To only mention the SLAPP would take a situation out of context. Since the SLAPP is part of a longer happening, we must include details on everything in the case, if we are to include the SLAPP. Small story? Mr. Ward is a cultural icon, if only for one role. I'd take the <i>National Enquirer</i> or <i>US Magazine</i> as a proper source in this situation. Unless we have a full and accurate account of the whole first trial of Ward vs. the newspaper, nothing goes in. There's no use having an article that General Custer died at Little Big Horn, if we don't have anything about the Civil War before it. There's no reason to talk about grapefruit, if we don't know how they grow. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 11:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I spent about an hour reading through the posts on gentlegiantsnews.com. They were almost universally negative. But since this is Barbara Laird's site, that is what you might expect.</p>
<p>Here's what I know: Burt and Tracy Ward tried to repossess from Laird a dog she adopted from them. It seems they wanted her to feed the dog only food from GGR. She refused, on the reasonable grounds that the contract did not specify that. Apparently Laird then began collecting opinions from others who had dealt with GGR and displaying them on her Web site. Many different users have posted, in many threads. I saw only two posts defending the Wards, and Laird had tried to debunk one of those -- on what seem to me dubious grounds. The complaints fell mainly into three groups: dogs the Wards said were healthy were not; the dogs were older than claimed; the GGR food was not well-suited for large adult dogs. There were a few complaints about the state of repair of the facility and the stench emanating from it, and one about a "bait and switch" operation. This is the site the Wards took legal action against, claiming defamation.</p>
<p>The Wards did have trouble with the city government in 2003 when their neighbors complained about noise and stench. AFAICT they have resolved those problems to the city's satisfaction since GGR has not been shut down.</p>
<p>What may be a contributing factor to GGR's problems is described here:<br />
April 17, 2003<br />
The Hollywood Reporter<br />
"MGM's "Bulletproof Monk" encountered a number of postproduction complications, including the resignation of a co-founder and the artistic staff at Boy Wonder Visual Effects during production. Artists took their workstations with them, and walkouts were followed by a lawsuit involving claims of theft and misuse of corporate funds (HR 11/30/02). To keep the visual effects running -- and to prevent having to call on its completion bond through International Film Guarantors Inc. -- Boy Wonder founder Burt Ward was forced to divvy up shots to Blur Studios and Eyetronics, as well as invest hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money to keep his end of the production afloat."</p>
<p>It's not clear from this who was at fault. Also, since I found it on Laird's site, I can't be sure it wasn't doctored.</p>
<p>Finally, here is a link to a story about the dismissal of the defamation lawsuit:</p>

<p>I might learn more if I had an account on HR. I'll investigate that; but I expect they'll want money -- which lets me out.
