"--it's a railroad right-of-way" is purposeful foreshadowing, an elegant but informal segue flowing into the following paragraph. This construction purposefully picks up the thread begun in the summary paragraph.</p>

<p>After recent changes, this article:</p>
<p>1. Considers the Burke-Gilman to <i>incorporate</i> the Sammamish River Trail. I would argue that it is the Burke-Gilman to the point at which it becomes the Sammamish River Trail; it may be, physically, one trail, but at the point at which it switches names, the mileage count should be stopped. Hence it should not be called a 27-mile trail.</p>
<p>2. Says it begins at 8th Avenue NW; yet further down it notes the newest segment actually begins northwest of there, at 60th &amp; Seaview.</p>
<p>3. Appears to be confused as to whether the trail ends in Kenmore or Bothell.</p>
<p>I would like it cleared up as to what the actual length of that part of the trail actually known as "Burke-Gilman" is, and what its endpoints are.</p>

<p>For now:<br />
1. <b>Includes</b>, does not incorporate: "in Redmond as".<br />
"It is 14.1 mi (22.5 km) between 8th Ave NW, Ballard and Tracy Owen Station Kenmore [the original end of the B-G]. <i>At Blyth Park in Bothell <b>the trail becomes</b> the Sammamish River Trail</i> and continues for 10 miles to King County's Marymoor Park in Redmond" [emphasis added]. It's "duh" easy to subtract 10&#160;: )<br />
Topographically, Marymoor Park, Lake Sammamish is a logical mileage end, since recreational trekkers like to end at a lake, a high point, a beach.<br />
The name of the trail was political, and independent of how it is popularly used.*</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia, one standard for the B-G would be the limits of the old Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railroad railway, wherever that is per what reference. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Lake_Shore_and_Eastern_Railroad_4b78.html" title="Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad">Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad</a> article says it was founded by Burke and Gilman "with the purpose of creating a rail connection to North Dakota", and constructed to "just east of North Bend", so the B-G trail would historically accurately be that.</p>
<p>The references provided have been quoted; they themselves should clarify what's what. I used mileages per the refs. An easy way to corroborate might be with actual paper maps. If no one has, I'll see what I can find.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Seattle Parks Department considers the B-G to end in Kenmore (<a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/parks/BurkeGilman/bgtrail.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/parks/BurkeGilman/bgtrail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/parks/BurkeGilman/bgtrail.htm</a>). King County says it ends in Bothell (<a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/trails/trails/burke.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/trails/trails/burke.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/trails/trails/burke.htm</a>). Interesting... it would be nice if the trail were actually signed--then we could see where the B-G signs stopped and the Sammamish signs started. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 18:23, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I basically provided some more accuracy and added references to existing text, per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>. Using MoS referencing does make the raw text hard to read and edit, but the form used is per my understanding of the MoS, subject to advisement.<br />
See "Style" section in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Talk%7ESeattle%2C_Washington_2730.html#Citing_sources" title="Talk:Seattle, Washington">Talk:Seattle, Citing sources</a>.</p>
<p>For alternative-transport fans, an important point is, "How far can you go before you have to use unseparated right of way?" So providing the total distance along any contiguous route would be particularly useful, such as a planned route along the MTS Greenway, someday--or as much as exists at the stated date of editing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, that Marymoor Park is beside Lake Sammamish is far more readily recognizable to those who are not already familiar with Seattle suburbia. The lake is far prominent as well as of more general interest to those not of Redmond (or Bellevue) who are also interested in the B-G. The velodrome could well be a greater draw to B-G Trail article readers than Redmond. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGoDot_aa14.html" title="User:GoDot">GoDot</a> 05:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>2</b>. "[Y]et further down it notes the newest segment": "The <i>main</i> trail <i>resumes</i>" [emphasis added], "extensions of the trail", "and planning for connecting".<br />
B-G has <b>two ends in Seattle</b>: provisional and future when completed. The mentioned "missing link" makes the trail incomplete, indefinitely. (The contiguous route east has similar discontinuity, but that's another story.)</p>
<p><b>3</b>. My reading of the references was that they were inexact about where the trail ends or changes names in Kenmore-Bothell. My reading of Wikipedia style is that discrepancies among valid sources should be duly noted. 'Need isolate whatever definitive reference for asserting exactitude. Maybe <b>Wikipedians</b> who are <b>avid B-G Trail travellers</b> would know. Anyone?</p>

[Asterisk] As much as Cowen-Ravenna parks are one with two names. <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington_Northern_Railroad_bf36.html" title="Burlington Northern Railroad">BN</a> held all the SLS&amp;E assets when they were abandoned, so the Burke-Gillman standing is moot but remains the historical genesis.</p>

<p>Accuracy is a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">goal</a>.<br />
With one portion 17 and one 10, "[i]ts eastern half" is less accurate than the previous construction. If distances are any big deal, a table would be significantly more useful and allow more readable text.<br />
"[T]he <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammamish_River_Trail_ce04.html" title="Sammamish River Trail">Sammamish River Trail</a>, and parallels the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammamish_River_d571.html" title="Sammamish River">Sammamish River</a>" is redundant; this would be notable only if different.</p>
<p>"Judge Burke and Daniel Gilman's original Road east" refers to a particular, therefore it is a proper noun in this case, sufficient for the summary paragraph and elaborated in a later paragraph.<br />
"<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Burke_%28judge%29_9396.html" title="Thomas Burke (judge)">Judge Burke</a> and Daniel Gilman's original Road east ran past North Bend to a little above Snoqualmie Falls" is of signal significance to the article, since this is the genesis of the enterprise. It is summary paragraph content. Further, while sufficient for the topic paragraph, it also provides foreshadowing for subsequent elaboration. These are specific constructions for particular purposes.</p>
<p>That "11th Avenue NW at NW 45h Street" is downtown <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballard%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington_6c0c.html" title="Ballard, Seattle, Washington">Ballard</a> is more signficant--and interesting--than the numbered streets alone. Ballard was and developed as an independent city; its structure today clearly still retains that of a small town (until relatively very recently, the adjacent City of Frement had long remained spiritedly so). The last mills were removed from both towns only in recent decades with the off-shoring of those jobs.</p>
