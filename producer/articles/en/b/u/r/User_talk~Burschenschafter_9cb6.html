	    <p>Hi. You might want to know that 'fall of Soviet' is meainingless English. Perhaps you mean 'fall of the Soviet Union'? 'fall of communism'? It is hard to tell. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 22:13, May 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your point in name of Torun from TORON in Palestine is interesting, but problem with it is that Teutonic Knights founded their city nearby Polish village called Torun, which existed there earlier. Those Polish peasants were per chance crusaders too&#160;? <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 08:16, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>good point! Nevertheless, the teutonic city was the beginning of the present-day city. The name might be inspired by both. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a> 08:25, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anyway, i kind can;'t understand your reasoning with Danzig. Danzig was incorporated into Poland with Pece of Thorn. It had substantial authonomy, but clearly it was part of Polish kingdom, as it was recognised both by citizens itself, and everyone in sight. It was not merely "under protection". From legal point of view, it was part of Polish kingdom. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 08:30, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The concept of nation-state did not exist, and it is historical falsification to call the city "Polish" because it had accepted the overlordship of the Polish king. It was a self-governing German city-state known as Danzig. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a></p>
<p>Gdansk is historical POlish name, not invented later. Well, in 1490 maybe it doesn't sound exaclty "Gdansk", but neither it was exactly "Danzig". In that time they used probably "Kdansk" and "Dantzig" or similar, but this is out of scope of this discussion.</p>
<p>Also, Danzig was not city-state. It was part of Polish kingdom. It's status was regulated by laws issued by POLISH parliament (e.g. statut Karnkowskiego). It was part of KINGDOM, not merely recognising overlordship of the king. What supports your theory that it was city-state?</p>
<p>The nation-state as we know today surely don't exist, nevertheless people were calling themselves "Poles" and their kingdom "Polish", and they know what belong to it and what not.</p>
<p>Another point: there was already LONG discussion over using Danzig/Gdansk. You see, 1) Both names are historical names, Gdansk is older than Danzig 2) Both were used in historical period 3) Danzig was predominantly German-speaking (but always there were also Poles living there, especially amongst lower classes) 4) Nevertheless, Danzig/Gdansk was part of Polish kingdom. It had substantial authonomy, but it was "royal" city, it recognized overlordship of Polish kingdom (and not merely "Polish king"). It was incorporated unilateraly into Poland after Prussian confederation asked for it in 1454 or something and then it was confirmed (so it became official)by treaty in 1466 or soemthing. 5) Frankly, don't know how one could rpove that it was city-state. It sometimes tried to behave like that, that's for sure. But then, you could then say than every magnate was separate magnate-state. Poland-Lithuania was not centralised state, more something of federation. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 08:42, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>My point is that it <i>de facto</i> was a city-state with, as you pointed out, substantial authonomy. When it recognized the overlordship, it was granted such rights. However, it was still known as Danzig, by itself as well as in English. The Polish name was in use by the Poles, but this was predominantly a German city (in the pre-1871 meaning).</p>
<p>A very large part of Europe have been formally part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, but that does not make all of it "German" either. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a> 08:52, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, <i>de iure</i> it was part of Polish kingdom - a fact recognised by foreign states and Danzigers themselves. You, may argue over <i>de facto</i> indeed - definetely Danzig on occasions tried to behave as independent state, e.g. during Polish-Swedish wars over Inflanty - and it had their own army (as many Polish magnates&#160;:) ). But it status was regulated by POlish parliament. The HRE anaology is not that good, since HRE states wre totally independent entities in fact and HRE was way more decentralised than Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. HRE had not common army, common treasure for example i believe, and HRE states waged wars amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Also, then you wold have to call every magnate possession <i>de facto</i> a state (as had separate armies and also were sedning their own envoys etc).</p>
<p>Also, you couldn't actually argue that in say 1400s or even 1500s it was known by ame "Danzig". The variants i saw of that name in medeival maps are really numerous and amongst them are Kdansk, Dantzk etc etc etc. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 09:02, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, de jure it was part of the Polish kingdom. However, accepting the overlordship of a stronger state/king was not unusual in those days, especially not for a city-state like Danzig, and it did <i>not</i> mean the same as it does today. It does not justify calling it by its Polish name. The Polish king did not care about which name was used for the city, the deal was not about that at all. Danzig was more independent than Poland was during the Soviet time. You are yourself pointing out that it behaved as a souvereign state, which was pretty usual! <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a> ~</p>
<p>No, i said that on occassions it tried to behave as independent state. OTOH there were Polish officials inside of the city. Besides, status of souvereign state is not regulated by laws created by foreign parliaments, isn't it?</p>
<p>One minor point about Heweliusz: well, he wrote letters in fluent Polish (although this was not his native language - he was sent to learn it by his parents in 1627 to some village nearby Bydgoszcz/Bromberg), in which he wrote about "our beloved Polish lands". He was definetely both Polish (by allegation) and German (by ethnicity) astronom. His case also talks a lot about what Danzigers thought about their relation to Poland, since Hevelius was member of city council. He was also later Polish noble. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 09:33, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added some explanation for you. Pleas read the attached German-langauge link. You will learn that his parents were not refugees during the war: it was German government, who gave Bessarabia to Soviets, and Germany pulled volunteer imigrants: Volksdeutsche. Of course, if they stayed in Bessarabia, they would have been deported as other non-Germans experienced. The plan behind <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi-Soviet_population_transfers_91da.html" title="Nazi-Soviet population transfers">Nazi-Soviet population transfers</a> was to use Volksdeutsche in German collonisation effort in Poland. If you don't like the history, better do not write at all. I don't think that he was guilty of it (child is not responsible for parent) and even his parents were only tools in the Nazi machine, but I would prefer to state historical truth. <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a> 13:15, 27 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The KÃ¶hler family were not German citizens. So decisions of the German and Soviet governments were not their resposibility. They were per definition refugees.</p>
<p>Should we have notes on Polish colonisation efforts in every articles related to Poles living or born in the German areas occupied after the war? <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a></p>
<p>There were no refugees. They made the decision of emigration to Germany themselves - read link I send you in German (on the talk page!). You hardly can compare the 2 situations. Poles from Skierbieszow were deported to Auschwitz and their children to Germany. Moreover Germans were settled in the area, that were not annexed to Germany even unitarely. Poles after WW2 were settled within of borders of Poland, recognized internationally. <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a> 07:51, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure I can compare the situations. The Germans were killed or deported by the Polish racist apartheid regime after the war. And the KÃ¶hlers were not German citizens; despite this fact, they were deported by Stalin. Btw, you should learn better English before you start messing with the KÃ¶hler article. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschenschafter_b1ea.html" title="User:Burschenschafter">Burschenschafter</a></p>
<p>First of all, Germans were not killed in Poland after WW2. The second: since they didn't posses Polish citizenship, they constituted the population of foreign aliens and according to international law, it is legal to deport such a person. However, it would have never happenned, if Germans hadn't been ethnic cleansing the parts of Poland. And KÃ¶hlers took part in it. <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a> 08:47, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Nico,<br />
People Republic of Poland doesn't exist for over 14 years, 11 before foundation of WIKIPEDIA. And how would you know which world the Polish WIKI is dealing with if you don't know the language? Why don't you write a book describing your alternate history - where Gdansk was never Polish before 1945, where all Polish kings were German and didn't even speak Polish, etc. - it could be fascinating, and you would be able to really unleash your imagination, instead of just quoting XIX century Prussian "historians", the way you do here.

<p>Hi! Thanks for uploading the following image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:East Prussia 1939.png</li>
</ul>
<p>I notice it currently doesn't have an image copyright tag. Could you add one to let us know its <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status?</p>
<p>You can use <b>{{gfdl}}</b> if you wish to release your own work under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, <b>{{PD-self}}</b> if you wish to release your own work to the public domain, <b>{{fairuse}}</b> if you claim fair use of someone else's work, and so on. Click <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">here</a> for a list of the various tags.</p>
<p>If you don't know what any of this means, just <i>let me know <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni">at my talk page</a></i> where you got the image from, and I'll tag it for you. (And if you know exactly what this means and are really tired of the constant reminders, please excuse me. They will stop once the tagging project is complete.) Thanks so much. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">â¯</font></a> 22:50, 2004 Dec 18 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. You can help tag other images at <a href="../../../u/n/t/Wikipedia%7EUntagged_Images_ab3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Untagged Images">Wikipedia:Untagged_Images</a>. Thanks again.</p>
