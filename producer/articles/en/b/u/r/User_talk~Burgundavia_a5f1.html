<p>Thanks for the heads-up -- you're right; I forgot to add gfdl tags to those images when I uploaded them; I just have. Two of the images you mentioned were not created by me -- namely, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Image%7EHarvard_Stadium.jpg_97aa.html" title="Image:Harvard Stadium.jpg">Image:Harvard Stadium.jpg</a> and Image:Gestahl -- Amano.jpg. I have taken no action w.r.t. those, although the edit summary for the former indicates that the uploader took the picture himself. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 18:09, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering as to why you removed the the Zvartnots image from the Zvartnots Airport article. I contributed that photo to the article, since it didn't have one.

<p>I had a question about Fair Use - was wondering if you knew. The image I listed on WP:PUI Image:Pm_manning_sm.jpg is part of the Office of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. While such an image in copyright, since it was meant for display, since it is an official portrait of a head of government, do you think that using constitute "fair use"? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 23:44, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Burgundavia: Hi! Thanks for your question. I appreciate the fact you came in and asked, because I myself don't know much about things in the British Columbia area as you do. I found the hotel's name like that at the Fairmont's company website. I was about to write about the hotel based on a show I saw and I found the hotel's history to be incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>I wanted to apologize for taking so long to answer. I havent been in the computer so much lately because Ive been having trouble, and also because of the one day reorganization at wikipedia.</p>
<p>By the way I have a question. Everyone talks about Vancouver International Airport, but how is Victoria's airport as far as the commercial area? I love those small commercial airports, if anything, because you never know what <i>rare colored bird</i> you might see there!</p>
<p>Thank you and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you! Sincerely yours, <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio UFO Martin</a></i></p>

<p>Hi I saw your name on the page of User talk Soman.</p>
<p>I got to that page from one of his untagged images.</p>
<p>That the user in question uploads lots of images without tagging them troubles me. Because it leads to hours of work for others. Finding the source for just one image may even take more than an hour.</p>
<p>If he doesn't respond to your request on his talk page, I would support you in labelling him a vandalist. Or, perhaps prefereably, getting a RfC.</p>

<p>I guess our definition of a <a href="../../../f/i/n/Wikipedia%7EFind_or_fix_a_stub_e7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Find or fix a stub">stub</a> are different. I glanced at the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast_Airport_3649.html" title="Gold Coast Airport">Gold Coast Airport</a> article and in a few minutes I'd learned a hell of a lot, like the airlines that make use of the airport, and even an image of what the airport looks like. I got a lot of information I don't usally get from stubs. I was stub sorting at the time, and if you feel the article is a stub, I'm not going to disagree. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 22:44, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I assume you're refering to the Cambridge Bay (and Baker Lake) entry. I gave the Cambridge Bay stub a try but I'm not sure that it's improved (look at the font for the water co-ordinates). Can you have a look before I do the Baker Lake entry. I wonder if it would be better to have a seperate listing for all water aerodromes. But on the other hand would that not mean yet a seperate listing for Heliports?</p>
<p>What other soft of information would be of use on the individual aerodrome pages? I have access to the latest CFS (and get the update every 56 days) so technical information is not a problem. However, general comments other than for one or two aerodromes would be.</p>

Both the GFDL and the cc-by-sa-2.5 require attribution to be given for
any use or creation of derivative works from the original, and further
require that all derivative works be licensed under the original license.

It is further necessary for any derivative works based on the first
derivative work (the Wikipedia image) to grant the same rights and
licensing as your original image. This means continued proper
attribution (including the minimum attribution line) to the original
authors throughout all generations of the derivation process. Any
derived work along all generations will furthermore be granted the right
to produce its own derivative works, of possibly commercial nature. The
original authors of the image still hold full rights to their
0th-generation, original image; the license merely grants the right of
derivative creation, with proper attribution, to any future derivative
"generations" of the image.

If you do not allow us to use your image, we will remove it immediately
as it does not comply with our licensing requirements. For more
information, you can read the section entitled "Contributors' rights and
obligations" on our copyright page (viewable at

<p>Image:No19sqn1.jpg was uploaded and he claims rights have been obtained without properly tagging it. however i'm unable to contact him as his username is in red and i would like to see the whole "rights granted" part that he might have obtained from the said site. also under what categories do these fall the "untagged but rights obtained images", so that i can do them myself in the future. tx --<a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 09:32, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>UPDATE: It seems the image is a copyrighted image for which permission has been obtained. and i quote the rights that were granted to him. "Please feel free to use the images as long as you give proper credit." Since this image was uploaded after may 31, 2005 I think these images should be immediately deleted. Again please inform me of the process (as i hate reading help section lol) so the next time i'll be able to delete them myself or put them up for speedy deletion. tx --<a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 18:17, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks so much for all your work, you really are doing a great job. I've been combing over the images and making free replacements for whatever I can.. I've only done a few since many are of things or place I don't have access to, but I do what I can. Would there be a way you could easily copy some of the description text from the images to the entries? It would make it much easier for me to find images that I am able to replace.

<p>Hey B. Thanks for working at this. In regards to the images on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetekno.html" title="Freetekno">Freetekno</a>: The two from ontario were taken by friends of mine, in fact, I'm in one of them! I'm fairly certain that the copyright holders would not object to this use, but that is not enough; I endeavour to learn of their wishes in the matter. As for the czech pic, it was taken by someone I don't know, but is hosted on my friend's machine. Like the ontario pics, I'm reasonably certain they would not mind this use, but still I will contact my friend in the matter. I hope you'll hold off on deletion until I can verify, as the pictures contribute greatly to the article which I expanded from a stub today, Thanks <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBennyp_77ad.html" title="User:Bennyp">Bennyp</a> 00:59, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi sorry to take so long to get back to you, regrettably doing things via, govt channels takes time. Though his time it was due to a prolonged vacation on the National Health. I am still waiting for an answer on the copyright of the images though. I have managed to do a bit of work on some of my images. However I am not now sure I wish to continue with Wiki after what I can only describe as childish personal abuse from a wiki user and a possible 3RR infringement. If you go to:- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Wellesley%2C_8th_Duke_of_Wellington" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Wellesley%2C_8th_Duke_of_Wellington" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Wellesley%2C_8th_Duke_of_Wellington</a> , you will get the idea, following the user pages &amp; edits of the two users (one at least a sysop) gives the impression they work together to impose their will. I will get back to you in due course on the image copyright status issue. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 5 July 2005 19:13 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there:</p>
<p>I noticed that on the article <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor_a3d1.html" title="Sandra Day O'Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a>, you made an edit with the summary "reelected does not have an umlaut on it!", changing "reëlected" to "reelected". As it happens, "reëlected" doesn't have an umlaut on it; it has a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaresis.html" title="Diaresis">diaresis</a> on it. This is a diacritical mark that indicates that the second of two vowels does not form a dipthong with its predecessor but instead has a separate sound. And, yes, it is valid (albeit somewhat obscure) English.</p>
<p>I haven't reverted your change; instead, I've inserted a hyphen because I find "re-elected" slightly easier to read than the non-hyphenated version (although both are valid English). I only write this so that you'll understand what's going on if you encounter a diaresis in some other article, Wikipedia or otherwise.</p>

<dd>Wikipedia was recently a subject of intensive research of an huge international human right organization. A team of people from different nationalities and ages were acting on Wikipedia for 20 days, investigating previously noted anomalities of Wikipedia free editing and forming a final report, which (between the others similar reports) will later be a guide to all future moves of the organization concerning Wikipedia. Acting under an account of a real person, their privacy is to be held private. Therefore, very few private information will be revealed.</dd>

<p>I was wondering if it would be possible to add runway width to the template? I've heard of some former US military bases with wider-than-normal runways for B-52's can cause problems with depth perception for pilots used to certain runway widths. Airnav.com lists width along with length and more specific information about runway composition (I've added most of this to <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paine_Field_1d04.html" title="Paine Field">Paine Field</a>, for example).
