<p>Since you seem to be interested in the airline stuff, here is a request for help.</p>
<p>I started to put together the <i>how you get a ticket to fly</i> and the associated process. Some of it uses <i>generic terms</i> like a paper ticket and e-ticket.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how to arrange this so that it is not spread out and is in a logical place? What pages should be created and what should they be named? This is even more confusing these days since you need a boarding pass and not a ticket to get through security at US airports. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:44, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Burgundavia (I like that name). I realise that the airport infobox isn't yet ready for universal implementation, but I thought it a worthwhile edition to the major Australian airports. I had no intention of adding it to all Australian airports, for the time being at least. It was hard enough to find the stats for the major aiports, let alone attempting the minors. For the templates you've created, great work! I did a little bit of re-arranging for the Australian airports - "Closest Town"/"Distance from" changed to city and IATA/ICAO codes moved lower. I've now created Template:Infobox Australian Airport, as <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkk_d41a.html" title="User:Clarkk">Clarkk</a> mentioned, based on that hybrid infobox, but have yet to implement it.</p>
<p>Now, I'm the first to admit that I know next to nothing about template syntax. I work around this by using various exemplars. But having two separate templates, one for stats and one for runways, sounds like an awful complication. And I don't see how this will change the problem of some airports having more runways then others - though I am perhaps blinded by my inexperience. However, this idea does make sense for smaller airports, where it might be very hard to get information on either. Nevertheless, I think there should be one infobox in, say, four different versions: v1 2 runways; v2 3 runways; v3 4 runways; and, v4 5 runways. This is what I may do with Template:Infobox Australian Airport, though only two versions would be required. Thoughts?--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 03:01, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It sounds good, but still, functionability/user-friendliness is a concern. So your planning to make a test template? If so, will it be in the style already used. I'd like to see the changes I made to the Australian infobox carry through.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 03:41, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statistics should remain attached to the Infobox in my opinion. As for the airport weblink, I'm not particularly fussed either way. I made that addition to the infobox because it seemed a nifty feature, and one included in some other infoboxes I've worked on. I've seen the progress you've made, and all seems well. Although, once your more prepared, the WikiProject Airport infobox page may need to be better organised and more instructive. Also, I think that changing the "Closest town"/"City" to "Serves" is a very good compromise. I might suggest, however, you change "Distance from town" to "Distance from <a href="../../../c/b/d/CBD_1f66.html" title="CBD">CBD</a>".--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 08:19, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So you're saying that there will be a separate table for the statistics? I can't find anything on the WikiProject Airport pages that sets out any sort of standard layout. If that is what you meant, I'd advise against it. Generally, the airport articles are not large enough to warrant the use of more than one table. The infobox seems sufficient. The stats currently comprise only two facts anyways. Of course, if you mean that the stats are going to be included within the written article, that is appropriate. With regards to the external link, as I've said, I don't care if it is removed. I was just explaining why I included it in the first place. The only thing that I am disagreeing with you on, is the "Distance from" section. Town is erroneous terminology. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Business_District_727f.html" title="Central Business District">CBD</a> is universally understood, though admittedly in more common usage in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries. As for it being too technical, I think that is negligible, especially within an infobox citing ICAO/IATA. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Business_District_727f.html" title="Central Business District">CBD</a> is the correct term, and one that is applicable to all airports. Anyone who requires clarification can follow the link (the point of a wiki) and see its near-equivalent 'downtown'.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 03:49, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently <a href="../../../a/i/c/Aichi_Prefecture_c65c.html" title="Aichi Prefecture">Aichi Prefecture</a> owns the civil part of the airport. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centrair.html" title="Centrair">Centrair</a> is owned by a for-profit company. "Prefectural" prefix can be used to distinguish it from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centrair.html" title="Centrair">Centrair</a> and is for probably public relation and promotion by the prefectural government. It will not likely to appear in English document. NKM's official name by the national government Ministry of Land. Infrastructure and Transport is "Nagoya Airport" (名古屋飛行場 Nagoya Hikōjō). I suggest that the latter better denotes current status. Hikojo often translates aerodrome or airfield. I will update following this. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESoredewa_5906.html" title="User:Soredewa">Soredewa</a> 05:15, 2005 Apr 16 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment on my talk page. I think I understand the distinctions you want to make. For international vs. domestic, the real concern is whether there are customs/immigration services available. If so, the airport is an <i>airport of entry</i> (AoE). GA vs. commercial is tricky, because a lot of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_aviation.html" title="General aviation">general aviation</a> is commercial: think of flight training, charter and air taxi, crop dusting, pipeline inspection, air ambulance, aerial surveying, traffic reporting, aerial photography, etc. etc. The real question, I think, is whether an airport has scheduled passenger service or not. So here's my suggestion:</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's a good idea to include Airports of New York City as a subcategory of Airports of New York, because Airports of New York refers to New York <i>state</i>, while Airports of New York City covers airports in New York State, New Jersey, and potentially Connecticut (though there are not currently any in the part of Connecticut close to NYC; White Plains is <i>almost</i> in Connecticut). <a href="../../../d/p/m/User%7EDpm64_5105.html" title="User:Dpm64">David</a> 13:37, 2005 Apr 18 (UTC)</p>

<p>You flagged a page, just wanted to comment that the much of that timeline was taken from the following public record, my understanding would be that City Council Meeting public records would not be protected by copyright. Your thoughts?</p>
<p><i>Appendix A (pp. A-1 - A-4) of the Santa Cruz Sky Park Airport Master Plan Report, Santa Cruz City Council, 1979.</i></p>
<p>I referenced the URL just because that was the only other online source for that text and provided it to aid others in further research on other issues.

<p>Hi, you asked about the source of a bunch of Pan Am 103 images. Could you be more explicit about what you want to know? Most of the information on the image pages is self-explanatory: govt docs (PD), photos released by the court (PD), or widely available photographs allowable under fair use because we're an educational site. Perhaps you could put a note on the image talk page for each saying exactly what you need, and I'll track down the information for you.

<dl>
<dd>I think some of them have that. Please put a note on the image talk pages saying what you want exactly, although note that if an image is very widely available (e.g. the photos of the cockpit, the accused, and the memorials), then there's not much point in having a website to link to, as there are hundreds, and it would just be a question of randomly picking one. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:08, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All these images are solid, believe me. There's no one who would want to sue, and if they did, there are thousands of commercial websites they'd have to wade through before they reached us.

<dd>Please do not add the unverified tag to my images again. I have asked you to say exactly what you need on each image talk page, and when you've done that, I'll track down the material for you, but as things stand, I don't understand what you want. For example, the wanted poster of the PA 103 suspects: tens of thousands of these were distributed by the American govt around the Middle East. The particular photograph of them that I've used was released about 12 years ago by the American government. The image is PD without question, and I'm confused as to why you would doubt it. If you leave your <i>specific</i> concerns on the image talk pages, I'll do my best to address them.

<dd>Thanks for your reply, Corey. Some of the images were taken by the U.S. govt and are PD; some were taken by the British govt but were released by them; the rest can be claimed as fair use as it's an important historical event, we are an educational website, and the copyright holders' do not stand to lose money because of the images' use. I also know roughly where I got the images from. So give me a day or two and I'll add the information and sources to the pages.

<p>I think there is some confusion. The scan is a page from the original Russian out of a book that ceased publication in 1906 which can be seen from the Darmouth website. The book from 1990 you referred to is an English translation of this Russian work but the english page is not scanned so this should not be an issue. I hope that clears everything up.

<p>Well, some of the stuff there I nominated somewhat, though not entirely blindly. Knowing that an admin would have to look at the history and inbound links on each one anyway, I decided to leave it up to them to decide whether or not the nomination was justified. Some of the Wiki Syntax pages might be re-created later by a bot (at least, I assume that the project manager is using a bot there), but only if they are needed, and I don't think there's any harm in deleting the existing pages. Some of the higher-numbered ones almost certainly won't be needed again, because the first-ever run of the system probably picked up a much higher number of mistakes than subsequent runs will.

<dd>I am the project leader of the Typo/capitalization project, and I certainly approve deletion of those. I don't think there is a VFD project leader, so I'm not sure what to do there. If there's any doubt that they are not spurious pages, leave them alone. There are about 6000 VFD subpages that need to be dealt with en masse, anyway, so they can just be lumped in with those as soon as I figure out what the community wants done with them, if anything. I will ask the Wiki Syntax project lead about his subpages. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 06:03, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Hi Beland, Please feel free to delete those listing pages added by the Wiki Syntax project. They're easy to recreate if needed. They're all created via text copy-and-pasting the output of a script, I'm afraid, rather than a bot&#160;:-(. Only thing is I'd probably suggest keeping a handful of those pages - namely square-brackets 001 through to 007 inclusive, and triple-quotes-001 and 002 - because those page ranges are quite likely to get reused in future runs (those categories appear to have stabilized at those levels), so there's not much to be gained by deleting them; but deleting all the other stuff listed as speedy deletion sounds good as they're unlikely to be reused. I don't feel strongly about this though, so if you'd prefer to delete the lot, then that's fine too. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 08:12, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Corey, just to let you know that two of the websites I took the PA 103 images from seem to have disappeared, which is odd as they've been up for years and have both disappeared at the same time (yet were not connected to each other). They used to be <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/headpage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/headpage.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and [<a href="http://planetruth.com" class="external text" title="http://planetruth.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm therefore going through the images and re-labelling them fair use and will look for alternative sources for them, and may apply for permission where appropriate instead of relying on fair use. The ones that came from the U.S. govt I'm retaining as PD; likewise with the one or two (can't remember which) that I know the British government released. Hope this is okay.

<p>I was part of that discussion; indeed I was the one who recommended that category's deletion when it was made into a catch-all metro New York category. I also said in the discussion that I thought this sort of category would be a better alternative, which noone objected to.

<p>New York City is a real and significant entity, it's not an abstract statistical concept; it has eight million citizens, a 51-member city council, a billionaire mayor, even an income tax. Of course some people traveling to NYC land at Newark, but I think it is a significant fact that some transportation facilities are in the city and some are not; if there can be a Category:Transportation in New York City, then Category:Aviation in New York City should be allowed to be a proper subcategory of it.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:08, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What's wrong with a Category:New York City area airports or the like?

<li>If SPUI's still watching this (I don't want to spread it over too many pages), please see <i>Category talk:Airports of New York City</i>; there was some opinion to put regional airports on a list, but I think that aviation topics in New York City (including non-airport topics) still belong under the Transportation in New York City hierarchy.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:40, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. Thanks for your message. Well, the images <u>are</u> free. Just now, I returned to the website, which is still online, and in the multimidia section, image galleries subsection, where all the images are posted (still), the website has a header instructing the press to "click in <i>[such and such place]</i> to get the high resolution version of the images. Thus, the website was offering the images to the press without any restriction, which means that those were released and would be free to be published indiscriminately anywhere — including Wikipedia, I gather. <a href="http://www.cob.org.br/atenas2004/multimidia/galeria.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.cob.org.br/atenas2004/multimidia/galeria.asp" rel="nofollow">Here's the section</a> I mentioned, but it's in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> (look for the header that reads "ATENÇÃO IMPRENSA", which means "attention press members", right underneath it, there's the sentence that instructs them on where to click to get the high resolution images).

<dd>I could not find an e-mail address for the Webmaster (only the typical "give us your opinion" stuff). But I did find something that might solve this mistery: turns out that the images were released by the website as long as they are used for the sole purpose of covering the participation of Brazilian athletes, meaning that they did restrict use for commercial purposes. Since Wikipedia is a non-profit organization and the articles in which the images are in use do cover the Brazilian performance in the games, it would appear that we are covered by their terms. We might have to tag the images making the commercial restrictions known though.<br />
Here's the text of the "commitment term" that the press members have to "sign" (really it's just checking a box in one of those electronic forms) before having access to the high resolution versions of the images (I didn't translate it, they had a version in English on the website):<br />
<i>"Upon accepting this commitment term, I agree to use the images available in this website for the sole purpose of the press coverage of brazilian athletes in sports-related events, and I understand that any other forms of use will constitute an infringement of international copyright laws."</i><br />
I must note that, even though they were offering an English version of the "commitment term", it was a somewhat poor translation of the actual stuff in Portuguese. The English version says "press coverage", but the original version states "editorial coverage", which I believe allows use of the images in any means of divulgement, as long as it's not directly commercial (as in using the image in a company logo, for instance), according to their terms. Do you think that we are covered? Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 21:16, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm fairly certain that "meter" is the only approved English spelling for the SI unit of measure -- at least, I've been taken to task by engineers and scientists for spelling it "metre".

<dd>In official BIPM texts, the spelling 'metre' is used. However, there no is prohibition against other spellings. It is just the symbolic forms that are constrained. For example, Italians write speed as chilometri a l'ora, which could be abbreviated as cao or calo but you will see the symbolic form as km/h in Italy. English speakers are just lucky that there is a match between the words and the symbols. Think of it just like we write 'Hg' as the symbolic form for 'mercury'.

<p>I noticed you cleared the copyright violation for this article (on Apr. 22).</p>
<p>When you do work on a copyvio can you please update its listing on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>?</p>
<p>If you resolve a copyright violation you need to remove the listing on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. Remember, listings must stay in place for at least seven days.</p>
<p>I went to clear this listing today (May 4th) only to find that there was no copyvio tag and there were still copyright violations in the text. After deleting, I see that you deleted some versions on April 22, including the copyvio tagged version.</p>
<p>I've reverted the article to the most recent version I could find that doesn't contain any copyright violations and deleted from history all other versions.--<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuk_3ef6.html" title="User:Duk">Duk</a> 19:13, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Burgundavia: Hello! Thanks for your message in my user page. I love the fact you promote yourself as an airline hehe and I love the fact you are committed to aviation. I am mostly committed to aviation and boxing, but I like to stray off and write about people, or things, that have made an important contribution (or at least an infamous <i>contribution</i>) to society.</p>
<p>If I had been born a billionaire, I would have stayed in <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and made a real airline. Like <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexicana_de_Aviacion_9e87.html" title="Mexicana de Aviacion">Mexicana</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubana_de_Aviacion_503b.html" title="Cubana de Aviacion">Cubana</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicana_de_Aviacion_5ce8.html" title="Dominicana de Aviacion">Dominicana</a> and <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecuatoriana_de_Aviacion_0b18.html" title="Ecuatoriana de Aviacion">Ecuatoriana</a>, mine would have been named <b>Puertorriquena de Aviacion</b>. I imagine a fleet of <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-9_3680.html" title="DC-9">DC-9</a>'s (now called MD-80, whatever!), <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727s.html" title="Boeing 727s">Boeing 727s</a> and a couple of <a href="../../../a/3/4/A340.html" title="A340">A340s</a> and a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> just to say we had them..lol. Dreaming is free!!!</p>
<p>About the Ecuatoriana and Raphael Hernadez photos, I believe they are only free for the site because at the time I asked for permission I had no idea that the site was making a DVD and I did not inform the owners. There are several other pictures like that on the wikipedia, particularly the ones I obtained permission for. I usually search on <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airliners.net.html" title="Airliners.net">Airliners.net</a>. There, they have every photo you can be on the lookout for you should see by yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for the message and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Puertorriquena's President Martin</a></i></p>
<p>Ehem well they are over 50 photos. All I promise is I will try to contact them all. But, on the other hand the photos make the article prettier so that would be sad if they had to go. And, like I said, just for everyone to know, Rapahel Hernandez Aorport is not Rapahel, but Rafael, named after the famous Aguadilla composer Rafael Hernandez. Thanks a bunch and God bless you burgundavia!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Reckless Flight Martin</a></i></p>
