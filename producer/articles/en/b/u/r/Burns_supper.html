	    <p>A <b>Burns supper</b> is a celebration of the life and <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> of the poet <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Burns_c5f3.html" title="Robert Burns">Robert Burns</a>, author of many <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_Language_547a.html" title="Scots Language">Scots</a> poems including "<a href="../../../a/u/l/Auld_Lang_Syne_6ac5.html" title="Auld Lang Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a>," which is generally sung as a <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk song</a> at <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogmanay.html" title="Hogmanay">Hogmanay</a> and other <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year_d5ea.html" title="New Year">New Year</a> celebrations around the world. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, sometimes known as Burns Night, although they may in principle be held at any time of the year.</p>
<p>Burns suppers are most common in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, but they occur wherever there are Burns clubs, Scottish Societies, expatriate Scots, or lovers of Burns' poetry.</p>
<p>The first suppers were held in <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayrshire.html" title="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a> at the end of the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> by his friends on the anniversary of his death, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, <i>In Memoriam</i> and, although the date has changed to the 25th of January since then, they have been a regular occurrence ever since.</p>
<p>They may be formal or informal but they should always be entertaining. The only items which the informal suppers have in common are <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haggis.html" title="Haggis">haggis</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_whisky.html" title="Scotch whisky">Scotch whisky</a> and perhaps a poem or two. Formal dinners given by organisations such as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemason.html" title="Freemason">Freemasons</a> or St. Andrews Societies often do not allow ladies to be present. However whether they are single sex or not, the formal suppers follow a standard format which is as follows.</p>

<p>The host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it. The event is declared open.</p>
<p>Everyone is seated at the table(s) and grace is said, usually using the <i><a href="../../../s/e/l/Selkirk.html" title="Selkirk">Selkirk</a> Grace:</i></p>
<p><b>The Selkirk Grace</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Some hae meat and canna eat,</dd>
<dd>And some wad eat that want it;</dd>
<dd>But we hae meat, and we can eat,</dd>
<dd>Sae let the Lord be thankit.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The supper then starts with the soup course. Normally a Scots soup such as <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_Broth_f9da.html" title="Scotch Broth">Scotch Broth</a>, Potato Soup or <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cock-a-leekie_soup.html" title="Cock-a-leekie soup">Cock-a-Leekie</a> is served.</p>

<p>Everyone stands as the main course is brought in. This is always a <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haggis.html" title="Haggis">haggis</a> on a large dish. It is brought in by the cook, generally while a piper plays bagpipes and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. He might play 'A man's a man for aw that'. The host, or perhaps a guest with a talent, then recites the <i>Address To a Haggis</i></p>

<p>If the poem is being recited with any sense of drama or humour at all, then at the line <i>His knife see rustic Labour dicht</i> the speaker will normally raise a knife, sharpening it menacingly, and at the line <i>An' cut you up wi' ready slicht</i>, plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end. When done properly this "ceremony" is a highlight of the evening.</p>
<p><a name="Supper" id="Supper"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Supper">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Supper</span></h3>
<p>At the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis. Then the company will sit and enjoy the meal. The main course is, of course, haggis, and is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (<a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatties.html" title="Tatties">tatties</a>) and mashed <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutabaga.html" title="Rutabaga">neeps</a> (known in England as swede or in North America as rutabaga or turnip). A dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc. may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance dessert may be <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranachan.html" title="Cranachan">cranachan</a> or Tipsy Laird (sherry trifle) followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with liberal tots of the "water of life" (uisge beatha) – Scotch whisky.</p>
<p>When the meal reaches the coffee stage various speeches and toasts are given. In order the core speeches and toasts are as follows.</p>
<p><a name="Loyal_toast" id="Loyal_toast"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Loyal toast">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Loyal toast</span></h3>
<p>The host proposes a toast to the health of the monarch (or to the leader of the country if it is not a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>). After this speech it is acceptable for atendees to smoke or leave their tables.</p>
<p><a name="Immortal_memory" id="Immortal_memory"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Immortal memory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Immortal memory</span></h3>
<p>One of the guests gives a short speech, remembering some aspect of Burns' life or poetry. This may be light-hearted or intensely serious. The speaker should always prepare a speech with his audience in mind, since above all, the Burns' supper should be entertaining.</p>
<p>Everyone drinks a toast to Robert Burns.</p>
<p><a name="Appreciation" id="Appreciation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Appreciation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appreciation</span></h3>
<p>The host will normally say a few words thanking the previous speaker for his speech and perhaps commenting on some of the points raised.</p>
<p><a name="Toast_to_the_lassies" id="Toast_to_the_lassies"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Toast to the lassies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Toast to the lassies</span></h3>
<p>This was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to those women who had prepared the meal. However nowadays it is much more wide ranging, and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing but should never be offensive, particularly bearing in mind that it will be followed by a reply from the "Lassies" concerned.</p>
<p>The men drink a toast to the women's health.</p>
<p><a name="Reply_to_the_toast_to_the_lassies" id="Reply_to_the_toast_to_the_lassies"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Reply to the toast to the lassies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reply to the toast to the lassies</span></h3>
<p>This is occasionally (and humorously) called the 'Toast to the Laddies', and like the previous toast it is generally quite wide ranging nowadays. In it a female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech this should be amusing but not offensive. Quite often the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.</p>
<p>The women drink a toast to the men's health.</p>
<p><a name="Other_toasts_and_speeches" id="Other_toasts_and_speeches"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Other toasts and speeches">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other toasts and speeches</span></h3>
<p>These may follow if desired. It is not unusual to toast the locality or nation in which the supper is being held. It is also quite common to propose a toast to Scotland but there is no fixed list of subjects, so this is very dependent on circumstances.</p>
<p><a name="Works_by_Burns" id="Works_by_Burns"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Works by Burns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Works by Burns</span></h3>
<p>After the speeches, there may be singing of songs by Burns -- <i>Ae Fond Kiss</i>, <i>Parcel O' Rogues</i>, <i>A Man's a Man</i>, etc -- and more poetry -- <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_a_Mouse_5f50.html" title="To a Mouse">To a Mouse</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_a_Louse_965b.html" title="To a Louse">To a Louse</a></i>, <i>Tam O' Shanter</i>, <i>The Twa Dugs</i>, <i>Holy Willie's Prayer</i>, etc. This may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts. It goes on for as long as the guests wish and may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. The only rule is to give the audience what they want.</p>
<p><a name="Dancing" id="Dancing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Dancing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dancing</span></h3>
<p>There may occasionally be Scottish country dancing, if the venue allows, but this is not a normal part of a Burns supper.</p>
<p><a name="Closing" id="Closing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_supper.html" title="Edit section: Closing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Closing</span></h3>
<p>Finally the host will wind things up, calling on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks, after which everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing <i><a href="../../../a/u/l/Auld_Lang_Syne_6ac5.html" title="Auld Lang Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a></i> which brings the evening to an end.</p>
