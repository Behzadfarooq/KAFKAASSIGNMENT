<p>To the statement that formerly read <i>"The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) was kept within the Treasury Department and continues to operate the tax collection side,"</i> I added the qualifier "most of" with respect to tax collection.

<p>They were outstanding ATF warrants, because there were violations of federal firearms laws, but there was no ATF presence in the actual operation. It's really rather common in law enforcement at all levels for outstanding warrants (of long standing) by one organization to be acted on by another, often with the knowledge or cooperation of the organization issuing the warrants. It's sort of the idea of an "outstanding" warrant, and the reason why there's a system for checking whether or not outstanding warrants exist. I don't believe there's ever been any serious question as to whether the warrants as issued were valid.<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 23:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, there's been subsequent legislation, since the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (which moved ATF to Justice), that has since deleted the comma after "Firearms." The agency, for internal and external purposes, has never used the comma after Firearms, for any purpose.<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 23:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On 21 June 2006, the following verbiage was added by an anonymous user:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once Prohibition was repealed the ATF was forced to occupy the time of their now idle agents, the answer for this came when the National Fireamrs [sic; "Firearms"] Act was passed. Now all of these agents could occupy thier [sic; "their"] time by harassing firearm owners.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed this verbiage. This is blatant non-neutral POV and, as an unsourced statement, is unverifiable for purposes of Wikipedia. Sounds like a statement of opinion by someone with a bias against ATF agents. This is an encyclopedia. Let's keep it encyclopedic.

<p>Dear fellow editors: I have made some edits to remove blatant non-neutral point of view in this article. In my opinion, this article probably should not be used as a dumping ground for verbiage that is blatantly either pro-gun control or anti-gun control, pro- BATFE or anti-BATFE. I argue that the purpose of a Wikipedia encyclopedia article on this government agency is not to criticise or commend the agency or its actions, but instead to be informative in a neutral way. Also, any statement of controversial "fact" should be supported with a citation to the source for the statement.

<p>Dear fellow editors: On 14 July 2006 I deleted the following verbiage:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is commonplace for sheriffs to allow BATFE to operate within their counties as if BATFE were regular law enforcement with the same standing as an elected sheriff.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This language is problematic for a number of reasons. First, from a <i>legal standpoint</i> Federal law enforcement officials (such as ATF agents, FBI agents, IRS agents, Secret Service agents, etc.) do not as a general proposition need to be "allowed" by local "sheriffs" -- or by any other local law enforcement officials -- to "operate" within the geographical boundaries of the United States of America -- which boundaries obviously include all the "counties" and parishes in the United States. Second, the phrase "regular law enforcement" seems to have been used in contradistinction with what presumably would be "non-regular law enforcement" -- whatever that might be -- a concept, the contours and relevance of which the user who inserted this verbiage failed to explain. Third, the phrase "the same standing as an elected sheriff" is enigmatic as well. What would it mean to say that a law enforcement official has the "same standing as a sheriff"? Why would that be important? The user who inserted this verbiage did not say. For example, is there such a thing as a "regular law enforcement" official who does NOT have the "same standing as an elected sheriff"?? Why is the "standing of an elected sheriff" supposed to be relevant or important to the duties of ATF agents? Let's be more specific in the article if we're going to have language like this in the article. To someone like me who has no pro- or anti- ATF bias, the entry just comes off as some sort of bitter, non-neutral POV attempt at a "slam" at the ATF. Non-encyclopedic in my opinion.

<p>Regarding this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Jewish gun-rights organization JPFO accuses the ATF of manipulating evidence in the case of competition shooter John Glover and sells a video that allegedly proves the ATF "supports a culture of cruel ineptitude."[1] This case is notable as Celeta sells "80% Complete" guns, which are uncompleted firearms that require more labor to be functional.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's unclear to someone like me -- who has no expertise or particularized interest in firearms or the ATF -- what the second sentence has to do with the first sentence. Presumably "Celeta" is a manufacturing or wholesaling or retailing company for firearms or parts of firearms. What does Celeta or its "80% Complete" guns have to do with the "case" of John Glover (whoever he is), and why or how is the "Glover case" "notable" with respect to Celeta and its products? Can anyone provide specificity here? The verbiage as written might make sense to someone who already knows a lot about ATF and firearms and Celeta and John Glover, but in my opinion most readers of Wikipedia do not fall into that category.

<p>PS: The apparent footnote [1] reference after the word "ineptitude" in the article seems to lead nowhere when I click on it. Can anyone help here? Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 22:14, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I corrected part of the problem. There was a coding error that masked part of the text in the article, making it invisible. We now have two footnote references, and the missing sentence is now visible. But the links still don't work. So there might be another coding error (?). Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 22:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I have changed the coding on the footnote references so that they are operational. I express no opinion one way or the other on the reliability of the cited material. Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 22:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To summarize, the material now reads:</p>
<dl>

</dl>
<p>The sentence beginning with "More recently, the ATF raided [ . . . ]" had been imbedded in the article but was essentially invisible because of a coding problem. Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 23:04, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Martee 99 on 08/21/06.</p>
<p>I did some minor editing to smooth the flow and condense some of the text. I added the reference to ATF predeccessor agency Alcohol Tobacco Tax Unit (ATTU) in the organizational history. I further enhanced the info regarding the agency' reassignment from Treasury to Justice Department.</p>
<p>With respect to the "Criticisms" section of the article, I find the passages not only poorly written and somewhat jaded, I contend that this whole section should be eliminated altogether. This particluar entry should neither be a forum for allegations of inappropriate government actions nor should it tout successful ATF investigations and convictions. Those events are more thouroughly documented in their respective articles, all of which presumably have links to the ATF. This article should merely served to inform the reader of ATF's governmental function and its position within the Executive Branch of government.</p>
<p>But I will defer to other editors to see if they agree with my opinion. I hate to see Wikipedia degenerate into a dumping ground for innumerable advocacies.</p>
<p>I've re-titled and rewritten the "Criticisms" section so that it at least has the patina of neutrality, but I concur that, notwithstanding my edits, it needs more, or should go. More deplorable still is the section that follows; basically one random ATF operation (that someone doesn't like) and one random ATF detractor group (that, oh, coincidentally is selling something). These two things together say nothing about the agency's work. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a></p>

<p>"For this reason most firearms builders prefer to use fully manufactured receivers - 100% receivers - that must comply with the same federal regulations as a complete firearm.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the above has to do with ATF as an organization. Even discussion of the requirements of the federal gun laws themselves, seems to me, belongs under the gun laws in question (see the box), not under ATF.</p>
