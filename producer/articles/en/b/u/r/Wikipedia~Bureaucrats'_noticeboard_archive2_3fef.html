<p>There's a lengthy conversation going on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship#Potential_problem_brewing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship#Potential_problem_brewing" rel="nofollow">here</a> concerning RFA's and the number of additional bureaucrats we may or may not need. I think it might be useful if some more bureaucrats joined the discussion. I know some have, but more voices can't hurt. Especially as it concerns how active the group and it's members are. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 22:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, please do not remove or strike them out. Just put a comment below the vote that the user is a possible sockpuppet.

<dd>I second this strongly; removing or striking votes is a) a bureaucrat task, and b) potentially inflammatory. It is, however, extremely helpful to put a note below the vote pointing out any <i>legit</i> issues with votes, as the bureaucrats can't possibly hope to know all the various inter-user situations. <font color="#696969"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><i>Talk</i></a> • <i>Contact</i></sup></font> 07:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I support the removal of the RFA nom. It's far to controversial and is generating a lot of bad blood. A relist after 45-60 days would be more suited to gain a better consensus. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 18:57, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well not necessarily. We can't just allow candidates to choose how they want to run their request by restricting whom can "vote" and how. Linuxbeak probably should have just let the whole thing run, then at the end discounted the socks, etc. And explained his actions! (A little communication goes a long way) Restarting the RfA with these restrictions seems very odd. But HRE <i>has</i> been very quiet on the whole thing (from what I can tell). --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 20:26, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is an issue with allowing sock puppets to overwhelm an RfA that can't be remedied by just discounting the sock puppets at closing time—the effect that the sock puppets have on other voters. With a few sock puppets, this is hopefully negligible. When it gets to 10 to 15 sock puppets supporting/opposing for similar reasons, I think legitimate voters, especially those on the fence, may be swayed. Also, I know that I will sometimes not bother to investigate an RfA for an editor I'm not familiar with if the outcome of the vote already seems to be a foregone conclusion. So I think something needed to be done, although I'm not too comfortable with how it was handled. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 21:02, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, rather unusual situation here. Amgine clearly has the support, respect and trust of some very respected Wikipedians and Wikimedian's. From the perspective of a person very displeased with Amgine's two blocks in the Wikinews issue, I must say that overall (not in <i>every</i> case) the support in this RfA is much stronger and generally more well reasoned than the opposition. If I could ignore the numbers, I'd call this one as a consensus to promote. But bureaucrates are generally held to a 75-80% discretionary zone. Unless there is a bureacrat consensus to promote despite the strict numerical standards not being met (or a Wikimedia board member giving the nod), I'd say we have to close as no consensus and wait for the next time to promote. So I'd ask for some additional time to discuss this one and see if bcrats can come to a consensus or for a board member to weigh in. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If one of you surviving 'crats promotes with these numbers, you better be prepared for two things:
<ol>
<li>Justification on what makes this nomination so special (with detailed reasoning); and</li>
<li>Prepare to explain to the community why their favorite candidate is not getting promoted with, say, 71%, or 73%, or 77%.</li>

</dl>
<p>Hmmm...I voted, and expressed a rather strong support, so I obviously can't weigh in on whether to promote or not, but as to the procedure for making the decision, I think it must be treated as any other RfA. A single, uninvolved, and unbiased bureaucrat should review the nomination and make a decision on promotion; there is no need to define a special procedure. With that said, I would encourage the decision to be made by one of the bureaucrats who has both been a bureaucrat for an extended period of time and has been consistently active on RFA; this decision will most certainly require both a great deal of experience in making these decisions, and a good feel for the pulse of the community.</p>
<p>As to Taxman's suggestion that a board member weigh in, I doubt that will happen, certainly not in the capacity of binding the Board. However, as we all know, Jimbo retains the ability to make such decisions, and as the reasons for Amgine becoming a sysop have included his duties on behalf of the Foundation (both OTRS and official committee business), I don't think it would be out of line at all for Jimbo to sanction promotion on his own authority, much like the promotion of <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">User:BradPatrick</a>, the Foundation attorney. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font> 04:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Heh, Jim, I think the first point you make would be much easier than the second, as far as taking the flak.&#160;:) I am glad you've weighed in as a respected voice. And Essjay, I'm not so sure it requires a single bcrat. A consensus among us would be the only way I see we could justify a promotion without board intervention. Lets see how it goes.- <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest a compromise. If Amgine needs admin access for his work on OTRS, but there's no consensus on RfA, then we should consider an alternative level of adminship (this can be implemented through trust, not technical measures). He could have adminship where he can read deleted articles etc, but he would be asked not to block users or get involved in normal admin stuff. This was what was done for the Board vote. People like Aphaia needed adminship to use the board voting software, but those people wouldn't have made it through a normal RfA, so they had adminship for that task only.

<p>After going through the RFA, I don't support its promotion. However if he needs the adminship for OTRS, it would be better to get it through 'trust' by a board member as Angela puts it. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 07:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I personally trust Amgine, people's concerns seem to be valid ones: not enough contributions (although I admit I haven't checked how many he has), and wheel-warring concerns. I don't think we want to get caught up in what Cecropia mentioned (having to explain to everyone else why <i>their</i> candidate wasn't promoted at 71%). If he needs it for OTRS, I would rather he get it through 'trust' by a board member as well. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">Ilyan</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_Esperanza_a2a7.html" title="User:Ilyanep/Esperanza"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">p</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:#808080;">(Talk)</span></a> 11:08, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since many of the compromise proposals (that were made with the hopes of garnering enough support to get this RfA passed) were made after much of the early voting was already done, the solution would seem to be that Amgine's boosters should work out a plan that would pass muster next time, and propose it up front (in detail) when the RfA is submitted next time. To promote based on the current RfA would not be well received and I think would be a big mistake. Do you want to hurt the basic trust out there of bureaucrats as fair umpires of the RfA process? (and I say that as support voter #3 on this RfA). <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 11:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's an unfortunate situation, and two unhelpful votes, but that doesn't mean we get to strike them out or move them just because of that. Leave a message on those user's talk pages explaining their interaction in the RfA is not helpful and why, then they can adjust their position now and/or in the future without being battered.

<dd>Usually the nominator is more than just a "regular user" and would be acting in the best interests of their nominee, and timeliness of withdrawal can be an issue (to avoid a pile-on of oppose votes).

<dd>Tradition says that bureaucrats should close nominations, but where a nomination is withdrawn, any user smart enough to stick <tt>{{subst:rfaf}} {{subst:rfab}}</tt> around it and change "Vote here...ending" to "Final...ended" can close it out and save the bureaucrats the time and trouble (additionally, with it delisted from RfA, we may not see it. Sticking tags on things is not a big deal; the reason full-term nominations need a bureaucrat is to make the decision about consensus and set the rights if necessary. If there is no decision to be made, no consensus to determine, as is the case with a withdrawn nomination, it falls to anyone in the community to handle a matter of simple maintence.

<p>In March, <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> told me on <a href="../../../j/o/t/User_talk%7EJoturner_Archive_Three_e175.html#Attacks_at_your_RfA" title="User talk:Joturner/Archive Three">my talk page</a> that he was "bound to express no personal opinon on [my] overall RfA until a decision must be made, in the event [he were to be] the closing bureaucrat."

<dd>I believe many bureaucrats discuss RfAs, but they may not close one in which they have commented on, which seems perfectly legitimate to me. I wouldn't hold a bureaucrat accountable for closing an RfA in which he commented if the outcome is clearly obvious either, but I would hope bureaucrats err on the side of caution and not close an RfA in which they have a conflict of interest, so to speak. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 01:30, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally hate the singular they, but then again, I'm a tech writer, so I should be expected to be this anal about it. If I'm really into using gender neutral language, I try to use all plural, like "Let's say people are gay; they should be banned from Wikipedia". If I were to refer to one person, that would be tough. Maybe "Deathphoenix is gay, so he or she should be banned from Wikipedia."

<p>Hi, I'm not sure if i should ask this here or at the Admin's area; so i thought i'll ask here first. I was wondering if a group could be made (hopefully with me in it), and a very low, restricted block privlidge's be given. Perhaps no more than say an hour, so it at least immobilises the Vandal, and gives Admin enough time to look into the case, and give a longer block if necessary. I understand that it's a big priv, and should be used very carefully, and perhaps have a system like <a href="../../../r/f/r/WP%7ERFR_c883.html" title="WP:RFR">WP:RFR</a> did, where you could report abuses of power etc.</p>

<li>That actually requires many changes to the MediaWiki software, unlike RFR, which only requires the creation of a separate "rollback" permissions group.

<li>Determining whether the user is a junior sysop (e.g. a user::isAllowed('limitedblock') function)</li>

<dd>Yes, we are aware of that. But being in the middle zone means it can take more time. Leaving comments on bcrat's talk pages to ask them to close it is certainly not needed either, we know our job. I note that there are 11 supports and 14 opposes that have come in since 0:00 UTC on the 23rd, which may indicate the direction the consensus is going or it may not. Personally I would leave it up longer to solidify the consensus, as I'm not comfortable promoting or closing as no consensus because of the comments I made in the RfA. If the consensus was clear that wouldn't be an issue. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. In any case, we have an issue here. There is certainly a lot of supporting people, but there is also a large amount of opposers.

<dd>I request that the vote be extended by 2 full days. There is a developing controversy on the talk page for this RfA with regards to the apparent speed in which the nominee wishes to close the vote, despite the fact that more oppose AND support votes keep coming in. Given the (unfortunate) controversial nature of this RfA and the passions it has enflamed on both the support and oppose camps, extension of the voting by 2 days would settle the question of ths RfA once and for all. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 20:41, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what comments Cecropia was referring to; there were several on the RfA itself about joturner's request for closing, and I agree some of those were uncalled for. In general, if someone wants to point out an overdue RfA, I would hope they would limit themselves to requesting it here on the BN, not on bcrats' talk pages (which could be seen as shopping for a sympathetic bcrat to close your RfA). <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 11:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Or for a currently active bureaucrat that is distracted with something else...Let's assume enough good faith of our admin candidates that they aren't profiling bureaucrats to determine sympathies, and then engineering their RfAs to close while that bureaucrat will be online. If an RfA isn't closed within an hour or two, it's no big deal, but if there is a bureaucrat online who is generally active on RfA, then dropping a note saying "There is a past-due RFA" is perfectly fine. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 12:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I used the phrase "In general" because I wasn't assuming anything less than good faith about those making such requests. But there is the issue of avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest or any sort of deliberate bias. Past discussions on WT:RFA make it clear that some will not assume good faith if they can find a series of events that appears to be a gaming of the system (and contacting selective bcrats could be part of such a series of events). Using the BN is a great way to avoid any such appearances, since you don't know who will see a message here first, and we should encourage people to use this page. I would encourage candidates to say nothing at all about an RfA past the deadline, just wait until someone closes it, even if it is a day old. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 12:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The real purpose of the RfA process is to determine what the community consensus is. While 95% of RfAs are pretty much dead by the time day 7 rolls around, those few that are both close and still actively having comments added are still very much in play. Why shouldn't we give the community time to decide in those rare cases? I have seen close RfAs go both directions after the scheduled close time, and sometimes remain stuck in that close call range. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 19:34, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, you seem to be saying that it is the latter. In other words that you are attentive to the issue but choosing not to act. That is your decision to make, but I fail to see what benefit is served by drawing many of these things out. To use a recent example, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_WillC_eaaf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/WillC">WillC's RFA</a> in the 24 hours before it was closed went from 4-21-7 to 4-39-3, with very little being accomplished except that WillC had more opportunities to atagonize the community. To use another recent example, a newbie with fewer than 100 edits <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Piemanmoo_5218.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Piemanmoo">ran a nom</a> for 24 hours and drew 24 opposes before being closed. There once was a time when I personally would have removed such a nom as soon as I saw it and left a gentle note explaining to the newbie that adminship is a privledge earned by establishing a track record of valuable contributions. It is your job to decide these issues, not mine, but if you really are making a conscious choice to let these things run on, then I must say I don't agree with that. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 05:41, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's a difficult balancing act trying to please all the people all the time, and it would help if everyone could see that and give them a break. They are doing the best they can, and if both sides of the argument are hassling them about equally, then they are probably getting it right. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 08:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I was just making the point that the RfA part of the job will always lead to someone criticizing the bureaucrat, often unfairly. That's just part of the job.

<dd>Btw, the early withdrawal issue is one issue I don't really care much about one way or the other. If a user can deal with 10 oppose votes from strangers, getting 40 oppose votes shouldn't make them any more disappointed and ready to leave. On the other hand, the user has no right to have their RfA remain listed if they have no chance, and do not have a legitimate reason to be upset when it is removed early. So whether it gets removed sooner or later doesn't seem to be all that critical here. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 12:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Speaking (maybe) for those people who often oppose ealier withdrawals; I don't think there's much objection to early withdrawal of a nomination of a user who just begin editing today. Equally, there'd be massive objection to early withdrawal of a nomination of a user with 5,000 edits and the vote standing at 12-11-1. Both are about equally incapable of achieving consensus to promote. Where the problem lies is in defining the gray area. Different bureaucrats use different rules of thumb, and there's no consistency on the matter. This has and will lead to ill-will. It's almost akin to a deletionist/inclusionist debate. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 10:27, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But perhaps with a little bit of understanding, and an acknowledgement that bureaucrats are doing their best to navigate that tricky grey area, there need not be ill-will. The ill-will seems to come from an idea that they are careless or unthinking or lazy in making these decisions - which is simply unfair and untrue. And of course an acknowledgement that "you disagree with me" does not always mean "you are wrong". -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 11:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's no static bar at which ill-will is generated or not generated. Where I sit on this is really irrelevant. What matters is the nominees that are caught in the grey area. They (rightfully) have and will have concerns over what metrics are being applied and why, when other bureaucrats use different metrics. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:42, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If the situation warrants, I sometimes close an RFA if the oppose votes exceeds the support by 10 or more, after checking who has voted. RFA is not a ridgid voting exercise that needs to end at a fixed time. Consensus determines the outcome, and if it's clearly going the downhill way, it needs to be removed to prevent pileons, and from continuing to be a waste of everybody's time. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 03:31, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, have the discussion in a manner that acknowledges that there <i>is not</i> a rule, and that all the bureaucrats have to go on is thier best judgment.

<dd>I don't think you're attacking me in the least. Let me say that again: <b>I don't think you're attacking me at all</b>, far from it, I think you're trying to achieve a standard for all cases. What I want you, and everyone else involved, to realize is that <i>there is no standard</i> and that as much as you may disagree with early closure, or as much as you may support it, it is a matter of bureaucrat's descretion. Until a standard gains community consensus, questioning every early closure, or calling for more of them, does nothing to resolve the issue; it does, however, make the bureaucrat who made that already difficult decision feel like they're completely screwed, because no matter what they do, someone (and quite likely someone well respected in the community, whom they don't want to ignore) will come and tell them the did the wrong thing. I don't think you or anyone else involved in the discussion wants to make bureaucrats feel unappreciated and stressed; you have an opinion, a valid opinion, and you want to see the matter resolved. However, the simple truth is that the way that the matter is being addressed (addressing individual cases, rather than a global standard) *does* make the responsible bureaucrat feel unappreciated and stressed, and *doesn't* do anything to establish an accepted standard that can be used the next time, because it focuses on the decision that was made, rather than how to achieve a standard for making decisions.</dd>

What people don't seem to realize is that without a standard, there is no basis for either position to be enforced across the board, and that the only thing that can be done is for individual bureaucrats to make individual decisions, just as they were elected to do. What I'm asking is that everyone, not just one side, stop addressing individual situations, and instead work on establishing an accepted standard that can be used in all cases. Once that happens, there will be no need for any bureaucrat to feel unappreciated and stressed (due to this issue) because we will just be enforcing the standard the community has given us.</dd>

<p>The bureaucrats who handle admin promotions review the discussion to see if a general consensus is present (the threshold for consensus here is roughly 75–80 percent support). Only bureaucrats may close or de-list a nomination as a definitive promotion or non-promotion. In the case of vandalism, improper formatting or a declined or withdrawn nomination, non-bureaucrats may choose to de-list a nomination but they are never empowered to decide on whether consensus has been achieved.</p>

<dd>There have been comments lately to suggest that non-bureaucrats are welcome to close any failed request, even those that would traditionally be considered "no consensus" (that is, above 50% support, but less than 75% support). This position is not universal, however, and does not have universal support even amongst bureaucrats, so acting on it will necessarily be controversial. There does not appear to be an explicit policy either way, but tradition has long held that only bureaucrats should close RfAs that have a resonable amount of support (at an extreme minimum, more thant 50% support), and barring the adoption of a policy stating otherwise, I personally, and not in any position of authority, discourage non-bureaucrats from closing such nominations, as it will create controversey without fail.</dd>
<dd>As I have said all along, each bureaucrat was promoted based on a public expression of trust in the individual's judgement, and the community should trust these individuals to do the job they were promoted to do. The task of closing non-catastrophic RfAs is best left to those who have been specifically entrusted with it; there are enough hurt feelings when an RfA fails, it does not need to be compounded by controversy surrounding the individual who closed it. There is not such a backlog on nominations, especially failed nominations, that requires non-bureaucrats to begin closing them; the community should express some patience and wait the two or three hours that may be required for a bureaucrat to close the nomination. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 09:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Since the noticeboard is getting more use lately, I've updated it, moving the header text to a subpage and transcluding it in (as is done with most other similar pages), and archived off old posts. I've also added a feature to the header that we can discuss and decide if we like. Tangotango has a bot that produces not just an update of the tallies for RFAs that are open, but also a report of duplicate votes on RfAs; we've tweaked the report a bit to fit on the page, and placed it at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats%27_noticeboard_RfA_Report_b3b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard/RfA Report">Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard/RfA Report</a>. I've transcluded this through into the header, aligned with the Table of Contents (which is a bit short at the moment, since I just archived, but will grow again shortly). Hopefully, since we all seem to be checking here regularly, this will help keep us informed.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats%27_noticeboard_archive2_3fef.html" title="Edit section: Suspend RfA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suspend RfA</span></h2>
<p>I would like to suspend RfA for a month or so while we have a community discussion on how to resolve the problems with RfA. I am especially dismayed to see this cute little color-coded vote-counter box that someone has plopped on this page; it clearly indicates that we've lost all concept of discussing candidates and are now merely counting votes. It is my belief that RfA elects popular candidates without regard to reliability, and that some other system is needed, but I also believe that nothing will happen until the issue is forced.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for, therefore, is consensus amongst bureaucrats to suspend consideration of all candidates pending a discussion on the merits of RfA as a method for selecting candidate administrators. Thoughts? <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 21:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tentatively support such a move, in the absence of anything better. I think bureaucrats' hands are tied to votes at this point, and would support nearly any new system over the current one. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 21:19, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There's long-standing disagreement over this. I would expect any temporary shutdown of RfA to cause a great amount of dispute. An attempt was made by some bureaucrats to suspend RfA while they implemented <a href="../../../d/f/a/WP%7EDFA_c57d.html" title="WP:DFA">WP:DFA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&amp;diff=38201121&amp;oldid=38174060" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&amp;diff=38201121&amp;oldid=38174060" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> with rather hot responses to that move. Any attempt to suspend RfA in a similar manner without community input/support is very likely to cause similar problems, even if every bureaucrat is in support of such a move. Further, there have been a huge number of discussions regarding what may or may not be wrong with RfA across quite a number of forums. No consensus has developed as a result of any of these discussions. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:34, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Some people think RFA is broken, most people don't. I think there are problems with it, editcountitis being among the worst, but by and large there is substantial agreement that it does not have a very large number of false positives or false negatives. In no conversations about this issue has there been a consensus that RFA is not working. And to speak specifically to the little colored boxes, that it a tool just like any other. It can be used to break things or help things. I happen to use it to note where more work is needed and where it isn't, and for that it is very nice. So have any and all discussions about how to create a better process, but the answer isn't suspending a working process where no clear and present danger has been shown. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:02, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>While no fan of editcountitis, I don't see it as a big problem for the simple reason that it is an objection that is easy for the candidate to overcome... just keep editing a few more months and come back for another RfA. A short wait is not going to be a terrible impediment to qualified candidates. If editcountitis is <i>among the worst</i> problems with RfA, as Taxman suggests, then RfA must be in pretty good shape overall. I think it is. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 15:54, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with editcountitis is it represents a failure to consider the intangibles of a candidate and whether they can be trusted with the admin tools which is really what RfA should be about. So it is a symptom/contributory cause of the bigger problem. But, I should post this instead on the RfA talk page so more people will see it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:59, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see people with relatively low edit counts get approved when they are clearly good candidates. I think some mention edits as a shorthand for inexperienced, but are not really voting on the actual counts. And there are plenty of others who decide without reference to edit counts. I don't see people actually failing for too few edits. They are failing for other reasons. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 17:15, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I added the bot-updated box to the page, and if you look up two posts, discussed doing so and invited comment, which to-date, nobody has done. The main point of it is not to provide an easy "Oh, they got the required votes, lets close now" box (if I wanted that, I would have added the one that does only that), but rather, the duplicate-vote tool, which is very useful, and needs a wider audience. I personally pay little attention to the vote summaries, with the exeption of looking for those that have less than 25% support, as those generally need to be checked on and potentially closed early.</p>
<p>I don't think I could, in good conscience, take part in what would amount to a bureaucrat hijak of RfA; my job is to carry out community consensus, and without a community consensus to stop using RfA, I would be imposing my desires on the community. Bureaucrats aren't the rulers of RfA, we are merely custodians of the community-owned RfA, and we have a duty to carry out the community's directives. I would expect, and quite frankly, encourage the stewards to step in and take over promotions if bureaucrats refused to do so; it is not our place to decide who should or shouldn't be an administrator, it is our place to promote those who the community has decided should be one.</p>
<p>If the community believes that RfA is not working, then an overhaul is in order; the community decided that VfD was not working, and it was overhauled. At the same time, a single individual decided to take matters into his own hands (which is what bureaucrats are being asked to do here), caused a project-wide shutdown in the process, and ended up losing the community's trust and (in a strange parallel to this situation) his bureaucrat rights.</p>
<p>If users believe that RfA is not working, then it is their responsibility to propose a better solution, and convince the community to adopt it. It is not the place of the custodians to lock up the building and refuse to let anyone inside; it is for those who work in the building to discuss and come to a solution. Various solutions to the problem have been raised, and as of yet, none have achieved community approval (as evidenced by the fact that RfA is still running strong). Until an alternate solution has been proposed and approved, RfA needs to continue to function.</p>
<p>I refuse to be responsible for burning down the building without anyplace else to go. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 22:36, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Democracies are small-minded; they pander to the mass of men, an ignorant beast rooting and rutting. They follow the peacock with the brightest feather and shun the wise owl. Democratic elections devolve quickly into name-calling and mud-slinging -- at best they tend to be mere personality contests. Villains ride to office on the shoulders of fools. Officials corrupt their duties and spend their time in office scheming to stay there. At its very best, democracy is miserably inefficient.</dd>

<dd>A meritocracy is much better but you will understand, of course, that <i>I</i> am to be allowed the prerogative of determining the criteria of merit. This condition is self-evident since I am he who has the greatest merit. I'm sure we'll all appreciate the greater quality and efficiency of government approved by me.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>On the whole I prefer dictatorship. One Leader to bind and guide us all; that is the plan for maximum efficiency and guaranteed devotion to our most cherished ideals. <i>I</i> shall assume the awful burden, since I know best.

<dd>You insist on democracy after all? It surely is the worst possible form of government. I can think of many that are much better -- but somehow I think you will never agree with me exactly.

<p>RfA works. It is a misperception to interpret it as an election, just a counting of votes. It is clearly a discussion and a consensus decision at work here. I say this because when you watch an RfA develop hour to hour, you see how a relevant comment placed in the discussion will inexorably send the count of votes in a direction that is reflective of the community's view of the candidate. People do read the comments made, and decisions are made on those comments. That is exactly what a consensus discussion should produce. There are surprisingly few truly close RfAs, if it were just a vote, this would not be the case. People are listening to each other here. The process works. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 13:02, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a>. RFA is far more than an election. There is good interaction between the nom and other users on almost every RFA. The nom gets good feedback from the process. I have not seen any evidence that RFA is broken or that any other system suggested would be better. The unsuccessful candidates are almost always given specific suggestions and are encouraged to reapply in 3 to 6 months. They almost always receive broad supportive and encouraging comments as well.</dd>

<p>RfA is vulnernable to easy manipulation and editcountitis. However, most tof these risks are non-issues for most RfAs. RfA only "works in practice" at all, because it really shouldn't work that great at all but its seems to be OK, though getting worse. I see 5 major problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Editcountitis - "5000=good no matter what...<b>YAY! first SUpport</b>" (note that the typos where deliberate).
<dl>
<dd>I run edit counts for new (almost no votes) RfAs that I catch, close ones (70% Support), and especially ones where user's edit count total is a bit short. Sometimes the "notable article edits" will be very high, yet the total article edit count will be low...that is why I made this tool; if people are going on edit counts, at least have some I idea what the hell that means, or what the quality is. Some people, myself in included, will oppose on "low WP: edits", which I do because I <i>know</i> that the amount <i>happens</i> to statistically be very important in that specific area.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"No reason to oppose" - Even though you looked at the RfA for 1 minute, you didn't see any evidence of <i>bad</i> behavior and means that you support? Does society work by "confident until they mess up", no test, no entrace exams, no licenses, just throw them out there...</li>
<li>"Failed per 1FA?" - What the heck is this, an encouragement quota? What if person A had 10% of his/her edits as article creation/expansion and more as minor (but not just spelling stuff) but didn't work on FACs, but perhaps rather more obsure articles...Oh well, guess that just another <b>Oppose</b>. What if person B almost always makes formating edits/spelling and vandal patrol, but out of his of large articles (say 1%) edits included 3 to a FAC that was promoted...taht makes a lot of sense...right...</li>
<li>"User replies too much to oppose votes" - I understand that vindicitive/rude/passively rude responses show poor form, but come on! Is this a witch hunt; nobody can reply to votes even if they are based on wrong information, misleading diffs, or bad logic?</li>
<li>"Oppose due to POV edits at X" (when its not even clearly POV at all) or any other oppose due to reasons that boil down to "I disagree with people like you"/"I don't trust people of your nationality" or "I revert warred of an article and got blocked and want to get back at you". What makes this really dangerous is the <i>vote stacking</i> that always seems to go with it. The candidate, NOR voters should be able to rally for/against people.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go on, but there are the basics for starters.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:33, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The thing is though, there will never be some magic system that will deal with all the minor grievances people come up with. Of course there are some things about RfA that are a bit annoying, but no system is going to be flawless in practice. The things people criticise are more problems with indivudual or groups of voters than with RfA itself... any system we impliment is still going to have those people involved. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:41, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it "only works in practice", as I said. If it keeps getting worse, it may be best to find another way though. As it is now, it is tolerable, there is not enough reason to make any major changes just yet.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:43, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>On point 3, I'm considering a new 0FA standard. I mean, do we want editors who polish one or two articles to perfection while neglecting the other 1,000,000 articles to become admins? No way. Any FA involvement should be the kiss of death to admin candidates. <font size="0">(No, I'm not serious about this, but it is just as good a standard as 1FA is.)</font> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 17:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I most definitely agree with Tawker there. When one is an administrator, there is often a significant shift from focusing on improving articles (more of an editor job, doesn't take an administrator to do) to more janitorial work. If anything, mainspace edits are being focused on way too much and what counts most is community involvement and the ability to work with others. Sure, a good number of mainspace edits can show that someone is familiar with policy and is here to build an encyclopedia, but why should a less than average namespace edit count affect a user's chances at adminship? I believe that some of the flaws of the RfA process could be fixed by the introduction of new policy, specifically mentioning what is and what isn't grounds for opposing a candidate. The idea of community consensus throughout history has showed its flaws without proper checks, such as policy, (a bit of a stretch, though comparing a strong legislative branch in the United States post-revolution requiring a strong executive + judicial). It is my opinion that with bureaucrats taking a step towards more involvement in the RfA process or simply the introduction of new policy that many of these problems can be addressed. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109">Cowman109</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 18:55, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that discussing greviences is not "a cure in search of a disease". For the third time, I don't think the RfA is broken, it is simply vunerable and getting worse.

<p>I think if we want to criticise the RFA process then we should be willing to put our own ideas on the table for criticism.

<ul>
<li>Those are problems only if RFA isn't making the right decisions right? I mean, we could be flipping coins and if the right editors were approved and the wrong ones turned down we'd be fine. So isn't the first question to ask are we making the right promotions? Are there admins passing that shouldn't be? This probably isn't the right page to continue this but I think there has to be some consensus answer to that question before we go too far down this road. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 04:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I think that some admins shouldn't have made it through RfA, and the poorer among the admins, including some of those since de-sysopped, have been promoted on less than the gold-standard of 80%. There's been a bit of a slide at times towards supposing that anything between 75 and 80 is an excuse to promote without properly considering the weight of the opposition, but that seems partially to have been reversed lately. So basically, I think as long as the bureaucrats are absolutely fully sensitive to the standards the community expects then, yes, RfA gets the decisions rights. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 04:55, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, the vast bulk of admins do productive, useful, uncontroversial work—whether they drew 75%, 80%, or unanimous support. I'm also actually having difficulty finding a desysopped admin who received less than 80% on his or her RfA. Several of our desysopped admins actually had near-unanimous support on their original RfAs. (I'm looking for counterexamples from the lists <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Desysop_dff7.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Desysop">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">here</a>.) Frankly, I suspect that drawing a bright line at 80%, or 75%, or 85%, or wherever...just wouldn't make an appreciable difference. We effectively screen out candidates who are obviously unstable, ineffective, or out-and-out looney—but we'd be able to do that with a 50% threshold. We can get a rough measure of how controversial an editor is; the level of controversy we'll accept is tied to the threshold percentage that we set. What we're almost completely incapable of doing – as editors, or as bureaucrats – is predicting which individuals will, under unusually stressful or weird conditions, misuse their admin powers. That's where the desysoppings usually come from: admins who wheel war over deletion or page protection. There's seldom malice involved; it's just admins who think they're doing 'the right thing' for 'the protection of the wiki'. I don't think we can 'fix' that no matter where we put the threshold for promotion. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:17, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The NSLE case may be one where an admin expected to receive a personal benefit for an admin action, which is slightly different from an admin warring while thinking they are doing the "right thing" for Wikipedia. But you can't protect against that in the RfA process either. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 18:06, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed&#160;:). Although 100%, at this point, amounts to just 2 promotions (plus 2 delistings). Especially, I've been able to cover what I'm calling a "window of inactivity" in the Bureaucracy: it extends roughly from 2 a.m. to 11 a.m. UTC daily. During this time, it is not uncommon that all the Bureaucrats are offline, so any RfAs ending during this time could be closed with a delay of up to 9 or 10 hours.

Taxman has helped me to confirm that <a href="../../../r/e/n/Special%7ERenameuser_4e33.html" title="Special:Renameuser">Special:Renameuser</a> is inoperative at the moment, but that's due to server load at peak hours. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 15:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not necessarily true, it was just my first assumption. In any case it is better to do those in off peak hours because they are brutal on the servers if there are a decent amount of edits. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:17, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Every once in a while, I get a timeout when trying to run bureaucrat tasks. I usually check the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">job queue</a>, and if it is fairly high, I wait until it drops before trying again. The job queue doesn't have anything to do with renameuser, as best I know, but I find it to be a convenient measure of how busy things are. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 03:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most embarassedly (is that a word?) I must bring up an error Redux pointed out to me. It seems I've been the victim of a practical joke and the clocks that I use most to refer to the date (my office phone and computer) have been changed on me. For whatever reason I never questioned that and checked against wiki (and the rest of the world's) time, and I promoted two admins early. I suppose now the best option is to re-open them even though lacking a last minute bomshell, neither was questionable. My only concern is I don't want the mistake to be held against the candidates. And a steward must be contacted to make a demotion. Barring any differing thoughts from others, I'll go do that shortly. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 21:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I respect your honesty and candor about this, I don't really think bureaucrats generally ought to be slaves to the clock. If in your judgment the extra time is unlikely to make a difference then I would suggest that you just leave it be. I haven't checked, but I assume we are talking about several hours, rather than several days, right? In the past, some bureaucrats would often dispense of the obvious candidates a few hours early. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:52, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
