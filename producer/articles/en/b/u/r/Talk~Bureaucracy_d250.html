<p>The article says:</p>
<p>"Not allowing people to use common sense, as everything must be as is written by the law. For example: a particular person cannot be convicted even if they are clearly guilty of a crime, simply because the law does not accept the evidence given against them."</p>
<p>But many philosophies consider this procedural justice, not an anomaly of bureaucracy gone wild. Letting someone go who can't be convicted in the eyes of the law? The article says it is against common sense. I say it <i>is</i> common sense. Either way it's POV. I deleted the example. <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminatingvision_3e51.html" title="User:Illuminatingvision">Illuminatingvision</a> 07:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be appropriate to mention the film Brazil, which is almost entirely about the dehumanising effects of bureaucracy run wild... not sure which section though. Perhaps a whole new one concerning bureaucracy in literature and film?</p>
<p>If one were to do this, maybe include the movie Office Space? It is pretty much how pop culture views the bureaucracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreed. (Maybe not Office Space, but certainly Brazil.) And perhaps a tounge-in-cheek reference to the bureaucracy of the wiki itself might be fun too, and worthwhile. For instance, that so many of the ideals that are attempted to be portrayed in this encyclopaedia are in such contrast with the pace of modern living. (eg. the tension between the world of blogs as a personal model of expression vs. the wiki as a public model held to certain standards.) Information doesn't seem to be viewed as being inclusive to the wiki if it hasn't been run through the non-virtual publishing bureaucracy first. This seems quite backwards when the entire project of the wiki is founded upon the freedom of the virtual, open-source edit. Is this not stifling, and retrogressive, from a certain vantage point? Not that any of this is definitively true, but that these kinds of ubquitous bureaucratic cages are present (as explored in the film Brazil), seems worth mentioning in any progressive article on bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went here tying to locate the side effects from the imposed bureaucracy, the old ways(wich are mostly present in Brazil or in any other 3° world contrys). If anyone could write it...</p>
<p>I came on here to suggest adding a link to Brazil, but found that it had already been suggested! Wikipedia is pretty freakin cool.</p>

<dd>What do you mean "read like original research"? 99 % of that stuff on weber can be found in a basic University text-book (one of which I have added to sources). And how do you mean "swayed towards Weber?" Weber is <b>the</b> person everyone refers to when introducing the concept of bureaucracy. Yes, one should be careful in adding information without sources but one should be equally careful about filling a page with templates "just because". For example, there is no way one can claim that the sentence "the Oxford English Dictionary cites usage in several different years between 1818 and 1860, prior to Weber's birth in 1864" lacks sources. <i>They are right there</i>. -<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamulili_688f.html" title="User:Samulili">Samulili</a> 19:32, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure why there is so much Marx in this article. Bureaucracy refers to the methodology of public and private administration. What does this have to do with Marxism in particular? IF Marx should be mentioned (I don't see why), it should not go to the extend of arguing about the feasibility of socialism. That's just totally off topic. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDietwald_75fe.html" title="User:Dietwald">Dietwald</a> 09:08, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Neither am I. Marx didn't say much about the topic... With the excetion of the excellent section on Weber written by Piotrus, this article needs a rewrite. I hope to get around to rewriting it myself in the near future, unless someone beats me to it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 03:36, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dudes, marx was the first to make considerations from de bureaucracy, and Weber wrote all of his principles in bureaucracy(valids until today), based on Marx!Totaly necessary. For me, you should include Trotsky and Stalin too!The first sense of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Hey, but the film is higly relevant to the word "bureacracy". I think it is an excellent idea.</p>

<p>Under Criticism: "As Max Weber himself noted, in reality no ideal type organization can exist. Thus the real bureaucracy will be less optimal and effective than his ideal model. Each of Weber's seven principles can degenerate."</p>
<p>This so-called criticism misses the point of Weber's Ideal type, completely. In short not a valid criticism of Weber’s model and should be removed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The part you quoted is confusing. I don't think it should be removed but it should be improved, for Weber did point out that "total bureaucracy" will fail. In other words Weber believed that an ideal (pure, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal_type.html" title="Ideal type">ideal type</a>) bureaucracy will not be ideal (good).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, what I think is wrong with those sentences is the word "thus". The two aren't in fact connected. I'll remove the first one. -<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamulili_688f.html" title="User:Samulili">Samulili</a> 09:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Marx died in 1883. Weber died in 1920. Yet most of this article tells us what Weber and Marx said. While it is true that this article ought to include these viewpoints--especially Weber's contributions, which are still taught in college courses on bureaucracy--the focus of this article ought to be elsewhere. Our understanding of bureaucracy has progressed considerably since 1883 and 1920. Now, we mostly worry about the policy implications of delegating rule-making powers (among other responsibilities) from elected politicians to unelected bureaucracies. This concern is dominant both in politics (how many times have you heard a campaign advertisment mention "unaccountable bureaucrats?") as well as in academia (which has moved from "iron triangles" to "capture theory" to "police patrols and fire alarms"). Indeed, the bulk of the bureaucratic studies literature focuses exclusively on questions of delegation and policy control: Legislatures delegate regulatory authority to bureaucrats, who may use this authority in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>I wrote a section on these topics a couple months ago (the "Current Debates" section in the article), which should probably be renamed, expanded, and moved upward (IMHO). To make this article relevant to the typical visitor, should we not be focusing more on these issues of accountability and regulation? While Weber's contributions are relevant (probably more so than Marx's), the detailed summary of them available here belongs in a textbook, or in a less prominent part of the present article.</p>
<p>Implementing these suggestions would involve rather radical changes to the article as presently constituted. Although Wikipedia's guidelines encourage us to be bold, I'll forego overhauling the article until waiting for some feedback. (Better yet, since I'm quite pressed for time, perhaps somebody else wants to step up to the plate.)</p>

<p>Suggestion add Subset Bureaucratic Reform See the Talk page which I created "Government Reform subset Bureaucratic Reform" I have recently added this talk page with references to my web blog on government Reform at: <a href="http://managementconsultant.blogsome.com" class="external free" title="http://managementconsultant.blogsome.com" rel="nofollow">http://managementconsultant.blogsome.com</a> and my Ebook site at: <a href="http://ebooksbylrosier.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://ebooksbylrosier.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ebooksbylrosier.blogspot.com</a> Reprinted articles are noted but few all other material is my original work and constitutes a break through in Bureaucratic reform.</p>
