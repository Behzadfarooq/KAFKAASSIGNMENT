<li>RobyWayne is currently marginal, a bit under 75%.

<li>I'm confused. It's 82.6%, unless you count the late vote, in which case it's 83.3%. I promoted. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 15:12, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I probably shouldn't be talking about my own nomination, but, are you counting Boothy443?

<li>That's a valid point. Also some of the opposes are based largely on too many bureaucrats.

<p>I don't think Gordon Watts' nomination should be allowed to carry on. Given the fact that he kept on renominating Terri Schiavo in FAC, he might very well run for adminship a fortnight's time after this RFA is over. He is clearly not going to make it.

<p>I've created three RFB closure templates modeled after the existing RFA closure templates (those are, for those keeping score at home, {{<a href="../../../r/f/a/Template%7ERfap_01cf.html" title="Template:Rfap">rfap</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../r/f/a/Template%7ERfaf_a29c.html" title="Template:Rfaf">rfaf</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../r/f/a/Template%7ERfab_6fb8.html" title="Template:Rfab">rfab</a>}}). The new templates are named similarly, and are functionally identical (except with language appropriate for closing a request for bureaucratship). These are–</p>
<ul>
<li>{{<a href="../../../r/f/b/Template%7ERfbp_8fa5.html" title="Template:Rfbp">rfbp</a>}} – for a successful/passing RFB</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../r/f/b/Template%7ERfbf_3b3f.html" title="Template:Rfbf">rfbf</a>}} – for an unsuccessful/failing RFB</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../r/f/b/Template%7ERfbb_15a0.html" title="Template:Rfbb">rfbb</a>}} – this goes at the bottom of the RFB (identical really to {{<a href="../../../r/f/a/Template%7ERfab_6fb8.html" title="Template:Rfab">rfab</a>}})</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be used with or without subst. I'll leave that up to you Bureaucrats.&#160;:P In any event, while RFBs are much more rare, they should (IMHO) have the same closure language to discourage people from editing finalized RFBs. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 03:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current percentage appears to be 82.5% in support (not counting neutral). Would you guys say this is a pretty good support? If it ended at this percentage, would you promote? I would, seeing as most of the oppose votes (I think 8, although I didn't count) are cliché things like "not enough time" (which isn't always a good reason), "we don't need more bureaucrats" (why not?), etc. What are your opinions? — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">Ilyan</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">p</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:#808080;">(Talk)</span></a> 02:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

But in a borderline case some thought would be required.

<dd>There is only one almighty godking at Wikipedia, and he gets his picture taken sailing on yachts surrounding by pretty girls. I don't think that's me, but thanks for the fantasy. There are a few points to be made, and they are not directly particularly at you, but at all bureaucrats and bureaucrat-wannabes. We went througha pretty extensive process of determining community sentiment on promotions, and it is incumbent on all bureaucrats to know what they are about. You already understand the 90% plus - no substantive disability/opposition issue, but I will make a few more points:
<ul>
<li><b>All bureaucrats need to be on the same page</b>. There is a discretionary area in admin promotions of 75%-80% and a strict scrutiny on bcrats. But "discretion" means reasoned discretion, not personal opinion. We can't have bcrat A deciding that 75% is always enough, bcrat B deciding that it's 80% or nothing and bcrat C using a dart board. If a discretionary promotion falls to a bcrat who is willing to tackle it, (s)he must know why (s)he is making or removing the promotion and be able to explain it in neutral terms.</li>
<li><b>Openness</b> means that bcrats are ready to disclose all reasoning behind promotions <i>once they are made</i>. If consultation <b>only</b> with other bcrats is necessary that should be done on the other bcrats talk pages or exceptionally by email, not on IRC or the mailing list. This is not a matter of secrecy, it is a matter of not publicly debating individual promotions.</li>
<li>Bureaucrats should only discuss pending promotions or removals with other bureaucrats. There is only one place for the wider community to discuss a promotion and that is at the candidate's RfA where everyone can see and discuss it. Why? <b>Don't double the process</b>. Bureaucrats are "influenced" by the community's opinions as written at RfA. It is the only place.</li>
<li><b>Don't jump the process.</b> Discussing whether or not sentiment is going for or against a candidate while the voting is going on interferes with the neutrality of bcrats and the neutrality of the process. Whether this is the bcrat's intention or not, this is the appearance.</li>
<li><b>If a bcrat votes on (pro or con) or sponsors a nomination</b> (which is best avoided except in extraordinary circumstances) that bcrat should recuse him/herself from acting on the nomination unless the result is beyond dispute. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 17:44, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Trivial or not trivial, they're objections, and they must be weighed carefully.

<p>The thing is though, that I haven't seen solid reasons (such as 'Titoxd has engaged in mass page move vandalism'&#160;;P) -- not that I'm saying they're useless objections, but there could be much much worse than only having been here for a year (I myself got promoted to admin after 2 months and bureaucrat at, lo and behold, only 1 year and 1 month of wikipedianship). Of course, I will listen to the community when it comes time to promote or not, but when you're getting to the borderline percentages you really have to think. So I was really asking what people's views are on the weight objections vs. how borderline or not the percentage is. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">Ilyan</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:black;">p</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:#808080;">(Talk)</span></a> 03:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it is good that the bureaucrats discuss this ahead of time so you have consensus among yourselves (although having a race to see who will close would be fun to watch). Bumping an admin to bcrat seems a much smaller step than promoting a user to admin. All bcrat specific actions are reversable either by other bcrats or stewards (and those stewards are underworked anyway&#160;;-) ). Note that at Spanish wiki, most admins are also bcrats (<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Especial:Listusers&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=0&amp;group=sysop" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Especial:Listusers&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=0&amp;group=sysop" rel="nofollow">source</a>), and our bcrat/admin ratio is lower than most wikis. I guess I'm saying it should be no big deal, and 80% seems like enough for consensus to me. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 04:06, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding of Bureaucrat privileges is that they can <i>grant</i> admin or bureaucrat status, but cannot revoke either (only Stewards can revoke those, IIRC). So no, their actions are not currently reversible by other bureaucrats. I could've swore I'd seen <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> talking about creating a new bureaucrat interface for granting rights though, and I'd think revoking sysop or bureaucrat privileges would be included in that? —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 04:15, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not an issue of good faith. I think that Ilyanep is acting out of honest motives, but he is acting inappropriately. His posting this here, since this is an open forum, is rather like a judge trying to decide on sentencing after a jury verdict by asking the people in the spectator's gallery and the press how much weight he should give to the juror's various findings. Moreover, it is telegraphing "I know the law requires that 10 out of 12 jurors agree on a verdict, but only 8 out of the 12 thinks this guy is guilty. I don't think that at least 2 of the dissenting jurors really understood the case, so maybe I should throw their votes out. What do you guys think?" The main thing a bureaucrat needs, more than the wisdom of Solomon ("I can't decide. Let's cut the candidate in half. No wait! He can be a bureaucrat on odd days and a regular admin on even days.") and the maturity of Methuselah, is the fact and <i>appearance</i> of impartiality. Once a bureaucrat is seen as looking for justification and support outside the bureaucracy to promote or not promote someone, his credibility and impartiality is open to question, and so is that of other bureaucrats. Making a decision involves not only making difficult decisions, but making decisions that may go against your own feelings, if the standards of the community demand it. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 08:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, this I can agree with (the bit about asking in a public forum being generally bad). Do b-crats have a private mailing list? Maybe you guys should so things like this can be kept internal? I've seen the notes left to new b-crats about keeping the counsel of other b-crats, so an internal list that facilitates this would seem obvious (similar to how the ArbCom has an internal/private mailing list to discuss matters concerning them).

<p><b>Ilyanep</b>, I try not to comment on pending matters, but Titoxd's nomination is clearly failing. The community has expressed its support for a very high standard for bureaucrats. Look at the bureaucrat promotions: the last time I looked we have not had a single bureaucrat in more than a year-and-a-half promoted without 90+ support, and only two with more than two opposes. Whether or not Tito would make a fine bureaucrat, be aware, be very aware, that if you lower the standard for support here it will set a precedent. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 04:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I support the idea of having more bureaucrats generally, I continue to believe that candidates should have overwhelming support with no substantive objections before being promoted to bureaucrat. I am rather less fond of statistics and percentage thresholds than some others, but I come to the same conclusion as <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">User:Cecropia</a> does in this partcular matter: that it doesn't exactly look like a solid case for promotion. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 04:54, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright, perhaps 82.5 is too low if 90+ was where most others were promoted, but what is this now? I thought we were <i>encouraged</i> to discuss testy issues. Especially now with the language in the b-crat questions that imply we can't discuss anywhere <i><b>but</b></i> an open forum such as a place on Wikipedia. If you're going to put a double standard on this, I'm not going to play along. Also, maybe it sounded like it, but I was certainly <i><b>not</b></i> trying to find a reason to throw out votes, but generally in borderline cases you look to see if there is really a valid concern (hence bureaucrat judgement). Perhaps this case was not borderline. Of course I will listen to the community in the end (and especially if it's backed by the opinions of my former b-crats).

<p>OK, now that I <i>can</i> talk... <tt>;)</tt> The bureaucrat position is of extreme importance, and therefore, it requires an extremely high level of consensus for promotion, which is reasonable. In a way, I'm happy that there were more oppose voters, pushing the percentage below 80%, as that made it easy to see that I shouldn't have been promoted. Hypothetically speaking, if the percentage had been higher, but still not 90%, I wouldn't have wanted to be promoted. Any sense of "illegitimacy" in a bureaucrat would taint the admins / promotions done by him or her, which is fundamentally unfair to the nominees who would have not done anything wrong. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 01:16, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is regarding <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Joturner_6f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Joturner">my RfA</a>, which appears to me to be one of the ugliest I have seen in awhile. I have only allowed it to remain open because I thought that there was at least some chance I could get a bureaucrat to review the validity of the votes before closing. Although there are most certainly a reasonable number of legitimate oppose reasons, a good number also border on personal attacks. For example, the most obvious unfounded personal attacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"a 16 yr old fundamentalist? Sorry, but there is no way I can give my support. Ageism...in this case yes."</li>
<li>"Too many conflicts based on religious zeal"</li>
<li>"I am sorry but your zealous devotion to 'Islam', while perfectly ok in your personal life, has no place in the Wiki community. Despite your best assurances, I would not trust you, nor ANY religious zealot, with maintaining a NPOV."</li>
<li>"Oppose per radicalist concerns"</li>
<li>"Strong oppose per above. I don't think Wikipedia should have ugh... radical admins."</li>
</ul>
<p>A few other oppose votes hinge on these personal attacks although they do not directly state them. Most notably, the twenty-sixth oppose vote says:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Still, it might not be in the project's best interest for him to be made an administrator; it takes little to imagine a number of newbies or vandals blocked or reverted (quite correctly) by him, looking at his userpage and clamoring in the blogosphere that "Wikipedia has been taken over by the Taliban" or the like."</li>
</ul>
<p>And the fourth oppose voter stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>"However, an user page that is almost in its entirety bend on furthering one religion, and, to my agnostic sensibilities, fringes on the zealot, is outright disturbing. Jimbo spoke against user boxes lately, as he feels that display of bias might be contrary to wikipedic goals. I haven't made up my mind so far, as bias while editing is certainly to be avoided - elsewhere it's... just human. So while I don't mind you to shape your page in a way that's appalling to me, your fellow wikipedian, I'd feel more than uncomfortable to see you as admin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even a supporter has joined in on the personal attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I have all the personal anecdotal evidence I need to conclude that not only will his faith "interfere with Wikipedia's NPOV policy", but that it is the primary reason he is here in the first place (as it is the reason for every Islamist editor presently making the place a shambles regards anything resembling accuracy as opposed to neutured pablum)."</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet, I have attempted on more than one occasion to address these personal attacks and quell them, to no avail (see my comments in the Comments section). I would like to think that adminships are given based on contributions to Wikipedia and not on the religious affiliation of the editor (especially if the degree to which others perceive them are unfounded). I understand that the RfA may have gone too far and that there is a great possibility that even this appeal will do nothing to help my RfA, but I'd thought I'd get some input from a few bureaucrats in deciding whether there is in fact little to no hope for invalidating a few votes and thus I should retract my nomination and end these attacks. Even if I end up retracting the nomination or the nomination fails, I hope this statement opens up some discussion on the rationales given for opposing and what constitutes legitimate rationale. After all, unlike with some of the concerns of other oppose voters (such as length of tenure), I cannot address the concerns of those mentioned above. I am not a radical, fundamentalist, or religious zealot and never will be.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this; I trust you all, as bureaucrats, will make a well thought-out decision, no matter what that decision may be. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 15:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There <i>were</i> valid reasons to oppose this nomination; there are valid reasons to oppose anyone. Personally, I mistrust any RfA that garners not a single oppose vote; it suggests that the candidate is not suffciently well-known or experienced.

<dd>Keep in mind that Islam is a controversial issue. Both of the main English-speaking countries (the UK and the US ) are currently in a war on <i>radical</i> Islam. Many people don't realize that greater than 99.9% of Muslims are opposed to (and even ashamed of) the ideas of Bin Laden. We need people like you who both know about the topics <i>and</i> can confine themselves to a scholarly tone and NPOV. If it makes you feel any better, sysop rights (with the exception of editing protected pages) focus on the inner workings of Wikipedia, not the articles themselves.

<dd>I apologize for missing Turnstep's RfA. When I came around to it this evening, it was so late that I thought no one (including myself) had promoted because the time wasn't up. Then I looked at the calendar. Therefore, I grant <s>Joturner</s> Turnstep the right to do <i>twice</i> the admin work for the next day to make up for it!&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 05:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi.

<dd>My apologies, HereToHelp. I guess my brain went on Wikivacation.
