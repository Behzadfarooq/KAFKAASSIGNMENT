<p>We return to when Team Shino is stuck in the cave and Hinata is heading towards them. Hinata looks ahead with her Byakugan and sees that the tunnel ends in a huge drop and thinks about Naruto. She thinks about how she won't give up in this situation. She uses chakra to cut the wax but doesn't make it in time.</p>
<p>Team Shino is trapped to the floor with honey and nectar and the two male ninjas return, saying that they and all the bees looked for the bug but couldn't find it. Shino is sending his bugs out, little by little while the ninjas argue about having to torture the genins. Shino agrees, if they hand over Hinata, the ninjas are skeptical about this but Shino says that they will regret this if they don't. The ninjas huddle and know that if they keep on stalling, the Bikouchuu will hatch and become useless. Naruto is worried about Hinata but Shino tells him not to worry as Hinata is strong and can hold her own while his bugs come out and say that she is much stronger than Naruto thinks she is. The ninjas agree to their demands and they say that they want to see their comrade first. The ninjas discover that the string is empty and Naruto is mad at them. The male ninja with the yellow hair mocks him by asking whether or not Hinata is Naruto's girlfriend. Naruto calls him a buzzard. Shino calmly says that if they don't have Hinata, they won't get the Bikouchuu.</p>
<p>The female ninja comes to a conclusion and decides to kill them or else they had better tell the Rock-nin where the scent bug is. The other male ninja holds a kunai to Kiba's throat, who is knocked out, while the yellow haired one is smashing his foot in Naruto's head. Shino is about to beat him, but Naruto says that he will beat them up. The yellow haired one tells him to shut up and slams his foot into Naruto's head repeatedly but Naruto raises his head with the eyes of the nine-tailed fox and the yellow-haired clan member jumps back and rushes to kill him. A kunai lands in front of his foot and attached to it is an explosive seal. The seal detonates and Hinata appears holding a stance.</p>
<p>Hinata had apparently managed to break the covering after all just when the cocoon went over the edge and freed herself. She then managed to grab hold of a ledge just 10 feet below the top of the waterfall and stayed on. They are surprised that she managed to get out. Hinata says that she hasn't used THAT yet and the ninjas use Bee Bomb Technique, 1,000 Bee Needle Technique, and Bee Wax Technique, all at the same time. Hinata focuses, telling Naruto to watch her and uses Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. This jutsu allows Hinata to project a long, sharp chakra "blade" from each palm, and makes her hands move so fast, it makes her look like she had eight hands and knocks out all of the bees in the air with ease. Naruto just watches her saying that is really amazing. Shino says that the present Hinata is not the one in the past and says that she has been developing. It flashbacks to when they were doing their hobbies and when he asked what was her hobby. Hinata's answer was that to help her with her training and we see Hinata getting beat up several times but she refuses to give up even after Kiba's attempts to help her.</p>
<p>Hinata had also developed her own style and the move she is using right now is the result of her own training. Shino suddenly breaks out of the wax while Naruto is stunned at how he did it. He calmly says that angering the bee and getting encased in wax, was all part of the plan. The only way the larva couldn't absorb their chakra was when they didn't move. He was also using the bugs to hollow out the wax to make it easier to break it. When Hinata uses her chakra and her precise chakra control, all the bugs are basically diced like things in a blender. She does this to be acknowledged by Naruto. The ninjas are worried and they notice how Team Shino had escaped. The female one then summons a huge bee. The bee shoots a stream of honey at Hinata which obscures her vision and allows the bee to knock her down and send her tumbling. Naruto attempts to rush to her but Shino holds him back while Hinata gets up and tells him to let her do the rest.</p>
<p>The chakra is suddenly visible like a net covering Hinata. The bee charges but is deflected by it and the bee crashes into them which knocks them out. Naruto catches her as she falls down and tells her that the technique was really amazing. Shino tells them that they should hurry as dawn is beginning to rise. Naruto mentions that the egg has already become a pupa and Sasuke, just wait... The female ninja is back and Kiba is amazed at how she can still move. Shino explains that he put the Aburame clan's secret bug repellent on it when he hid it in a tree and that as long as she used bees to look for them, they could never find them. The girl says that as long as they are here, their clan is doomed to be destroyed. The girl summons a giant bee to crash into them, even if it costs her her life. Naruto uses Kage Bunshin and creates Spiraling Sphere. The female ninja tells him to shut up as the bee charges and Naruto uses Rasengen to destroy the bee and put her out of condition.</p>
<p>Naruto cheers but he has lost the headband and Shino tells him to hurry as the Bikouchuu is beginning to hatch. Hinata uses Byakugan but the headband is stuck between to rocks and the egg begins to hatch. Naruto, farts right in their faces. Kiba howls as the Bikouchuu hatches. Naruto grabs the headband and finds Team Shino holding their noses and Shino lets out the Bikouchuu and it lands on Naruto's butt. Naruto howls in protest, saying that one didn't count but Shino knows that it is no use.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Sakura chasing Naruto across Konoha and on rooftops screaming:</p>
<p>Hey! Hold it! I was told that the mission failed because you farted! You better take responsibility for this!</p>
<p>Naruto: But it's too late now!</p>
<p>Sakura loses Naruto in the middle of a city but she notices the Bikouchuu, which lands on Naruto's butt and Sakura exclaims that she found him and knocks Naruto down (which used Sexy no Jutsu to hide in the crowd) with a headward punch, who disappears to reveal Naruto. Naruto tells her to forgive him but she doesn't. Tsunade hears that the mission was a failure from Shizune and says that Hinata must be depressed and we she at the Hyuuga house that Hiashi is telling her that she failed but Hinata happily; says that she will work harder while Hiashi is confused at why she is so happy and agrees with her while she thinks "More, more more".</p>
