<p>Thanks you for answering my message. As you know, originally I created the page on Death(Discworld) and there was Copyright issues so it was taken down. At first I didn't understand to rewrite to a temp page and just rewrote it over the article a few times. They were quickly taken down each time and I didn't understand why, so I asked you. You then informed me about the temp page and I then copied what I had rewritten onto the temp page. That anon is not me, but in my rewrite I did originally write the info about the extra characters and about the film adaptations. (Because I own both) I don't know how that page is dated before my temp. It probably has something to do with my rewriting on to the article and not the temp page. When I first created the original page there was no other entry about it. Unless you can pull the history of the original article before it was replace by the stub (it showed the history of my rewrites), I don't know how I can prove I wrote it. I'm sorry for all the mess and I thank you for looking into it like this. The only thing I could find to help was the stub creation date it gives in the history now is: 23:14, 26 Jun 2004, and your first reply to me in reference to my question about the page was before that at 08:53, Jun 26, 2004. I had already rewriten it a few times before I even got in touch with you. I hope this helps and thanks again.</p>

<p>I have a question in reference to the message below that I sent you months ago. You sent me a reply very quickly and I appreciate that and I did exactly as you suggested rewriting the page on the /temp version of the page. My question is did I do something wrong when I did this. When the page was restored what I wrote in my rewrite from the /temp was placed as the article but it was not credited to me. (Instead Jimregan was credited with stub creation) It was like this other user just copied what I wrote and posted it as his entry. You can still view the temp page and compare the two. I know it's been little while but I was reviewing this in my contributions and it just kind of gets on my nerves. I also want to figure out what I did wrong, incase this ever happens again I know what to do. Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Burgundavia how are you, one of the pages that I created <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Discworld%29_41df.html" title="Death (Discworld)">Death (Discworld)</a> was removed with a copyright notice. I don't feel as if it is, just that the page that was claim to be the source is describing the same character just in much more detail. But, I want the page to work properly so I rewrote it on the temp page. Would you be so kind as to take a look at it and make sure there is no problems with it before it goes up. Thanks for your time and your welcome message.</p>

<p>Hi. You posted the following on my talk page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hey, I just noticed you listed this page The Cheese Profiler on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVfd_3559.html" title="WP:Vfd">WP:Vfd</a> as "crap". One of the things about Vfd is that the author is probably going to see that, if they care about joining the community at all. So be kind, be gentle, as it costs you nothing. Also, it makes it much harder for people to vote. Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 10:02, Jun 23, 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So the author might see it -- great. Maybe he/she then won't post crap again. How does calling crap crap make it hard for people to vote? If they don't agree it's crap they'll vote to keep. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 21:35, Jun 23, 2004 (UTC). PS, just had a thought. How do you interpret the word crap? I use the word as defined in defs 1 and 2 in Wiktionary, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Crap" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Crap" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Crap</a>. Lots of people down this way do. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPing_4215.html" title="User:Ping">User:Ping</a> too, I notice.<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 21:42, Jun 23, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree it is crap, however the principle of do not bite the newcomers applies here. There is as much general unfriendly almost clubiness that happens at vfd, something that annoys me (and I happen to know other users too) a great deal. Try and keep that to be a minimum. Try not the turn it into Slashdot, which is what I fear that it is becoming. And no, User:RickK is not someone to emulate, IMNSHO. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 02:16, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't jump to conclusions with the word <b>newcomers</b>. If you were following Vfd a couple of weeks ago you could have seen two very clever hoaxes, from two different IP addresses. Posted by the same person who tried to give the impression he was two newbies. Formatting gave the show away. Exactly the same as for a couple of other items deleted some months back. Furthermore, if you have a beef with people clubbing it together on Vfd then tell them. Don't say to me -- <i>try and keep that to be a minimum</i> (a D minus for English) or <i>try not the turn it into Slashdot</i>. I've just checked my last 500 posts and see that excepting the two hoax posts mentioned above, I have posted to Vfd only five times since April 29. When you dry behind your ears you might learn to check things before shooting off. Don't worry, most of us went through it. Incidentaly (2), do you not thibk there is a place in Wiki for people like RickK? If you intend to reply, do so here to preserve continuity of the conversation. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 03:05, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I follow Vfd quite regularly, and I don't really like a lot of what happens there. For the record, I have never had anything I really cared about, or even had a strong opinion on, listed on Vfd. This is not an attack because I rubbed against the people there the wrong way. My main argument is that we should assume the best, and thus treat the entry as such. If you look at my edit history, I am not a blanket inclusionist, I have voted to delete things. As for RickK, is a very useful and valuable member of WP. I could live with a little less of his shoot from the hip attitude, but I have been accused of that before as well. He is a useful check and he makes a great many extremely useful edits. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 06:46, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can <i>assume the best</i> and be as touchy feely as you like, but we are not here for YOUR feelings or MY feelings. We are here to always try to improve the integrity of Wilkipedia. Naive defence of crap postings lowers standards rather than elevate them. Next time you say things like - <i>try and keep that to be a minimum</i> and <i>try not the turn it into Slashdot</i> to someone without the slightest justification, as has already been pointed out to you, just try saying "sorry". I'll take what you call RickK's <i>shoot from the hip attitude</i> over your immature lectures any day. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a>

<dd>It is the use of words like 'crap' in Wikipedia which degrade it.

<dd>This is not an either or situation. We can still remove that which needs to be removed from WP and be civil about it. At no point have I argued that we should have keep anything you have voted to delete, merely that in the process, civility and humanity can be remembered. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 15:57, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why is it that holier than thous need to introduce red herrings such as you did here. No-one suggested anywhere that you argued to keep anything I voted to delete. Why do you feel a need to make that inference? Also, when any of us here consider something is crap, we will call it crap. You stay as PC as you like, and perhaps work towards deleting the word <i><b>crap</b></i> from Wiktionary. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 22:23, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is not about staying PC, it is about staying civil and professional. The written word is a terrible medium for conducting business, because you cannot shade with emotion. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 22:29, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>To the contrary, the written word is the very best medium for conducting business, because it leaves evidence of what was said. Furthermore, there are many words that convey exactly the right description of something. Take <b>CRAP</b> for instance. The first two defs in Wiktionary say it means <b>1. Something of poor quality</b> and <b>2. Something that is rubbish, useless.</b>. That <i><b>perfectly</b></i> decribes the article listed on Vfd . Isn't it great to witness the very evolution of English usage. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 01:11, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As soon as the majority of news broadcasts, newspaper articles and journal articles begin to use the word "crap" to describe anything of poor quality, I will support its inclusion in Wikipedia. Until that point, we should strive to keep Wikipedia's literary quality above what Americans would call "potty-mouth". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 04:06, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>TWO extremely important points here. Firstly, what arrogance motivates you to think you can claim that YOU are WE? You most definitely are not we. Secondly, Wikipedia is an international co-operative, and not everyone on Wiki blindly accepts Americans' opinions re everything. I'm surprised you hadn't noticed that already. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 08:09, Jun 29, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, WP is an international org, but crap is not used on many other countries news broadcasts either, AFAIK. I think the original intent of my comment is lost. All I asked for was some common courtesy. Using, Not "encyclopedic, IMHO" as opposed to "crap". Crap and other derogatory words are, IMHO, not useful for building communities and long term relationships, most especially in the critical first few impressions. IE, I can say to someone who I have interacted with a lot that I think their edit was crap, but that is because they know I am not attacking them and that generally there edits are good. However, with someone new, if the first thing they see when they know nothing of the project, is a page of theirs being described as crap, would I want to return? Please, put yourself in their shoes. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 08:17, Jun 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You claim YOU can target someone with <i>there edit was crap</i>. Funny how you want the right to do so but deny me the same right! I was NOT targeting a personality, but described a crappy post as crap. It was crap, and it still is crap. How about you catching up with the real world? What has the reference to <i>many other countries news broadcasts</i> got to do with anything? What are you on about? Totally irrelevant. Another red herring smokescreen. I asked a question a couple of days ago, but it wasn't answered, so here we go again --<i>why is it that holier than thous need to introduce red herrings?</i> <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 08:52, Jun 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This discussion is going around and around and getting nowhere. Let me deal with your complaints one at a time.
<dl>
<dd>1 - "You claim YOU can target someone with <i>there edit was crap</i>. Funny how you want the right to do so but deny me the same right!" - I retract this statement, as it was not well thought out.</dd>
<dd>2 - "I was NOT targeting a personality, but described a crappy post as crap. It was crap, and it still is crap" - An important point, that all things are our opinion, thus crap is your opinion. We are building a professional encyclopedia, and thus I try and treat people with respect and professionalism, as I would in a job. In a professional environment, one does not use crap all that much, AFAIK.</dd>
<dd>3 -" many other countries news broadcasts" - refers to you saying that we should not be amerocentric, which was a comment on mark's (an Aussie) comment on crap being used in american news. Thus I stated that crap probably isn't used on any other countries news broadcasts either.</dd>
<dd>4 - This discussion is <b>not</b> about the article itself and its relative merits. That discussion happened on Vfd, as it should. This discussion is about how things should be worded on Vfd when listing and discussing those articles. Again, I maintain my position that we should maintain a professional attitude whenever possible and treat people in that way, even if this is the 3rd (or the 9th, or the 32nd) non-encyclopedic article by the same person. I say that we should evalutate the article, not the person writing it, otherwise ad hominem can quickly sneak in. IE, User:XYZ always writes crap, therefor it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 09:15, Jun 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Corey! Excellent job on the new pages! I really like the lay-out on the airport pages, and I hope you put the lay-outs on the seven Puerto Rican airports I wrote about.</p>
<p>About Puerto Roco not being a country, well, thats one of the most controversial issues in he world. While we have no [[United Nations] representation, we have <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> authonomy. While we "are a state" we cannot vote during Presidential campaign. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airlines.html" title="List of airlines">Airlines</a> from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> always consider us an "international destination", yet airlines from <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> airlines are subject to have NA??? numbers on them. Its really confusing. My family is a great example of the confusion. My grandpa wants it to become the fifty first state of the union and so does my mother. Me and my father want it to be independent. I tell my grandfather, well if you wanna be "American", why dont you cheer for the American <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a> when they fight <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Trinidad_a701.html" title="Felix Trinidad">Felix Trinidad</a> and mom, I tell her , If you think youre American, cheer for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a> instead of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Puerto_Rico_e814.html" title="Miss Puerto Rico">Miss Puerto Rico</a> at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Universe_b97e.html" title="Miss Universe">Miss Universe</a>, which; by the way; is another ting there, beauty organizations recognize Puerto Rico as an autonomous country when it comes to peagants.</p>
<p>My own family's arguments reflect those of other Puerto Ricans. They proudly wear Puerto Rican flags everywhere, but the ones who vote for the <a href="../../../p/n/p/PNP_d889.html" title="PNP">PNP</a>, the party that wants Statehood, I call those hypocrites. My view is that only Puerto Ricans who go for the <a href="../../../p/p/d/PPD_d4e2.html" title="PPD">PPD</a> or the <a href="../../../p/i/p/PIP_354e.html" title="PIP">PIP</a> are honest in saying they are proud to be Puerto Rican.</p>
<p>Having lived in the States for fourteen years, I have a lot of gratitute to this country and love to the state I live in. I have no plans to return to Puerto Rico because I, like millions others here, want to be a celebrity and hit it real big here. But I would definitely enjoy the dual citizenshio guaranteed by the constitution to me and those other Puerto Ricans born under American control of our island! Most Puerto Ricans say Puerto Rican is their nationality and I would be so proud if it could finally, officially , be recognized as a nationality by the other countries.</p>
<p>In theory, looking at the debate of whether Puerto Rico is a country or a state, is really like looking at a <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">Tennis</a> court: All lines are perfectly lined, all dimensions perfectly set, you cant tell one side from the other, only two competitors raking it up against each other in sides that perfectly match each other.</p>
<p>I recently found out that Puerto Rico actually had a President for three months during the [[1700s], in an article written by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">my dad</a>.</p>
<p>As far as Puerto Rico being a country or not, politically , you're right. But me and millons other Puerto Ricans refuse to be called "Americans" and get this, I know this is stupid, but even many statehood voters dont want to be called "American", unlike mom and grandpa, of course. I tell people "Look, even if we become a state, they (generally) will keep on looking down at us because we are not as white as they are!"</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vieques%2C_Puerto_Rico_0812.html" title="Vieques, Puerto Rico">Vieques</a> victory, in which Viequenses have discovered they can progress without the large economical resources the military provided, many Puerto Ricans have been inspired to create a movement geared towards Puerto Rico becoming a Republic by <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, similar to what happened in a former American possetion in the [Pacific Ocan]]. Shall Puerto Ricans then decide they want to become a republic, the States are entitled to give Puerto Rico independence in six months, maintain us for a further 71 years so we can establish an economy, give us Puerto Ricans who were born under American ownership dual citizenship, and we'd be entitled to a seat in the United Nations.</p>
<p>Im not mad at you for bringning the thing into the table, rather thankful. I pray to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> that someday the rest of the world that sees our ties with the States, which were, by the way, forced upon us in the early 20 Century as we had no say then when the state took over, accepts us as a different country.</p>
<p>Go there and you will see it by yourself: We are <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, not the States when you get there. Most Latin American Presidents, when talking of Puerto Rico, call us "el pais de..." or "the country of" as do most other Latin American people, out of respect to our "country", because, whether we are a part of the States or not, it is a fact that we are <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanics.html" title="Hispanics">Hispanics</a>, that Puerto Rico is accepted by everyone as part of Latin America, and that the culture simply reflects that of the rest of our Hispanic countries.</p>
<p>I, myself, consider to be 200% proud of being Puerto Riocan and %150 percent proud of being Latin American, no matter what others say about us here. Im a %100 percent supporter of the human rights of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> illegals and other Latino illegals here.</p>
<p>So, in theory, and to finish this message herem I guess the balance is, well...balanced in tis case. I mean, what about that? While still legally a possetion of the United States, the Latin Anmerican confederations and organizations always include Puerto Rico in their programs! Whats more, look into the internet and you will see how huge he debate is!</p>
<p>I hope you can leave Puerto Rico on the list of airports and countries at least for a while. As I said, airlines from North America do consider Puerto Rico an international destination...</p>
<p>Thanks, bud, and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless!!</p>

<p>Hello, i'm the same sebjarod from fr.wiki. I want to excuse myself if I appeared too rude this morning (french time) when you start to move interwikis and cat. I was not; I just wanted to spare you the effort since bottom- or top-page-interwikis is a very old topic of debate between some people on fr. And, since, these somes are sometimes quick to heat up, I wanted to spare you their ressentment.</p>
<p>So, if you want to do things on fr., I am not the one that will stop you from it.&#160;:)</p>

<p>ps: dear Corey, as a member of the Association of Members' Advocates, and one of the first wikipedians to offer me useful advise, I feel you might be able to help with something I am finding rather odd of late, something which I am not conplaining about but which seems rather unatural to wikipedians...</p>
<p>This being that I have specifically written from scratch a number of items for the website that have remained unchallenged, and unaltered.</p>

<p>Either I have become proficient in my spelling, and research to the point of excellence, or I am being deliberately ignored by other users?</p>
<p>All of my copyright problems have now been resolved but I am not happy that the history files on my item the great fire of whitstable are still available, can these be removed?... <a href="../../../f/a/e/User%7EFaedra_13a7.html" title="User:Faedra">Faedra</a> 13:07, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yea, not being able to put tuff at the bottom makes it a royal pain. I already have too many commerical airports to make the page look good. So, I'm going to create a <i>List of Airports of the United States that need articles</i> and put that in Category:Airports of the United States. Should look a lot better. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:19, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the list of US airports needs to die. A list of what's mising that should at some point either die or only list less then notable airports sounds better. Lists need to be maintained. I think there is way too much work in keeping the destinations for each airport current, so another list that would require constant manual changes seems to be the wrong way to go. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:28, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Putting them in the states' Category sounds like a good balance. I'll do that. I can speedy delete the list I just created if I empty it. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:44, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
