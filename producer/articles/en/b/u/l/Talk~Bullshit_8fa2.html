<ul>
<li>Of course. The " <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">F</a> word" is one of our most heavily-visited pages. We're (mostly) adults here, and Wikipedia has long held (as far as I can tell) an anti-censorship policy. If it's encyclopedic, it stays. That said, I would support a way of "child-proofing" Wikipedia if I knew of one that was feasible, but presently there is none, and unless angry parents start banging on the doors, I doubt the "powers that be" will see a need for such. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 07:47, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Bullshit is only a taboo word in some societies, not sure which ones though. Heh! Scope for an article there, List of Societies where bullshit is taboo. Just joking. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPing_4215.html" title="User:Ping">ping</a> 07:34, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Horseshit is sibilant, euphonious, concentrated, well-formed and pungent, whereas bullshit is flat and featureless (and hackneyed by careless usage). Bullshit is used in a trite and generalized perjorative manner; horseshit is more specific and more insulting. The sibilance connotes action, akin to spitting or pissing."</p>
<p>Yes, I'm complaing about pov in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit.html" title="Bullshit">Bullshit</a>.

<p>Trivial yes, but the part about the difference between 'bullshit' and 'horseshit' seems to consist with how I've observed the difference between the terms. I guess if you can think of social situations, you might be able to see the author's point. All bullshit aside, I think it should stay and the disputed POV tag should be removed, unless there are people who genuinely believe this article is just a bunch of horseshit. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 05:46, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I always thought "money talks, bullshit walks" had more to do with the power of money, ie, with money behind it a bullshit idea will prevail, or money is so powerful it can make bullshit walk.

<p>Arguing by deletion is not the wiki way. It is bullshit. Ok deleting the large lump in the major entry is one thing. Deleting the literal, accurate, factual example of the the use of bullshitting is Australian Humour located way down the page was another. Deleting the dissenting view which is clearly labelled dissenting that cross references to another source of examples of high quality bullshit so that the reader may be exposed to a variety of styles of bullshitting is something else altogether. Presumably the deleter is so zen a wikipedian that not only can they delete the arguments they can delete that there is an argument. In my view the deleter is 'full of it'.</p>
<p>In the deleters view was arrived at apparently in period of 3 minutes, The deleter describes the deletions removing off topic nonsense. The notion that BS occurs in places other than the US, arrived in other countries not via the unsupported and undocumented (undocumentable ie bald assertion, ie BS) process "American popular culture has spread the term to other English-speaking countries.", and that indeed the concept may have arisen elsewhere and been introduced to the US. The deleter contends all this is off topic nonsense. The article as it stands does not convey the concept of BS, I defy people to convey the concept of BS without examples. BS examples do not announce a priori what you are about to hear is BS. BS sometimes becomes self apparent as it goes on. It is true that 'untrue BS' is infinite has no place on wikipedia it belongs on uncyclopedia, which is full of it, the deleted entry was true, and factual and relevant it was simply written in the style of an Australian Bullshitter. The local Australian audience thought it was pretty darn accurate, presumably the cultural gap to the deleter was too wide. Presumably the deleter is the keeper of the one true source of BS. I suppose those that really want see it can examine easily the history, that is until the deleter argues by deleting this pointer to that aswell.</p>
<p>Before arguing by deleteion again please consider what is left when you do. The remaining entry goes such tiny part of the way toward defining Bullshit. The original entry can be sumarised as follows:</p>
<pre>
  "it can be used as an interjection (or in many other parts of speech) and can carry a wide variety of meanings."
</pre>
<p>Well thats informative (not) it is a word can be intejected and it means something (actually more than one something....) This totally disregards the idea that Bullshiting is something you can do. Perhaps in the US that is the only use for the word, but in other countries most notably Australia the concept is much richer and fuller.</p>
<p>The idea presented little lower that Bullshit is somehow synonomous with 'mistake' is simply wrong. Bullshit when uttered is generally a deliberate act. A much better synonym for Bullshit as an interjection would be 'inaccurate'. However as with the examples added on the article page they are not 'inaccurate', a majority of voters do indeed in a sense effectively vote 'none of the above' when asked 'who do you want to be president of the US'. If anything that claim could be accused of being overly or pedantically accurate. Although that argument is bullshiting a simple interjection 'Bullshit' would be innapropriate. The appropriate interjections would be 'stop bullshiting', or 'cut the bullshit', these interjections are not equivalent to saying "I call bullshit on that" (which means 'I say that is untrue'), these ideas even though usuually expressed by seemingly 'unedcuated yobbos' are both complex and subtle and best demonstrated by example.</p>
<p>Bullshit is what you get if the speaker runs off to far and beyond the bounds of reason in any direction. Even going outside the bounds of socially accceptable expression of an idea in an academic forum in which you are participating, by adding more than the cultural norm for extra redundant and superfluous words to excessively make a point beyond what would be considered reasonable is Bullshitting. Trust me, I know how my Bullshit smells.</p>
<p>Ok so according to you an example of Bullshit as used in humour, is an amusing annectdote and as such belongs on rec.humor does not belong on wikipedia and was now deleted twice. Ok deleters. Be constructive .... Please replace it with something other than an example that actually lets people know what bullshit, and bullshiting is, and how it is related to and used in humour. Doing otherwise is to claim that certain knowlege, ie what bullshit is and how it is used is not fitting material to be in an encylopedia, that view is Bullshit and I call you for it.</p>
<p>Consider the articles Wiki:Joke, they contain primarily by volume examples of jokes that you should surely now delete as amusing annectdotes that belong on rec.humor. Your trouble with BS is seemingly that it mocks the truth by playing with it. The truth is not a sacred cow and is considerably more complex than the binary True vs False.</p>
<p>In fact I just noticed not only did you delete the humor but you deleted the paragraoph describing the relationship between the simple dichotomy of true vs false and the more complex space produced by the introduction of the concept of bullshit that is neither true nor false. Consult Godel, Hofstader and his book GEB for the formal mathematical and pure logic equivalents.</p>
<p>Note also: that this contributor is a wikizen and is entirely happy for people to 'fix' the article if in the end there is no trace of my contribution, I will feel my task complete. Deleteing it back to an empty shell that does not address the task of explaining bullshit to someone who presumably does not undertsand the concept is not part of improving it. The original fails utterly to address a number of issues, is very short on quality exemplars, provides and exceedingly (offensively) US centric view of the subject matter.</p>

<p>Money Talk Bullshit Walks does NOT mean meaning that people who "do something" will get more results than people who merely talk. in the circles I mix in, finding a defintiive reference before I reverse that is hard.. For the moment I found this second hand non authoritative source with which I raise the objection. <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/30/messages/1659.html" class="external free" title="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/30/messages/1659.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/30/messages/1659.html</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>MONEY TALKS - "An offer of money is often the most persuasive argument in getting someone to do what you want. The saying can be traced back to G. Torriano's 'Italian Proverbs' (1666)..First attested in the United States in the 'Saturday Evening Post' (September 3, 1903).Anoter common modern variant is 'money talks, bullsh*t walks'." From "Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings" by Gregory Y. Titelman (Random House, New York, 1996).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The contention that the dichotmy is between "do something" and talk is false. The dichotomy is between Bullshit and money. People who offer up bullshit to a business deal get "walk away" ie no deal. People who "put their money where their mouth is", "put their money on the table", get to talk and make the proposal, bullshit does not even get a hearing.</p>
<p>On rexamination I think I understood what was meant and added more words to make it I think clearer. The problem was the use of the word "talk" in the explanation as a synonym for Bullshit. Up to that point whwre the saying is used, one party has been merely talking, this saying indicates that that talking is now identified as bullshit, and that in order to continue the bullshiter must "do something", the "do something" may not involve money. If there are two thugs standing around talking about who will shoot the victim may say this, and then the formerly bullshitting party is thus challenged to do the deed and shoot the vicitim.</p>
<p>This explains the need to anbstract "money" into "do something" in the explanation. What was needed was to change the explanation so that people who do not already know what the saying means can find out from the explanation. This process is called teaching, my advice is more editors should think about teaching as being part of what they do. ie The aim of an encyclopedia is to move the readers POV from not knowing to closer to the authors educated one. Recording the truth however accurately is not the whole point.</p>

<p>- As recounted by a soldier that came back from the war after the war to end all wars - After coming back from the war, the Australian troops brought news of a marvelous invention that was going to dramatically reduce the toll taken by sharks eating bathers at our beaches. The 'Yanks' they informed the stay homes had apparently invented a shark proof suit.

<p>It has been a while since I read 'attack of the weasel words', I will need to go back to it again. Even though the author is Australian and the book was popular, in Australian general use weasel words is not as common by any means as Bullshit. There are no weasel word artists, people are not full of weasel words, etc etc. In fact reading wikipedias definition of the scope and breadth of weasel words Im not sure it was that wide when I learnt what weasel words were. My memory was of weaseling out of things, Collateral damage etc. The use in "is now 20% cheaper" does not fit my memory at all. Indeed while there are words I have trouble identifying which are the weasel ones... This example is about the idea and words left out. I might describe it picturesquely as weasel wording but fail to make the idea of weasel words apply. But if thats actually in general usage it does not have to make sense, it just is. Whats left out is at times non trivial question. The weasel words page says</p>
<p>"Clinically tested..." (but not proven? What did the test results reveal? Does the product work as claimed?)</p>
<p>No few extra words will address these issues. Even the full text of the primary refereed paper in a journal often leaves out salient essential points due to word count requirements. Frequently when attempting to replicate work I have either wanted to or in fact contacted the authors to find out what they really did. Like the article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> indicates, truth is a complex concept, weaseling out of the truth gets complicated and subtle when it comes to lying by omission.</p>

<p>Ok, so it seems AccurateOne is becoming frustrated with the constant reverting of all of his edits. Personally, I can't blame him, I'd be a little pissed too if all of my edits were being reverted. Although I'm sure you have perfectly valid reasons for deleting his material, it's generally best to discuss it on the talk page and then come to an agreement before we change material that's causing conflict between editors. Please note that I personally take no sides on the situation, and will remain neutral throughout any discussion. Yaaaaay neautrality!!</p>

<p>It has died out in the sense that I am not changing anything so nothing is being reverted. It exists in the sense that I am not bold. I could be very bold and put back what I did that got deleted before but that seems silly, if it was deleted before and nothing has been said and no ideas exchanged, then either immediately or in the not to distant future it will be again. With no information at all on what was percieved to be wrong the last time deciding in the dark what I think and can find that explains 'Bullshit' but might be different in a way to make it acceptable makes the task multiple times harder. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurateOne_416d.html" title="User:AccurateOne">AccurateOne</a> 10:57, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On a separate note in order to learn I examined some users histories of contributions, and the histories of some articles, so as to find out how wikipedia really works in the real world instead of just how it is supposed to work. When I examined your history to find out what a postive history of contribution looks like, you dont have one.

<p>Good call. Causing an edit conflict won't help at all. From what I can speculate, people might not like your lack of citations. Let's pull one of your edits up and analyze it, to help you make better edits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>As recounted by a soldier that came back from the war after the war to end all wars</i> After coming back from the war, the Australian troops brought news of a marvelous invention that was going to dramatically reduce the toll taken by sharks eating bathers at our beaches. The 'Yanks' they informed the stay homes had apparently invented a shark proof suit. At the time neck to knee was all the go so there was considerable space for logos etc. On the front, the suit sponsored a full sized American flag neck to knee, on the back was the writing "We won the war" the ANZACS it seems were certain that not even a shark would swallow that. Note: The accurate use of the word Yank, American is far to broad and grandiose a term to use when referring to the citizens of just one country in America. Even North American would be too broad a term given the cultural diversity it contains. While it is known that Yank properly only refers to half the country, it does refer to the half that did win a war all by themselves. Referring to United Stateans as Confederates would indeed be silly, but in the context of this joke Yank does seem fitting from an external world wide perspective and rolls of the tongue much better than the more correct United Stateans or the wordy United States Citizens. This BS has been brought to you in the spirit of the ever increasing US AU ties. It is hoped that it will increase our mutual cultural understanding of our mutually supporting roles of founding high-falutin Bullshit as a useful linguistic element in even academic discorse. It is to be remembered after all that when the BS flies it is traditional that it flies in all directions and that no targets are sacred cows. The interesting thing about bullshit is that it inherently disputes the idea that truth and falsity are mutually exclusive opposites that live on a linear continuim with only two discreet values. While some people accept the truth comes in shades of grey a true Bullshiter plays around with the truth in a complex non linear space and examines it from various directions and perspectives, some of these when they produce suprising or unusual conclusions, ie 'the majority of the US citizens vote for none of the above at each election' are humourous.

<p>It seems to me the main reason for this being edited out is its lack of any sources. Although Wikipedia is a collaboration of human knowedlge, it's policy to use accurate and verifiable resources, rather than anecdotal <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</p>
<p>There really isn't much of a dispute for me to mediate. Sorry I can't be of much help, but there's no heated conflicts to cool down... it's just a case of the removal of material that's not backed up with sources. Small sentences here and there are acceptable, but when you include an entire section with a hefty amount of information, you usually need to back up your claims.</p>
<p>As for your belief that there is a way Wikipedia is "supposed" to work, and a way that it "really" works, I can't agree. The reality of Wikipedia pretty much runs parallel to its theory.</p>
<p>Sorry if my user contributions are a little... limited. I've just created an account recently, to allow myself more capabilities for assisting Wikipedia. I'm afraid I don't have much information to contribute to the actual articles, that is my area of expertise. I'm more of a "behind-the-scenes" workers, who deals with helping and greeting new people, making Wikipedia more fun, resolving conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>So, if you think that there's not really a dispute to settle... should we consider it case closed? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_prophet_wizard_of_the_crayon_cake_7755.html" title="User:The prophet wizard of the crayon cake">The Prophet Wizard of the Crayon Cake</a> <sup>{<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_prophet_wizard_of_the_crayon_cake_38ea.html" title="User talk:The prophet wizard of the crayon cake">Prophesize</a>)</sup> 11:47, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My written reviewed and then not saved edit of this page took that statement of yours rather badly. Your statement So, if you think "..." is in no sense fair summary of anything I said I think so far. Thus instead of reacting badly to that as I nearly did</p>
<p>Here instead let me now put words in your mouth</p>
<p>Instead you say, as a slightly premptive mediator whos ahead of the game and hence knows what will happen next. So, if you now think that there's no longer really a dispute to settle... should we consider it case closed? -</p>
<p>Yes there really was a dispute of course there was a dispute and I'm not happy the dispute came to be, but does it still exist? If you speculate correctly then yes the dispute is over, if you don't then its simply waiting for me to decide you did speculate correctly and act on the advice and we would be right back here or another forum again. So is it really over or not, we can as you did only speculate that I now understand Henry's reasoning by hoping it is the same as yours.</p>
<p>Yes you have now explained what could have been stated easily quite some time ago. Your explanation while it does I suspect go to the heart of the issue, does not explain all the reverts that happened. I understand edit wars are not clean things and guess that might explain the rest. In considering wikipedia I suspect I listened to the sound bites that skim the details, (hence they are weasel words?) "Contain the sum of all human knowledge", means "contain the sum of all verifiable knowledge preferably with multiple sources" a less well spun claim to fame.</p>
<p>Your explanation does not reassure me that a different explanation might not pop out of the woodwork if I take your advice, I might still be reverted without comment or discussion. Ive seen a number of examples of just that in my study of the various users histories, and thus we could be back here having another one sided conversation. I find the amount of time and energy I spend to get a little progress to be rather frustrating. The wikipedia advice 'be bold' does not seem to be on my radar anymore, last time I got bitten. I do however see the writing on the wall and understand 'who' you are now. (See I can read between the lines.) Thanks for being kinder than you needed to be. I understand your rules better and will consider if I wish to participate. It would be a better place if there was greater level of adherence to "Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: Do not simply revert changes in a dispute." but I suspect I know what the underlying systemic problems are, that pretensioned the social fabric and thus created the effects I experienced. (the actual need for most of the reverts I saw in the histories and the annoyance that must bring). I have been on wikis where respectful was true even when disagreeing severely and that was an experience I wished to repeat. Still time will tell perhaps one day I will be bold again.</p>
<p>If I were to be bold again the first thing to decide is what it is that is important that I can add to wikipedia that fits your guidelines. I suspect as it is literally, "the sum of all human knowledge" that really intrigues me that I may not find a place here. I see incomplete bits of wikipedia that I do know that I could add within your guidelines, but they are not important enough to *me* to add and especially not important enough to risk an edit war over them. BS was an exception the world has BS, Every day important decisions get slid by on platter made of convincing BS. An entry on BS that actually explained it well enough so that people who read it would better understand the game, and how the bullshiters really manipulated the game so that it was "heads I win tails you lose" proposition. That would have been worthwhile. Its a shame I cant see how to try and get there within wikipedias guidelines.</p>
<p>BTW 'WWI' is still I believe wrong but I expect an rfD or a major edit by someone will just wash that away soonish. As it stands I suggest the article will attract trouble and effectively troll the internet for errors of judgement. And please try not to make the unverifiable claim that is it is American popular culture that carried the term to elsewhere in the world. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurateOne_416d.html" title="User:AccurateOne">AccurateOne</a> 15:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your statements about verifiable sources would make more sense if this didnt exist.</p>
<p>Cave Clan While I suspect much of it precisely true and so on it is not exactly verifiable.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong I kind of think it should, but I am not sure how you intend to avoid having your leg pulled regularly which is probably one reason verifiability exists.</p>
<p>Nirvana Avenue, Melbourne represents a probably mainly true page but I am suprised the inherent non notability of a suburban residential street or that the local Melburnian wikpedians havent said 'why is that here'. I particularly wonder who speculated to who about the involvement of Buddhists. The location of Halls gap is also equally flawed as an error in fact. It is between those towns in the sense of NOT. From memory, its been about 2months since I drove it(oops an annectdote), it is 1km further to drive from Arrarat to Halls gap via Stawell than direct. It might be about half way between Arrarat and Cherrypoole but dont look for Cherrypoole last time I was there the town of Cherrypoole was a white fence post on the corner of two country roads. Even the verfiable official Australian road maps pull your leg sometimes.... While I don't dispute the policy for verifiability, I wonder just how self consistent the whole process is.</p>
<p>I kind of feel bad about dobbing on those pages put there by my fellow melburnians because I am sure in there are pages like this all over the place and it all only depends on who gets a bee in their bonnet. hmm.

<p>It seems to be a pedia cultural norm that in order to edit page with some potential for controversy the existing culture requires multiple editors, or the solo editors are seen as (or become?) crusaders. Thus the hard to do right articles are only edited in packs.</p>
<p>Hence if someone else turns up who knows the wiki way, undertsnds BS in variety of cultural uses, ie in my experience it varies widely within a country across socio economic groups (Im socio economically ecumenical) and preferably does not come from down under, (ie a diff cultural POV to me.) and wants to have go at _adding_ content to this this article, and I notice, ie didnt get bored/disillusioned waiting, then say hi, and save me a slice of the blue moons cheese. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurateOne_416d.html" title="User:AccurateOne">AccurateOne</a> 11:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To me this almost seems like a different usage of the term, like "2." vs "1." in a dictionary, but "bullshit" is certainly used this way pretty commonly (at least in my experience). By way of example:</p>
<p>Student 1: "How'd your exam go?" Student 2: "Awful, man the professor put stuff on there he didn't cover!" Student 1: "What? Oh that's bullshit man!"</p>
<p>It seems to me this is almost akin to describing behavior as nonsense, but with an added sense of malice and/or fault, thereby making it a different usage, if only subtly so. While one might think this makes another usage simply "unacceptable" or "wrong", I'm not aware of it being applied to describe anything other than behavior of some sort. For example, low wages at a chain store might be described as BS, as ultimately <i>someone</i> is in charge of setting that wage and it's a behavior. By contrast, plastics being non-biodegradable isn't something anyone has control over, so it wouldn't be described as BS. More likely, one would simply say it "sucks". 70.33.191.29 23:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The bullshit entry does not give enough emphasis to two things:</p>
<p>1. The fact that British philosophers have long used "bullshit" as a technical term to describe continental philosophy. (I don't know anything about this myself but I know a man who does.)</p>
<p>2. The fact that "bull" is an old British army word - noun and adjective. "Bulling" means shining up your brasses, blanco-ing your webbing, creasing your trousers, boxing your blankets, cleaning the toilet with a toothbrush, paininting the coal white and so on. Bull is designed to impress and making an impression on the enemy has been around for thousands of years - headdresses to make you taller, warcries, drums, etc. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.249.220.82 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.249.220.82_4b1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.249.220.82">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>afaik bulling in that sense is the action of polishing or scrubbing (cf <i>buffing</i>). I guess there's a connection with appearing plausible, putting on a show, which connects to an old sense of 'bull' ie egregious nonsense, which I'm pretty sure is older than the article has it atm but anyway. Back to army slang, that's always very hard to pin down m8. <a href="../../../h/a/k/User%7EHakluyt_bean_a25f.html" title="User:Hakluyt bean">Hakluyt bean</a> 05:27, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
