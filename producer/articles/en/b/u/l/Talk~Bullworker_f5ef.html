<p>This entire article is obviously nothing more than an attempt to sell newer versions of the Bullworker. I have removed all SPAM and attempted to make the article neutral. 68.232.143.152</p>

<p>Mr. Sherrill: You asked for more information as to why I removed links to your site. The reasons can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="Wikipedia:External links">Links normally to be avoided</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, items 3 and 4 which read as follows:</p>
<p>3. A page that you own or maintain, even if the guidelines above imply that it should be linked. This is because of neutrality and point-of-view concerns; neutrality is an important and difficult objective at Wikipedia. If your page is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let unbiased Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link.</p>
<p>5. Links intended to promote a site, especially if that site's primary purpose is to advertise or sell products or services, or if the site requires payment to view the relevant content. This is colloquially known as external link spamming.</p>
<p>And here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="Wikipedia:Spam">How not to be a spammer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please read these Wikipedia guidlines very carefully, especially <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="Wikipedia:Spam">How not to be a spammer</a>, and it should be clear as to why the links to your site were removed. They are in violation of Wikipedia standards.</p>
<p>I have a Bullworker X-5 and think it's a great piece of equipment! However, this is supposed to be an Encyclopedia, not a promotional vehicle. The links to your site quite clearly link to other pages on your site where the Bullworker can be purchased.</p>
<p>User <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> has already asked that you do not post advertising. I think you will find that articles such as the Bullworker article usually don't last too long. Countless editors will eventually find their way to the article and will likely view it as Promotional Material, SPAM or Advertisement. This is especially true due to the fact that you are the one who started the article and are very high up in the Bullworker company if not the CEO.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bully Extreme is not a Bullworker, has nothing to do with the name Bullworker and everytime any reference is made to a B-Extreme is the same as Chevrolet trying to switch you from a Ford. Shameless promotion by ripping off a quality product.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bullworker (<a href="../../../b/u/l/User_talk%7EBullworker_cc9e.html" title="User talk:Bullworker">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bullworker_7746.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bullworker">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think that perhaps this comment may be a little too strong. I've looked at the Bully Extreme on the internet and think it is likely to be a very fine and high-quality product. Business people are always looking at older products and coming out with newer products in attempts to improve upon them. There is certainly nothing wrong with this. I don't think we should resort to making disrespectful comments about such products. It is worth noting however, that there have been persistent attempts to market the Bully Extreme within this article. This is against Wikipedia policy and innappropriate. To those who continue to make such attempts, please familiarize yourselves with Wikipedia policies. Continued attempts are quickly caught and addressed. You don't want to put yourselves at risk of being blocked from editing, or worse, banned. Additionally, please do not delete content within the article or on this talk page. This is considered vandalism according to Wikipedia policy. 69.69.250.37 16:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>While the Bullworker X5 is the old design or I should say the last design from Gert F Koelbel, who no longer manufactures the product. Much has changed since 1980 including the fact that all Bullworker patents have run out.</p>
<p>The advent of "hybrids" has not only occured in the Automotive industry but as is always the case old inventions are changed and made better. Yesterdays chevrolet or ford are not the same car. In fact unfortunately the quality of both cars is sad.</p>
<p>I wouldn't compare the Bully Xtreme to anything less than the LEXUS of Bullworker typr devices. The only reason the term "Bullworker type" is used is that is the only way to identify the product and according to the 1910 ruling by the Supreme Court of The United States this is allowed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.111.192.204 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.111.192.204.html" title="User talk:70.111.192.204">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.111.192.204_118f.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.111.192.204">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>It is interesting to continually read promotion for the Bully Xtreme on a Bullworker article. There is no reference to the Rio Power, Super4, Pit Bull or the new Steel-Bow which are all made by the same company from India. Again, if one wants to talk Bullworker, talk Bullworker as that is the heading of this article. If one wants to talk products from India, which are very good products, talk the products, not just hyping one model that is manufactured under 4 different names. If the B-X is a Lexus in your unbiased opinion… what is the new Steel-Bow28… a Rolls Royce? The visual differences are huge. Only a person trying to market their product would be mentioning <b>only</b> their product under this category.</p>
<p>The fact the patents have expired have no bearing with the Bullworker; It is still being marketed by Bullworker. There are many products still marketed after their patent expires. One does not read about the Cross Bow Gym when one types in BowFlex… Bullworker is the title of the Wikipedia article… <b>BULLWORKER</b>; not India Super 4, not Rio Power, not Pit Bull, not Steel-Bow28 and not B-X, which are all similar designed products.</p>
<p>The Bullworker has sold million of units worldwide over 40 years. The numbers speak for the product. The <b>ONLY</b> company trashing the Bullworker is B-X… The constant shrilling for a product out 6 months trying to coattail on the Bullworker’s trademark name is shameless. There are 5 posts in this discussion area and all deal with shameless advertising for a product trying to cash in on a 40 year history of the Bullworker. What a coincidence????.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bullworker (<a href="../../../b/u/l/User_talk%7EBullworker_cc9e.html" title="User talk:Bullworker">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bullworker_7746.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bullworker">contribs</a>).</small></p>
