<p>Anyone from or near Bulwell, anyone who knows anything about Bulwell - Anyone, in fact - can add to this site. Please do! It's weird, but we're proud of Bulwell despite everything, and every little bit helps. Are you a volunteer that can add something to the page about your project? A member/coach/whatever of a local sports team that can add a bit about yourselves? A schoolkid in Bulwell who wants to write about school/cadets/whatever that they attend locally? Somone with something to do with the BMX track? I promise I'll flesh out whatever you write if you're a bit unsure. If you have a club/pack/whatever website you can link to, please add the link or click on my name at the bottom of this bit, edit my page and let me know about it. I'll sort it within days. Thanks. I want to make this page great, and a definitive guide to Bulwell. Help me! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeye_acec.html" title="User:Codeye">Codeye</a> 06:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i live in bulwell and i am 11 years old and i am cleverer than most of the adults in bulwell - i go to university on saturdays. Bulwell is not a nessaserily a nice place to live, but i am still proud of it for some strange reason. For example there is a petrol station near where i live and an aldi, but i am not allowed to go there, because of the chavs. My school is the best in Nottingham and our ex-head is now giong to another school, which failed its OFSTED inpection earlier this year. She was the best head ever and i am sasd she left, tho many other pupils will disagree with me. The only reason i am writing this is because i am bored. If anyone has any questions on Bulwell i am happy to answer them, as i am bored ofen cos ther is nothing to do in buw-wuw.</p>

<p>To the Charlie's Cycles contributor: Wikipedia is not for advertising local businesses. I know the shop well, have used it for years man and boy, and would love for it to get the exposure, but you need a reason for its inclusion. How is Charlie's Cycles unique, for instance? How else is it noteworthy, or special enough for inclusion on the Wiki? All the shops in Bulwell would advertise on here if they could, but that's not what Wikipedia is about, sorry! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeye_acec.html" title="User:Codeye">Codeye</a> 00:10, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly apologies for creating the contribution Charlie’s Cycles, the reason for this insertion was to try and help a small local business that’s being swallowed up by Globalization and the massive monopoly of large stores sweeping the land all selling the same products cheaper. If you have indeed visited Charlie’s Cycles recently you will know that the owner is thinking of closing the shop due to this, which I think is a real shame! and a great loss to us cyclists and the community as a whole. On the point of why the shop is unique.. I’m sure ANY small shop owner will tell you a business that can survive for over 60 years trading in the same location selling the same products and services IS unique in this day and age. Once again apologies for the contribution, I was only trying to help the shop out after speaking to the owner. I was in no way trying to circumnavigate the Wikipedia rules and now realise that people are more interested in reading and writing about crime instead. (DR R P Growcock)(BMA) 10 October 2006 10.01(bulwell time)</p>
<p><br />
Firstly, thanks for your reply, Dr Growcock. It's good to know there are still lots of people in Bulwell that care, both about each other and the place itself. Secondly, globalisation has been around for a long while, and it has affected us all to some degree. My father and grandfather worked at Raleigh, until they were made redundant when globalisation (and a number of other factors) made the British workman an anathema. My mother worked at Players, (bought out by Imperial Tobacco, owned by BAT) and then General Accident (Bought, sold, merged into international ownership) before being made redundant by both. My parents re-trained, went into the licensed trade, and worked for Home Ales, Shipstone's and Mansfield, being made redundant by each in turn after they were taken over or disbanded. My maternal grandfather worked at Stanton's (made redundant), the fabric works on Bar Lane (made redundant), as a park-keeper for the Council (made redundant), and then on the buses (Guess?). My grandmothers were both from mining families... I've only scratched the surface here, believe me!</p>
<p>I could go on for pages sympathising and agreeing about the plight of the little man, but in Bulwell there are many of these "little men", all struggling just as hard to survive. The Fosters in the cobblers shop, Chadbunds', French's Florists, Geoff's newsagents, Godfrey's TV repair shop (at least until a few years back) - lots of names spring to mind when I think of small businesses that have been there for a long time. The newcomers also deserve a mention, all the newsagents, chip shop owners, landlords, marketeers, indeed ALL the traders in Bulwell. Unfortunately, that is not why Wikipedia exists. There are lots of sites (Knowwhere.co.uk springs to mind as an example) where you can freely advertise Charlie's, or any of the others, but you have to appreciate that an encyclopedia is not the place for this? Every wiki would be enormous if everyone added an advert! Please check the style guide for information about what is permissible on these pages.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I note your final comment was phrased rather harshly and sarcastically. Please be assured of my best intentions with my earlier edit; I pondered for a good half-hour for a reason to justify the inclusion of your edit without success. I offered you advice as to how you may justify the inclusion of just one out of Bulwell's thousand or so businesses, in the hope you may be able to come up with something I don't or didn't know. I do not appreciate receiving such a curt and terse rebuttal of my help. Yes, this is an emotive issue, but emotion, opinion, and favour should have no place in any factual document, or in the motivations for adding to the document.</p>
<p>Finally, as a male from Bulwell in my mid-20's, I believe that there is a desperate NEED to focus attention on crime in the area. We may eventually receive some of the resources to tackle the underlying problems: the under-resourced and over-stretched schools, (Yes, in which I was taught),the historical culture of low expectations, the social exclusion, the lack of anything to do or anywhere to go for the youth, the exceptionally easy availability of hard drugs, the "examples" shown to them by rich gangsters STILL on the streets after years of serious crime etc etc. Our Council is to blame for a lot of it, but again, this is really not the time or place to discuss such matters. I hope this helps clarify things a little. I look forward to your assistance in the future maintainance of the page.&#160;:) (Niall Brady, BA (hon.)
