<p><i>Firearms made their entry at the end of the medieval era. When many knights and nobles purchased their new breast plates, they wanted “proof” that the armor would protect them from early bullets. Armor makers would shoot the breast plates, and the resulting dent in the new armor was provided as evidence that it was “bullet-proofed”.</i></p>
<p>This absolutely reeks of a false etymology. Can anyone provide sources?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not the one who wrote the above quote in the article, but I have heard it before. I don't have an actual source, but I read it at the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html#Arms_and_Armor" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Arms and Armor gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York. They had a sign explaining the term next to some bullet-proofed armor. According to the sign, the dent in the armor was often incorporated into the armor's decoration. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:52, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sharp edges such as knives, hunting arrows, and shrapnel will cut through the fibers in bullet-resistant soft body armor, penetrating the armor with ease. Bulletproof vests that incorporate hard "threat plates" (made from ceramic, titanium, or a kevlar weave embedded in plastic) will provide protection from such threats. Flak jackets use a material that is designed to snag the jagged edges of shrapnel, which is why it's ineffective against bullets or other threats. I am, however, not an armorer so take my words with the usual salt. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 09:35, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm no expert but I've read that current standard issue US Army protective vest is able to stop an AK47 round at point blank.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No way. At that range it will go through the individual and any body else behind him. Shots fired from a rifle or a machine gun? Forget it.
<dl>
<dd>Funny, because it's designed to do this, seeing most US adversaries use the AK-47 (or the AK-74 or some recent retreated like the AK-103). 76.100.75.55 17:11, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Interceptor armour should be able to stop it point blank, i think its rated for 3 AK shots on the trauma plate at ~10m. A video that shows how effective the armour is (WITH trauma plates) is <a href="http://www.pointblankarmor.com/media/video/videos/wm/sniper.wmv" class="external free" title="http://www.pointblankarmor.com/media/video/videos/wm/sniper.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://www.pointblankarmor.com/media/video/videos/wm/sniper.wmv</a> (sorry only wmv). I think the main problem at the moment is the lack of trauma plates in serivce.</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. But it can stop a 7.62 x 39, not a 7.62 x 51 NATO, which would penetrate.</p>
<p>The above statement is incorrect Interceptor plates WILL stop 7.62 Nato, its type III!!!!!</p>
<p>It would be great to get some information on the Dragon skin armor, by pinnacle armor.</p>

<p>I have removed this section because I believe that nearly the entirety of the section is false and misleading. Different types of bullets DO have different penetration characteristics for body armor, and handgun bullets CAN penetrate body armor, especially the lightweight armor routinely worn by police officers. There are documented cases of <a href="http://www.policeone.com/police-products/tactical/body-armor/articles/65090/" class="external text" title="http://www.policeone.com/police-products/tactical/body-armor/articles/65090/" rel="nofollow">handgun bullets penetrating the protective panels</a> of bulletproof vests, especially the lightweight models used by police officers. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 10:14, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, and with the wiki format I don't think that the inclusion of urban legends is appropriate unless its explicitly related and intrinsic to the topic.</p>
<p>In relation to the statement about bullets from handguns regularly penetrating body armour. That particular vest contained a faulty material which placed it's manufacturer in a very difficult finnacial position and the poice officers in less than desirable set of circumstances see <a href="http://www.secondchance.com/news.asp?action=article&amp;newsID=88" class="external text" title="http://www.secondchance.com/news.asp?action=article&amp;newsID=88" rel="nofollow">ARMOR HOLDINGS, INC.

<p>"Curiously enough, bulletproof vests remain legal in many countries where firearms are heavily restricted, such as the UK." There is absolutely nothing "curious" about this. It is perfectly sound and sensible to restrict something that can harm other people while not restricting something that prevents other people from harming you. Consider any other type of weapon and you will find that it is perfectly natural to restrict weapon but not the protection. Medicins and vaccins are relatively unrestricted compared to biological warfare agents. Gas-masks and anti-nerve agents are unrestricted compared to chemical warfare agents. An air-raid shelter is rarely subject to many restrictions but a bomber certainly is. You could probably armour up your boat as much as you like but the government will object to you installing missiles or cannons. Mine-detectors are subject to fewer restrictions than mines are. Fire-fighting equipment is subject to very few restrictions but incendiary devices are rarely legal.</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of editing that sentence.</p>

<dd>While I don't disagree with your edit, I do have to say that I believe there is some sense in restricting access to bulletproof vests. Having easy access to fire-fighting equipment doesn't make it easier to be an arsonist, but having access to a bulletproof vest makes it easier and safer to rob a bank. In a country where firearms are heavily restricted, it is less likely that you'll be shot on the street, so I guess that's why the author said it was "curious" that bulletproof vests are legal in countries where you're unlikely to be shot by a criminal. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 12:03, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am glad you agree with my edit. I understand your logic, but I do not fully agree. If I were an non-suicidal arsonist would I like to have some fire-fighting equipment? The answer is 'perhaps'. Some light flame resistant clothing would be useful as would a simple breathing mask and perhaps a small powder extinguisher. On the other hand I must be able to get out quickly and perhaps blend into a crowd so this equipment must not make me stick out. Furthermore, possession of these items, while not illegal, could draw the police's attention to me. In the end, it is a judgement call. If I prioritize personal safety I would want such equipment, if I prioritize staying out of jail, I would not. Similarly, would I like a bullet-proof vest if I were to rob a bank? It might increase my chances of surviving a hit, but even a none-penetrating hit creates a bad bruising that hampers me and makes it harder to get away. The vest itself hampers me, makes me bigger and more conspicious. It is a judgement call. If I were to prioritize personal survival, it might be a good idea to wear a bullet-proof vest. (I am not even sure about this, though. The vest might cause the police to aim for my head!) If I prioritize getting away, I would not. Generally speaking, I think many other legal accessories are more unambigiously useful -such as a police radio.</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your point of view. The way I'm looking at this is that we're providing information about performance standards for body armor by quoting a relevant passage from the actual standard. My view is that, since we're quoting the actual standard, making changes to it is like altering a direct quote from somebody. I think if we want to insert additional information into the middle of such text or change something, we need to mark it in some way like an editor would. Another option would be to get the same information across without taking a quote directly from the source, but I think in this case quoting the standard is the best way to present the information. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 11:25, Dec 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't these tables read "impacting at a MAXIMUM velocity of Xm/s or less"? To say "a minimum of X or less" is basically like saying "just X" isn't it, since you can't go less than something that's already the minimum? I've looked at NIJ Standard–0101.04 and it does indeed say "minimum", but this doesn't make a whole lot of sense this way, and I think this may actually be a typo in the NIJ standard.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBennihana_e497.html" title="User:Bennihana">Bennihana</a> 05:32, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone has placed this text "[provided the projectile hits the hard trauma plate]" in the table. It will be removed in 2 weeks unless someone can provide a good reason for not removing it. I have three reasons for removing it.</p>
<p>Firstly the text is taking the standard out of context. The standard is designed to rate armour against specific known threats. That means a standard manufactured firearm with a standard manufactured bullet in a standard test environment. It does not take into account any variables in the real world. Hand loaded ammunition fired from vehicles travelling at speed, tailwinds, high altitudes etc.</p>
<p>Secondly the text is incorrect. They are hard armour plates not trauma plates. "Trauma packs" are designed to reduce the amount of trauma the body sustains in a ballistic event. Armour can be heavy to get around in, so to provide a little extra protection, without increasing the weight of the armour dramatically, trauma packs, usually made of the same material as the vest, are placed over major organs.</p>
<p>Thirdly the text seems to infer that they are of little use. Hard armour plates are designed to stop rifle rounds which have much higher muzzle velocities than handguns or armour piercing rounds. The plates are to cover the most vital parts of your body.If you where to make a vest out of the material it would reduce your mobility to that of a medieval night. If the projectile does not hit the hard armour plate that means it has done one of three things. 1 Hit you in the head (Goodbye, so long, see you later) 2 Hit you somewhere else not vital to you staying alive with some exceptions. 3. Not hit you at all (That'll do Donkey). It's all about reducing the likelihood of death in a ballistic event. --Uncle Ming 05:26, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't prove it, but the etymology here looks very much like a folk etymology. The OED treats -proof generically. Based on the OED's dating -proof is already being used generically by the late 1500s -- proof as a noun is an old French borrowing in the 11th or 12th century -- but bullet, also a French borrowing, doesn't even enter our language until the 1500s. If the dating is true, it would be just as likely that something_else-proof was applied to bullet-proof as it would be for bullet-proof to be applied to other words. Andrew.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, -proof is a generic term; bulletproof is not, nor is it implied to be, the origin of the world "proof." What is meant in the History section is that the term "bulletproof" originates from how breastplates were originally "proofed," or proven to be effective, against bullets, hence bullet-proofed, hence the origin of the current word bulletproof. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:11, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"In recent years advances in material science have opened the door to the old idea of an actual "Bulletproof vest" that will be able to stop handgun and rifle bullets without the assistance of heavy and cumbersome extra metal or ceramic plating." Metal and ceramic plating is NOT required to stop handgun bullets, only rifle bullets. I am removing the mentioning of handgun bullets in that section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A couple of issues. First the goal <i>is</i> to have a vest that will stop both handgun bullets and rifle bullets without metal or ceramic plates. As it now is, a handgun rated vest won't do much for rifle bullets. The gift of foresight is a gift which few have; when should one wear the rifle vest and when should one wear the handgun vest? I wouldn't want to guess wrong on this. Secondly, there <i>are</i> handgun bullets that a traditional vest without plates won't stop. The old <a href="../../../7/2E/6/7.62_x_25_mm_TT_6107.html" title="7.62 x 25 mm TT">Tokarev</a> comes to mind. It is often a preferred handgun when possibly having to counter assailants who may be wearing handgun-rated vests. It can cut right through them; it is known for being rather skorchy for a handgun!

<p>Thats true, and while the article does mention that there are special vests for knives, it doesn't go into them in any detail. either this artical should be changed to read "body armor" and include information on vests for knife protection or a seperate article should be created about them.

<p>Hi. I am just learning about body armor and am new to Wikipedia, but I have a question regarding DSM's Dyneema vs. Honeywell's Spectra. They are different, but I am not sure of all the technical differences. I tried adding a Spectra page, but it was taken down for some reason. Anyways, Dyneema is not the same as Spectra. They are both brand names referring to UHMWPE technology.</p>

I was under the impression that they are the same or very nearly the same material. Since neither Spectra-the-brand nor Dyneema-the-brand are really notable enough to have articles <i>about the brand</i>, that they are different brands doesn't really matter. However, the material is notable, so the technical difference if any does matter. In other words, if they are the same material, than we need only one article (which is what we have now). If they are different material, then we need two articles. I don't know which is the case, but that's what needs to be determined. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 21:28, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While there is perhaps a technical majority for the Ballistic vest below, compelling arguments were put forward for keeping it as-is per <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">WP:NC(CN)</a>.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. A google reveals that bulletproof vest is more clear.

<dd>Yep, there's a problem here. "Body armor" is only equated to anti-firearm gear (primarily vests) because that's what's currently issued; but, historically, the term is more applicable to <i>all</i> types of armor (e.g. chainmail, cuirasses, etc.).

<dd>Why I think this is a bad idea: Ballistic vest gets 44000 ghits, Bulletproof vest: 370000, body armor: 1.26 million. The term Ballistic Vest, in other words is 30 times less common than the last, and 9 times less common than the first. This is a horrible idea. We are simply creating a new word for the sake of it being technically correct: despite the fact that the other word exists in common language.
