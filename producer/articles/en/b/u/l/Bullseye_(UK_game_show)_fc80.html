<p><i><b>Bullseye</b></i> is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game show</a> first made by <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_TeleVision_4ff6.html" title="Associated TeleVision">ATV</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Independent_Television_e124.html" title="Central Independent Television">Central</a> for <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> between <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, and hosted by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Bowen_eafd.html" title="Jim Bowen">Jim Bowen</a>. In its prime, it was watched by around 15 million viewers on Sunday evenings, where it was shown from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> to early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. The first series (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>) was on Monday nights, and the last two series (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>) were on Saturday evenings.

<p>Centred around <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darts.html" title="Darts">darts</a>, the show places three pairs of contestants (each team with one person to answer questions and one darts player) against one another to win prizes ranging from a new <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>, a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedboat.html" title="Speedboat">speedboat</a>, a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travel_trailer.html" title="Travel trailer">caravan</a>, or a luxury holiday, to the consolation prize of a set of darts, a tankard (silver goblet for lady contestants) and a 'Bendy Bully', a rubber model of the show's mascot.</p>

<p>In round 1, the darts players throw one dart at a board in which each segment represents a different category of question (such as Faces, Places, Sport, Showbiz, Affairs, History, Books, Words, Britain, Spelling). The first set of questions is worth £30 each, the next set (more difficult) is worth £50, and the final set (more difficult still) is worth £100. The cash prize for hitting the board varies depending on what part of the category board is hit; the easiest part of the board to hit wins £30, a slightly harder part wins £50, a narrow and difficult-to-reach part wins £100, and hitting the bullseye wins the maximum cash prize of £200 (£150 from 2006). If contestants hit a category which they have not chosen, they would win no money for the throw, and could only win money through answering the question if a question on the category had not already been asked. If a contestant hits a category which had already turned up on that programme, the host will say "The category's gone, so we can't ask the question" and carry on. Up to and including the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">88</a> series, the lowest-scoring couple would be eliminated at the end of the first round, but from the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">89</a> series onwards, all three couples would stay in the game for the second round.</p>

<p>In round 2, the darts players throw three darts at a time at a normal dartboard, with the highest scoring team given the chance to convert the number of points scored to <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">pounds</a> by answering a general knowledge question. An incorrect answer causes the question to be passed in turn to the second-highest and lowest scoring teams. After three rounds of play the pair with the highest total winnings goes through to the next round. The other pairs receive a set of darts, a tankard (silver goblet for lady contestants) a 'Bendy Bully' and the money that they had won from the 2 rounds, which is counted during the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">commercial break</a>.</p>

<p>Immediately at the start of part 2, a professional darts player or other celebrity throws nine darts, with the score converted to money for the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charity</a> of the final contestant's choice. A score over 301 was doubled. At the end of the series (from the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">86</a> series onwards) the dart player who got the highest score in the series received a 'Bronze Bully' trophy. In the earlier years of the show (up to and including the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">85</a> series) the celebrity player was given a 60 head-start; between then and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, the charity segment was exclusive to professional dart players. Celebrities who performed particularly badly (as when an obviously worse-for-wear <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Best_68ca.html" title="George Best">George Best</a> missed the board) would usually offer to 'add some of their own money'.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullseye_%28UK_game_show%29_fc80.html" title="Edit section: Bully's Prize Board">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bully's Prize Board</span></h3>
<p>In this round the final pair is faced with a large prizeboard containing black and smaller red segments. They throw 9 darts (3 for the non-dart player and 6 for the dart player) and win a prize for each red segment they hit (however, if they hit an already-hit red segment again, the prize is lost - hence the catchphrase "Keep out of the black, and in the red; there's nothing in this game for two in a bed"). However, in special charity episodes, contestant did win the prize twice. The bullseye represented 'Bully's special prize'. The prizeboard has become the butt of jokes since the programme's original demise because of the perceived poor quality of prizes on offer, but it should be pointed out that, for most of the programme's original run, prize values were restricted by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Broadcasting_Authority_eea6.html" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a>. Although some prizes (such as a remote-controlled toy cat) were laughed at by the studio audience even then, smaller prizes were taken for granted at the time, and they seemed relatively lavish compared to those on offer in <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> game shows such as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blankety_Blank_7306.html" title="Blankety Blank">Blankety Blank</a>. In a recent episode, Bully's Special Prize was a fully-functional Bullseye <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slot_Machine_d870.html" title="Slot Machine">Fruit Machine</a>, quite possibly the most valuable prize in the show's history not to be the Mystery Star Prize- It should come to little surprise that the contestants promptly lost it after doing badly in the final round.</p>
<p><a name="Bully.27s_Star_Prize_Gamble" id="Bully.27s_Star_Prize_Gamble"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullseye_%28UK_game_show%29_fc80.html" title="Edit section: Bully's Star Prize Gamble">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bully's Star Prize Gamble</span></h3>
<p>Having completed Bully's Prize Board, the winning pair is presented with the option of whether to gamble their winnings from the prize board for the mystery star prize hidden behind a screen in the studio. From the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">92</a> series onwards, they also have to gamble the money they had won earlier in the show (it was at this point that the phrase "all you'll win is your BFH - Bus Fare Home" came about). If they gamble, they then had six darts (three for each member of the team) to score 101 or more on a standard matchplay dartboard. Contestants who failed to reach 101 were then invited to "have a look what you would have won", by Jim.</p>
<p>If the couple who took part in Bully's Prize Board refuses to gamble (inevitably ducking out claiming that they'd already had a "smashing day, Jim" and would like "to give the others a chance"), the second-place couple from the second round is asked to gamble their money. If the second couple decline, the first couple is asked. On the rare occasions that no couple takes up the gamble the star prize is revealed and the show ends. The star prize is usually a holiday (especially in later series), a car, a caravan or a speedboat. Sometimes less lavish star prizes (fitted <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitchen.html" title="Kitchen">kitchens</a> and the like) were given away so as to fit within the IBA's prize limits. If in the rare case, both the second and third place contestants had tied on equal points (prior to the 1987-1988 series), then they would have to play a round. The winning couple would have the first chance to gamble.</p>
<p>On the show, it is never made clear if the two winning contestants have to share the star prize or if they get one each. The issue of the star prize being completely inappropriate is never broached either - prizes like speedboats are unlikely to be useful for contestants living in blocks of flats in Wolverhampton. Although Jim Bowen did on some occasions utter phrases such as "And you live by the sea - that's good ...so you can use it" when he could put a positive spin on the situation.</p>

<p>In more recent years, people have started to remember Bullseye again, and its popularity has risen. This is most likely thanks to comedian <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kay_bff1.html" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a> who poked fun at the game show in his <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_at_the_Bolton_Albert_Halls_7af0.html" title="Live at the Bolton Albert Halls">Live at the Bolton Albert Halls</a> stage tour. Bullseye was one of several game shows to be released as an interactive dvd game for Christmas 2005, although the game did not feature the voice of Jim Bowen, and 'Bully' was redesigned. A Bullseye boardgame was made around the same time. <a href="http://www.bullseyeonline.net/Bully's%20%20Gifts/Bully's%20%20Gifts.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bullseyeonline.net/Bully's%20%20Gifts/Bully's%20%20Gifts.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In 2005 it was announced that programme creator Andrew Wood had signed a contract with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada_Productions_0942.html" title="Granada Productions">Granada Media</a> for Granada to produce a 1 hour long celebrity special 'Bullseye' show to be hosted by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant_%26_Dec_9e11.html" title="Ant &amp; Dec">Ant &amp; Dec</a>.</p>
<p>This 'Bullseye' special was part of <i><a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameshow_Marathon_%28UK_game_show%29_1c46.html" title="Gameshow Marathon (UK game show)">Ant &amp; Dec's Gameshow Marathon</a></i>, in turn part of ITV’s 50th anniversary birthday celebrations and was aired on ITV on 22 October 2005.</p>
<p>Andrew Wood signed an exclusive option Agreement with Granada Media. This exclusive option is for 6 months at the end of which Granada Media can extend the option period for a further 6 months.</p>
<p>Granada had decided during this period that a new series of Bullseye would be produced early next year. On January 25 2006, it was announced that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Challenge.html" title="Challenge">Challenge</a> won the rights to show the new series. <a href="http://www.bullseyeonline.net/newBullseye_pressrelease.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bullseyeonline.net/newBullseye_pressrelease.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Jim Bowen was not asked back to present the show, possibly due to allegedly racist comments <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2307607.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2307607.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that he had made earlier in 2002 on a local BBC radio show he was presenting. Following these comments he told the Lancashire Evening Telegraph that he expected the incident would end his career.</p>
<p>Asked if he would be retiring, he said: "Yes, although in this business you don't actually retire.</p>
<p>"What happens is that the phone stops ringing and sometimes little hiccups occur like this one.</p>
<p>"Basically you do as the business tells you."</p>
<p>He said: "No racial connotation was ever intended and, having said all that, I should have been sharp enough to correct the error.</p>
<p>"I almost immediately apologised for it as it was, to say the least, not clever." It was announced on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">03-14</a> that comedian <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Spikey_56ac.html" title="Dave Spikey">Dave Spikey</a> would present the show, despite tabloid rumours that it would be presented by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant_and_Dec_7905.html" title="Ant and Dec">Ant and Dec</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kay_bff1.html" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a>. Bully was also redesigned for the new series.</p>
<p>Bullseye returned to the UK on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Challenge.html" title="Challenge">Challenge</a> at 22:00 on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">17 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The show maintained the style of prizes from the original — none of the cash prizes have increased in value since the first show. Some of the prizes from Bully's Prize Board were of more modern gameshow standard, such as a TFT television and an MP4 player. <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Spikey_56ac.html" title="Dave Spikey">Dave Spikey</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Green_3057.html" title="Tony Green">Tony Green</a>, who had remained from the original Bullseye, commented on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_1_3f66.html" title="BBC Radio 1">BBC Radio 1</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Murray_8bb7.html" title="Colin Murray">Colin</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Bowman_496a.html" title="Edith Bowman">Edith</a> show on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">19 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>: "<i>...[Bullseye is] The only gameshow on the television in which the prizes get a round of applause...</i>" then joking around about some of the more "naff" prizes on the show. Bullseye aired, ironically, at the same time as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4s</a> <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kay_bff1.html" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a> Night, which just after Bullseye aired, showed the Mum wants a bungalow Tour at Manchester which poked fun at Bullseye, thus in hindsight helped to start the revival.</p>

<p>In one series, a deal was struck with a Speedboat manufacturer, meaning that the winning prize would always be a speedboat - the losing prize video was always something else, obviously completely fictitious as it would never be won.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>This series is not to be confused with the American <i>Bullseye</i>, which was an entirely different game. See <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullseye_%28US_game_show%29_d740.html" title="Bullseye (US game show)">Bullseye (US game show)</a> for details.</p>
<p>The show is nearly unique in having two different closing theme tunes — an upbeat tune played when the contestants win the star prize, and a tune in a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_key.html" title="Minor key">minor key</a> played when they lose or nobody takes the gamble.</p>
<p>Jim Bowen once described Bullseye as <i>"the second-best darts-based game show on television"</i>. There are no others.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> The show was filmed at The ATV Centre in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Aston.html" title="Aston">Aston</a> <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> the show moved to The Television House the home of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Independent_Television_e124.html" title="Central Independent Television">Central Independent Television</a> <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>.</p>
<p>The revival of Bullseye is now filmed at <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Television_c5f9.html" title="Yorkshire Television">Yorkshire Television</a> studios in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The theme music for the show was written by John Patrick, a succesful musician who has written a number of theme tunes for commercial television shows.</p>

<p>The repetitive, ordered nature of the show's format tended to result in the dialogue being practically the same from week to week - only the contestants' names would change. This resulted in an extraordinary number of Bullseye 'catchphrases' seeping into the public consciousness in a short space of time and becoming a central part of its charm.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It's a Bullseye, and here's your host Jim Bowen</i></li>
<li><i>It's a Bullseye, and here's your host Dave Spikey</i></li>
<li><i>Keep out of the black and in the red - nothing in this game for two in a bed</i></li>
<li><i>You can't beat a bit o' Bully!</i></li>
<li><i>See you back on the oche in a couple of throws</i></li>
<li><i>It'll take me two minutes to count it out</i></li>
<li><i>It's pounds for points</i></li>
<li><i>Let's just check that wi' Bully.</i> (On checking whether the contestant had correctly answered a spelling question. This involved the 'Bully' character moving along the bottom of the screen revealing the correct spelling of the word in question. Jim Bowen would rather awkwardly point to each letter in time with Bully movements.)</li>
<li><i>It's the wrong answer, and there's a light on</i></li>
<li><i>Let's have a look at what you could have have won.</i></li>
<li><i>You've got the time it takes the board to revolve to tell us what you would like to do</i></li>
<li><i>I'm afraid you've been 'Bully'd' out</i> (The Bully character's 'Moooo' signified that the contestant had run out of time to answer a question).</li>
<li><i>One hundred and one or more... for tonight's star prize... six darts... take your time... off you go boys</i></li>
<li><i>Just settle in boys, take your time and listen to Tony</i></li>
<li><i>Super! Smashing! Great!</i> although Bowen denies ever saying this, and it is almost certainly a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_misquotations.html" title="List of famous misquotations">misquote</a>, probably popularised by <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spitting_Image_ca1b.html" title="Spitting Image">Spitting Image</a>. In reality, Bowen would frequently use these words in isolation, but never in succession; infamously, he once replied 'smashing' after a contestant told him they had recently become unemployed. The mythical "catchphrase" was famously used in a UK poster advertising campaign for Skol Lager in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</li>
<li><i>All for the throw of a dart.</i></li>
<li><i>You get your BFH.....Bus fare home!</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> only)</li>
<li><i>You've hit 'words', and the category's gone</i></li>
<li><i>Let's see what Bully's prize board has for you tonight</i></li>
<li><i>Innnnn ONE, Innnnn TWO, Innnnn THREE, Innnnn FOUR, Innnnn FIVE, Innnnn SIX, Innnnn SEVEN, Innnnn EIGHT, and Bully's special priiiiize...</i></li>
<li><i>That's Red, It's number...</i></li>
<li><i>Red, Number...</i></li>
<li><i>And Red again, number...</i></li>
<li><i>Black</i></li>
<li><i>I want you to consider a gamble, the money you've won, that's safe, your charity money's safe too, it's these prizes. Would you like to gamble your prizes, for tonight's star prize, which is hiding behind Bully?</i></li>
<li><i>We've had a lovely day Jim. I think we'll give someone else a chance.</i> (Often said by contestants who had done well on the prize board - and did not wish to gamble).</li>
<li><i>And that's the bullseye</i></li>
<li><i>This is what you could have won</i></li>
<li><i>Oh Dear, never mind. Come and have a look at what you would have won.</i></li>
<li><i>Showbiz we'd like (the contestant would then inevitably miss the showbiz category.</i></li>
<li><i>Wake up to a nice hot cuppa with this Goblin tea's maid!</i></li>
<li><i>For that little tyke!, It's a BMX bike!!!</i></li>
<li><i>From <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_South_34c1.html" title="Television South">TVS</a> (etc.), we've got a lovely couple</i> (instead of introducing contestants as, for example, person A from town Y, in the programme's early years they were always person A from <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> region Y, which was unusual. This habit had largely ceased by the fifth series in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">86</a> and had disappeared entirely by the sixth series in 1986-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">87</a>.)</li>
<li><i>The ones which are lit, are the ones you can hit.</i> - used by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Spikey_56ac.html" title="Dave Spikey">Dave Spikey</a></li>
<li><i>If you don't make it, well, you've had a good day out, but you're goin' home with nowt.</i> (used by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Spikey_56ac.html" title="Dave Spikey">Dave Spikey</a> in reference to contestants who choose to gamble)</li>
<li><i>You, my friend, are crap!</i></li>
<li><i>You risked it, You missed it.</i> (Used by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Spikey_56ac.html" title="Dave Spikey">Dave Spikey</a> when contestants lose the gamble)</li>
