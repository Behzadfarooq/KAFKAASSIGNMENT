<p>"A press release by Take-Two Interactive, publishers of the game, states, "As a troublesome schoolboy, you'll laugh and cringe as you stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks on malicious kids, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the fictitious reform school, Bullworth Academy." This Game is the best game ever made for any system in the history of the universe"</p>
<p>While I believe that Bully is a very good game, the last sentence is obviously not coming from an objective point of view; it has absolutely no place in an encyclopedia and therefore should be removed.</p>
<p>I removed the links to Bully OnLine. It appears to be a separate site from Bullying Online, which is the site that complained about the game. This may stem from what appears to be a typo in [www.igniq.com/2005/08/thompson-bullies-rockstar-over.html]; according to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4135988.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4135988.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, Carnell is from Bullying Online. Of course, this is complicated by a link from that BBC article to Bully OnLine. If anyone has evidence that Bully OnLine has complained, please add that to the article. -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregoryWeir_b38e.html" title="User:GregoryWeir">GregoryWeir</a> 20:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

It has been announced on several reputable review sites that it DOES mean Dog Eat Dog.</p>
<p>Umm, yeah it does mean "dog eat dog", my dad learned Latin in school and I asked him what it meant when I bought the game. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreemDeem_12ed.html" title="User:FreemDeem">FreemDeem</a> 21:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Canis" = dog (nominative singular, the subject of the sentence.) "Canem" = dog (accusative singular, the object of the sentence.) "Edit" = third person active indicative (whew) of "edo" (eat). Basically, it means "a/the dog eats a/the dog," I think. 219.88.164.179 01:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You <i>can</i> beat people up with a number of objects, though many are limited to certain special fights. The normal weapons include those hazing paddles you see in most stereotypical school movies, broken sticks, and, yes, baseball bats. You can also use basket balls, soccer balls, frisbees, and even textbooks to throw at your fellow students. So yes. You <i>can</i> beat people in the head with a baseball bat. I've played through the entire story; there's no blood or deaths in the game. In fact, the closest thing to any sort of blood is the boxing matches; as you and your opponent get more and more beat up, you show more bruises.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 23:47, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've played the game for a few hours and yes indeed, you can beat people with baseball bats, so David Hogue is right on that point.

<dd>The name change now applies in Australia. Personally, I think its a stupid, STUPID mistake by Rockstar to submit CCE for review. Both games received the M rating and both received the same consumer advice. I don't know about Europe, but the title makes NO difference to the classification of a film or video game. Our M rating is also unrestricted, and can be exhibited by anybody regardless of age. The higher classification, MA15+ on the other hand is a legally restricted category, and the highest available classification for video games in Australia (although the R18+ rating only applies to films). Once Rockstar realises that the game has maintained its classification irregardless of the name change, there is a SLIGHT possibility that it will still be known as Bully in Australia, although it is EXTREMELY unlikely. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillygostly_3a85.html" title="User:Sillygostly">Sillygostly</a> 08:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello. I follow the workings of the videogame industry very closely, and the reason why I believe Rockstar changed the name for the UK market, at least, was because the game was attracting ungodly levels of negative press. Even when the game was first announced by title only, and with one screenshot available, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Vaz_03f8.html" title="Keith Vaz">Keith Vaz</a> started motioning in the Houses of Parliament to get the game banned, and even started "quoting" a list of things that were in the game, even though all that had been announced at the time was the name and a single screenshot (<a href="http://games.kikizo.com/media/bully_jun05/01c.jpg" class="external text" title="http://games.kikizo.com/media/bully_jun05/01c.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, in fact).</dd>
<dd>He wouldn't relent, and has been almost an English <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Thompson_%28attorney%29_1506.html" title="Jack Thompson (attorney)">Jack Thompson</a> since then, and has appeared on tabloidesque TV shows such as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_%26_Judy_4507.html" title="Richard &amp; Judy">Richard &amp; Judy</a> as an "expert on the industry", demonising videogames, though not to the extent of Mr Thompson. Likewise, there have been petitions and anti-bullying groups all over the game, even though the majority of people who were against the game may not know much about it (as was the case with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Jerry_Springer%7E_The_Opera_4d23.html" title="Jerry Springer: The Opera">Jerry Springer: The Opera</a>).</dd>
<dd>I feel the name change has almost certainly been to just start a clean sheet, as so much of the controversy over here has been based merely on the name of the game, and the notion that "videogames are for children".--<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreaded_Walrus_1d0d.html" title="User:Dreaded Walrus">Dreaded Walrus</a> 12:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it is being changed in <i>all</i> English-speaking PAL countries, so that they won't have to make multiple variations of the PAL disc?

<dd>Surely it couldn't be THAT expensive to manufacture more than one type of disc. After all, each country will have their own type of disc as for example, the T rating will be printed on the American version whereas the M rating will be printed on the Australian version. The distributors of Rockstar's games in each country are responsible for printing out the discs, so I still don't see why its necessary to change the name. Theoretically, it's more expensive to retitle the game as the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Film_and_Literature_Classification_%28Australia%29_7172.html" title="Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)">OFLC</a> charges companies who change the titles of their games or films. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillygostly_3a85.html" title="User:Sillygostly">Sillygostly</a> 00:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I live in Australia and I actually have the game. I don't mind much about the name. I still think of it as 'Bully', because the Official Playstation 2 Magazine Australia wrote many articles and updates on Bully as it was being produced, before the name change, and so it's just in my head with that name. Honestly, if the changed name means that more people will buy the brilliant game, I don't really care.

<dd>Bullworth seems to have a combination of private school traits.

Sort of like the town of Bullworth is supposed to be a microcosm representing New England, Bullworth School is to private education. <a href="../../../m/c/j/User%7EMcJeff_0d8f.html" title="User:McJeff">McJeff</a> 11:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off: all the bulleted lists need to go. A suggest a table of some sort for the notable things. Remember: Wikipedia isn't a game guide, so it's not important to list each and every character and item/weapon in the game. Secondly, references to pop culture could be cleaned as well. Wikipedia isn't a pop culture guide. I'm sure more could be done, but those are the two main things I see that would make the article look alot neater. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 00:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe it's just the fact that I did a whole lot of work on the character list speaking, but I don't think the character list needs to be changed, shortened, cleaned up, etc... If anything, it should be exported to a Characters of Bully/Canis Canem Edit page. This has been done with most other videogames. <a href="../../../m/c/j/User%7EMcJeff_0d8f.html" title="User:McJeff">McJeff</a> 20:44, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed. The bulleted lists need to be removed immediately. There's legitimate media coverage over this game (such as BBC's website), so this has the potential to be a good article, but right now it's downright awful. --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristam_8892.html" title="User:Tristam">Tristam</a> 01:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. It's not just a problem with this article, all of the Grand Theft Auto articles have too many sections that read like strategy guides, too. Until then, I moved the characters page and shortened the weapons/equipment sections just to try and clean things up a bit. It'd be nice if someone could just replace all of the bulleted sections with a nice paragraph about gameplay features. I'll admit the pop culture references interest me, but again, is it really neccessary for an encyclopedia article? <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPele_Merengue_0fb8.html" title="User:Pele Merengue">Pele Merengue</a> 21:14, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b>.

<li><b>Support</b> Both names are found on the North American version of the game, so it could be taken that the second part is a subtitle. As with most subtitles, they don't always have to be said. This would indeed give the page a more international name. -<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESaturnYoshi_465c.html" title="User:SaturnYoshi"><font color="midnightblue" face="comic sans ms"><b>Saturn</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESaturnYoshi_Esperanza_c7e5.html" title="User:SaturnYoshi/Esperanza"><font color="green" face="comic sans ms"><b>Yoshi</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESaturnYoshi_ae63.html" title="User talk:SaturnYoshi"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">THE VOICES</font></a></sup> 07:59, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, though the phrase "Canis Canem Edit" is in fact on the cover of the North American version of the game, it only occurs as the motto on the Bullworth Academy's coat of arms (see the article's page for the image). Unless you hold the position that every single piece of text on a game's cover (including those which are part of decorative elements) is part of the game's title, "Canis Canem Edit" is not part of the title. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 14:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> That title is wrong. It's either of the two titles, not both, as Docether quite clearly explains above. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:54, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why not move the page to Bully/Canis Canem Edit instead?

<dd>I think it would be rejected as strenuously as this suggestion has been... Particularly since there's no precedent for putting two titles together like that.

<p>Does anyone else think that this suddenly appeared detailed story section should be removed? It's huge, crufty and poorly typed up. Frankly it's an eyesore. It goes into what I think is stupid detail. We only need an overview of the story, not a huge step-by-step walkthrough of the story complete with quotes.

<p>I've redone the synopsis for Chapter I. I haven't got enough time for every chapter, but maybe someone else will want to make this particular section a little easier on the eyes. (Anon. 21:09, 17 January 2007 (GMT +1)</p>

<dd>I agree with Kinslayer too.. A basic summary would be alright, but a detailed synopsis of the story, chapter by chapter is excessive, unecessary, and has few precedents within Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 05:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wish I'd seen this discussion earlier before I spent a couple hours working on cleaning the plot synopsis section up. None the less, I've neatened it up extensively. It may be a bit long, but it's organized and less "crufty", and should be easier to edit by anyone who wants to.

<dd>The plot summary is identical to the version that was previously removed, and is attracting vandalism and nonsense information adders. I think at best an extra 2 sentences per chapter is all that needs to be added to the summary in thre gameplay section. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Somehow when you reverted the vandalism earlier, you also reverted a bunch of other stuff, including the chapter descriptions.

<p>Please bear with me, as this is the first assessment I have done for CVG. I hope that it is fair and helpful.</p>
<p>Considerable work, including a Peer Review, has been done on the article. After reviewing the assessment scale several times, however, I have decided to keep the article as start-class, but barely.</p>
<p>Considerable work still must be done to improve the quality of this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional references are needed throughout the article, but especially in the Introduction. Was there really a planned XBox version? Prove it.</li>
<li>The page assumes that the reader has some idea of what Bully is, notably in the Gameplay section where some examples are given as to types of gameplay included but is still confusing to those readers who have not played the game before.</li>
<li>Quite a bit of copy-editing is needed, and some parts are not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a></li>
<li>External Links section seems to contain articles that would be better used as references</li>
</ul>
<p>The most well written section appears to be the ESRB controversy section, as it contains an appropriate number of references and is somewhat easier to understand for someone who hasn't played the game, but still requires that the user has heard of the title to understand.</p>
<p>This potential for this article is present, but unfortunately I cannot upgrade its status until the article on a whole is improved. -<a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigiwrld1_cf17.html" title="User:Digiwrld1">Digiwrld1</a> 22:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
