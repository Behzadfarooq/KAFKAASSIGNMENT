<p>I'd like to know why were my contributions deleted. They are completely logical!</p>
<p>Can we edit or take out the part about Homosexual males being at risk? The source cites "gender identity" which is not connected to homosexuality.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree; I was just coming here to say that. The article refers to gay males as "gender-conflicted" which is extremely offensive. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchelhof_7224.html" title="User:Ichelhof">Ichelhof</a> 16:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I'm a bit new to Wpedia, but I believe that I must post a link here before adding it to the main page.</p>
<p>My link is Somerset &amp; Wessex Eating Disorders Association, I design and manage the site on a volunteer basis (being a recovered sufferer from anorexia and bulimia myself).</p>
<p>Although we are a rather localised charity I would hope that the information provided by the site would be useful to a much wider audience.</p>
<p>I dont think that the information its really bad</p>
<p>I appreciate that others may remove the listing if they don't feel that it's appropriate to be included here but I thought that I'd post in up just in case and have also done so in a few other eating disorder related articles.</p>
<p>I hope that this is ok. Feel free to email me if there's a problem (contact details are on the website).</p>

<p>We've got one sentence saying "The following six criteria must all be met for a patient to be diagnosed", but then another saying "note that these diagnosis criteria are only a <b>guide</b>". So either the second sentence should be removed, or the word "must" in the first sentence should be changed. Also, why is "guide" in the second sentence in bold? Also, "many doctors will diagnose bulimia nervosa if only one is not present" would be clearer, I think, as "many doctors will diagnose bulimia nervosa if five of the six are present". (But the reason I'm not being bold and making this change is that the first three times I read the sentence, I read it as "many doctors will diagnose bulimia nervosa if only one is present", and I'm not sure that's not what was meant.)</p>
<p>Also, the parenthetical "Some anorectics may demonstrate bulimic behaviours in their illness: binge-eating and purging themselves of food on a regular or infrequent basis at certain times during the course of their disease. Alternatively, some individuals might switch from having anorexia to having bulimia..." is long and somewhat confusing. Would it be accurate to say "A patient expressing both sets of behaviors is generally considered <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexic.html" title="Anorexic">anorexic</a>, and indeed some anorectics may demonstrate binge-eating or other bulimic behaviours during the course of their disease. Alternatively, some individuals might switch from expressing primarily anorexic to primarily bumemic symptoms."?</p>
<p>Also, are there truly six criteria in the DSM-IV? The section head used to say "The Five DSM-IV critera". Presumably one was added later -- is it legitimate?</p>

<p>In patients expressing both anorexic and bulimic behaviors, the final catagorazation is genarally made based on weight and status of amnorhia (anorexia being amnoria and BMI of &lt;17.5)If the patient is sub-threshold for both weight and frequency requirements, that would be defined as ED-NOS. --Emiyorkie 02:30, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've used the Wikipedia in the past but this is the first time I've tried to contribute. ECRI recently published an online resource guide focusing on bulimia nervosa and I think it would be a valuable addition to your the list of external resources. The project was funded by a grant from the Hilda and Preston Davis Foundation and the reports and website are freely available to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bulimiaguide.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bulimiaguide.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Here's the blurb from the site.</p>
<p>This Web site provides a one-stop comprehensive resource on bulimia nervosa for anyone who wants to understand the disorder and how to support a family member or friend with bulimia nervosa. This information was developed in response to questions and concerns voiced by patients and families affected by bulimia nervosa and clinicians treating bulimia nervosa. Patients seeking treatment for bulimia nervosa may also find this Web site useful. Included here are scientific findings on how well various treatments for bulimia nervosa work based on the most comprehensive analysis completed to date on treatments for bulimia nervosa. You'll also find easy-to-use check lists and tips on how to start a discussion about bulimia nervosa with a friend or family member who might have bulimia. If you are seeking bulimia nervosa treatment facilities, the find a treatment center database can help.</p>
<p>About this Resource Guide</p>
<p>The content presented here on bulimia nervosa was researched and developed by ECRI (www.ecri.org) an international independent nonprofit agency and Collaborating Center of the World Health Organization, under a grant from a private foundation, The Hilda and Preston Davis Foundation. An external advisory committee of bulimia nervosa patients, families, and clinical experts reviewed all content. ECRI is designated as an Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. ECRI's mission is to improve the safety, quality, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare. It is widely recognized by the healthcare community as one of the world's leading independent organizations committed to advancing the quality and safety of healthcare.</p>

<dd>This looks like a good call. I reviewed the site, and it seems to contain some valuable information, from a somewhat less disease-centered perspective. In addition, ECRI is a credible agency with a demonstrable track record.

<p>What's the point of specifically stating that females and males are at risk groups for bulimia?

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm going to add a 'cleanup' tag to this page, as it is badly in need of it. It lacks coherent referencing to scientific studies, is unstructured, confused in places and contains lots of personal advice from someone. There's plenty of great information in the article, I think it just needs thorough going through by specialist in the field.</p>

<p>I added "Eating disorder not otherwise specified" to the "see also" section, as EDNOS also covers binging and purging behaviors. Please let me know if you believe this is inappropriate.</p>

<p>I have made a number of edits and re-worded a few parts of it. Is it wise to remove toe personal advice though? Bear in mind that a number of people with bulimia may look it up and it may inspire them to seek help <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStui_aebd.html" title="User:Stui">Stui</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStui_3a3f.html" title="User talk:Stui">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stui_58f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stui">contribs</a>) 4 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I've noticed there are a few references to treatment centres in there, probably because of the original source material. Is it worth taking out these references seeing as Wikipedia is pretty much an international site &amp; phrases like "...available in this country" don't make sense otherwise?</p>
<p><br />
Yes, just where is 'this country' anyway, dammit? There are 193 of them. And why are there only listings for centres in the USA and UK?</p>

<p>This seems irrelovent: 5% or less of bullimics are male. Assuming 10% (a rather high estimate) of men are gay, that puts the percentage of gay bullimics much lower than 5%. Not to mention it does not effect homosexuals more than straight people, but people people who find it a 'female condition' are less likely to have it recognized/diagnosed. Homosexuals are not "gender identity conflict" victims. Homosexuality should not be mentioned. The paragraph should read, "Some males, who find Bulimia nervosa a female disorder, are at a higher risk of the disorder not being recognized and diagnosed. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_jedi_requiem_3b2a.html" title="User:Dark jedi requiem">Dark jedi requiem</a> 03:41, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone needs to go through this article, replacing every "her" (the personal pronoun for the bulimic) with "they", "one" or "a sufferer of bulimia". Feminising the issue only makes it less acessible to male readers or sufferers, as well as potentially sounding POV.</p>
<p>"Characteristically, those with bulimia nervosa feel more shame and out of control with their behaviors, as the anorexic meticulously controls her intake, a symptom that calms her anxiety around food as she feels she has control of it, naïve to the notion that it, in fact, controls her." - I don't like this.</p>
<p>The reference to the television programme also seems fairly ludicrous in what is essentially a medical article.</p>

<p>The use of "Caucasian race" is problematic, for several reasons; 1) This is a medical article and "Caucasian" is not a scientific term. 2) It is not an Environmental Factor. 3) It is American-centric and this is an international encyclopedia. If the intention is to describe a White American demographic, simply use "White American". See <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasian race</a>.</p>

I know why i fell into this horrible cycle.
