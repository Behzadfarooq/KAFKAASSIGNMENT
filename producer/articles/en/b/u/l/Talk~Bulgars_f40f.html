	    <p>Currently the article leaves the impression that Onogurs were non-bulgar tribe which Kubrat united with the bulgars. Is that so, or please rephrase! Koliokolio 16:49, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thing that the name Bulgaria is very simple. "B'L' - GR' " means "The Great Land" . B' - means Old, big, great, Older; L' means mountain, teeth etc.; GR' means land. And the apostrophe here is the active letter "Ъ" in bulgarian language. There is some other languages used the letter but not the "Latin" and "Greek" languages. From here the name <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan.html" title="Balkan">Balkan</a> means B'L'K'N' - "The Great Land/Mountain Keeper/fortress - (<a href="../../../k/h/a/Khan.html" title="Khan">Khan</a> or Tcar, or Shakh) - Balkhan - Великан, Balshah / Balhash - lake, Baltatcar or <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltazar.html" title="Baltazar">Baltazar</a> - name</p>

<p>What on Earth is <i>Varkun</i>, and how could it be related to the word Bulgar? Furthermore, I believe the current view is that Bulgars were not originally Turkic (article seems to agree), so it does not make sense for the word to be derived from a Turkic language. According to Bulgarian scholars (who should care), the etymology of the name is somewhere between very controversial, and totally unknown. We should remove the whole name etymology sentence. This is an encyclopedia, not a place to throw wild guesses. Unless someone presents a viable referenced argument for the current etymology hypothesis, I will edit it out. --<a href="../../../b/b/u/User%7EBbugg_eb06.html" title="User:Bbugg">Bbugg</a> 00:37, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bulgar (Bolgar) name seems to be driven from Volga river. I find the suggested etymology ("Bulgha" to mix) less likely.</p>
<p>NO. Volga comes from the Russian ways of pronouncing Bulga. The Bulgars settled there, hence the name. --Kaloyan* 16:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I think etymologists agree that Volga is also derived from the Turkic for mix. Hope it helps.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Btw a friend of mine that graduated Turkology told me there is no word "bulgha" meaning "mix" in any Turkic language. In Bulgarian textbooks the name is explained with a totemistic origin. In Turkic languages <i>bulga</i> is a kind of small animal with valuable fur. So the "Bulgars" would be the "bulga hunters".</dd>

<dd><i>името българи има тотемен произход, т. е. свързва се с името на животното-прародител.

Или казано по друг начин, българи означава „ловци на самури"</i> (<b>История на България за 11 клас. С., Отворено общество, 1996 - автори: П. Делев, Г. Бакалов, П. Ангелов, Цв. Георгиева, Пл.

<dd>I would think twice before using "Отворено общество" (Open Society Institute) texts for anything, particularly concerning facts that might (or might not, as it usually is) have a "nationalist" ring to them. The institute is somewhat notorious for pushing their agenda when it comes to interpretations of history. It is very unfortunate, that such publications are actually used in some high schools in Bulgaria. On the subject of protobulgarian language, if you bothered to look at a list of non-slavic words, present in modern Bulgarian, you would discover that most words tend to appear much more closely related to Pashtu, than to any Turkic language. Refrain from posting in Bulgarian here, do so on my talk page. --<a href="../../../b/b/u/User%7EBbugg_eb06.html" title="User:Bbugg">Bbugg</a> 19:47, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Otto Maenchen-Helfen: <b>“The names of the Danube Bulgars offer an illustration of the pitfalls into which scholars are likely to stumble when they approach the complex problems of the migration period with their eyes fixed on etymologies. In spite of the labor spent on the explanation of Bulgarian names, since the thirties of the past century, there is hardly one name whose etymology has been definitely established. The name Bulgar itself is an example. What does it mean? Are the Bulgars "the Mixed ones" or "the Rebels?" Pelliot was inclined to the latter interpretation but thought it is possible that bulgar meant les trouveurs. Detschev challenged the Turkish etymology; he assumed that Bulgar was the name given to the descendants of the Attilanic Huns by the Gepids and Ostrogoths and took it for Germanic, meaning homo pugnax. Still another non-Turkish etymology has been suggested by Keramopoulos. He takes Bulgarii to be burgaroi, Roman mercenaries garrisoned in the burgi along the limes. Without accepting this etymology, I would like to point out that in the second half of the sixth century a group of Huns who had found refuge in the empire were known as fossalisii. Fossalum is a military camp.”</b></p>
<p>“In addition to the objective difficulties, subjective ones bedevil some scholars. Turkologists are likely to find Turks everywhere; Germanic scholars discover Germans in unlikely places. Convinced that all Bulgarians spoke Turkish, Nemeth offered an attractive Turkish etymology of Asparuch; other Turkologists explained the name in a different, perhaps less convincing way. Now it has turned out, that Asparuch is an Iranian name. Validi Togan, a scholar of profound erudition but sometimes biased by pan-Turkism, derived shogun, Sino-Japanese for chiang chun, "general," from the Qarluq title sagun. Pro-Germanic bias led Schonfeld to maintain, in disregard of all chronology, that the Moors took Vandalic names.” <b>---Sarmatian 01:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>Hi, I'm from <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan.html" title="Kazan">Kazan</a> and I can help you in this question!</p>
<p><i>Volga</i> is Finnish for <i>water</i>. (Finnish tribes lived in Russia before Slavics and Turks). <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatars.html" title="Tatars">Tatars</a> use <i>İdel</i> for <i>Volga</i>. So Volga is Finnish name. In native Tatar and Russian pronouncing <i>bolğar</i> do not sounds like <i>volga</i>^becose it's <i>rr</i> in the ending.</p>

<dd>Hi, I am a Bulgarian, who speaks Finnish, and I can tell you that <i>Volga</i> is not a word in Finnish. The Finnish word for water is <i>vesi</i>, and the sound combination <i>lg</i> is not present in Finnish at all. I'd bet on the Turkic origin of <i>Volga</i>.</dd>

<dd>I don't know about proposed etymologies for the name 'Volga', but what I do know is that although there is no such word as 'volga' in finnish, 'valka' is an old finnish word meaning something like 'to flow' or 'water' or the like, I'm not quite sure what. Although the word itself isn't in use in modern finnish, a derived word 'valkama', meaning something like a 'landing place for a boat' still sees some use, although many finns of today probably wouldn't understand it anymore. Similar words can, as far as I know, be found in related languages. Sorry for the anonymity, maybe I'll get bold and register myself and then come back to reference my claims, now you'll just have to take my word as a native speaker of finnish and student of general linguistics.</dd>

<p>The name of Volga comes from the Russian/Slavic inability to pronounce the saound "shwa" in Bulga. That is how they pronounce Bulgaria even today. Volga was named after the Bulgars.</p>

<dd>We get the same sort of "discoveries" every year, some of them (few) end up accepted by science, however, the most of them do not. You heard something on TV a year ago and that is not an especially valid reason for changing the whole article. On top of it, it is quite hard to talk of any Thracians after 1 cent DC (as they were all Romanized) and the monument is officially dated to the 7th or 8th century DC.

<hr />
<p>Wikipedia ,as a free encyclopedia, is used by many as a reference source. Thus, it should seek the objectivity and truth in its articles. However, in the article for Bulgars, the author, who I assume is from Bulgaria tried to impose his beliefs rather than the commonly accepted theory about the origin of the Bulgars. Even in the given external links, Bulgars or proto-Bulgars are described as a Turkic people, however according to the author they were most probably 'pamyrians'. I would like to ask what is the basis of these claims, are there any recent scientific and objective work which is strong enough to change the generally accepted view that Bulgars were Turkic? Otherwise, one may assume that this article is a product of so-called a "revisionist history", and serves the purpose of currently Slavic-speaking nation of Bulgaria to create a false history for the Bulgar tribe that they took their name from.</p>
<hr />
<p>Occasionally I watch the debate here whether the <b>Bulgars</b> were Turkic or not. I'm wondering what evidence exists that indicates they were Turkic. Whatever evidence exists for that theory should be collected and put in the article. If no evidence exists, then it is hard to list Bulgars under the Turkic category. Decius 02:16, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as I am aware there is NO debate in serious scholarly circles. The early Bulgars were linguistically Turkic, regardless of whatever their genealogical origin may be. The works of M.I. Artamanov, Runciman, Peter Golden, David Christian, Omeljan Pritsak and D. Dmitrov (himself a Bulgarian) to name only a few, all conclude that the early Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, as do all serious linguists who have studied the topic. I have yet to see a single citation from VMORO or any other user to a serious work of linguistics that contains arguments for reclassifying the proto-Bulgar language as Iranic or part of any other language group. Unfortunately, the "debate", such as it is, is motivated largely by nationalist ideologues seeking to minimize Bulgarian associations with Turkic peoples. --<a href="../../../d/z/i/User%7EDzimmer6_f56e.html" title="User:Dzimmer6">Dzimmer6</a> 02:57, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I often hear that "The Bulgars were Turkic", yet I rarely see evidence for that idea. It might just be an assumption. Unless many Bulgar names, etc., have been shown to be Turkic (which would be a strong indication). On the other hand, I have found a scholarly site that presents much evidence indicating that the Bulgars did not speak a Turkic language:<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Groznijat/pb_lang/pbl_1_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.tripod.com/~Groznijat/pb_lang/pbl_1_1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This is based on a detailed study of old Bulgar inscriptions, which really are not apparently Turkic at all, except for some Turkic words thrown in here and there (and there are also Slavic words thrown in here and there). Decius 09:07, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are absolutely no evidences, no clues that the Bulgarians have any Turkic origin. But there are plenty of assumptions, drivven by different ideological goals for presenting the Bulgarians as a Turkic or Tatar or Mongol or Marsian tribe... --Shisharki 04:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must agree. Even Britanica states "...PROBABLY of Turkic origin". No hard evidence for the Turkic origin of the Bulgars. I have had lenghty discussion on this topic with people that know a lot. My conclusion is that they were both, as they assimilated various tribes along their migrations. Most importantly, the newer views on this matter are becoming increasingly accepted from contemporary scholars.</p>
<dl>
<dd>ooh Britanica, it must be true.. Not. I am not motivated by my religion to tell you that the Pro-Bulgars were not Turkic, whatever that means. They do however have a very strong connection with tribes that lived in that area around the 5 century. Originaly Bulgarians come from the west part of Tibet and are not related to Turkics. They did become related at a later time after they established the Great Bulgaria around the 6th century.

<p>Anthropological research of skeletons found in Bulgar burial mounds testify to an unusual diversity of anthropological types found there - roughly half of them are of Mongolian/Turanian origin, the other half are of Iranian origin + some are of Uralian/Finnish stock. Considering that the Bulgars evidently managed to assimilate a wide variety of other nomadic peoples (or may be they were themselves an amalgamation of different tribes), the question as to whether they were Turkic or Iranian becomes rather pointless.

<dd>Well, I’m a professional linguist, now retired, and I am not in the least certain that the original language was Turkic. It was Turkic at one point, but many of us believe that it began as something else. The Encyclopaedia Britannica, for instance, claims the origin was Ugrian. In any case, no one is trying to rule Turkic origins out as a possibility ... but we believe there are other possibilities as well, some more likely than others. I don’t believe any competent linguist would support you and insist that Turkic was the only possibility. Moreover, it’s not really the linguistic question that you say it is. There is no proof that anything remains of the original language, whatever it may have been. The original language is a matter of conjecture, and the only thing that actually remains is DNA. In other words, nobody claims that the Modern Bulgarian language exhibits any Pamirian influence or retains any Pamirian features whatsoever (or Ugrian, as the case may be) ... the modern language developed out of Slavic, Turkic, and Balkan linguistic union influences, plus a few other minor sources that are well known. —<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_G._Brown_7cee.html" title="User:Stephen G.

<p>There are no evidences for Turkic or Tatar origin - just a bunch of bubble from some 'specialists' based on no real facts (artifacts or scripts) - just speculations and attempts for rewriting the history of the Bulgarians under the influence of the Soviet mission for placing all Eastern-European nations under a Slavic umbrella led by the Russians themselves. Yes, the article "Bulgars" needs a major repair. All pamirian-turkic-tatar-mongolian fairy-tales about the Bulgars' origin are not based on any true evidences or logical assumptions.

If the early Bulgars are not of Turkic origin why their leaders' title was "Khan" then? Bulgarians, Kazan Tatars, Chuvash and Bashkir people are all descendants of Bulgar Khanate, Bulgars were assimilated by Slavs, Finno-Ugric etc. people of the region. Chuvash language is accepted as a Turkic language and is seen as the only remain of the old Bulgar language. I can't understand why our Bulgarian fellows are being so quick-tempered about this issue, as a Turk, I don't see modern Bulgarians as Turks, it's clear that they are assimilated. Also there are some claims saying that "Bulgar" is derived from "Bel-Ogur" which is the western Turkic equivalent of eastern "Beş Oğuz" probably meaning a confederation Five-Tribes. I want to say a last thing, Turanism was popular among Bularian intellectuals after Balkan Wars. Orhanoglu 05:38, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Orhanoglu, using the title 'Khan' in intself doesn't prove much. People borrow words and titles all the time. What makes you think that 'khan' was exclusively Turkic? Why did the Germans use the Roman title 'ceaser'(Keiser)? Note, that the Bulgarian rulers used 'khan' always in front of the name: Khan Asparuh, Khan Krum, Khan Sabin. Turkic rulers on the other hand always put it nehinf the name, i.e. Genghis Khan. --Kaloyan* 16:44, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good idea to ask for an expert's opinion; however, I doubt that there is an expert who can decide the matter once and for all since there simply aren't enough fragments of the Bulgar language left to allow one or the other theory to be proven without doubt. I think all existing theories should be mentioned, with the possible addition that the Pamir/Iranian theory is more popular within Bulgaria, and the Turkic theory more popular outside. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslav_37b7.html" title="User:Preslav">Preslav</a> 13:01, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think the problem lies on the fact that some people want to restrict their research according to their national instincts. Tt seems like they have this national pride which is affecting their further research by trying not to accept any theory that may link them to Turkic origins, or origins same with Turkic people. Bulgar people do not want to be referred as Turkic people (even EU legacy is linked to this notion) and all I read here is that there is no evidence. But also there is no evidence of them being not part of proto-Turkic people. If there was then there would be no discussion. In wiki it says "Bulgars are called as Huns, Sycthians but not as Turks" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] but on the other hand if you read Turkish origins all these people are referred as proto-Turkic but again not accepted. We know that Huns had Turkic rulers but people doesn't have to be Turkic. If we take the ruling class as the origins of a nation then Huns should be Turkic. I am not sure about language theries but it seems like language now is the most relevant cultural identity to follow origins. If Bulgar language have Indo_european origin does it make them Indian origin. We have to look at other suggestions [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]that Indo-European language may derive from a super family such as Altaic Languages. I would assume migration routes, and place of origin is also a good argument since Hungarians like Bulgars are coming from Ural-Altay region and Hungarian is an Altaic language. Does anyone have an idea what writing system were Bulgars using prior to Greek or Cyrillic alphabet?--Kultegin 13:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The title 'Khan' is totally invented. It was taken from the title “Canasjubigi” which was used only by 3 of tem, starting with Omortag of Bulgaria, and can be in an inscription with Greec letters. In the nominalia is used the title K’nas which everione can see is verry close to the title Knjaz. The title khan was invented form “Canasjubigi” only to fit in the turkish theory. Which, I must say, was serving a Soviet instruction to the Bulgarian Academy of Science from the year1948. I cannot citate it exactli ofcorce but the meaninng was ‘proto’bulgarians to be pronounced turkish under fier of lusing rights of partcipate in the academy. That’s how from “Canasjubigi” it became to Khan. The title khan exists in no historical documents. See please "The language of the Asparukh and Kuber Bulgars, Vocabulary and grammar" by Peter Dobrev <a href="http://www.kroraina.com/b_lang/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kroraina.com/b_lang/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kroraina.com/b_lang/index.html</a></p>
<p>He is a scientist in the Bulgarian Academy of Science and the last 30 years of his career he deals with the protobulgarians, their origin, language, habits and so on.</p>
<p>Peter Dobrev is not a scientist, he's a simple charlatan. The origin of the Bulgars is disputed, the Turkic hypothesis being so to say, traditional, and in addition there have been dozens of hypotheses of Finnish, Iranian, Pamirian etc. links. Strange nobody has mentioned Chinese and Sumerian yet, because I myself have heard 'scientists' claiming that it was Bulgars who buit the Great Wall and settled Messopotamia, so all Asia seems to have been populated by Bulgars once&#160;:) The point is, just make it clear in the article that there is a debate and that Turkic origin, while the most prevalent hypothesis, is still a hypothesis. And guys, why do you bother to read Wikipedia and post on the discussion page since you don't even speak decent English - 'under fier of lusing rights of particpate in the academy' is simply brilliant.

<p>-- Some Bulgarian extremist nationalists have come across a fact in their history which they just can't bare. As their nationalism is based upon anti-Ottomanism they find it hard to stomach that the "Bulgars" were Turkic.</p>
<p>Now, let's get down to the facts.</p>
<p>Bulgar's were and most importantly ARE Turkic and un-assimilated Bulgar's exist today in the Volga Bulgaria, they speak Turkic and retain their heritage. Just search <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuvash.html" title="Chuvash">Chuvash</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volga_Tatar_9390.html" title="Volga Tatar">Volga Tatar</a>.</p>
<p>The origin of the "Bulgar's" is Central Asia.</p>
<p>Some Bulgar's spread and took control of the area of what is today modern Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Throughout time the Bulgar's were assimilated into the majority population and only the name Bulgar-ia remains.</p>
<p>The attempts of some extremist nationalists of the country "Bulgaria" is to try and create this long ancient glorious history in which the "Bulgars" are their ancestors. However, the Bulgar's being Turkic doesn't fit this ideal so they try to invent the most outlandish theories that the actual Bulgars, that the Turkic Bulgar's who still retain their history and heritage are actually "Iranic".</p>
<p>This theory has no credibility and no base. It revolves around the flimsy account of Herodotus calling some Bulgars Scythians, it is very well known that Herodotus lumped all Eastern Nomads into one grop called Scythians.</p>
<p>Wikipedia cannot allow this laugable theory to be included, it is nothing but pseudo-history.</p>

I do not know who you are, but your anger is very suspicious. How can you be so sure? The Turkic “theory” is obviously wrong and is going to the past no matters do you like it or not! And the argument – “extremist nationalists” is just silly! And it is not the oldest theory! And the Iranian theory is not new at all! It is exactly your closed eyes that “Wikipedia cannot allow”!</p>

<p>“Some Bulgar's spread and took control of the area of what is today modern Bulgaria.Throughout time the Bulgar's were assimilated into the majority population and only the name Bulgar-ia remains.” This is nonsense – this is the Russian silly pan-Slavic version and it is political!

<p>Maenchen-Helfen provides an extensive analysis of the Bulgar-Chuvash language and his conclusion is exactly the opposite to “The oldest and more widely accepted theory” presented by Wiki’s writing. Some quotes: “In Hunnish, which developed into Bulgar-Chuvash, *iis-lil, *iis-til-a must have meant grosse Wassermenge, grosser Fluss, grosses Meer. The name Attila, for example, seems to offer neither phonetic nor semantic difficulties. Attila is formed from Gothic or Gepidic; atta, "gather," by means of the diminutive suffix -ila. However some scholars, impressed by the similarity of Attila to Atil, the Turkish name of the Volga, equated the two names without concern for their phonetic and semantic relationship.” and <b>“…one cannot help marveling at the boldness with which the problem of the Hunnish language has been and still is being attacked.”</b> ---Sarmatian 01:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>“migration form Central Asia” and “[Bulgars] Swept by the Hunnish wave … from their settlements in central Asia…” - here is a short story about the beginning of this confusion:</p>
<p>In the 1750’s, the French Orientalist Joseph de Guignes identified the Huns with the Hsiung-nu described in the Chinese records. Until the 1940’s, the identity of the European Huns with the Hsiung-nu on China’s borders was rarely questioned. As no one doubted that the Hsiung-nu were Mongoloids, the Huns must have been Mongoloids too. These assumptions however have never been proven by paleoanthropological finds to reconstruct the routs over which the Huns migrated into Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The answer given by A. N. Bernshtam in 1926 was for widely accepted: In the last century B.C., Hsiung-nu were supposed to have moved to eastern Middle Asia and from there spread westward. Bernshtam’s thesis centered on a catacomb in the cemetery on the Kenkol River in the Upper Talas Valley. Bernshtam excavated kurgan 10. “In the catacomb,” he wrote, “lay two Mongoloid skeletons with deformed skulls; the skeletons in the dromos were Europoids, apparently slaves from the local population of the Pamiro-Fergana race.” Bernshtam was an excellent and indefatigable excavator, but he wrote in too great haste, reconstructing whole periods of world history on the narrowest foundations. His interpretation of the Kenkol finds is the telling example. The two Mongoloids became in no time Turkish-speaking Hsiung-nu, and the Europoids in the dromos Wu-sun slaves. Because the Mongoloids were buried in catacombs, all catacombs burials in Middle Asia were declared Hsiung-nu burials. The shepherds from Kenkol were the missing link between the Hsiung-nu in Mongolia and the Huns in Central Europe.</p>
<p>Later excavations made Berhshtam’s interpretation questionable as early as 1940. Gryaznov proved that the ‘slaves’ in the dormos belong to a secondary burial. A closer study of the Chinese annals also argued Bernshtam’s thesis and the assumed connection between Hsiung-nu and the Huns.</p>
<p>Bulgars were the brain and the generator behind the Hunnish associations and their migration paths should not and cannot be reviewed separately. It is certain that the Bulgars inhabited different areas around the Black Sea literal and it would be safer to stick around with opinions like 'Beyond them [the Acatziri] extend above the Pontic sea the territories of the Bulgars, whom the punishments of our sins have made notorious. After these the Huns, like a cluster of mighty races, have spawned twofold frenzied peoples.” – Jordanes, then jump bravely in the past with assumptions like the “Pamirian” one. From the Black Sea literal we have old enough knowledge about the Bulgars' adobe, as old as the origin of the Germanic and the Slavic tribes for example. ---Sarmatian 02:01, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been researching about the Iranic people and by chance I met some bulgarian people. Its very interesting that in the zhargon language which is the sreet language in bulgaria, too many Iranic words and frases are used. In some Iranian and Islamic works, Bulgars are related to the hephtalites. Hephtalites or the wite huns where a confedration of saka or scythian tribse with some hunnic or mongoloid. This has been told by travelers in the Balkh and Bactra aria at the time. In Iranian language when they want to indicate a home less person they say alakhon and valakhon, which is derived from the triball names of alxon an valxon, and as I read once thies names have been used by Bulgars. The same thing is about the word avare which has been taken from Avar. This is because when persian Shahanshah Khosro Anushirvan who grow up as a hostage at the hephtalites defeatet the heftalites, they fled westwards and did not settel for many years untill ther riched the northern black sea and eastern europe.</p>
<p>On the origin of the title Khan I have to say that it was driven from the word Ghan or gan like in khodaygan or bozorgan in persian, meaning graetnes. The turks where subjects to the hephtalites and they helped the persians to defeat the hephtalites.</p>
<p>The name Bulgar would be a transformation Of Bactra, Balhara, Balhar or Balkh, Indicating the aria in centralasia and northern Pamir. The bulgar words are too similar with the iranic and sanskrit.</p>
