<p>There seem to be at least 6 grammatically distinct tenses in the subjunctive. However, some of them serve primarily in the formation of coplex verb forms like "I want to do" while others are colloquially used only to convey doubt (impossible to translate). Maybe these last ones should be separated their own dubitative mood, since they are not only semantically, but also gramatically distinct.</p>

<p>Somebody please fix the table with the consonants because it doesn't have the dz sound. == I've weakened the claim that the suffixed article is an inheritance from Bulgar. First I've heard of it. But it might be true, so I haven't removed it entirely. I thought the orthodox story was that since Romanian, Bulgarian, and Albanian form a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprachbund.html" title="Sprachbund">Sprachbund</a> for the article, and neither the Romance nor Slavonic branches otherwise have it, it must have been an Albanian innovation. I don't know anything about Bulgar, not even what branch of 'Altaic' it was in, but neither Mongolian nor Turkish has a definite article. (Turkish omits accusative marking on indefinite objects.) <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a> 19:30 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Romanians and Bulgarians had direct commercial/cultural links since the Bulgarians came in the Balkans and about 1000 years ago there was even a Romanian-Bulgarian common state, but both Romanians and Bulgarians had almost no link with Albanians that could bring an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A better explanation is that the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Tracians</a> had this suffixed article since Thracians were living in Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Albanians may have directly inherited it (since Albanians are direct descendents of the Thracians), Romanians kept it from the <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacia.html" title="Dacia">Dacian</a> language (a Thracian dialect) into the Latin after the Roman conquest and Bulgarians, establishing themselves in a region already inhabited by Thracians, add it into their language. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> 11:52, 19 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A very similiar suffixised article exists in Aramiac and other west semitic languages, a diliact of Aramiac which was lingua franca in a large area circa 1st cent may have gotten in the Bugarian, including a great mixure of people from turkey for example.

<p>In Routledge's <i>The Slavonic Languages</i>, edited by Bernard Comrie, the section on Bulgarian explains that it is really only the Bulgarian and Greek linguists who do not recognise Macedonian as a separate language, whilst the general community of linguists does. I've highlighted that accordingly. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 10:08, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I've updated the history of Bulgarian using the aforementioned work <i>The Slavonic Languages</i>. I also emphasized that while Bulgarian is descended from Old Church Slavonic, so as other languages in the Balkan region, and therefore the name "Old Bulgarian" is considered an anachronism by reputable modern linguists. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 16:01, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>===VMORO</p>
<p>Generally agree with most of the edits but I've made some corrections. 1. A.Schleicher, M.Hatala and L.Geitler in the 19th century talk about Old Bulgarian and I have reflected that. 2. No Bulgarian linguist (and as far as I am aware, no Greek one) has ever recognised the Macedonian language, so the definition "most" is incorrect.</p>

<p>It's so comfortable that you two (Crculver and Juro) turned out logged at the same time and Crculver just happened to look the things we were arguing about with Juro in the dictionary...</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that Juro is identical with Crculver?!!! <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 11:46, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think it's silly to suggest that there's some sort of conspiracy. In the summer I spend a good 16 hours a day at the computer, so there's no surprise that I am logged in at the same time as someone else. Furthermore, I am a philologist, so it's quite understandable that I have a large library which I can consult for my work, including a number of works on Slavonic comparative linguistics. Incidentally, you would do well to take a look at some of those works, because you are generally editing from a Bulgarian-centric viewpoint, whereas I would prefer you support the international viewpoint that, among other things, recognises Macedonian as a separate language for centuries. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 14:32, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All linguists in Greece and Bulgaria are united in Not recognising the Macedonian language, as well as some foreign linguists (certainly a minority), for ex. Austrian Otto Kronsteiner. What my opinion is is irrelevant, I am just stating the facts. If I edited from a "Bulgarian-centric viewpoint", I would have said smth like "Macedonian language does not exist and has never existed, it is a southwestern Bulgarian dialect". As for "the international viewpoint, which recognises Macedonian as a separate language for centuries", that is certainly untrue in its "centuries" part.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Articles with definite article are something normal and used without any help words,</dd>
<dd>e.g. English "the new one" is Bulgarian 'noviat'.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This phrase is not very clear. What do you mean by "Articles with definite article"&#160;? Noviat looks like an adjectiv (novi) + definite article (-iat). <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 13:12, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I was wondering whether the meaning is equivalent to the Romanian: (Noul = adj. "nou" + article. "-l")</p>
<p>example:<br />
Rom: "<b>Noul</b> este superior <i>vechiului</i>".<br />
Eng: "<b>What's new</b> is superior <i>to what's old</i>".</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 13:21, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>It was a mistake, it is an adjective.</p>
<p>As for the sentence, it's pretty much like Romanian: "<i>ÐÐ¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ¾ Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾-Ð´Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ñ ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾</i>" Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ - new, neutr. sing ÑÐ¾ - neutr. art.</p>
<p>Though I must confess the sentence sounds a bit strange in Bulgarian</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a></p>
<hr />
<p>"Bulgarian demonstrates several linguistic <i>innovations</i> that set it apart from other Slavic languages, such as the elimination of noun <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declension.html" title="Declension">declension</a>, the development of a suffixed <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definite_article.html" title="Definite article">definite article</a> (possibly inherited from the Bulgar language), the lack of a verb <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinitive.html" title="Infinitive">infinitive</a>, and the retention and further development of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Slavic_4f8e.html" title="Proto-Slavic">Proto-Slavic</a> verb system. There are various verb forms to express non-witnessed, retold, and doubtful action."</p>
<p>I replaced 'innovations' with developments. The connotation of 'innovation' implies an improvement upon previous circumstances. The word 'development' captures the same denotation without implying improvement. It is important to highlight Bulgarian's unique characteristics in comparison to other languages in the surrounding area (Macedonian, Albanian, Romanian) and in contrast to other languages of the Slavic branch, but this should be done in neutral language. It is no more an innovation of Bulgarian's to move away from synthetic structure than it as an innovation of Estonian's to move toward it (from agglutinative).</p>
<p>Nationalism and linguistics do not go well together. Norwegian and Danish are mutually intelligible and far more dialects than separate languages, but one does not see any hissy-fits over the matter on their wiki articles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>the word 'innovations' is used in this mannar in the lingiustic jargon, meaning something like 'a mutation ie, not borrowed or inherited', and does not try to imply improvement in such context, I believe this was naive jargon use rather than 'nationalism'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's right, there is nothing remotely nationalistic or emotional about the word "innovation" as used in a linguistic sense. It simply means that a grammatical feature was newly created and introduced, and not borrowed from another language or inherited from a parent language. It's an innocent word.</dd>

<p>Yes. Many of those alleged "Turkic" words are in fact from other sources (Romanian, Slavonic, possibly even Thracian, etc.). In fact, one of these lists (if not both) I've looked through before. I was amused to see the attempted derivation of <i>calugar</i> from Turkic. Alexander 007</p>

<p>This article needs to explain that while some Old Church Slavonic texts can be termed Old Bulgarian, others cannot. Cyril and Methodius never set foot in Bulgaria, coming from Thessaloniki. In instructing the Slavs of Moravia they used general Proto-South-Slavonic, and the translations and writings which were created by the Moravian students (such as the Kiev Folia) were too far north to suffer any Bulgarian influence. It is only in the texts first written after the explusion within the Kingdom of Bulgaria that there is any influence from the language of the Bulgarians. Furthermore, this explanation should be done succinctly, as anything too specific would rather go on the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Church_Slavonic_09a4.html" title="Old Church Slavonic">Old Church Slavonic</a> page. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 10:59, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've gone ahead and made a large redaction. I have removed any information which is too pertinent only to Old Church Slavonic. VMORO et al, you are welcome to move those statements to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Church_Slavonic_09a4.html" title="Old Church Slavonic">Old Church Slavonic</a> article and put them into better shape there. Conciseness is to be desired in an encyclopedia article, and if someone wanted to see polemics about OCS, they can look at the OCS article. No use wasting them time of people who are mostly reading about later forms of the language. I have tried to clarify that only the OCS writings made within Bulgarian can be fairly well called "Old Bulgarian", as the manuscripts from the Moravian tradition have no connection to Bulgaria at all, but I might try to polish this more later <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 00:54, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you with the exception of one single thing: The phonological and grammatical peculiarities found in Old Church Slavonic are characteristic only for Bulgarian, what do you mean by terming them vaguely South Slavic? As from the 9th/10th century we can talk about several distinct Slavic nations, and if South Slavic can be deemed an term for the 6th and the 7th century, it is not for the 9th century. I'll see what I can do to shorten the text here tomorrow. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a></dd>

<dd>And I will repeat once again, Cyril and Methodius <b>never</b> set foot in the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Ever. Any "Bulgarian features" which show up in the northern OCS manuscripts can only be due to the fact that they are general South Slavonic features, found at the time among the non-Bulgarian Slavonic community of Thessaloniki. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 03:00, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to spell this out very simply, pay attention. 1) Cyril and Methodius were from Thessaloniki, they never went to Bulgarian. 2) Therefore, their own language cannot be called "Old Bulgarian". 3) The Kiev Folia, the text of which was produced by their Moravian students, contains many of the same linguistic features present in Bulgaria, but was in no way influenced by Bulgarian. 4) Therefore, those linguistics features cannot be called "Bulgarian", for they are not specific to it, but must be <b>generally</b> called South Slavonic. This is what reputable linguistics do. See Schlamstieg, Nandris, Huntley, Schenker, etc. etc. If you disagree with this, you not only disagree with the bulk of comparative Slavonic scholarship (which already suggests you're wrong), but with simple logic. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 03:26, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are "South Slavs". That is what they are called by reputable scholars. They cannot be called Bulgarians because Thessaloniki was outside of the area where the Bulghars, the biggest element of a distinct Bulgarian people back then, settled. Incidentally, Juro is correct. There are comparative linguists who venture that Common Slavonic lasted up to the 13th century.

<p>Kostja, there are three different types of "a" (or may be even many more), a front one, a central one and a back one. In languages which don't differentiate between them, they are just allophones.</p>
<p>For the second, phonetics is a relative science and in different languages, the same vowels/consonants are described in a completely different way. For one reason or another, "a" in Bulgarian is considered a central vowel - probably for the sake of conveniency as it makes pair with "Ñ", which can not be described as anything else but a central vowel. You can check this in any textbook in Modern Bulgarian or any book in Bulgarian phonetics. When I wrote the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_language.html" title="Bulgarian language">Bulgarian language</a> article, I have used primarily a Western textbook which also classified the vowel as central. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 23:19, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the mid vowels (e and o) to be mid-high instead of mid-low, all of the literature I've read about Bulgarian (and I'll admit it's not much) say nothing about the vowels being mid-low. If someone can produce a source that indicates the vowels as mid-low then it'll be appropriate to change it back.<a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 03:27, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am really not concerned about mid-low and mid-high, in a language with lax vowels such as Bulgarian, this is irrelevant. However, you keep changing the vowels <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> to plain e and o and this is incorrect. e and o are much higher (or more closed) than <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> and they don't exist in Bulgarian or in any other Slavic language (may be with the exception of Slovenian). There are several grades of shading between o and u and a and @ (2 in the first pair and 3 in the second one), depending on the position of the vowel with regard to the stressed syllable. And finally, shading between i and e is the norm in most Eastern Bulgarian dialects but it is not ALLOWED in the formal language (for example, not [rika] but only [reka] without any shading). I have used mostly a compilation by Routledge on all Slavic languages - for the sake of English terminology. Otherwise, I draw on the classes in Modern Bulgarian which I've had at the university - I am a linguist. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 21:27, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All right, I guess that works. Since those are the vowels, I'll change the whole article to fit it since the changes that you are holding to make the article inconsistant. I will, however, revert my other changes. The phrase "approaching each other, though without merging completely" doesn't make sense. "Allowed" is a prescriptive term and if it's only for the formal language then that should be in the article. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 21:05, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the paragraph:<i>Most Bulgarian verbs have perfective-imperfective pairs (imperfective&lt;&gt;perfective: Ð¸Ð´Ð²Ð°Ð¼&lt;&gt;Ð´Ð¾Ð¹Ð´Ð° âcomeâ, ÑÑÐ°&lt;&gt;Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ° âstudyâ). Perfective stems are usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation.</i></p>
<p>I don't think pairs of the kind <b>ÑÑÐ°</b>&lt;&gt;<b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> are considered perfective-imperfective pairs anymore. Although <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> is derived from <b>ÑÑÐ°</b> using a prefix, these are considered two separate words with two separate, although close, meanings. The imperfective counterpart of <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> is <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð¼</b>. These two are considered by some to be different forms of the same word. <b>Ð£ÑÐ°</b> is an imerfective verb without perfective counterpart. The prefix <b>Ð½Ð°-</b> adds a sense of completion, but IMHO that is not equivalnt to "perfectiveness". The verb <b>ÑÑÐ°</b> refers to the process of just studying something, while the verb <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> refers to the proces of studiyng and rememberring something in its entirety. The later process may be reffered in both perfective (<b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b>) and imperfective manner(<b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð¼</b>).</p>
<p>It is the same way with other preficess, and much easier to comprehend when the meaning the prefix adds to te word is not completion: from Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ° (to write): <b>Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ° - Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b> (to write down), <b>Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ° - Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b> (to describe), <b>Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ° - Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b> (to sign), etc., I dont see a reason why the pair <b>Ð½Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ° - Ð½Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b> should be treated differently, or as in the example above, <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ° - Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð¼</b>.</p>

<dd>You are partially right but only partially. What is the perfective counterpart of <b>ÑÑÐ°</b> in this case? Non-existent? <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> may be a separate word but with regard to <b>ÑÑÐ°</b>, it is used as the verb's perfective counterpart. <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b> can form a perfective-imperfective pair with <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð¼</b>, as well - I don't see what is so confusing in that... A language is, anyway, a living organism, formal criteria can facilitate its understanding but they are not all-valid. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 08:43, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's better to think of verbs like <b>ÑÑÐ°</b>, <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°</b>, <b>Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð¼</b> or <b>Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°</b>, <b>Ð½Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°</b>, <b>Ð½Ð°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b> as a triad - the first verb is imperfective, the second - perfective and the third - <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_grammar.html#Secondary_imperfective_verbs" title="Bulgarian grammar">secondary imperfective</a>, because in most other non-slavic languages they would be translated by just one verb (for example in English the slight change in meaning which occurs when adding the prefix <b>Ð½Ð°-</b> is unimportant and the last three verbs all mean "to write"). <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a> 15:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can anyone please write something about the spelling reform of 1945? Particularly what interets me is:</p>
<ul>
<li>How were yat and yus pronounced before they were removed?</li>
<li>Was the iotated yus used considered a separate letter? How was it pronounced?</li>
<li>Was the Ðª at the end of the word completely unpronounced in speech by that time? When did disappear from speech?</li>
<li>I saw in an old dctionary that the word for "language" was written ÑÐ·Ð¸ÐºÑ and now it is written ÐµÐ·Ð¸Ðº. What was the rule for replacing Ñ with Ðµ?</li>
<li>What other changes were made?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also the non-linguistic matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the public reaction in Bulgaria?</li>
<li>Who initiated the reform? The Russians or someone else?</li>
<li>Are there today any advocates for going back to the old spelling?</li>

<ul>
<li>The yus was (and still is) pronounced as Ðª in standard Bulgarian, Ð¼ÑÐºÐ° (variations Ñ, Ð¼ÑÐºÐ° in the Torlak dialects, a, Ð¼Ð°ÐºÐ° in the Macedonian dialects and o, Ð¼Ð¾ÐºÐ° in the Rodopian dialects.</li>
<li>There was a rul that the yat should be pronounced the way it's written now but it was never concidered obligatory - the tsar for example and a lot of the MPs followed strictly the western pronunciation - Ð±ÐµÐ» - Ð±ÐµÐ»Ð¸, and not as the rule says Ð±ÑÐ» - Ð±ÐµÐ»Ð¸.</li>
<li>The iotated yus was concidered a separate letter but was removed by Marin Drinov in his reform in the 1880s.</li>
<li>The final Ðª lost its pronunciation in the 15th century.</li>
<li>Ð¯Ð·Ð¸ÐºÑ is a russism, the norm was ÐµÐ·Ð¸ÐºÑ, now ÐµÐ·Ð¸Ðº.</li>
<li>The reform was generally accepted cause it was seen as necessary but a lot of speakers of western dialects and especially the Macedonians from Pirin Macedonian and the diaspora wanted to keep the yat as a unifing letter although not on its ethimological place but only when the western and eastern prounuciantion differ. But there wasn't really any room for public debate in 1945.</li>
<li>The reform was purely Bulgarian deed.</li>
<li>There are some right wing cultural and political organisation (like VMRO-BND) which advocate reintroduction only of the yat. Miko Stavrev.</li>

<p>To my consideration the deffinite article suffix is not used in that way! The article ending depends on what the word ending. You have "bashta" (father), which is a noun in masculine gender, but the definite form is "bashta<b>ta</b>( the father). "Dyado" (grandfather), again in masculine gender has a defenite form of "dyado<b>to</b>, etc. As I am no linguist please consult the Petar Pashov book "Prakticheska balgarska gramatica" (Practical Bulgarian Grammar).</p>

<p>The IPA handbook has been removed from the reference section twice now, along with reverts of the very useful and illustrative vowel chart and kwami's corrections concerning some of the fricatives. I really don't understand the point of removing the only source the article has in favor of innacurate information as well as the information attached to it.</p>

<dd>Oh man, I didn't even see that reference at the bottom. I apologize. Kwami's corrections are correct as far as the Bulgarian postalveolars not being Russian, but considering that most readers of the page will be unfamiliar with the minute details of Russian phonetics and the Russian phonemes chart has a different symbol for its postalveolar sound anyway, it seems unnecessary, especially in a table. I also think that since the page that is linked to is called "postalveolar" and the official IPA chart labels those sounds postalveolar that it's best to keep it simple and call these sounds "postalveolar" here as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both Russian and Bulgarian postalveolars are often transcribed with the same symbols. There have been some recent reversions on the Russian article to Ê and Ê, just like Bulgarian. Also, a lot of people coming to the various Slavic language articles will have some knowledge of Russian, and might think that Bulgarian has been similarly mistranscribed. Combine the two, and a heads-up might prove worthwhile. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 05:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, an illistrative vowel chart is very useful. My understanding of how the vowel charts work is that you don't put allophones on it. I suppose we could alter the image and put the allophonic vowels in parenthesis. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 01:50, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Usually it's limited to phonemes, but in this case there's obviously not a problem since there are so few phonetic vowels to deal with. The chart is also explained quite clearly in the paragraph right below it. And no matter what, removing a perfectly correct chart altogether is the least constructive solution.</dd>

<p>Look: I don't care where you took this chart from, remember well: <b>Bulgarian has six vowels</b>, <b>SIX</b>, <b>SIX</b>, <b>SIX</b> and <b>NOT</b> eight. There are four other allophones (two between a and @ and two between o and u), which appear in unstressed syllables depending on the position of the unstressed syllable to the stressed syllable within a certain word. If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is <b>why</b> you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?</p>
<p>Then we get to another reasonable question: <b>why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions?</b> Ha?</p>
<p>So: you post a chart which is <b>WRONG</b> and then you erase a section which is <b>RIGHT</b>. What the hell are you doing? I am getting tired of non-experts who read something somewhere and then come and try to wreak havoc on articles which they understand <b>nothing</b> about. A couple of months ago, one user was trying to change the article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> because he had read that the Bulgarians were descendants of the Shumers. In two words, your edit is pretty much of the same value and worth. For the phonetics section here, I've used the Routledge compendium on Slavic languages (1991) and the newest Bulgarian edition of New Bulgarian - phonetics, grammar and syntax.

<p>Just an outsider's 2 cents: I noticed there was a bout of reverting here about a sentence dealing with Turkish/Ottoman, which was in danger of being drawn into an apparently ongoing edit war. I'm not going to comment on the behaviour of the parties involved, but I'd like to point out that I find this addition by User:81.213.83.14 somewhat unfortunate: "the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish language</a>, which was the official language of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_empire.html" title="Ottoman empire">Ottoman empire</a> along with <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_language.html" title="Ottoman language">Ottoman language</a> (which was a version of Turkish)." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bulgarian_language&amp;diff=33365636&amp;oldid=33340246" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bulgarian_language&amp;diff=33365636&amp;oldid=33340246" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> It may be useful in some contexts to distinguish (modern) Turkish proper from Ottoman, but it seems to make little sense to treat the two as if they had been two separate, contemporary forms side by side with each other.

<p>I am hereby placing the vowel chart on the talk page until it is brought into conformity with the <b>actual state</b> of affairs in the Bulgarian language: <a href="../../../b/u/l/Image%7EBulgarian_vowel_chart.png_ef90.html" class="image" title="Standard Bulgarian vowels"><img src="../../../upload/shared/7/7d/Bulgarian_vowel_chart.png" alt="Standard Bulgarian vowels" width="279" height="196" longdesc="../../../b/u/l/Image%7EBulgarian_vowel_chart.png_ef90.html" /></a></p>

<dd>The chart has been taken from the Bulgarian section of the IPA handbook which has been compiled by Elmar Ternes and Tatjana Vladimirova-Buhtz and I've pointed out many times that <b>all the vowels are not meant to indicate phonemes</b> and I've made this very clear in the article as well. The chart was made by <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKarma_ddee.html" title="User:IceKarma">IceKarma</a> based on photos of the vowel charts in the handbook taken by me, since I was the one who asked him to do it.</dd>
<dd>As for the analysis of 6 phonemes with 4 allophones, which VMORO is insisting on, this is exactly what the info in the handbook says, <b>except that that the allophones of two of the phoneme pairs are identical</b>. This is pretty much the same as what the current info says, except that the current info is a lot more vague.</dd>
<dd>The symbols used are really a matter of finer detail on the part of the vowel chart makers. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> is quite close to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É¤]</span> and choosing the latter symbol is much more sensible, since it is a near-back vowel. The same goes for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span>, which is also very close to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span>. Using <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwa.html" title="Schwa">schwa</a> for both <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É¤]</span> would be to over-simplify an already quite uncomplicated vowel system.</dd>

<dd>No, it wouldn't be to over-simplify it, cause it's really that simple! Like <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a>, I am a native speaker of Bulgarian. We speak Bulgarian and we know what vowels we pronounce, when we speak. I myself might not be a philologist, but I am very interested in linguistics and, especially, phonetics and I also believe I am a well educated person, who speaks correct Bulgarian (I've been working as a journalist). Considering all this, you shoul not only believe <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a>, but me too, when we tell you that <b>there are 6 vowels in Bulgarian</b>, that is all. It's a nice and simple vowel system, which I am proud of, unlike the awfully complex vowel systems of all <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_languages.html" title="Germanic languages">Germanic languages</a>.</dd>

<dd>Please, don't take that as a personal insult, especially since its not your fault what your language sounds like and you haven't chosen it :) I just don't like it that you people up there North have so many freaking vowels, large groups of which sound like mere variations of one vowel, which we have to twist our mouths and make strange faces in order to pronounce correctly :) (Note that I'm not saying they are not separate vowels, cause I for one know they are, I'm just saying that, to an average Bulgarian, they sound the same). It's all a real mess for any Bulgarian (likewise an Italian or Spaniard, I guess), who tries to learn English, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, etc. But what is worse is that for speakers of those Germanic languages, who don't know linguistics and phonetics, it's equally hard to comprehend the simplicity of our nice 6 vowels, so it always an agony to try and explain to them the pronunciation of even one simple Bulgarian word. I've also had frustrating arguments with friends of mine from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, who don't believe me, when I tell them their "e" (as in "pet") sounds similar to the "i" (as in "pit") of other English speakers - so, in their NZ accent, the word "pet" e.g. sounds like "pit". They claim it's completely different, believe it or not! This is because they have so many forms of "i", perceived as separate vowels, that they can't comprehend that for us it all sounds like "i", cause we only have one form of it. Of course, all I've said in this paragraph is just my personal opinion - other people may like the diversity of the Germanic phonetic systems more than the simplicity of the ones of Bulgarian, Italian, etc. :)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I digress. The main thing I wanted to say was: please, leave our language alone and don't confuse readers with vowel charts like that one. We don't need such "finer detail on the part of the vowel chart makers", when we don't actually have that detail in the language. There is no need for 2 or 3 symbols for just one vowel, which can simply be represented with the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwa.html" title="Schwa">schwa</a> - it's the closed one of the central pair of vowels, the "a" being the open one. It was also awfully hard for me to explain to those same NZ friends of mine how that vowel is pronounced in Bulgarian, which is amazing, considering how often it occurs (though apparently in variations) in English. I would have expected that from native speakers of Italian, Spanish or Russian, where they don't even have that vowel, but I didn't expect it from native English speakers :( The problem is for them there seem to be several different <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> sounds in English and they are all different from the Bulgarian one. For me they all sound similar to it. Don't get me wrong - I don't deny the existence of the numerous vowels in Germanic languages - I'm just happy we only have six and I don't have to moo like a cow etc., when I speak my language :P And I believe it should be represented in the article exactly that way - i.e. I support keeping the current version of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_language.html#Vowels" title="Bulgarian language">the disputed section</a> or revising the vowel chart before putting it back in there. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../../bg/c/h/r/User%7EChristomir_7d4d.html" class="extiw" title="bg:User:Christomir">Christomir</a></dd>

<p>Christomir: Your conversation with your NZ friends is typical for laypeople. An important concept in linguistic is that of a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoneme.html" title="Phoneme">phoneme</a>. This is what should be depicted in a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonology.html" title="Phonology">phonology</a> chart. The vowels in &lt;pit&gt; and &lt;pet&gt; are different <i>phonemes</i> in English (see <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_phonology.html" title="English phonology">English phonology</a>. The distinction between phonemes is often difficult for a non-native speaker. On the other hand, there are variations in the pronunciation of phonemes according to the context (called <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophones.html" title="Allophones">allophones</a>). These variations are mostly done unconsciously and therefore are not perceived by a native speaker, but they are noticed by non-native speakers. The actual pronunciation of phonemes is the subject of the discipline of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonetics.html" title="Phonetics">phonetics</a>. I do not speak or understand Bulgarian, but it appears to me that there are indeed six vowel phonemes in Bulgarian. These phonemes may differ in pronunciation, depending on if they occur in stressed or unstressed position, and on regional variations (see: <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Accent (linguistics)">Accent (linguistics)</a>). A vowel chart as the one at the top of this section cannot accurately represent the phonemes, because each entry consists of an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> symbol and therefore a specific pronunciation. A better choice would be to have a table with the six phonemes, showing their "standard" pronunciation in stressed and unstressed position. (By "standard" I mean how an educated person would speak in a neutral context, such as a news show in TV). However, because native speakers untrained in linguistic usually do not hear the difference of variants in pronunciation of a phoneme, it is important to consult scientific sources about Bulgarian phonetics. This is mandatory according to Wikipedia guidelines: judging from your own experience as a native speaker would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and is not permissible. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:ÎÎ½Î´ÏÎ­Î±Ï">Andreas</a> 15:51, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said I thought the vowels in <i>pit</i> and <i>pet</i> in New Zealand English <b>are</b> the same, because I realize that (even in that) they are different phonemes. (In other forms of English they are completely different and almost the same as the Bulgarian "i" and "e".) I just said they sounded similar for us Bulgarians and the New Zealand "e" sounded almost the same as the "i" of non-New Zealand English. But my friend claimed they were completely different, which you have to admit they are not (though I don't know if you people have ever listened to a Kiwi speaking :P). She also claimed that all the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span>'s in English were different, e.g. the vowel in <i>fur</i> was completely different from the one in <i>stol<b>e</b>n</i>. In that case I'm not sure if English phonetics says they are different phonemes or not, but I'm sure for a Bulgarian they sound exactly the same, only one is stressed and the other is not. But, anyway, the subject here is the vowels in Bulgarian, rather than those in English. With all I've been saying I just wanted to show how complicated the vowel system of some languages is and how simple the one of Bulgarian is in comparison. And I'm glad it is :) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../../bg/c/h/r/User%7EChristomir_7d4d.html" class="extiw" title="bg:User:Christomir">Christomir</a></dd>

<dd>I don't think that Christomir was providing original research, he was backing up other sources. To my knowledge, I haven't seen any vowel charts that put in unstressed allophones the way the Bulgarian chart has. This vowel chart for <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amharic.html" title="Amharic">Amharic</a> does, but indicates the allophones the way I mentioned before, with parenthesese. I contacted IceKarma but he doesn't seem to be responding and I don't know how to upload pictures. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 18:16, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bulgarian has <b>six</b> vowel phonemes. No has questioned this even once, but I'm glad we've cleared it up once and for all.</dd>
<dd>There is a problem here, though. There is no such thing as "standard pronunciation" of any IPA vowel. IPA symbols technically represent <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_vowels.html" title="Cardinal vowels">cardinal vowels</a>, which are theoretical entities. There are languages that have vowel position which match the theoretical cardinal positions almost exactly, but these are mostly exceptions. Using typed characters for symbols is very ambiguous, and much more prone to dispute, since any vowel that happens to be between two cardinal positions could very well be argued to be either symbol. For example, [u] and [o] or [y] and [Ã¸], or in this case <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É¤]</span>. Both could very well be interpreted as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span>, which is entirely unsatisfactory. For this reason a table is actually a rather poor alternative to a chart, and for other reasons as well. Displaying IPA as text is not possible on all computers. A vowel chart in the form of an image solves this problem universally and provides some reference when comparing to other languages. I'd also like to point out that the vowel chart depicts an educated form from of Standard Bulgarian, not some exotic rural dialect.</dd>
<dd>As for the issue of native speakers having some sort of last say over "their own" language article, I can only echo Andreas comments and point out that being a native speaker doesn't qualify you in the least to be a competent analyst of your own language. Native speaker input is always welcome and will often lead to great articles, but under no circumstances does it trump the contributions of non-natives.</dd>
<dd>Since I have consulted the source on Bulgarian phonology provided by VMORO without finding anything that actually contradicts the vowel chart I will reinsert the chart in the article with the appropriate comments. If anyone feels like removing it again, please accompany the removal with a detailed explanation as to why you feel it is wrong (the focus should be on "why" not "it is wrong") and why you feel entitled to reject the IPA handbook as a reliable source; i.e. violate <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I'm going to stress the importance of <i>factual argumentation</i>, because merely expressing an <i>editorial opinion</i> about the accuracy of a phonological fact is no more relevant than expressing an opinion about the density of chlorine or the coronation of Queen Victoria.</dd>
<dd>And please just drop the parenthasis quibble for now. I'm sure it'll be a great vowel chart once we get them in there, but removing it just because of a subjective triviality is <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/don%27t_be_a_dick" class="extiw" title="m:don't_be_a_dick">pedantic beyond reason</a>.</dd>

<p>We have still to decide which IPA symbol to use for the schwa. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:ÎÎ½Î´ÏÎ­Î±Ï">Andreas</a> 03:50, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd suggest going with whatever the conventional literature says.

<dd>I can't find any discrepancy worth mentioning. <i>The Slavonic Languages</i> uses /a/ for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span> and /Ä/ for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/É¤/</span> respectively. I didn't have time to read the entire chapter on Bulgarian vowels, so I don't know if it's the source of the schwa. Whatever it is, I feel that using <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[É]</span> for the mid-central allophone is much more accurate.</dd>

<dd>Hey, I don't speak any "exotic rural dialect"!! I know very well how literary Bulgarian is spoken correctly - I am a journalist, soon to be a TV reporter and, hopefully one day, a TV presenter. I was very good at Bulgarian lessons in school and I can tell you they only teach six vowels. I am also sure they only teach six vowels in Bulgarian Philology at university too, although I've never studied it (you can ask <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> about that one, I think I saw him saying somewhere that he was a philologist). So who do you think knows Bulgarian better - our scientists or some foreign ones? Have you ever thought that IPA are mere people, not gods and, as such, they are not faultless, so it's possible they might have made a mistake for once? Expressing an opinion about this issue is completely different from expressing an opinion about the density of chlorine or the coronation of Queen Victoria, since those fact are much more popular and widely studied that the issue in subject. Also, the fact that you didn't find anything that actually contradicts the vowel chart in that source on Bulgarian phonology doesn't necessarily mean it isn't there, it only means <b>you</b> weren't able to find it :) Also, I don't believe than any one of us was being a dick, but you might just be one for implying that ;) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../../bg/c/h/r/User%7EChristomir_7d4d.html" class="extiw" title="bg:User:Christomir">Christomir</a></dd>

<dd>If there is any evidence of contradiction in the sources, you're welcome to point it out. Otherwise, I find it ironic that you praise "your" scientists compared to "some foreign ones", because the source presented by me (the IPA handbook) was written by two Bulgarians while the source presented by VMORO (<i>The Slavonic languages</i>) seems to have been written by a native English-speaker. Not that this actually matters, though, since a trained phonetician can be adept at analyzing almost any language. Of course it helps to be a native speaker, but only with the proper education and training.</dd>

There's simply no need for it because native speakers know how to speak their language properly anyway and have it internalized without having to be taught things like phonetics theoretically. Things like orthography and diction are what's focused on. (Illiterate people can speak a language fluently without a single day of schooling.) But ask any average student of any country about the finer points of the phonology of their own language and I can tell you that most of them will get most of it wrong. They'll pronounce it perfectly, but won't be able to explain most of it on a theoretical level. So, naturally, this is by no means unique to Bulgaria.</dd>

<p>Excuse me. I'm a native speaker and to me this vowel chart seems wrong. I can't really say how many allophones any of the vowels has but what I disagree with is that the phoneme for the "Ð°" sound is shown as more front than the phoneme for the "Ñ" sound. However, they actually stand on the same line regarding frontness/backness - the position of the tongue regarding frontness/backness is the same, just the "Ð°" is more open. In fact, the vowel chart which has been provided for Amharic represents much better the relation of the two vowels in Bulgarian - as there they are on the same frontness/backness line! How can I prove it? Well... First of all, I have observed it while pronouncing the two vowels - but I realize that no one can check that. I also have a book - "Modern Bulgarian Language", which says that the place of articulation of "Ð°" and "Ñ" is the same. But it looks like it has not been put online so I can't show it to you as evidence... Still, I hope you'll consider what I have written!</p>
<dl>

<dd>Well the chart has been made from an actual speaker. Every language has its dialects.

<dd>Anonymous user, if you read the discussions about vowels that have been going on on this talkpage, you'll find all the answers to your questions. If you have a source that claims that two vowels that are considered separate phonemes have the same place of articulation, then you've either misread your source or it's quite obviously incorrect, since all other sources are in agreement on this. Quite a few have been cited so far.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your answers. However, I'm afraid I don't see why two vowels that are considered separate phonemes can't have the same place of articulation. For example, "o" and "u" - their place of articulation is the same, the only difference is that "o" is more open than "u". Maybe it will be best if I try to translate the part of the Phonetics section from the "Modern Bulgarian Language" which deals with the opposition between "Ð°" and "Ñ". Here it is:</dd>

<dd>"According to the width of the passage between the most raised part of the tongue and the palate the vowels are divided into narrow and wide. During the articulation of the wide vowels (Ðµ, Ð°, Ð¾) the space between the tongue and the palate is wide while during the articulation of the narrow (Ð¸, Ñ, Ñ) the passage is narrower.</dd>
<dd>To each wide vowel corresponds one narrow, WHICH HAS THE SAME PLACE OF ARTICULATION but with a lower position of the tongue: (Ðµ-Ð¸, Ð°-Ñ, Ð¾-Ñ)."</dd>

<dd>I must admit there is a mistake in this text - the narrow vowels should have a "higher" and not a "lower" position of the tongue but I'm sure this is a case of oversight. Furthermore, later in the book an articulation chart of the vowels is given and there the narrow vowels are represented as higher than the wide ones. But what I wanted to show is that according to "Modern Bulgarian Language" the vowels "Ð°" and "Ñ" have the same place of articulation, the only difference is that "Ð°" is more open than "Ñ". This, combined with the fact that I notice the same when I pronounce "Ð°" and "Ñ" (from "Ð°" I just raise my lower jaw to produce "Ñ"; I don't move the tongue backwards) makes me come to the conclusion that in Bulgarian "Ñ" is not a more back vowel than "Ð°" - instead, they are at the same place according to frontness/backness. That's why I think the vowel chart in the "Bulgarian language" article is wrong.</dd>
<dd>About the dialects - I know that some Bulgarian dialects reduce "Ðµ" to "Ð¸" but I haven't heard of dialectal variation of the frontness/backness of "Ñ"... But even if there are some people who pronounce "Ñ" a little more back than "Ð°", what is most important is that for Bulgarian speakers the DEFINING feature of "Ñ" is that it is the closed counterpart of "Ð°". That's what Bulgarians are taught at school from an early age. And since in the Bulgarian speakers' conscience "Ñ" is the closed counterpart of "Ð°", it would be logical that they would pronounce the two vowels at one and the same place (regarding frontness/backness)... or at least very close to each other. And I think that should be represented in the vowel chart.</dd>

<p>It's strange that Tilkov and Boyadzhiev have used the term "place of articulation" to refer to the frontness/backness continuum, but NOT to vowel height. It doesn't make much sense to me. Furthermore, when we studied linguistics, the distinction "place of articulation" vs "active organ of articulation" wasn't used for vowels at all, it was only for consonants. That is confirmed by the present articles on "place of articulation" and "vowel" in Wikipedia, as well as by my textbook in linguistics from 1965.</p>
<p>I must admit that I, too, have problems imagining "a" being THAT front. But the fact that we native speakers aren't conscious of that doesn't mean that it isn't true: we don't learn our Bulgarian phonetics at school. Look, if you find another vowel chart for Bulgarian, and one that comes from a source as authoritative as the present one, then replacing the present chart might become an option. --85.187.44.128 14:17, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have skimmed the more recent edits and recommend that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter and especially VMORO start taking each other's knowledge and insights more seriously, which should enable them to reach consensus on <b>more complex issues</b> like the vowel chart dispute. Reread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. If you can't reach consensus -- take a break, as Lukas said.</li>
<li><b>simple differences of opinion</b> about usage (with references for both points of view) be left for other editors to decide. Especially where both proposed terms are generic words as opposed to linguistic terminology. Take a break.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I may suggest some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A possible consensus on the vowel chart issue -- is it feasible to put both approaches in, possibly indicating (based on references to reputable sources) their relative importance, various uses, etc.?</li>
<li>A distinction can sometimes be made between two versions of the same language: the "cultural language" and the "spoken language" (colloquial language/vernacular). Perhaps this helps you resolve the Ottoman vs. Turkish problem. I think the current wording (I'm not sure if it already reflects a consensus) needs to be improved.</li>
<li>When two terms are proposed for the same concept, it can be helpful if both terms are given, one of them in parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I will give some examples by editing the article myself (feel free to revert if you don't agree). But even when you have reached a version everyone agrees on, you shouldn't be surprised when someone else comes along and edits it into something you wish you had written but didn't think of. I am not commenting on any <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, etc. issues since this is an Article RfC, not a User Conduct RfC. By the way, is the Terminology Quibbles section a response to the RfC? If so, you may want to move it into the RfC Comments section.

<dd>The Turkish/Ottoman thang is not my quibble. I'm simply trying to include info on phonology I believe is relevant and to copyedit the article into good, reasonably uncomplicated English.

<p><i>Bulgarian is a language which, like a number of Slavic languages,</i> disprefers unstressed mid vowels. The degree to which unstressed mid vowels are disliked varies from dialect to dialect, as do the strategies used to avoid them. In most dialects of Bulgarian (including the standard dialect), unstressed mid vowels are raised: o become u, and e becomes i. <i><a href="http://www.ling.rochester.edu/people/cross/trigrad.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.rochester.edu/people/cross/trigrad.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></i></p>

<p><i>Results of a spectral analysis of vowel reduction in Bulgarian (N = 2 educated male speakers of the Sofia dialect) &amp; model experiments that test these results are reported. The hypothesis was that reduction of Bulgarian open vowels is related to neutralization of mandibular depression, weakening or elimination of lingual &amp; labial compensation for mandibular errors, &amp; weakening of pharyngeal narrowing: models were developed to match spectral regression for pharyngeal /a/, palatal /e/, &amp; pharyngovelar /o/. The experiments indicate that reduction is gradual rather than discrete, suggesting that an underlying articulatory plan for a complete rendering is executed with varying degrees of attention, depending on which components are neutralized &amp; how far. The articulatory behavior modeled in the experiments successfully reproduced the observed spectral reduction. Results demonstrate that the reduction of Bulgarian /e, a, o/ in unstressed syllables can be explained in terms of partial or complete neutralization of mandibular depression, lip spreading or rounding, pharyngeal activity, &amp; compensation.</i> <a href="http://lu-research.lub.lu.se/php/gateway.php?who=lr&amp;method=getfile&amp;file=archive/00019664/" class="external autonumber" title="http://lu-research.lub.lu.se/php/gateway.php?who=lr&amp;method=getfile&amp;file=archive/00019664/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

<p>Recall from section 2.3.2.1. that other languages, such as Bulgarian, show a slightly different pattern of vowel distribution in strong vs. weak syllables. Like Dutch, Bulgarian shows the full range of vowel contrasts in stressed syllables, but in unstressed syllables vowels do not reduce to schwa, but to a subset of the vowels in Bulgarian. Pettersson &amp; Wood (1987:266) claim that the vowels in Bulgarian have the following distribution in stressed vs. unstressed positions: (54)</p>

<p>The difference in vowel distribution in stressed vs. unstressed syllables is accounted for by referring to the licensing relations that hold between these positions (Harris 1997). Prosodic words are typically subdivided into feet, and a foot typically contains two syllables, a strong and a weak one. The strong, or stressed, syllable licenses the weak, or unstressed, syllable in a foot. This dependency relation suggests that restrictions are imposed on the unstressed nucleus by the stressed nucleus. In Bulgarian this is evidenced by the fact that the unstressed nucleus has to contain a vowel that consists of a subset of the elements that makes up the corresponding vowel in stressed position. <a href="http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/000507/bookpart.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/000507/bookpart.pdf" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/000573/bookpart.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/000573/bookpart.pdf" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:ÎÎ½Î´ÏÎ­Î±Ï">Andreas</a> 19:36, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm surprised that no one has discussed the quality of the Bulgarian Ð». Everyone seems content to assign it only one phonetic representation: /l/. Having done only a little work with one native speaker, I have already found that the pronunciation of this letter ranges from /l/ to /w/ to /o/. I have yet to determine exactly what conditions the different pronunciations, and I am no dialectologist or expert in Bulgarian. I am interested to hear what others, more experienced than I, have to say.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article should limit itself to the standard language, which has only /l/. The pronunciation of /w/ in syllable-final position (e.g /mawko/ "small") is typical of Sofia, although it can be heard from young people even in the southeast. The change of /l/ to a vowel or semivowel under many circumstances is common, it already happened in Serbian and in Polish, but in Bulgarian it remains a dialectal feature. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 23:36, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd rather call it a sociolectal feature. It is typical of young people, also if they are educated; I think it's almost fashionable. And as Crculver said, it's quickly spreading to young people in the rest of the country. It wasn't characteristic of Sofia either before the 1970's, when it was first registered in youngsters, according to my lecturer in Bulgarian. So it's more a matter of generation, and like any popular trend, it starts in the capital. It could be mentioned in the article, since it already mentions a lot of widespread provincial features (reduction of e to i and alophonic palatalization of consonants before e and i, to name but a few). Besides, it could be a useful piece of information for people trying to understand spoken Bulgarian. As for what conditions the different pronunciations, the answer is simple - it's a variant of the so-called hard /l/, which means the /l/ that is used in all other positions except before /e/ and /i/. I just added it in the article, but I don't know if it's an approximant or a semivowel. I don't have litterature about it right now, and it is too recent a development to be mentioned in standard conservative handbooks. If someone has info - help! --85.187.203.123 22:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a native Bulgarian speaker and not as a specialist, I have these impressions: The transformation of /l/ into /w/ is not a matter of fashion, but of dialect. I have amused myself with a native speaker from Vakarel - some 50 km east of Sofia, who was a trader in chemical products, how he tried to explain to a business partner on the phone that he didn't have polyethylene in his store, byt polypropylene. The other person was very slow in catching the subtle phonetic differences. Second case: some years ago a friend of mine went deliberately everyday to a restaurant, just to listen to one of the waiters how he recited the menu, especially "Ð¿Ð¸Ð»Ðµ ÑÑÑ Ð·ÐµÐ»Ðµ". Third case: I have a schoolmate from the village of Benkovski - just on the northern outskirts of Sofia, who didn't use /l/ at all (using /w/ instead) so he was a great subject of mockery at school and we kept joking with him saying "Ð½Ðµ Ðµ Ð»ÐµÑÐ½Ð¾". I have another schoolmate whose parens come from the southern side of the Vitosha mountain - he also sometimes misses the /l/. And the youngster fashion came as a form of a mockery over country people that have just arrived from somewhere around Sofia as far as Samokov into the city and is considered a bit low status and certainly funny. There was even a comic hit song Skakauec (meaning - Skakalec - grasshopper), that its lyrics were just had collected examples of this phenomenon. And about the slang - the general trend seems to me to be making all words one syllable - it remids me of French, for example "ÐÐ°ÐºÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐµ Ð¿ÑÐ°Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÑÐ°Ð·Ð¸ Ð²ÐµÑÐµÑ?" --&gt;&gt; ÐÐ¾'Ñ Ð¿ÑÐ°Ð¹Ñ ÑÐ°'Ð²ÐµÑÑ? --<a href="../../../k/o/m/User%7EKomitata_6bf7.html" title="User:Komitata">Komitata</a> 23:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess you have a point there, but I think we're talking about two slightly different things. Saying "w" in "powietiwen" "Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐµ ÑÑÑ Ð·ÐµÑÐµ", "Ð½Ðµ Ðµ ÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¾" "ÑÐºÐ°ÐºÐ°ÑÐµÑ", "ÐºÐ¾Ð¿ÐµÑÐµ" is funny and dialectal, and it doesn't occur very frequently either, so whenever a normal educated or Sofian youth pronounces it, it's just for fun, a mockery. The reason is that these words normally have the "soft" l. Now what teenagers normally pronounce as "w", without even noticing it, is the "hard" ("thick", "dark") l, as in "Ð¼Ð°ÑÐºÐ¾", "ÑÐ¾Ð´ÐºÐ°" Ð¸ "ÑÐ¸ ÑÑÐ´ Ð»Ð¸ ÑÐ¸ Ð±Ðµ?"? I'm not sure how the "Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐµ ÑÑÑ Ð·ÐµÐ»Ðµ" type came to being. I haven't dealt with Bg. dialectology of late, but I'd be very surprised if I heard it from an old peasant. I guess the thing is that the original western dialects have ONLY the THICK "l", not only in "malko" as in the standard language, but also in "pile", as I still hear it occasionally in the low-status speech in Sofia. Next, when the youth trend is superimposed on this, the youngsters from these villages start pronouncing not only "mawko", but also "piwe". Nobody would laugh at "mawko", it sounds pretty much like "malko" with thick "l", but "piwe" is hillarious, because it's so different from a "pile" with thin "l". Personally, as a 23 yr old Bulgarian, I would always say "mawko" in a colloquial context, but I wouldn't even dream of saying "piwe" instead of "pile". And I'm sure I'd be laughed at if I did. --85.187.203.123 10:38, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
OK, let's put some order here shall we?</p>
<ol>
<li>/w/ for /l/ *when not before front vowels* is neither fashionable, neither typical only for Sofia or any other specific geographical region. You can hear it from people born in the 1970s and after from all over Bulgaria: Sofia, Sliven, Burgas etc.</li>
<li>/w/ for &lt;Ð»&gt; in all positions is indeed dialectal and found in the Sofia region, to be more precise in what's commonly known as the Ð¨Ð¾Ð¿Ð»ÑÐº.</li>
<li>Number 1. is a separate development and hardly influenced by #2.</li>
<li>It's hardly a surprise that the said development was first reported in Sofia. I really doubt there's been much of 'field work' of sociolects throught Bulgaria back in the 1970s.</li>
<li>Under 'Hard and palatalized consonants' it states that 'The latter pre-front realization is traditionally (and incorrectly) called "soft l"', it's first time ever I hear that /l/ before front vowels is called 'soft', whenever 'soft' is used to refer to consonats it's ONLY to denote a palatalized consonat!</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is this just how you see the things or do you have any sources? I'm asking you this because I'm not sure whether you know the difference between a new development and a voice disorder (or Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¾Ð¿ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ñ in Bulgarian) and you might be confused. For example my brother, who is not from Sofia, has an awful voice disorder: he can't pronounce Ð» at all (the words <b>ÑÑÐ°</b> and <b>ÑÐ»ÑÑÐ°</b> are indistinguishable), has problems with consonant clusters (inserts vowels <b>ÐºÑÐ¼ÐµÑ</b>; <b>Ð·ÐµÐ¼Ñ</b> <b>Ð·Ð¼Ð¸Ñ</b> are pronounced the same way), and many others. So are you sure that the people you mention from Sliven and Burgas don't have similar problems, because people form Sofia can pronounce Ð»Ð°, Ð»Ð¾, Ð»Ñ, but don't use them in everyday speech. The case is the same with <b>Ñ</b>. Many people form all over Bulgaria pronounce it like French r. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a> 18:26, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the article is written that there are six participles in Bulgarian: <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ñ</u>, <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ð½</u>, <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð»</u>, <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ð»</u>, <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ñ</u>, <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ð¹ÐºÐ¸</u>. Then what participle is <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ»</u>? In the sentence <u>ÐÐºÐ¾ ÑÐ¾Ð¹ ÑÐµ ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ», Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ð½ÑÐ¼Ð°Ð»Ð¾ Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ðµ Ð´Ð° Ð³Ð¾ Ð½Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑÐ¸</u> it can be replaced by none of the others, without changing the meaning. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a></p>
<p><br />
It isn't a participle, it's a verb in the renarrative mood, (which is, in Bulgarian, either derived from or <i>morphologically</i> - identical to the participle). You can see that it's a verb if you transform the sentence into the indicative mood: then would be either <u>ÐÐºÐ¾ ÑÐ¾Ð¹ ÑÐµ ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ðµ, Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ð½ÑÐ¼Ð° Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ðµ Ð´Ð° Ð³Ð¾ Ð½Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑÐ¸</u> or <u>Ð°ÐºÐ¾ ÑÐ¾Ð¹ ÑÐµ ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÑÐµ, Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ð½ÑÐ¼Ð°ÑÐµ Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ðµ Ð´Ð° Ð³Ð¾ Ð½Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑÐ¸</u>. It's obvious that <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ðµ</u> and <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÑÐµ</u> aren't participles. Now if ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ» was a participle, it would be used like an adjective: ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½ *<u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ» ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº</u>, *<u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÑ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº</u>, just like <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº</u> or, say, <u>Ð¸Ð·ÐºÐ°Ð·Ð°Ð»Ð¸ÑÑ ÑÐµ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº</u> (<u>ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº, ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ñ/ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ð» Ð¿ÑÐµÑÑÑÐ¿Ð½Ð¸ÑÐ¸, ÑÐµ Ð½Ð°ÐºÐ°Ð·Ð²Ð° ÑÐ¿Ð¾ÑÐµÐ´ Ð·Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð½Ð°</u>; Ð½Ð¾ Ð½Ðµ Ð¸ <u>ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÐº, *ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ» Ð¿ÑÐµÑÑÑÐ¿Ð½Ð¸ÑÐ¸</u>). --85.187.203.123 22:15, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If it is a verb, isn't it in the subjunctive mood as well as in the renarrative. I know that the form <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÑÐµ</u> is a perfective verb in the past imperfective tense (Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð» Ð² Ð¼Ð¸Ð½Ð°Ð»Ð¾ Ð½ÐµÑÐ²ÑÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¾ Ð²ÑÐµÐ¼Ðµ, ÑÐ²ÑÑÑÐµÐ½ Ð²Ð¸Ð´) and the form <u>ÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐµÐ»</u> is the same but in the renarrative mood. But in the modern Bulgarian language haven't these forms (simultaneously preserving their original meaning) begun to play the role of a subjunctive mood? There might be several reasons for this. Firstly, in the sentence <u>Ð§Ð°Ðº ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´ ÐºÐ°ÑÐ¾ ÑÐ¿ÐµÑÐµÐ»ÐµÑ Ð¼Ð°ÑÐ°, ÑÑÑ Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð³Ð° Ð´Ð° ÑÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°</u> the action, denoted by <b>ÑÐ¿ÐµÑÐµÐ»ÐµÑ</b>, is complete but also unreal (I'm talking about the past, and at that point in the past the action hadn't happened yet, I hadn't won the match yet, but after I won it, I would be able to rest). Secondly, I've heard many people wrongly say <u>Ð°ÐºÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ, ÑÑÑ Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð³Ð° Ð´Ð° Ð»ÐµÐºÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ°</u>, instead of saying <u>Ð°ÐºÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐµÑ Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ, ÑÑÑ Ð´Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð³Ð° Ð´Ð° Ð»ÐµÐºÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ°</u>. And when I ask them whether the sentence would sound better if <u>ÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐµÑ</u> is used, they agree. And when I ask them if they could describe the difference between <u>ÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð°Ñ</u> and <u>ÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐµÑ</u>, they say that <b>ÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐµÑ</b> sounds as if the action is unreal, as if it hasn't happened yet. They think of it more as a verb denoting unreal action than as a perfective verb form. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a> 17:44, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well .. I was just saying that it wasn't a real participle. I'm not sure what to think about the subjunctive, because I'm not sure how to define a subjunctive in the first place. I can only compare with foreign language counterparts. The first thing that comes to my mind is that "Ð°ÐºÐ¾/ÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐµÑ Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ" is simply the past counterpart of "Ð°ÐºÐ¾/ÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð° Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ" (and indeed, as you mentioned, it is the imperfect vs present tense form of the prefective verb) and, logically speaking, both are about equally unreal. And, in turn, the counterpart of "Ð°ÐºÐ¾/ÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð° Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ" doesn't automatically require the subjunctive mood form in, say, French: "si/quand je deviens mÃ©decin", not *"si/quand je devienne..". In English, "if he become/be a doctor" isn't OK either. On the other hand, an imperfective close-counterpart "Ð°ÐºÐ¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð°Ñ Ð·Ð° Ð»ÐµÐºÐ°Ñ" certainly does have an contrary-to-fact meaning, and English constructions like "if I could make / were a good doctor" are, apparently (according to the wiki article on subjunctive mood) regarded as past subjunctive forms in the English grammatical tradition. Just some thoughts. Never mind, all of this can hardly have any significance for the article. --85.187.203.123 21:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If <b>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ñ</b>, <b>ÑÐ°Ð·Ð±ÑÐ°Ð½</b>, <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾ÐµÐ½</b> are participles, aren't <b>ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°ÐµÐ¼</b>, <b>ÑÐ°Ð·Ð±Ð¸ÑÐ°ÐµÐ¼</b>, <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¸Ð¼</b> also participles or are they considered to be just adjectives? They have gender forms and you can say <b>ÑÐ°Ð·Ð±Ð¸ÑÐ°ÐµÐ¼Ð° Ð·Ð°Ð´Ð°ÑÐ°</b>, they also refer to actions. For example <u>Ð¢ÑÐ¸ÑÐ³ÑÐ»Ð½Ð¸ÐºÑÑ Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ðµ Ð´Ð° Ð±ÑÐ´Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾ÐµÐ½</u> and <u>Ð¢ÑÐ¸ÑÐ³ÑÐ»Ð½Ð¸ÐºÑÑ Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¸Ð¼</u> have the same meaning. Furthermore, if you look up <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ²Ð°Ñ</b>, <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸Ñ</b>, <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾ÐµÐ½</b> in a dictionary you won't find them, nor will you find <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¸Ð¼</b>, you'll find only <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¼</b>. So <b>Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¸Ð¼</b> must be some kind of a word that is derived from a verb, and, as the other participles and conjugated verb forms, it is considered not worthy to be placed in a dictionary because its meaning can easily be understood. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a></p>
<p>No idea. All I know is that I've never heard of such a participle (English -able, German -bar etc.). Where is the boundary between lexical derivation and grammatical declension?

<p>I think the merger is a bad idea. This article should only contain some general information, and it's good as it is now (I'd even say it's already too big). More importantly, the article "Bulgarian grammar", just like the recently incorporated section on adverbs in "Bulgarian language" is nothing but a translation - by a very laborious enthusiast - of Borimir Kr'stev's "Gramatika za vsichki", published in Sofia, 1992. First of all, I suspect that violates copyright. Secondly, I think wikipedia should contain some intelligently summarized information and not entire grammars or handbooks. Thirdly, I don't think Borimir Kr'stevs grammar is that good, partly because it's intended for Bulgarians and neither for foreigners, nor for linguists (just read the introductory sentences). It includes many unnecessary details and much of the info isn't well summarized or is intended to teach Bulgarians basic grammar and what we call "common culture". Finally, that would only be satisfactory if also the other sections (phonetics etc.) were merged in the same way (as in the article on the Russian language).</p>
<p>A separate complete Bulgarian online grammar would be useful, but I guess its place would be in Wikibooks or somewhere else.</p>

<dd>I think merging is a good idea - I've just been working on the grammar page and it seems to me to be too incomplete.

<p>Sure the grammar page is incomplete, but I think the most logical way to complete it would be to finish what has been started and translate the remaining relevant pages of Borimir Kr'stevs grammar. :) --85.187.203.123 22:51, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think merging is a good idea, because ,as 85.187.203.123 says, the grammar section on this page is too big. Besides, not everything in the article "Bulgarian grammar" is a translation of Borimir Kr'stev's "Gramatika za vsichki". There are some additions, like the sections: forming the vocative, pronouns, and verbs.</p>
<p>I was wrong to say that Wikipedia isn't the place for detailed grammars (compare the Latin page). However, Arath has already started writing the verbs section, and I think his approach fits in well with the rest of the "Bulgarian grammar" article, because it is detailed (including entire conjugations), while the verb section in "Bulgarian language" is too concise and just wouldn't do. So maybe the grammar section in "Bulgarian language" should indeed be reduced to its basics after its useful parts are added to "Bulgarian grammar" (a long and difficult process, I'm afraid), in the way it has been done on other language pages, but that shouldn't happen before "Bulgarian grammar" is completed. Even then, I still think it's a pity if these overviews are lost. They are long, but much of them is nevertheless written with a view to providing a <i>linguistically competent foreigner</i> with information about the way the language works <i>in principle</i> plus some interesting peculiarities, while the "Bulgarian grammar" page, apart from its "popularizing" parts (the legacy of Kr'stev), has a very different orientation, namely to describe every single detail and serve as a reference work for an active learner of Bulgarian. --85.187.203.123 16:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>These edits are very messy, not to mention their terrible English. To begin with, there is no reason to put the semi-vowel and palatalisation together (except for Bulgarian orthography). Only semivowels should be mentioned between vowels and consonants. Secondly, palatalisation and its expression in orthography are treated later in the article, so this edit repeats a lot of things that have been said elsewhere. Thirdly, at least parts of it are written from a Bulgarian point of view ("The rule is that you write Ð¹Ð¾ at the beginning of words and ÑÐ¾ never at the beginning").

<p>This names the two non-Bulgarian, non-Greek linguists who thinks that "Macedonian is a literary variant of the Bulgarian language". This is important because it is an extreme minority point of view. Of course, this is not to say that there is no truth in this. I would imagine that many linguists could imagine categorising Macedonian-Bulgarian as a <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluricentric_language.html" title="Pluricentric language">pluricentric language</a>. But they would never say "Macedonian is a literary variant of the Bulgarian language", that is subordinating one under the other.

<p>I disagre, because it presents a biased view of the problem. You cannot source every single linguist in the world, you only can sample opinions, and it is not fair to claim there are only two in support. With the same success I can claim that 90 or 100 or whatever sources you have still do not constitute a majority. Btw, what's with your bias? <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyFly_03f0.html" title="User:FunkyFly">FunkyFly</a> 17:39, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By "it is not used anymore" I was refering to "some", now substituted with "certain", which according to my understaning of English expresses a smaller quantity. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyFly_03f0.html" title="User:FunkyFly">FunkyFly</a> 17:44, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My "bias" as you put it is just good linguistics. I remain surprised that there are two people calling themselves linguists who would say "Macedonian is a literary variant of the Bulgarian language". I am truely astonished. It just is not done. It does not present a biased view of the problem at all. Really I am beginning to doubt you've ever studied linguistics or sociolinguistics at all. Ok, here's a suggestion, how about we take all the linguists I can find say "Macedonian is a separate language", and all the linguists you can find saying "Macedonian is a literary variant of the Bulgarian language" and we divide your number by my number and multiply it by 100 to get the percentage? I can guarantee it will be below 10%, if I wasted enough time finding names, probably below 1%. Perhaps I could do a survey and get it below 0.1%. The fraction would be miniscule.</p>
<p>On the other hand, provide sources or don't include it. How about this:</p>

<p>The problem with that is you demand that all sources I find be added as an exception, except this linguist, except that one and so on, which is POV. Now the number is up to three, it can climb more in the future, so I stick to this - certain linguists, without naming. Sources in the reference section.</p>

<p>I don't demand all the sources you list be added as an exception. You have provided two linguists, which is a small enough number to add as an exception. They are an exception.

<p>What determines the form of the definite article (-qt/a vs -ta vs -to vs -te, etc.)? If it is gender, as the article and many other sources say, how can we explain starshina-ta (masculine) and zhivotni-te (neuter plural)? Obviously, form and not gender is decisive here (<a href="http://seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3" class="external text" title="http://seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3" rel="nofollow">Victor Friedman</a> analyses Macedonian in the same way). In Russian, the same problem (masculine papa-papoy conjugated like feminine mama-mamoy) is solved by distinguishing between gender and declension class.</p>
<p>Now if we accept the idea that gender itself is decisive, then we <b>can</b> say that Bulgarian nouns, unlike Russian ones, <b>inflect for gender</b> - and so we have said, in the article. But it seems pretty weird and imprecise to me. --85.187.44.131 15:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyway, I wouldn't object removing the 'influenced' part, it simply has to be clear these are generally not ordinary loanwords. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">â</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 10:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since Modern Bulgarian is based on a somewhat different series of dialects than Old Church Slavonic (OCS was based on the speech of Solun, outside the Kingdom of Bulgaria), and this is evident when one considers things like the variant treatment of VRC groups in the two, there was no "reintroducing". The term "Old Bulgarian" is no longer used in English as a name of Old Church Slavonic. The only mention of it one will see in a modern English handbooks is an exhortation not to use it. Much the same situation as scholars preferring "Anglo-Saxon" to "Old English", since modern English is based on dialects different than what one finds in that corpus. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 17:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>These dialects from around Thessaloniki have the phonetic changes of Common Slavic *dÊ² to Êd and *tÊ² to Êt, just like modern Bulgarian and most of what are considered its dialects today, so they're very close if not the same (differentiating Slavic languages back then was a difficult thing to do). The Bulgarian recension of OCS is what influenced Old East Slavic and subsequently Russian. It gradually developed into Middle Bulgarian while Church Slavonic was only a liturgical language that, apparently, was not a vernacular. What I mean by this is OCS (or at least a form very close to its original) was what Bulgarians actually spoke back then, no matter how you'd call it, and it's indeed <i>reintroducing</i>. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">â</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 23:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In OCS, the metathesis of VRC shows lengthening, while in Modern Standard Bulgarian there is no lengthening. Compare "rob" to OCS "rabU". This fact alone makes it clear that modern Bulgarian is not derived from OCS, but from different dialect(s) that split off from the common ancestor with OCS (Proto-South-Slavonic or Proto-South-East-Slavonic) before this sound change took place in each. This is a simple matter of historical linguistics. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 02:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Allright, I'm not a specialist, just an amateur, but can't this a â o be the result of later evolution? And by the U in 'rabU' do you mean the final 'Ñ', because I believe its dropping is a later development (though I might be wrong).</dd>
<dd>Even if it was the result of some earlier split, can this be a single reason to classify the Thessaloniki speech as a separate <i>language</i> from what was then Bulgarian, so we couldn't classify those much later loanwords as being <i>reintroduced</i>? I myself would regard it as the same language as Bulgarian. Not that it has any relevance to the article now, but I'm just curious since I'm very interested in the topic. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">â</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 20:04, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say that, although the history behind the loanwords might be unusual (and certainly noteworthy), there is no uniqueness in modifying a word to fit the borrowing language's phonology.

<dd>Well, pronouncing a loanword in a way that would sound natural in the recipient language is what happens most of the time. But in this case we're talking about different evolution of sound groups in the different Slavic languages â what in Russian became <i>oro</i> became <i>ra</i> in Bulgarian, for example, and this was usually taken in consideration when borrowing (though not always). <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">â</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 23:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
