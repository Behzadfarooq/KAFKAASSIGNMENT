<p>My question pertains to why this article is written as if by a member of the Victorian gentry. The question is: Why is this article written as if by a 19th century aristocrat?</p>

<p>"The Bull Terrier is one of several breeds in which the dog (male) and bitch (female) must have distinctly different appearances."</p>
<p>Is it just size differences between the dogs and bitches, or something more distinctive? could it be put in the article to help clerify? <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekana_60c9.html" title="User:Tekana">Tekana</a> 17:58, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good question, Tekana. In some dog breeds, the standard specifies that the male and female have differing appearances, sometimes it is written as distinctly 'feminine' or 'masculine' or words to that effect; so no, it is not just size. See <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_of_Breed_4e44.html" title="Best of Breed">Best of Breed</a>.

<p>I have just joined, so please be kind with any criticism of this post.</p>
<p>I noticed that this line: "(Although Blue and liver highly undesirable)" is missing a verb. I assume "are".</p>
<p>Also, I want to ask how famous a Bull Terrier has to be to get included on the list. For example there is a famous greeting card character named Maxine. She seems to have a white Bull Terrier. The character Monica in the well-known web comic Wapsi Square also has a white Bull Terrier named Dietzel. And of course Target stores has had a white Bull Terrier in its marketing campaigns for quite some time.</p>
<p>Finally, I originally looked for the search term "English Bull Terrier" and that was in no way connected to this article. Given that it's the breed's proper name, I think it should be linked.</p>
<p>As I said, I am new. Also, I am not ready to delve in just yet - it's a little intimidating. Because of that, feel free to use anything I've said here as a possible change/addition to this article.</p>

<p>The article doesn't seem to talk much about the potential violent nature of bull terriers. They are prone to bouts of extreme violence, especially with other larger dogs. There are frequent instances in the news of bull terriers mauling people, much more then I see in other legal breeds</p>
<p>In fact the breed has been banned in germany <a href="http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/consular_services/customs/dogs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/consular_services/customs/dogs.html" rel="nofollow">German customs</a></p>

<dd>Unsigned message response. This issue is much larger than simply one breed of dog, any dog can be violent. Frequent instances maybe - you'd need to back that up with a citation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe you should try looking for an article other than this one to choose - the "media scares" and folklore about a whole range of breeds (and the derivative cross breeds) as being endemically violent is as intriguing as the threat. Joanna Bourke's "Fear a Cultural History" would be a good start on that issue. However all that said, some strains of some dogs have been recognised as having problematic behaviours, but bullies arent the only breed with that issue! <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 01:08, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am a fervent lover of this breed. However I think that the potential for violence of the breed IS entirely relevant to this article. Whilst there is a lot of folklore and media hype associated with such things, it is an INDISPUTABLE FACT that this breed has been classified as a dangerous dog in both Italy and Germany. Mention should be made of this in the article irrespective of the wrongs or rights of these actions in these countries. The subject also warrants mention because the breed is thought to be particularly susceptible to a neurological condition called sudden onset aggression (SOA) and is the subject of at least one study in the US. see <a href="http://critterweb.com/btneuro/" class="external free" title="http://critterweb.com/btneuro/" rel="nofollow">http://critterweb.com/btneuro/</a> .</p>
<p>As regards suitability with children, I think this article is downright irresponsible. Whilst this breed is one of the most loving and human centric you could find, other characteristics make them one of the LESS suitable breeds to have around children. These other characteristics include:</p>
<dl>
<dd>extremey strong</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>one of the most powerful canine jaws</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>extraordinarily dangerous teeth</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>highly maneuverable</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>notoriously headstrong, determined and difficult to train for recall</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>intolerance to teasing</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>reaction to being challenged.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have NEVER seen a recommendation for households with small children. Indeed they are recommended only for adults with much experience of dogs or of BTs.</p>
<p>None of this should detract from their INTENSELY loving nature; they just need to be in the right hands.</p>

<p>There seems to be a contradiction in this article. "they were <b>originally bred as fighting dogs</b> therefore they will react if challenged but they will not normally make the first move.(<b>It is a misconception that they were bred for fighting. Dog fighting was common at the time, but they were bred to be companions</b>. Also they were bred for comformation to create a dog that was pleasing to the eye.)</p>
<p>I'm just wondering which one it is.Could someone tell me?<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerenaacw_f2c5.html" title="User:Serenaacw">Serenaacw</a> 00:27, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bull Terriers were bred as a pit dog, that would not turn on its owner after the fight.</p>

<p>Um. 1. Pictures. Specifically, the eyes, a close-up; and showing the appearance difference between genders. 2. In general, given the (inevitable) comparison with American Pit Bulls, some treatment of the different breeding should appear in the History section; and the fighting/companion dog bit needs clarification. 3. This breed is international -- maybe an Oz section?</p>
<p>This article is what I would place in the "Start" class -- most of the info is there, it needs building, but it also needs to be made interesting -- it's lacking that "human" touch. I would remove the, er, "order" "<i>Also, be sure to check ears, eyes, nose and mouth every day for signs of infection.</i>" as being very depressing and possibly POV. Much of the Temperament and Health sections are generic to all dogs -- this should be mentioned, but kept in. Should that be "kept in but qualified"? Whatever.</p>
<p>They are lovely dogs. I know a couple of them quite well, unfortunately they are the White variety and suffer badly from sunburn. Australians would do well to change to the Coloured variety, as even a Tan skin will better handle our summer skies. See if some genetic background to Bully colours can be found (see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Kelpie_ba7c.html" title="Australian Kelpie">Australian Kelpie</a> *<a href="http://www.hnrworkingkelpies.com/Coat_Colors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hnrworkingkelpies.com/Coat_Colors.html" rel="nofollow">Genetic basis of Kelpie coat colours</a>).</p>

<p>The "History" section of this article does not concur with anything I have ever read about the breed, and I believe it is inaccurate. (for example no mention of Dalmatian or White English Terrier in the lineage)</p>
<p><br />
I have made comments above about the suitablilty with children; the article is expressing an individual opinion on this subject and does not concur with the general advice on the subject.</p>
<p>The full breed name (i.e. English Bull Terrier) is never even mentioned.</p>
<p>Whilst there is a link to the article for minis, I think they should at least be mentioned in this article because the category into which any example falls is determined by the height. It is therefore possible for a full sized pair to parent a mini. Indeed some breeding examples are categorised as suitable for breeding in both categories (whilst most fall into one category or the other).</p>
<p>The health problems section is not as extensive as it could be. A good resource can be found here: <a href="http://www.thebullterrier.com/btgendis.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.thebullterrier.com/btgendis.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebullterrier.com/btgendis.shtml</a></p>
<p>Additionally many (particularly minis) suffer from luxating lenses of the eye, which untreated can result in Blindness.</p>
<p>I can understand the removal of the sense of humor reference, but I think it is fair to say that owners may get this impression as a consequence of their desire for persistent and close human contact and involvement.</p>
<p><br />
At least one book I have read on the subject mentions four sub-categories within the breed, which are not mentioned here: the bull, the terrier, the dalmation and the middle-of-the-road. The categories effectively describes attributes such as stance, muscularity, neck length head size and so on. (I will post a reference when I can find the book again).</p>
