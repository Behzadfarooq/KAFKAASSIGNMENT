	    <p>Bullit formed in 2003 after the discussions of long time friends Eddie Reynolds and Ceall O'Dunlaing. The pair met in College in Dublin in 1989 and were drinking associates long before they ever got together with guitars.</p>
<p>Eddie was an acomplished trumpet and bass player who had spent much of his teenage years playing around the music scene in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_midlands.html" title="Irish midlands">Irish midlands</a> and making music with his older brother, Ken Reynolds. There was a number of rehearsal sessions involving the pair during their college days but they never amounted to anything.</p>
<p>Ceall engaged in a few projects in the early nineties. None of them would have achieved much recognition, but one act (who Ceall claims he can't remember the name of) played a few gigs with screaching amplifiers, agressive vocals. The sets usually didn't last more than 5 songs, including Jane's addiction and stones covers.</p>
<p>When Eddie and Ceall left college in 1993, they quickly set about forming Stuffed as a three piece, with Will Ahern on drums. At the time Nirvana were at their height, so Stuffed took the cue and spent six months in regular sessions, in Apple Rocks Studios. The music at this time was a blend of punk with a blues style. By the end of this six month period, Stuffed had around 20 original songs fully written and rehearsed. They recorded a 14 song demo album on a portable 4-track in Apple Rocks Studios in one day, with vocal and limited guitar overdubs over the following weeks in engineer and producer, Brian Bannon's, family home. At the time the music scene in Dublin/Ireland was feeling the hangover of not finding the next U2. As a result none of the record companies they sent the demo to, responded (even with rejection letters). With the dispondancy that Stuffed experienced, they quickly called it a day. Eddie went travelling around Europe, Will continued on working in IT, and Ceall went to set up a candle shop in the south of Ireland.</p>
<p>When Eddie returned from Europe, he moved to Galway, where a flourishing bohemian music scene had developed. He joined the Judas Diary on Bass, and Trumpet. Judas Diary were were more of a small orchestra of traditional instruments (guitars, drums, flute, brass, fiddle, vocals), and had up to 10 members at one stage. Judas Diary toured Germany frequently and remain part of Galway's popular myth even today. At this time Eddie was also running Hedgehog Studios outside Galway city with brother Ken.</p>
<p>Ceall did very little musically, in the years between the dissolving of Stuffed and 2000. this was largely due to personal and relationship circumstances. However during this Time Ceall and Eddie remained in contact. In 2000 during an impromtu jam Eddie played Ceall a riff on the guitar suggesting he produce some lyrics. This riff turned out to be "Who do you pray to&#160;?", which was the first song on the debut Bullit album, "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" (released 2003). Up to 2002, Eddie and Ceall collaborated in Eddie's Studio in Mullingar. At the time, drummers Paddy Hasset, and Kieth Horan sat in on drums in a session capacity. Everybody at the time was happy to let the project continue in an informal capacity.</p>
<p>In September 2002, Ceall was involved in a serious motorbike collision, breaking his lower left leg in 3 places. During his recovery, Eddie sold him a digital 8-track recording desk, which resulted in a very prolific song writing period. At this time, they also decided to produce a completed body of work.</p>
<p>Over January 2003, they recorded 11 songs on 16-track analog, with Kieth Horan, and Mick Cronin drumming. Ceall was bound by crutches and bad health, so eddie took the reigns with regards to finishing their debut album, "Can't Stop, Won't Stop". Eddie commisioned local Mulligar street artist, Andy McManus (Dirty Concepts) to design the album cover. Andy designed a series of graffiti images on billboards and shopping car park walls in Athlone and Shannon, based on Eddie's decision to call the venture Bullit. Bullit was Eddie's homage to the actor Steve McQueen. The album was finished in April 2003, and the rest of the year was spent getting it released on their own label bullit-hole records.</p>
<p>Over the period of December 2004 / January 2005, Bullit went back into the Studio with Ken Reynolds producing and Peter Kirby playing drums. At the time Peter was in his final year of school, but had very little interest in a scolastic progression in his career. Peter was an acomplished drummer, who from an early age had sat in on most of the bands to come out of Mullingar over the past 5 years. The second Bullit album consisted of songs which were fresh as opposed to the "clearing of the back catalog" of the debut. This album was called Addicted to Life, and was released in June 2005. To coincide with the release of this album Bullit enlisted bass player, Kevin Leech from Crimson, to play live.</p>
<p>Bullit's third album (Cinderella's Tranquilizer's) is due for release in 2006.</p>
