<p>WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF A CAR FROM THE FRONT? I EFFORTLESSLY TAKE PICTURES OF CARS FROM THE FRONT BECAUSE I DON'T GO LOOKING FOR THEM IN CROWDED PARKING LOTS! YOU THINK THAT ANY CRAP WILL QUALIFY AS A GOOD PIC, BUT IT WONT! LOOK AT THE IMAGES <a href="../../../c/a/r/Image%7ECars_008.jpg_8713.html" title="Image:Cars 008.jpg">Image:Cars 008.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Image%7ECars_011.jpg_c051.html" title="Image:Cars 011.jpg">Image:Cars 011.jpg</a> SEE, I TOOK A IMAGE OF A CAR FROM THE FRONT, AND I'M STILL ALIVE. THESE IMAGES ACTUALLY ILLUSTRATE THE ARTICLE INSTEAD OF CLUTTERING THEM UP WITH NONSENSE! I AM SO FED UP WITH YOUR CRAPPY PICS! IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR YOU, YOU WILL TAKE A GOOD PIC, USING THE TWO I POSTED AS EXAMPLES (mainly the Escort) GOT IT!

<dd>You know, Montréal is one of my favorite cities. I wish I could live there year-round. There are so many fun things to do there, but wandering through parking lots taking pictures of banged-up cars from the rear isn't one of them.

<p>First off, the Shadow &amp; Colt were subcompacts. The Colt surpassed the Shadow in size for '92, because the Colt was still considered a subcompact. The Spirit was a compact, and its twins were the LeBaron &amp; Acclaim, and were competitors of other compacts at the time (Accord, Corsica, Stanza, Tempo, etc.). The Accord became a midsize in 1994. The Dynasty &amp; Monaco were midsize cars.</p>

<dd>You are right about the Colt being a subcompact, but the Shadow was a compact, not a subcompact. The Spirit, LeBaron sedan and Acclaim are mid-sized.

<p>Hi, I looked over the past few pictures you uploaded, and they're <b>getting better</b>. The resolution is now much better and you have blocked out the license plates and added the corrected licensing tags. While that's great, there are just a few more things to consider. If you could start photographing the cars from the front and make sure the car is clean and well maintained your pics would be much better. I think if you could take more picures like that of the 2003-05 Honda Pilot you uploaded recently, your edits would be much more appreciated. Thanks for contributing.

<p>Regarding your last change.. the Pontiac G5 and Chevrolet Cobalt are <i>related</i>. The G5 is <i>not</i> known as the Cobalt in the US. The Cobalt is also sold in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and the G5 will be sold in the US this summer. If a car is sold under a different brand or model outside of its home market, that is an "a.k.a." - for example, the <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daewoo_Magnus_19a3.html" title="Daewoo Magnus">Daewoo Magnus</a> from South Korea is sold as the Chevrolet Epica in Canada, and the Suzuki Verona in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a>, since Daewoo as a brand is no longer in either country. When two similar cars or brands are sold in the same market (country), that makes them "related" instead. Does this make sense? --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossanova_e002.html" title="User talk:Vossanova">o&lt;</a></sup> 11:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Verona &amp; Epica are both sold in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.

The U.S. couldn't sell the Swift+, since the Aerio is served as the entry-level model, and the Forenza (which replaced the <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzuki_Esteem_9767.html" title="Suzuki Esteem">Suzuki Esteem</a> &amp; <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daewoo_Nubira_353f.html" title="Daewoo Nubira">Daewoo Nubira</a> for the U.S.) competes with compacts in the U.S. I know the Aerio was replaced by the Esteem. However, I heard on MSN News Suzuki will be dropping the Verona due to poor sales, and I think it'll be replaced by the Suzuki Tosca.</dd>

<dd>Entry-level: Versailler -&gt; LS V6 -&gt; Zephyr -&gt; MKZ<br /></dd>

<dd>Personal Lux: Mark -&gt; LS -&gt; MKZ (the sport sedan are also aimed at this audience)<br /></dd>
<dd>FYI: It is expected that limo version of the Chrysler 300C will become a new favorite among livery services, the MKS might also be streched, but the body on frame design, which makes the Town Car so easy to stretch and is the primary reason for its poularity among livery services will be retires thus making the MKS as difficult to stretch as any other luxury car.

<dd>Don is right, the ES is a mid-size. The position a car takes in a marque's line-up is not neccessarily related to its actual size. The Lincoln LS was hardly a small car, yet it was the entry-level Lincoln.

<p>Most of your new batch of car photos are very nice. Keep up the good work! A couple of suggestions: If taking a picture in bright sunlight, lower the exposure on your camera or try to avoid direct reflections of the sun. That would improve your camera's ability to focus on the car. Also, after you have taken the picture, try cropping the photo so as to draw the focus to the car and not the surroundings.

<p>Thanks for your continuing image contributions. A tip: For better results, try to increase the contrast in your pictures, and also try not to have direct reflections in your camera.

<p>The current C-Class is a compact car. The Acura TL is similar in length to an E-Class. Mercedes brought the CLS-Class as a fighter for the Lexus GS, Acura RL &amp; Cadillac STS.</p>

<dd>Japanese vehicles tend to be cheaper than German vehicles. For example the LS competes for colsely in price, and according to Forbes also in handling with TC or DTS, than the S-Class. Yet it is a flaghsip sedan and thereby also directed at the S-Class.</dd>

<p>The Shadow only replaced the Charger &amp; Omni. The Spirit replaced the Aries &amp; Lancer. The Dynasty replaced the 600 &amp; Diplomat.

<p>I appreciate that you've inserted some of my Commons photos into their appropriate articles when I never got around to doing so. I like the idea of there being a second opinion that the image is good enough to go into its article, and someone else putting it in is definite confirmation. Plus, it gets the articles up-to-date faster and relieves the rush of one person trying to fit everything in. Thanks again. <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 10:48, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wanted to say thank you for fixing the link to that image. Also wanted to ask why you pit in this line: "In 2005, the Toyota Tacoma took over from the Ranger the best-selling small pickup."

<dd>I can't recall last year's data, but I don't doubt its accuracy. The Tacoma's sales for last month, which I have seen recently, were in the neighborhood of 50% higher than the Ranger's. <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 18:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but this isn't a guessing game here. Dosn't matter wether or not you doubt it's accuracy or if the Tacoma has higher numbers for last month, that is discussing last year. I do doubt it's accuracy I've been searching and have found nothing that states that the tacoma was the best selling in 2005 but have found numerous that say that point to Ranger. This really belongs more in the Tacoma page anyway. You just say that it took over in 2005 you didn't say anything about the Ranger's over 20 years as the best seller. Josh 18:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who gives a **** if the Dakota outsold it once, that's not the topic of discussion here. We are discussing the Tacoma replacing the Ranger as best seller in 2005, which you still haven't showed me any proof of. Yall are just going to show what I've thaught since I joined this place, a user editable encyclopedia is a very bad idea. If this discussion is any sign as to what yall put into the articles yall work on, how the hell do yall belong on a project to further the resources here. Whatever... yall go on and **** up the pages as much as you want to I nolonger give a ****. Since yall started messing with the Ford Ranger page all you've done is to run off knowledgable people who know more about the Rangers than you'll ever hope to know. Josh 20:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Guys, what are your original sources, or did you simply make this up? There are 3 different internet sources that contradict you, and none that support your position. Who first thought up this theory, who is not embarrased to admit that they constructed this non-fact almost out of thin air. Interesting theory, but it's original research unless you can cite someone outside of WP who came up with the same idea.

<p>There are two rather obvious reasons that the Edge is not the successor to the Freestar. 1: The Edge is a midsize 5-passenger crossover, while the Freestar is a 7-passenger ful size minivan. 2: The Freestar is still being sold, so it has not been replaced. It is slated to be replaced (when it actually is) by a production version of the Fairlane concept. (I'm putting this here instead of creating a discussion page on either the Edge or Freestar articles, it's more likely to be noticed here.) <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 11:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Glad to see you help bring some of the lists down to the requisite three. Remember, "similar" doesn't necessarily mean "competitor", so in most cases the drive setup (FWD vs. RWD, or FWD vs. RWD based) will be a determining factor, as will exterior size, and sometimes whether a car has sport or luxury intentions (if you still have too many that meet the qualification). <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>To add to that, I would like to clarify that the "concept" is the most important. I guess it's best to explain using an example - while there were many contemporary executive cars that competed with the <a href="../../../n/s/u/NSU_Ro80_73cd.html" title="NSU Ro80">NSU Ro80</a>, and many of them might have had similar drive setup etc., the Ro80 was unique in that it was powered by a Wankel engine. Thus, a <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazda_Luce_c1e5.html" title="Mazda Luce">Mazda Luce</a>, that was sold in a different market in a different period is much more similar, as it share the uniqeu concept of a large passenger sedan powered by a Wankel engine. Cheers, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 13:59, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS. An important "mental scheme" to be avoided is thinking of vehicles that are similar "at the moment". For example, the American Ford Fusion is quite similar to the American Honda Accord at the moment, but given the long history and evolution of the Accord and the limited existence of the Fusion, the Fusion is not really all that similar to the Accord.
<dl>
<dd>Thank God this is being dealt with. I came over here to leave a message about that bloody "similar" field, but it looks like we're finally getting somewhere. No more populating it with a massive list of vaguely similar cars based on wheelbase, hopefully.</dd>
<dd>More things to consider ~ dates of production should greatly overlap, country of origin (lots of people won't buy "domestics", or "imports", or whatever), mechanical similarity, etc etc. I had to delete <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac_Firebird_5732.html" title="Pontiac Firebird">Pontiac Firebird</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Camaro_6be0.html" title="Chevrolet Camaro">Chevrolet Camaro</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> from the list of cars allegedly "similar" to a <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Starion_dc4d.html" title="Mitsubishi Starion">Mitsubishi Starion</a> recently. Big V8&#160;!= small turbo I4, even if they're both RWD coupes.</dd>
<dd>Personally I think the whole field reeks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and encourages region-centric editing, e.g. putting America-only vehicles as being similar to cars sold worldwide, which happens a lot with Japanese vehicles. The day we get rid of that field the infobox will improve. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 08:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I hate to talk over Bull-Doser's head here, but your revert is quite questionable. While the photo you reverted to is in the Commons, it is clearly a GM promo photo (not only do I recognize that, but also there is a watermark in the photo and the description says so), and even though somebody tagged it with GFDL, it is clear that it is a copyrighted photo and can perhaps be used as fair use. So, a free photo would be better here, and I believe the one that Bull-Doser put there was of quite good quality (it could be a bolt better, but it is not bad). Regards, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 17:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Still, you never know. The man who uploaded it could work for GM's marketing department, or may own the rights to the photo, you never know for sure. All I know is that I don't like how BD (and IFCAR) run around sticking images of cars in articles where they already have free images, sometimes where their images are of worse quality than that of the other image (look in the history of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Taurus_17f2.html" title="Ford Taurus">Ford Taurus</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volvo_S80_c0b7.html" title="Volvo S80">Volvo S80</a> for examples)<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 20:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is a fair amount of certainty in saying that GM didn't suddenly license its photo bearing a copyright tag under GFDL, especially this very photo while not others. I believe it would take a rather high-profile decision to make that happen.

<dd>This isn't my talk page either, but seeing as I'm mentioned I'll chime in, too: I never replace free images unless there is a clear, inarguable quality improvement. <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 23:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. I was hoping you'd figure it out, but apparently it is too advanced for you. A particular marque of vehicle is NOT the manufacturer. A Mercury is not built by Mercury, it is built by Ford Motor Company. No current Jeep is built by Jeep, it is built by DaimlerChrysler alongside other DaimlerChrysler models. Now, this may not be the case with GM's divisions several decades ago, when each division built its own engines, trasmissions, axles, body parts, etc. But this determination should be left to those who know what they're doing, which you clearly do not. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 02:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>STOp splitting pages up for no reason. I have merged two articles into other articles because they were useless, and unessicary. If they are different bodystyles, they will stay on teh same page, unless they are mechanically unrealted, like the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler_Sebring_8e38.html" title="Chrysler Sebring">Chrysler Sebring</a>. I want you to stop. If you continue, and keep ignoring my comments, I will create another RfC to stop all this page splitting nonsense. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 02:27, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't get it. You've gone and uploaded a bunch of fair use images (some of which are understandable, some are not). Then you proceed to remove a fair image (not exactly replaceable) of a rare car with one of your crappy ass end pics. That fair image, by the way, was put there in place of an image where the lighting was so bad you could barely see the car.</p>
<p>Allow me to point out some guidelines for car images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have good lighting</li>
<li>Car must be in decent shape and original condition</li>
<li>Must not be a cluttered picture</li>
<li>Must be of the front 3/4</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't understand what is so hard about taking good photographs. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 16:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has been a problem with him for the longest time. He must think that if he takes an image we can actually use, he might spur the apolocipse.

<dd>Bull-Doser, what I think what do you good is a new digital camera. Seriously, almost all of your images are grainy and blurry, even after they've been enhanced by whatever image editing program you use. And of course, it helps to abide by our image standards as Sable232 stated above. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApolloBoy_2382.html" title="User:ApolloBoy">ApolloBoy</a> 23:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>NO, the reason for his images being so grainy is that he brightens them <i>too</i> much. I think what ne needs to do is not be an itiot and look at the climate before he deciedes to take a pic. Like, he should not take pics when it is dark out, and not take pictures when it is raining. (LIke the Marauder pic, it was rainy and foggy when he took it). And, nothing was blocking the frotn of the car, so I don't know why he had to take it from the back, either. I think that BD just needs to use his brain. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 11:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rainy days can generate the best pictures if it's not too dark. You don't get glare, and the cars are all clean-looking and shiny. <a href="../../../i/f/c/User%7EIFCAR_5050.html" title="User:IFCAR">IFCAR</a> 11:43, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, but when it is foggy, and the rain crosses all over the camera, almost blurring out the car, then it is not a good pic. just look at Image:2003-04 Mercury Marauder.JPG and you be teh judge. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 12:07, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This criticism is rude and unwarranted. It is much better to have a poor image than none at all. Since we can't use promophotos of existing cars, homemade photos are our only option. Please stop insulting a user for doing a service for Wikipedia.

<dd>A bad image displays a car better than no image. I take what I can, but if BD comes across a car that I don't and gets an image, his contribution is better than mine.

<p>Hi Bull-Doser, I recently noticed that you added the "parent company" field to the Lexus LS article. We don't do that, however, becuase Lexus is a division and not a subsidary. We only add the parent company field if it is a subsidary. For divisions such as Cadillac, Lincoln, or Lexus (even if they make expensive luxury cars) we add the parent company directly as the manufacturer.

<p>Bull-Doser, you have a history of causing trouble with pages. Please stop replacing the image on the Nissan Maxima page without properly discussing it first. Also, please stop changing the features as well and replacing them with your own versions - unless you have a valid source with which to quote for the changes. Continuing such actions will only get you reported to an admin and quite possibly banned. Judging by your past actions, I would say to please heed this advice.

<p>Please, stop. Or at the very least, do some maths -- every one of your templates so far has some seriously skewy formatting. 2004 is twice as wide as every other year, and about four times as wide as 2007. Are you just copy/pasting from somewhere else, because that somewhere else needs fixing, not spread all over other articles like a layout virus. And why are you only doing North American markets? How encyclopedic is it to just omit the rest of the world? If you don't <i>know</i> about the rest of the world, maybe you're not the ideal author to create such templates? That's certainly true if you're not willing to do any research to <i>discover</i> what's beyond your shores.</p>
<p>The annoying thing is, Mitsubishi Motors has a .pdf, freely available from its global website, which gives a complete automotive timeline including the first years of its existence. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 20:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Replacing a list template with a timeline is not vandalism. I did that to several articles a while back, so the article for a specific car would have more relevant context. It makes little sense to have a huge template for every vehicle Ford has built worldwide on something like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Galaxie_1f19.html" title="Ford Galaxie">Ford Galaxie</a>. It is far more useful to have a timeline for that market during that time period.</dd>
<dd>Now, I can't speak for what he's doing here and I don't know if it's right or not, but I do not believe the intent is vandalism. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 16:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
