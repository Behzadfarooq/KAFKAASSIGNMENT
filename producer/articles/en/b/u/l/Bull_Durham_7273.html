<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>Costner stars as "Crash" Davis (named after <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence__Crash__Davis_9f27.html" title="Lawrence &quot;Crash&quot; Davis">Lawrence "Crash" Davis</a>, an actual player for the Durham Bulls in the 1940s and 50s), a veteran of countless years in the minor leagues unwillingly sent down to single-A Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate a hotshot rookie pitcher "Nuke" LaLoosh (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Dalkowski_65f7.html" title="Steve Dalkowski">Steve Dalkowski</a>) about being a major-league talent, and to get Nuke to control his haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Nuke by the degrading name of "Meat", and they get off to a very rocky start.</p>
<p>Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon, the character named for the "Baseball Annies" groupies), a life-long spiritual seeker who latched onto the "<a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a> of Baseball" and has, every year, taken on a prospect with the Bulls to be a lover/student. Annie flirts with Crash and Nuke but Crash walks out, noting he's too much a veteran to 'try out' for anything, although before leaving he and Annie share some sparks of mutual interest.</p>
<p>Annie and Crash then work, in their own way, and with a lot of animosity from Crash, to shape Nuke into a big-league pitcher: Annie by playing mild bondage games, reading poetry to Nuke, and getting the rookie to think in alternative ways; Crash by forcing Nuke to learn "not to think," by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch was coming after Nuke had shaken off Crash's calls), and lecturing to Nuke about the major leagues with both the pressure in facing big league hitters that can hit Nuke's "heat" (fastballs) and the pleasure of enjoying life in 'The Show' that Crash briefly lived for "the twenty-one best days of my life" and has tried desperately for years to get back to. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are right for each other, except for the fact that Annie's with Nuke now...</p>
<p>Along the way, Annie asks Crash what he believes about life, and Crash delivers a spectacular harangue (see "Quotes", below)..</p>
<p>After a rough start to Nuke's career, he becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season thanks to the coaching of Annie and Crash. By the end of the movie, Nuke is called up to 'The Show' and the Bulls, now having no use for Nuke's personal mentor, release Crash. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. Nuke leaves for the big leagues, effectively ending his relationship with Annie, and Crash overcomes his initial jealously to leave Nuke with some final words of advice.</p>
<p>Eventually Crash, an experienced and skilled hitter, joins another team and breaks the minor league record for most career home runs, achieving a personal milestone that he has striven for. Annie wants to tell <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_afe1.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a></i> about it, but Crash swears her to silence. Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham to begin a life with Annie. He tells her that he will accept a baseball coaching job. Foreshadowing suggests that he'll succeed both in this coaching role and in his life with Annie. Both characters end one phase of their lives and begin another. We see Nuke one last time, being interviewed as a major leaguer, where he recites some answers to questions which he practiced earlier in the movie with Crash.</p>

<p><i>Bull Durham</i> became a minor hit when released, and is now considered one of the best sports movies. It became a major career moment for the lead cast members. Costner especially would later play baseball players and fans in other movies, especially <i><a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_of_Dreams_07d1.html" title="Field of Dreams">Field of Dreams</a></i>. After <i>Durham</i> came out Hollywood began releasing more sports, and especially baseball, movies after the genre had slipped from view.</p>
<p>Many quotes and scenes have become popular, including the scene where the team's manager berates the players as 'lollygaggers' in the shower, Crash's reciting to Annie a list of things he believes in (including a belief that <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Harvey_Oswald_15b9.html" title="Lee Harvey Oswald">Oswald</a> was a lone gunman), the scene where Crash creates a "rain-out" so his teammates can have a day off a grueling road trip, and the pitching mound scene where the entire team gathers to discuss how to fix all the curses and bad luck they're having, as well as figuring out what to get a fellow teammate for his impending wedding.</p>
<p>Most of all, it revived interest in minor league baseball, which had been stagnating in small-town areas for decades, to where minor league teams achieve decent attendance and are even subject to relocation/bidding wars between communities. The Durham Bulls team itself in real-life has become one of the most famous minor-league teams in the United States (topped only by the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Barons_c1a8.html" title="Birmingham Barons">Birmingham Barons</a> during the years <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> tried baseball), and has moved from A (Class A) level to Triple-A (players who are one call away from 'The Show') status, complete with a larger <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_Bulls_Athletic_Park_37c4.html" title="Durham Bulls Athletic Park">stadium</a> built in the 1990s to accommodate the growing crowds and the shift to AAA as a minor league affiliate to the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_Devil_Rays_f581.html" title="Tampa Bay Devil Rays">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a> (during the film's time period, the Bulls were with the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>).</p>

<li>The filming was done after the close of the regular season, during September and October of 1987.

There were also scenes filmed in other <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_League_42af.html" title="Carolina League">Carolina League</a> cities, although one establishing shot of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_Memorial_Stadium_b893.html" title="World War Memorial Stadium">War Memorial Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greensboro%2C_North_Carolina_6072.html" title="Greensboro, North Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a> was erroneous, because Greensboro's club was and is in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Atlantic_League_ded9.html" title="South Atlantic League">South Atlantic League</a>.</li>
<li>The Durham Bull sign, once a staple at ballparks everywhere, was built specifically for the movie. Once filming was done, the bull was retained as a decoration, albeit in foul territory, and with a simple "Let's Go Bulls" instead of "Hit Sign Win Steak". Like the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Sign_a9b2.html" title="Hollywood Sign">Hollywood Sign</a>, this Durham Bull was not originally intended to be a long-lasting artifact, and was eventually replaced by a sturdier version. The new <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_Bulls_Athletic_Park_37c4.html" title="Durham Bulls Athletic Park">Durham Bulls Athletic Park</a> also features the Durham Bull. In the new park, the sign is in fair territory, and hitting the bull will win the batter a free steak. Also, if the batter hits the grass the bull is standing on, he will win a free salad.</li>
<li>In a case of life imitating art, during a long rain delay that interrupted (and ultimately postponed) the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>' first night game in August, 1988, several Cubs players came out and slid on the tarp, imitating a scene in this movie. Cubs manager <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Zimmer_7c44.html" title="Don Zimmer">Don Zimmer</a>, an old-school, no-nonsense type, reportedly was not amused, and saw to it that all of the "perpetrators" were fined $500. However, the on-screen antics may have been inspired by <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> catcher <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Dempsey_b082.html" title="Rick Dempsey">Rick Dempsey</a>, who famously performed a similar routine on the tarps at Fenway Park during a rain delay in the early 1980s and then made the routine a bit of a personal trademark, without publicly incurring the wrath of Orioles' management.</li>
<li>Aside from the sliding routine, the "rainout" scene was based on an actual event. In the late 1960s, Ron Shelton played minor-league ball in the Texas League. Shelton's team was in Amarillo, Texas for a season-ending series. The night before the final game, Shelton, some teammates and some Amarillo players were out partying and decided to go to the stadium and turn on the sprinkler system, thereby flooding the field and ensuring a "rainout". However, the Amarillo team owner rented a helicopter, dried the field, and the game was played.</li>
<li>During his famous rant, Crash Davis comments that he believes ". . . Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone . . ." in the <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_assassination_ab9b.html" title="JFK assassination">JFK assassination</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Costner_7a16.html" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a> appeared in <i><a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_%28film%29_034c.html" title="JFK (film)">JFK</a></i> as a District Attorney determined to indirectly prove Oswald was part of a larger conspiracy.</li>
<li>Crash yells at Nuke about messing up the lyrics to "<a href="../../../t/r/y/Try_a_Little_Tenderness_b5ec.html" title="Try a Little Tenderness">Try a Little Tenderness</a>". In the movie "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Upside_of_Anger_be4a.html" title="The Upside of Anger">The Upside of Anger</a>", Kevin Costner plays a former baseball player. At a wedding the singer starts singing "Try a Little Tenderness", after singing the first verse, the singer looks like he forgets the words and starts humming.</li>
<li>In the scene in which the bat boy gives Crash the pine tar rag and tells him to "get a hit", <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Costner_7a16.html" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a> ad-libbed the line "Shut up." The actor playing the bat boy wasn't expecting the line, thought Costner was being serious, and burst into tears.</li>
<li>The note that Crash writes to Annie actually reads "Let's fuck sometime," not "I want to make love to you", as Millie reads. It can be seen over Crash's right shoulder when he writes the note in the dugout.</li>
<li>The movie states that Crash Davis has 227 minor league home runs and needs twenty more to break the all-time minor league home run record. After hitting home run number 247 (but not with the Durham Bulls), Davis leaves baseball. However, the actual minor league home run record is 484, held by Hector Espino, who played for 24 years in the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_League_70a6.html" title="Mexican League">Mexican League</a> between 1960 and 1984. Espino played in the American minor league system briefly in 1964, but was offended by racial discrimination and returned to Mexico to finish his career there. (He hit no major league home runs.) Even discounting Mexican League players, Davis's 247 minor league home runs wouldn't put him in the current top ten list of all-time minor league home runs.</li>
