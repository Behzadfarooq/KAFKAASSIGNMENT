<dd>In Portugal, is commom what Error says, and its also for fiesta (called, <i>festa</i>), but not promptly, that would be a terrible scene. Bullfighting is very unpopular in here (north of Portugal). Most closed, only in my city, Povoa de Varzim (the only standing, some want it closed), but now only a few per year, mostly for TV. When I was a kid, some yrs ago, we use to see bullfighting after going to the beach on sundays, cause its near the beach. Its more popular in southern Portugal and Azores. In Portugal was forbitten to kill the Bull in the Arena, now its authorized in a small town, Barrancos, because they have allways killed the animal. Even with police, TV, every year there was a scandal because no one was arrested. That was giving more fame to the town and to that "festa", the government authorized it (only) in there.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 01:07, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bulls are not "victorious" when they kill the bullfighter (who will be replaced by another bullfighter). Bulls are victorious when they are pardoned, after demonstrating great bravery and strength. I don't have any solid number, but this usually happens several times every season.

<dd>If a bull has shown exceptional bravery and the crowd petition the president of the bullring before it is killed, he will grant an indulto (pardon) and spare the bull's life. The kill is then simulated using a banderilla or an empty hand. The bull will usually then become a semental (stud bull).</dd>

<dd>Er. One wonders how much you know about animals. First of all, bulls or other animals cannot be guilty, as the concept of guilt implies the capacity for one to be responsible for their actions, something that only humans can do. So your semantic argument is unfounded. And second of all, before they are slain, the wounds bulls receive during a corrida are only superficial, and inflicted to fuel their anger and make them run after the picadores and the matador. It's all the running which exhausts them, not the wounds. Banderillas only stab a few centimeters under the skin; for a 600+kg animal, that is a mild cut. And finally, bulls which are bred for corridas leave a much happier life than their peers before the corrida, and after when they survive, since they recover in a matter of days/weeks, have sex with plenty of cows, and die of old age in some meadow where they are allowed to live out their life. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoDV_66a4.html" title="User:LeoDV">LeoDV</a> 14:40, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I was in a village in Spain, the bull that was part of a "bloodless bullfight" at the village fiesta was butchered. Within a few hours it reappearred as some rather good stew. This was provided free to anyone in the town, as the bullfight was part of the (publicly funded) fiesta. (Anon.)</p>

<dd>Hi, I think it's accurate at least in Catalonia. I don't know in the past, but presently, bullfighting is not very popular in many parts of Catalonia. Furthermore, bullfighting has been heavily promoted as a symbol of Spain (<i>fiesta nacional</i>), which does not make it popular at all for catalan nationalists. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevi_3d02.html" title="User:Xevi">Xevi</a> 09:35, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bullfighting has never been that popular in Catalonia amongst Catalans; the only famous Catalan bullfighter was Mario Cabre in the 1950s. While bullfights were long popular in Barcelona, few Catalans attended the bullfights&#160;; most of the spectators were from other parts of Spain or from foreign countries. One of Barcelona's two arenas had been shut down long before the ban. Bullfights in the Baleares have generally catered to tourists. The heart of bullfighting country is considered to be <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andalusia.html" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, where the spectacle began in its modern form, where the best bulls are raised, and which continues to produce the most bullfighters and have the highest level of popular interest in the spectacle.</p>

<p>If Catalonia has banned bullfighting, why are there still bullfights going on in Barcelona? I spoke to the man who works at the Barcelona bull ring and he described the Catalan government's declaration that bullfighting was illegal as 'propaganda' and said that no law had been passed. Can anyone enlighten us on this?</p>

Barcelona city council (not Catalonia) has not banned bullfighting. They have just made a public statement against bullfights being held in the city. They don't have the powers to forbid bullfighting, though. [Manel]</p>

<p>Errors exist with these two statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>in Portugal, the main stars of bullfighting are the riders, as opposed to Spain, where the matadores are the most prominent bullfighters</li>
<li>In Portugal, bulls have their horns severed in a way that they do not present sharp points.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The article states that <i>"in Portugal, the main stars of bullfighting are the riders, as opposed to Spain, where the matadores are the most prominent bullfighters"</i>. This is incorrect. The riders are the main attraction in a corrida that is done with one or two horses/riders. This is also the most popular of the "two-types" of bullfights in Portugal. However, Portugal also has bullfights that are not done with the horse. In these bullfights, the matador is the prominent figure.</p>
<p>Confusion may come from the fact that in a "horse-style" tourada, assistants are available. These assistants are paid by, and work for, the horse rider. These assistants are known as bandalheiros <i>(not sure of the spelling)</i>. They do carry capes to guide the bull, but they are <b>not</b> matadors.</p>
<p>Additionally, the article states that in Portugal the bull's horns are cut. In a "horse-style" bullfight, the horns are covered to prevent injury to the horse and to the Forcados. Forcados are the men that must bring the charging bull to a stop and therefore come in direct contact with the horns. They only perform with bulls that are fought by horse. Bulls that are fought by foot do not have their horns capped are not stopped by the Forcados.</p>
<p>These "non-horse-style" bullfights are what people typically think of when they speak of bullfighting. These are performed by a matador. During these bullfights, the matador <b>is</b> the prominent figure <i>(obviously, because there is no horse)</i>.</p>
<p>The two styles of bullfighting may be mixed, it is then referred to as a <b>tourada mista</b>, with some bulls being fought by horsemen and the others by matadors. However, each bull cannot be shared by a horseman and a matador.</p>
<p>In Portugal, the "horse-style" bullfights may be more popular because the matador (which means killer) does not have the authority to kill the bull. It may also be because the crowds enjoy the Forcados, which cannot participate in a "foot-style" bullfight because of the sharp horns. Regardless of the reason, Portugal does have more "horse-style" bullfights than "foot-style", which may be the reason that this was written up incorrectly. I plan to amend the section when I have a chance.</p>

<p>"English-speaking critics often confuse the tauromachia with the coarse entertainment of "bull-baiting" formerly popular in Britain, in which packs of specially-bred bulldogs were loosed upon a bull confined within a ring or even tethered to a stake."</p>
<p>Is this really accurate? I'm speaking only from personal experience here, but the standard image of bull-fighting focuses around the matador and the bull, and few ever even think of bull baiting. I'm not sure I've ever heard of the two being confused. --<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanzzibar_643e.html" title="User:Xanzzibar">Xanzzibar</a> 19:48, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the "rejoneo" to Caveleiro. In Portuguese style bullfights, the bullfighters/ horsemen/ horse riders are formally known as the "Cavaleiro". Spanish style would be called a "rejoneo". Here in California, the bloodless bullfights are a seasonal event that begins between the months of April through October. And I also want to clarify that the horses are NOT beaten or abused to get them to do what they do. At least our horses are not. Just like with any animals, it is the "owners" responsibility to make sure that the animals are not harmed in any way. I read somewhere on the internet that the horses are tortured to get them to do tricks and go up against a bull. And I'm simply saying that it is NOT true at all.--<a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">Webmistress Diva</a> 20:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi I wonna ask one question Why bullfighters wear red hat?</p>
<p>IIRC only portuguese "forcados" wear a red hat (the traditional portuguese headdress). The standard hat for on-foot bullfighting is called a "montera" and it's always black. It's, though, usually lined on the inside in crimson. It's a common superstition not to let it bottom-up (with the inside visible) on the arena because it "looks like a coffin ..."</p>

<p>The King is a great fan of bullfighting, this is true. While he has no power to make laws, in many regions of Spain there is considerable support for bullfighting. In Andalusia, Castile, Extremadura and Valencia interest in bullfighting remains high. The Canary Islands banned bullfighting in the 1990s but it was not a part of their culture, as is the case with Catalonia, and likewise I would expect bullfighting to disappear in the Baleares at some point in time. I would not consider a national ban to be feasible but with the decentralization process which has occurred in Spain since the return to democracy and the resulting power of the autonomous communities, I would expect bullfighting to completely disappear in some communities while in others it will continue to thrive. Also, the article did not address the fact that in Spain it is considered a cultural event along the lines of opera or ballet, not a sport. Bullfights are covered in the cultural sections of newspaper, not the sports sections.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say your argument is moot on the grounds that dog fighting was also a 'cultural event' of numerous nations prior to the 1900's and in some instances of more well educated and refined cultures the 1800's. A complete ban on bullfighting will eventually occur as the practise of torturing and killing animals, for entertainment, under the guise of culture or not, is an affront to human decency and common sense to the rest of the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The argument that it is the countries right to see things differently is moot on the grounds that numerous countries saw it as their right to allow slavery and other animalistic behaviour, yet eventually they gave in to reason and common decency as human beings. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 17:38, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bullfighting in the Spanish style was quite popular in the American West in the 19th century, but by the 1920s was illegal. The bloodless bullfights in California became legal within the last 20 years, as they largely occur in small towns which had continued to hold conventional, illegal bullfights long after bullfighting became illegal. The bloodless corrida was legalized as a way of preserving local traditions in the state's rural areas, if I remember correctly. Documentation would be welcomed.</p>

<p>The link does not include legislative history, so it is uncertain at what time bullfighting was banned in California. There was a brief Los Angeles Times article about bullfighting in 19th century Los Angeles and its popularity at the time which is not available on the web. I get the impression that California banned bullfights some time in the 19th century, and that New Mexico and Arizona allowed bullfights into the early 20th century. This information would be appreciated.</p>

<p>It is apparent to me that this article has drastic point of view wording in the pro; the words 'pain', 'torment', 'cruelty', 'suffering' and 'torture' to name just a few are all jammed down in the criticisms section only. There is no possible argument that these are NPOV words to describe the act of ritualistic maiming and (eventual) slaying of an animal. The only instance of the word 'suffering' that isn't in the criticisms section is in relation to the matador suffering a gorging from the bull.</p>
<p>Cultural egg-shell treading must be put aside for accurate, realistic and neutral point of view editing of this article, I think personally that we all, as Wikipedians, are having ourselves on by being hypersensitive and keeping anything factual, that could be percieved as criticism, jammed in the criticism subheading only.

<dd>I have trouble understanding your point of view. The fact that the article does not condemn bullfighting makes it pro? It is your opinion and your point of view that bullfighting is "cruel" and a "torture". Many disagree. So I would suggest that you keep your point of view out of the article.

<p>In "characteristic combination of intelligence, strength and attack-proneness", it may not be clear that the desired intelligence is not very high. A smart bull would not attack blindly but would check at the last moment the real position of the bullfighter. (I was told that cows don't attack blindly, that's way there are no cows in bullrings). Samewise, the strength and attack-proneness have to be limited. Too much and the bullfighter can't work. Too few and the show is just butchering. There is also the difference between <i>torerist</i> and <i>bullist</i> audiences.</p>

<p>That's rather interesting considering that Gimenéz Caballero was not only from Cadiz, a part of Spain in which antibullfighting sentiment is virtually unknown even today, but was a man of the extreme right. The overwhelming majority of Spaniards who are opposed to bullfighting are from areas in which there is little interest in bullfighting and are on the left end of the political spectrum. An Andalusian right winger opposed to bullfighting is quite atypical. There was concern for the welfare of animals involved in bullfighting in Spain during the 1920s, but it invariably advocated measures to protect horses rather than banning corridas. The custom of padding worn by horses in the bullfight dates from that era, according to Hemingway's "Death In The Afternoon"</p>

<p>A Mexican friend of mine has described the outcome when the bull wins the fight: the bull retires to a life of ease and breeding. In this sense, he argues, bullfighting is fairer to the bull than a traditional slaughterhouse where the animal has no chance of survival. I don't have any particular view on this - but it would be interesting to see a subheading on the subject. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 22:01, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This argument is quite common in Mexico, where the conditions in slaughterhouses are considered to be far worse than any fate which could befall a bull in a ring.</p>

<dd>This is almost correct. In certain, very rare, circumstances when a bull has been unusually brave the crowd can petition the president of the Corrida to pardon the bull.

<p>Well, for one there is a sentence in it that doesn't make much sense. Secondly, no one is quite sure or even relatively sure what happened in crete. what we have are some tantalizing but unfortunately vague murals etc. Is it bull leaping? Or are the 'leapers' being gored, sacrificed the bull? Is it ritualistic? Are the paintings merely symbolic? Ok. Thirdly, with that note, I highly doubt you can trace bullfighting back to crete. Yes. They had something go on with bulls. But it is highly doubtful that there is even an indirect connection between the minoans and this sort of bullfighting. I mean, randomly, if I had to guess, I'd say that a connection to the venationes of Rome and its empire...</p>

<p>where in the bullfighting world is 'matador' a common term for the torero? In the United States, amongst people who know absolutely nothing about bullfights, the word 'matador' is standard. But I have never encountered it in places where bullfighting actually occurs, and there are some comments to the same effect on the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matador.html" title="Matador">matador</a> page. It seems clear to me that that page should be moved to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torero.html" title="Torero">torero</a>, and that there should be some clarification on this page. But I don't feel qualified to make that clarification... Is 'matador' simply wrong? Is there somewhere where bullfights actually occur, and this word is used in favor of 'torero'?</p>

<dd>Matador is word used in the Spanish speaking world. The word in Spanish for bullfighter is torero. Not all Toreros are bullfighters. Matador is the highest level of torero. It is sort of like being in the major leagues. A particularly promising torero is presented at a major bull by a current matador (his sponsor, so to speak) and the older matador formally asks the novillero to kill one of his bulls for him at which point the torero is promoted to full matador.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloridan_4550.html" title="User:Floridan">Counsel</a> 18:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Matador is a Spanish word and is used in spanish. The Spanish version of Wiki has this to say about the varios levels of promotion among Toreros: "El torero tiene varias etapas de formación, obtenida por la práctica. La primera etapa es la de novillero, en la que se lidia novillos debido a su menor tamaño y fuerza, comenzando generalmente en festivales sin caballos, para luego pasar a novilladas con picadores de acuerdo a sus resultados. La segunda etapa es la de <b>matador</b>, donde el torero ha conseguido destreza suficiente para desarrollar con estilo y técnica todos los tercios de la lidia. Cuando un novillero logra, en teoría, los méritos necesarios alcanzar el grado de matador, realiza una corrida especial denominada alternativa. La alternativa se puede conseguir en cualquier plaza de toros de primera categoría; sin embargo generalmente los matadores realizan una confirmación de su alternativa en plazas de particular tradición como Las Ventas en Madrid o la Monumental de Ciudad de México." If you are not a spanish speaker, this says largely the same thing that I wrote in English above.</p>
<p>The assertion that the article as written should be moved to "Torero" is largely valid, however. The article is not particularly accurate right now. It confuses Matador with Toreros in general. The article under Toreador is flat wrong. Matador is used in Spanish. It is roughly (very roughly) analogous to saying "major leaguer" rather than "ball player". Torero is the more common word, however picadors, peones, novilleros, and rejoneadores are all toreros. Only a Torero who is skilled in the third tercio of the corrida <b>and</b> has been presented at Las Ventas or Monumental is a Matador. This is the person who works the bull with the muleta and kills him with the sword in a major bullfight. I think that this article should be corrected and clarified to explain the role of a Matador vis a vie the rest of the players in a corrida, or it should be expanded to include all of the Toreros in a corrida and moved to that title. I believe the latter is the better option.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloridan_4550.html" title="User:Floridan">Counsel</a> 17:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the part about a bull surviving as it happens so infrequently as to be almost misleading to include it as a regular cause of applause at a bullfight. One may be an active aficionado attending bullfights for his or her entire life and never see this happen. Also, it is not the first part (third) of the fight that is the most significant. The bull must show unusual bravery and often this is when the bull faces the picador as this is the most painful portion for the bull, but it is not necessarily dispositive. A bull that shown disregard for the discomfort and continues to go after the picador will win points wiht the crowd and the president. Also the performance in the third tercio will be important. the Indulto is only issued when the time to actually kill the bull arives after the faena.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloridan_4550.html" title="User:Floridan">Counsel</a> 00:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate that the language is clumsy, but the point is well made and the revert seems to me to be wrong.

<p>The article currently has a section which outlines allegation of cheating against the bull. The various charges are drawn from a Michener novel about Mexico which includes bullfights in rural Mexico in the 1920's or 30's. Today, Bravos bulls represent a massive investment in money and time. The suggestion that the breeders of these bulls, who's reputations and finacial well-being is determined by the performance of their bulls, would leave these animals unsupervised in a position to be abused immediatly before a bullfight strains credulity. Does anyone have a citation for these allegations where something like this has happened in the past 50 years? Is there anything to this other than the novel? If not, I suggest that the section be revised to reflect that these were allegations of abuse in the past or that a novel incuded such exploits.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloridan_4550.html" title="User:Floridan">Counsel</a> 17:04, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

But maybe that's just because I'm a newbie when it comes to bullfighting.&#160;;) Best regards, --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch">Plumcouch</a> 12:59, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't know why my back getting pain since last week untill yesterday which was the worst day for me and which was coinsident with the 7/7 2004 London bombing. This also reminds me of the Madrid bombing and the spain train crash last week.</p>
<p>Don't people get allert that this is a very karmic event and needs to be changed to a more civilized form?</p>
<p>Not only animal suffers and now this suffering is epidemic to human like me who is sensitive to the surrounding.</p>
<p>If this old fashined bullfighting doesn't change, more mad cow diseases and bulling of human insidents shall happen</p>

<p>From memory, there is an age limit to attending a corrida but either it is very low or is not enforced, because there may be children watching it. There should be a mention too of the television coverage of the corridas.</p>

<p>I removed this "(usually it is a violent choke)", which was located in the "Forcados" section. How can one say that it is done in that manner? I'd like to know if the person who wrote it is actually a "Forcado". Because think about it.... when the bull is charging fast towards the first guy, his job is to grab the bull by it's neck, because it's the only logical place to where he can securely hang on to while the bull is trying to toss him off. There are plenty of times where the front guy is dangling and barely hanging on the bull. Also, if the front guy is "violently" choking the bull, there would be no need for the rest of the guys to take the bull down. That's why it requires at least 8 guys to take on the bull, because the bull is stronger than them all. I'm also removing it because we don't need animal rights activist coming up with another reason why this is not fair game.</p>
<p>So, unless you are a true Forcado and can actual state how it is truly done, then please make or suggest the corrections.</p>
<p>One additional change I'd like to include (but I haven't done so) is the subject about the horns. It needs to state that when a bull is being fought by a Cavaleiro and grabbed by the Forcados, the horns are covered with a "leather wrap". And for the Matadores, the bulls are not covered nor are they severed. The point of the horn is significant and challenging..</p>
<p>I've read controversial/conversations on the subject of cutting the horns of a bull. Some say that when that occurs, the bull losses their balance. Although, I have documented on video of when the ganaderos have cut a small portion of the tip, filed it down a bit, and then covered it with duck tape. This was during a tienta (tenta), where they test the bulls. It was also for the safety of the amateurs participating in the arena. If anyone objects or has the true facts, please include here.</p>

It's not only Lusitano Horses that are used in Portuguese Bullfights and there is no mention of Manuel dos Santos or as he was (well) known in Spain "Manolo dos Santos - a Matador</p>
<p>And as it was said...there is no violent choke, one man cannot choke a 600 Kg Bull half an arena or sometimes almost the entire arena ALONE...and in 8 people, he is the one hagging in the horns and neck of the bull...the others are "fists aids", "second aids" "rabojador" (taile man) etc 18 Fev 2007</p>

<p>I noticed it is mentioned several times in your article that <i>"Nowadays, less than 10% of Spaniards support bullfighting"</i>. It also states a "citation needed" for this number. Why is it being shown then? It is a contraversial figure to say the least! It took me 5 minutes on Google to find several sources disagreeing with this figure and none stating anywhere near 10%. Most in fact stated around a 20 -30% figure and used much improved wording of "XX% of Spaniards <b>have no interest</b> in bullfighting", which to me more accurately represents a NPOV.</p>
<p>The two sources I have put below both appear to use results from the same recent survey (both articles are from January this year). They state 72% of Spaniards have no interest in bullfighting, 82% of "young people". I assume young people would mean under 18 but this is not stated. Surely this should replace the ridiculous and unsighted 10% currently used.</p>
