	    <p>Levels 51 to 60 Eastern Kingdoms The Blasted Lands - Contested The Blasted lands continue to be in play until about the mid 50's. See the writeup in the levels 41 to 50 section for more details. Burning Steppes - Contested</p>
<pre>
A Bleak Landscape 
</pre>
<p>The Burning Steppes are located just north of Redridge Mountains and are a continuation of the mountainous terrain from the northern edge of that zone. It gets worse though as this zone has no green areas, no water and is fairly barren other than orc, ogre, dwarf and dragonkin ruins and settlements. There are also several elementals and a Giant that rage around the area. In the south east corner of the zone there is a small Alliance settlement, and along the northern edge there is a neutral goblin settlement that also contains a Horde flight point. The Burning Steppes also contain the south entrance to Black Rock Mountain and therefore access to many instances (BRD, LBRS, UBRS, MC and BWL).</p>
<pre>
Dragon scale opportunities! 
</pre>
<p>The Burning Steppes is a high level zone with many wandering high level elite MOBs. It is meant for level 52-60 characters. The Burning Steppes has many Alliance only quests in it as well as a bunch for both factions and a few for Horde. The MOBs range from level 46-60 with many of them being elite. It is a zone that is farmed heavily for thorium and for black dragon scales so expect traffic in the zone at all times. There is really only one large quest chain in the zone, being the Dragonkin Menace, which leads to the Alliance Onyxia chain. All the other quests for both factions are simple single quests or 2 part quests. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Burning Steppes . You can also find a map of the zone here. The Burning Steppes have several items for herbalists, including some sungrass and moderate amounts of dreamfoil, mountain silversage, and black lotus. Black lotus is the highest end herbalist plant and requires 300 skill. It is only found in the Burning Steppes, Winterspring and Silithus so expect some competition for it, especially on a PvP server. The Burning Steppes also houses high end reagents for miners in the form of lots of mithril and an even bigger amount of Thorium, including the best spot to find rich thorium veins. Rich thorium veins are the only place to find arcane crystals and therefore they are in much demand. Despite having many dragonkin in the zone, skinners should not expect to find large amounts of leather and hides. What they do find is several skinning items that are more rare, such as silithid hides and black dragon scales, which are important to continue leatherworking. The skinning opportunities in the zone allow you to level from 240 to 290 in skill. The Western Plaguelands - Contested</p>
<pre>
Ruins of Andorhal 
</pre>
<p>The battleground against the Scourge takes place in the Western Plageulands as well as the adjoining Eastern Flagellants. In the Western Flagellants however there are mobs meant for combat from low 50's all the way up to 60th level. Be sure to pick up the Argent Dawn Commission upon entering the Plaguelands so you can begin killing undead for scourge stones, which will increase your reputation with the Argent Dawn and allow access to high end items. Lower end players should avoid the central city of Andorhal which is filled with higher end mobs meant for a 60th level party if you intend to take on the 62nd level lich guarding the city.</p>
<pre>
A Lich in Andorhal? 
</pre>
<p>The zone is full of undead in various forms, zombies, skeletons, ghouls and ghosts. There are also many undead beasts in the area to content with. The whole zone has a diseased appearance and is at times creepy and unsettling. Along the south edge is the ruined city of Andorhal and a graveyard full of undead, and to the north of the zone there are settlements for the Scarlet Crusade. To the south you can also find the level 60 instance of Scholomance an old school of magic now overrun by the undead. There are several quest chains in the Western Plaguelands including Of Love and Family and Doctor Theolen Krastinov, the butcher for both factions, and Scholomance, and Clear the Way for the Alliance side. The quest chain about love and family is an excellent one that involves many challenging quests and some excellent rewards at the end. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Western Plaguelands. You can also find a map of the zone here. For leveling up skill in professions the western plaguelands are not the best zone. Herbalists can only find moderate amounts of Arthas' tears, mountain silversage and plaguebloom in the zone, also while the Western plaguelands may have some mining opportunities, they are so limited that we have not found them. The western plaguelands do not house many beast for skinning, although they are all high level. They will require skill levels 255-270. The Eastern Plaguelands - Contested</p>
<pre>
Lights Hope Chapel 
</pre>
<p>The Eastern Plaguelands is meant for high end players of at least level 55. Many of the quests continue from the Western Plaguelands into the eastern. The Eastern Plaguelands is a much more difficult zone though with many grouped, elite or fear causing MOBs. The MOBs range from 49-62 elite, most of the MOBs are around level 55. There are many quests located here for both factions, although the Horde has several more available to just them. The Eastern Plaguelands contains the instance city of Stratholme as well as one of the best farming areas in the game "Tyr's Hand". Stratholme is located along the northern edge of the zone, while Tyr's Hand is located in the south-east corner.</p>
<pre>
Blighted Horrors 
</pre>
<p>The whole zone appears diseased and infected and can be very creepy. Being one of the higher level zones it can be very difficult to solo at parts. However there are some real opportunities for loot in the zone. A prime example are the blighted horrors in the lake just west of Lights Hope Chapel that drop Essence of Water, which is used in high level crafting and sells for a fair amount of gold. The Easter Plaguelands house a large number of quests however most are single quests or part of quests in chains from other zones. The only large quest chain that starts in the Eastern Plaguelands is the Ranger Lord's Behest by Nathanos Blightcaller for the Horde faction. It has some excellent reward items, and is a must do for many Horde characters. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Eastern Plaguelands. You can also find a map of the zone here. Herbalists can only find moderate amounts of Arthas' tears, mountain silversage and plaguebloom in the zone, although plaguebloom can only be found in the plaguelands and sometimes in Felwood so it will be in demand. There is some mining in the eastern plaguelands in the form of moderate amounts of thorium veins found around the two alcoves into the mountains that house ziggurats. The first is located directly north of Darrowshire and the other just north of Lights Hope Chapel. While not as plentiful as the Burning Steppes it is still a good source of thorium and of rich thorium veins for arcane crystals. The eastern plaguelands do not house many beast for skinning, although they are all high level. They will require skill levels 265-280. Kalimdor Azshara- Contested Azshara is a zone that mixes several different environements. To the north and south there the zone is made up of forest areas on tall cliffs. While in the center of the zone and to the east the zone is ruins scattered over a coastal area and out into the ocean on islands and beneath the sea. The spirits in the ruins along the coast have decent drops for both gold and items so the zone ussually has several players farming them, so stays fairly lively, especially on a PvP server. Azshara comes into play in the low 50's and has many solo quests to be done. Azshara contains many more quests for Horde than Alliance and if you are Horde is well worth investing time in. The quests mainly involve killing MOBs throughout the area. The MOBs in Azshara are from level 45-57 and several of them are elite. The zone also has some areas to be careful of as it contains several higher level wandering elites, like the Cliff Breakers giants. Azshara goes up to about mid 50's before experience gain becomes too meager to really continue. Azshara also contains the outdoor raid boss Azuregos so be prepared to see raid groups of level 60's wandering the south-eastern area of the zone. One of the most important quest chains of the game starts in Azshara. It is the Poisoned Water quest chain from Duke Hydraxis that is for both factions. It is the chain that leads you through a series of Molten Core runs to earn a very good good ring with fire resist on it. In addition to this quest there is the Stealing Knowledge quest chain for Horde. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Azshara . You can also find a map of the zone here. The zone is only passable for gathering profesions as there are better zones at the level that provide more items. For herbalists there is some strangelkelp, sungrass, and dreamfoil along with a moderate amount of purple lotus. For miners there is a high amount of truesilver and a moderate amount of thorium. The issue with mining in the zone is that often the vien is either up on the cliffs or down by the water, ussually whichever place you are not (at least with my luck). There are a quite a few dragonkin in the south area of the zone as well as many other beasts to skin. Combined they should allow you to level skinning from 200 - 275, as well as collect a few blue dragon scales which can be either sold for profit or used in dragonscale leatherworking. Aszhara is one of only two zones that provides blude dragonscales. Moonglade - Contested Moonglade is an area that Druids gain access to early in the game, however most other players do not until they gain reputation with the Timbermaw Furbolg who will then allow them through the tunnel into Moonglade and Winterspring. There have been several festival quests that occur in Moonglade but other than that there is not much to do in the zone if you are not a druid. This may change in the future. There is no gathering of any kind that takes place in Moonglade. Silithus - Contested This zone is the home of the Silithid hives and is meant for a minimum of at least 55th level characters. The zone contains MOBs of level 49-60 and many of them are elite. With three different Silithid hives as well as several wandering mobs and Twilight Hammer encampments this zone has some defiantly interesting encounters. Patch 1.7 also saw the addition of a new city to the zone, Cenarion Hold. Since patch 1.9 the southern part of this zone, the ruins of Ahn'Qiraj was unlocked via a "World Event". Silithus is home to many elementals wandering the desert and hence is a favoride place for players to farm elemental essences. The ruined temple of Ahn'Qiraj is made up of two seperate instances. The Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ20) a 20 man instance and The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ40) a 40 man raid instance. Both are extremely difficult, and should only be atempted in a guild raid. There are more quests in Silithus than you can shake a stick at. So many that on a PvP server entering the zone is asking for trouble because it is that busy, all the time. Many of the quests are chain quests and almost all the quests in the zone are for both factions. The major chains are Aurel Goldleaf, Deadly Desert Venom, The Twilight Mystery and more! For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Silithus . You can also find a map of the zone here. For Herbalists you can find several different herbs, however many of them you will not need any more. The biggest exception is the small amount of black lotus that you can find in the zone. Besides the lotus you can find moderate amounts of sungrass, dreamfoil, and mountain silversage. For miners there isn't much of interest in the zone other than the odd truesilver, which you probably don't need anymore of. Skinners can find a very high number of beasts to skin in the zone including many silithid that will provide both light and heavy silithid carapace. The Un'Goro Crater - Contested Out of a bad Sci-fi dream comes a 50+ level zone filled with dinosaurs, walking plants, elementals and strange insect creatures. You spend your time in this zone adventuring under a canopy of towering trees through most of the zone, other than the center, where you are under a cloud of ash, being spewed forth from a might volcano. The MOBs are between 45 and 55 in level and this zone is great for low to mid 50's level characters. While adventuring though, take care to avoid the wandering level 55+ elite Devilsaurs that stalk the zone. There are many quests in the zone and it is a solid place to level for all low 50 characters. Most of the quests are for both factions. The main quest chains in the zone are Crystals of Power, It's a Secret to Everybody, and Chasing A-Me 01. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Un'Goro . You can also find a map of the zone here. Un'Goro Crater houses many different items for the gathering professions and since you will likely spend some time here, you should try to level your skills as you go. For Herbalists you can find a moderate amount of blindweed, dreamfoil, and mountain silversage. Miners can dig up a fair amount of thorium as wel as the odd bit of truesilver. Skinners generally love the zone as it has a very high number of beasts that provide leathers and hides, as well as being the exclusive home of the Devilsaur and therefor the only place to find devilsaur hide. In addition to the normal gathering profession items in Un'Goro there are different colored crystals that can be found around the zone. They are used for quests early on, but later can be used to create buffs that can be helpful in end game instances. It is well worth the effort to learn how to create them. Winterspring - Contested Winterspring is a zone meant for high-level characters of at the very least 55+. Accessing this zone requires passage through a tunnel out of Felwood that is inhabited by Timbermaw Furbolg who will attack unless you have gained reputation with them. This zone does maintain a neutral goblin town of Everlook that holds several rare suppliers. The main quest chains in the zone are Are we There, Yeti and Falling to Corruption for both factions. There is also Luck Be With You for the Horde and Enraged Wildkin for the Alliance. The Battle of Darrowshire chain also starts in the zone with the Sister Pamela quest, even though most of the chain is completed elsewhere. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for the Winterspring . You can also find a map of the zone here. Wihnterspring is an important place for gathering professions as it is one of the only places to gather blue dragon scales for skinners and high icecap for herbalists. In addition herbalists can find moderate amounts of wild steelbloom, mountain silversage, and more importantly black lotus. Skinners can find many dragonkin and other beasts to level thier skill from 250 - 300. Most important is the dragon scales that can be collected. Miners are not left out in this zone eather as it has a high concetration of Thorium and is generally less busy that the Burning Steppes. Instances Blackrock Depths - Contested Blackrock Depths (BRD) is located in Blackrock Mountain between the Searing Gorge and the Burning Steppes and is meant for levels 50-56. There are many quests located in BRD and it is an excellent place to level when you are mid 50's. Blackrock Depths also contains the entrance point that must be reached to access the Molten Core for the first time. The instance is full of Dark Iron Dwarves and elementals. Most of the quests revolve around the Dark Iron Dwarves or the various elementals in the area. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for Blackrock Depths . For miners there are several places that you can mine dark iron in the instance. It is also where you must travel to to create dark iron bars and to turn them into items, so prepare for multiple trips back here. Lower Blackrock Spire - Contested Lower Blackrock Spire (LBRS) is located in Blackrock Mountain between the Searing Gorge and the Burning Steppes and is meant for levels 52-58. While called Lower Blackrock Spire there really is only one instance. The distinction is made to easily refer to the lower area that you need to complete to get the key to open the upper area, and the area after that door. The lower area is filled with a variety of MOBs feature Ogres, wolves, spiders and more! It is a fairly long instance and you will need to run it multiple times if you want to get your own key to Upper Blackrock Spire. While it can be a very entertaining instance, many people pass it by for better loot in the upper portion and some of the other high level instances. Finding a group for it is sometimes very difficult, which can be annoying for Horde players as you need to run it for several quests including the start of the Onyxia attunement chain. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for Blackrock Spire . Upper Blackrock Spire - Contested Upper Blackrock Spire (UBRS) is located in Blackrock Mountain between the Searing Gorge and the Burning Steppes and is meant for levels 56-60 in a 10 man raid group. While Blizzard says it is a 10 man 56-60 level raid, to clear it to the end you really need to all be 60. While called Upper Blackrock Spire there really only is one Blackrock Spire instance. The distinction is made to easily refer to the lower area that you need to complete to get the key to open the upper area, and the area after that door. The Upper area houses Blackrock Orcs, Dragonkin and several bosses. All are elite and at least level 58. The key bosses are Rend, The Beast and General Drakkisath. All three are required for various quests and items, and you will more than likely spend a lot of time running this instance to finish quests and find specific set items that you need. Also General Drakkisath's blood is required for both factions Onyxia Attunement chains. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for Blackrock Spire . Dire Maul - Contested Dire Maul (DM) is located in the center of Feralas and is an instance with three-separate wings for levels 56-60. The instance takes place in an ancient city and each of the three wings has a different type of MOB to deal with. This Instance has some very interesting loot including a class based trinket for each class that is a must have for the end game due to its fire resistance bonus. The East instance is full of mainly plant and demon MOBs and is the first area you must clear. You have to do this first as it is the only unlocked instance and the only place you can find the Crescent Key which will open the doors to the other two wings. It also houses the completion area for mages to gain the ability to conjure Crystal Water. The West instance houses mainly undead and elementals. It is also the way that you must go to defeat Immol'thar so that you can fight the Prince in the Library. To get to Immol'thar you must fight your way through the instance and destroy the elementals that are guarding each of five crystal pylons. Once all the pylons are destroyed then Immol'thar will be attackable. The North instance is generally referred to as a tribute run and is full of Ogres. To complete this run successfully you must avoid killing all of the named ogre guards that you come across and then make an ogre costume to get by the last ones. You can then get to King Gordok and kill him while leaving Cho'Rush the observer alive. When the King dies, Cho'Rush will declare you the new King of Dire Maul and spawn a chest with treasure. For a complete list of quests in the zone check out our TenTonHammer database entries for Dire Maul . Stratholme - Contested</p>
<pre>
Final Boss in Scarlet Stratholme 
</pre>
<p>Stratholme (Strat) is located along the northern edge of the eastern plague lands. The nearest flight point for both factions is Light's Hope Chapel. Stratholme itself is usually referred to by the two possible entrances that you can take to it. They are the scarlet (referred to as either Live Strat or Scarlet Strat) and the undead (UD Strat) sides. While both are connected inside the instance, players generally do one "side" or the other, not both. To enter the Scarlet side you just follow the path and road signs to Stratholme and enter though the main gates. To enter the undead side you follow the road to just before entering the plague woods and turn north, there is a gate entrance along the mountains. The gate is locked however unless you have the key to the city. Strathome is meant for levels 55-60 but really needs you to be all 59 or 60. We have several great resources for Stratholme including a complete guide to Stratholme here: TenTonHammer's Guide to Stratholme, a map of the instance, and a gallery. Also you can find a complete list of quests in the zone in our TenTonHammer quest database. Scholomance - Contested Scholomance (scholo) is located in the Western Plaguelands and is meant for levels 57-60. It can be done as a 5 man group to complete quests (with great difficulty if they are not all level 60) or as a 10 man raid to "farm" it for loot. Scholomance is full of undead MOBs of level 55-60 almost all of which are elite. The Bosses in the instance are up to level 62 elite. Many of the first level class set items are found here so it is a popular instance to run at level 60. Onyxia's Lair - Contested</p>
<pre>
Onyxia in Flight 
</pre>
<p>Onyxia's lair is a very small 40 man instance, really meant as a training instance for raid groups. Once the tactics are down it becomes a very easy fight. Before you can enter Onyxia's chamber and even attempt to defeat her though, you must complete an epic series of quests to get a key. The key is in fact an amulet that "attunes" you to the instance and allows entry to her lair. The quest chain for Horde and Alliance races are very different, but both very long and difficult. We have a complete guide to both the attunement process and the fight tactics required to defeat Onyxia here: TenTonHammer's Guide to Onyxia. Zul'Gurub - Contested</p>
<pre>
Map of Zul'Gurub 
</pre>
<p>Zul'Gurub (ZG) is a 20 man raid instance in Stranglethorn Vale for level 60 players. It houses many different Troll bosses that need to be defeated before fighting the final Boss Hakkar. The boss fights are amazing and are all scripted fights, on top of this they have tons of epic loot. The instance itself is much easier than Molten Core and because it is 20 man, easier to organize. It is generally not an instance that you can do with a pickup group though. Many of the fights are very tough and must be coordinated well. This generally means you need to be in a guild to complete it. As you make your way to Hakkar you must kill 5 of his High Priests. The named Trolls you must kill are Jeklik, Venoxis, Mar'li, Thekal and Arlokk. If you do not kill the them they will grant Hakkar the abilities that will help him in thee fight with him. With these abilities it will be very hard if not impossible to defeat him. We have heard of groups that have defeated him with 1 ability left active and rumors of 2. To our knowledge no one has been able to defeat him without any of the Priests being downed. This may change in time though. For a list of the abilities granted, complete tactics on each boss fight and more, read our complete guide to Zul'Gurrub here: TenTonHammer's Guide to the Zul'Gurub Bosses. Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj - Contested</p>
<pre>
General Rajaxx 
</pre>
<p>The Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ20) are an incredibly fun, fast small group raid instance located in southern Silithus. It is very easy to complete the entire instance (once you understand the strategies) in an evening. Many of the bosses introduce very interesting fight mechanics and are in general a lot of fun, while not being overly difficult. In addition there is some very nice loot drops. These combine to make what is one of the most fun instances in the game, in my opinion. This is definitely an instance that you want to spend some time in, Blizzard got this one just right. The quests for Ahn'Qiraj are given out at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. Several quests are class specific and also reputation specific, meaning you can only complete them once you have earned a set amount of reputation with the Cenarion faction. The rewards for the class / Reputation based quests are a ring at honored, a cloak at revered and a weapon at exalted. The items are also part of a set, so when you complete the set of three you earn an additional bonus. For a list of tactics on the trash mobs, each boss fight, reputation items, and more, read our complete guide to Ahn'Qiraj here: TenTonHammer's Guide to the the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj.</p>
<p>Molten Core - Contested</p>
<pre>
Map of the Molten Core 
</pre>
<p>Molten Core (MC) is an extremely difficulty 40 person raid that contains the first tier epic armor set for classes. All the MOBs in Molten Core are level 60 elite and higher. The objective of the Molten Core is to defeat Ragnaros. To do so you need to defeat 9 preliminary bosses on your way to him. Tons of epic items drop in the Molten Core, however you need to be in an organized guild with lots of good equipment to be able to run the core.</p>
<pre>
Core Hounds 
</pre>
<p>The Molten Core can be found in the heart of Blackrock Mountain. To get to it you must be attuned through a long quest chain. Once you are you can get to it through a portal at the base of the chain in the center of the mountain. The bosses that must be defeated in the Molten Core are Lucifron, Magmadar, Gehennas, Garr, Baron Geddon, Shazzrah, Golemagg, Sulfuron, MajorDomo and Ragnaros. Most are fire based so having as much fire resistance gear as possible is critical for this instance. Many guilds attempt the instance and then get frustrated at wiping all the time, then farm gear and find it easy. Take my advise and get the gear first, it will save some huge repair bills. By the way, not only are the bosses hard, but until you learn the tactics on the Trash MOBs, they can cause many issues as well. You can find a complete guide to defeating the Molten Core bosses here: TenTonHammer's Guide to the Molten Core Bosses. Blackwing Lair - Contested Blackwing Lair (BWL) is meant for a full raid of 40 level 60 players with all the best Molten Core loot already secured. All the MOBs in Blackwing Lair are level 60 elite and higher. Blackwing lair houses the Tier 2 armor set. Blackwing Lair is a heavily secured fortress residing at the top of the Blackrock Mountains. Once owned by the Dark Iron Dwarves as one their largest fortress, it now is in the hands of the evil Nefarian, the son of the black dragonflights leader, Deathwing. Nefarian, using this fortress as his base of operations, plans to mix the various bloods of the dragons to form an ultimate dragon race which he will use to slay Ragnaros and conquer all of Azeroth. You can find our complete guide to Blackwing lair here: TenTonHammer's Guide to Blackwing Lair. Temple of Ahn'Qiraj - Contested The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj is the 40 man raid instance in Silithus. It is 3rd in difficulty of the 40 man raids. The bosses scale from about as hard as Molten Core bosses at the beginning to much harder that anything in Blackwing Lair by the end. For many of the bosses you will need to farm nature resist gear in the same way you had to farm fire resist gear for Molten Core. We currently do not have a guide for the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, if you know the instance and would like to submit a guide for publishing, please contact us. Naxxramas - Contested Naxxramas is a 40 man raid instance found in a floating necropolis over the Plaguelands. It is the hardest instance in the game before the expansion is released. It also houses the best gear in the game including the tier 3 armor set. To gain access to it you must first gain faction with the Argent Dawn and then complete a quest. Be prepared though that once you are attuned you may enter, but are probably not ready for it. Unless you have completed all previous instances the tactics and teamwork required here, even for the trash MOBs, will likely mean many wipes. We currently do not have a guide for Naxxramas, if you know the instance and would like to submit a guide for publishing, please contact us. Hellfire Peninsula - Contested Hellfire Peninsula is a dark war torn region and the first area of the Outlands that you are going to visit as it is the location of the other side of the Dark Portal. Upon entering you will find the Dark Portal under siege by the Burning Legion. To get to your faction city in the zone you can find a flight master on the steps of the Dark Portal that will fly you to either Honor Hold (Alliance) or Thrallmar (Horde). While the Hellfire Peninsula is accessible to players lower than level 60, it is really meant for levels 60-62. Lower level players can easily get squashed over and over again by some very difficult MOBS. Blizzards Description of Hellfire Peninsula: Once a lush and verdant land, Hellfire Peninsula is now a dry, barren wasteland rendered lifeless by the dark practices of orc warlocks. It is here that the Dark Portal stands, cementing the peninsula's place in history as the site of many pitched battles between the Alliance and Horde. The nefarious Burning Legion has gathered here also, using the area as a staging ground for its apocalyptic crusade. As with all the zones in the Outlands, Hellfire Peninsula is packed full of quests, so many that you are unlikely to complete all of them before being ready to move onto a new zone. The quests for both factions start out at your starting city and then expand to secondary towns and encampments throughout the zone, including the secondary flight points at the Temple of Telhamat (Alliance) and Falcon Watch (Horde). A complete list of quests in Hellfire Peninsula can be found in our database here: TenTonHammer Quest Database Results for Hellfire Peninsula along with our Map of Hellfire Peninsula. The zone contains a world PvP feature which is the Hellfire Fortifications. The fortifications are made up of Broken Hill, the Overlook and the Stadium. Whichever faction holds all three gets a +5% damage buff while in the zone. You also receive honor tokens when killing enemy players in these areas that can be turned in for rewards. The Hellfire Citadel is also located in the region, which houses four instances that you will want to check out, they are: Instance MOB Levels # of Players Hellfire Ramparts 60 - 62 5 The Blood Furnace 61 - 63 5 The Shattered Halls 70 - 72 5 Magtheridon's Lair 72+ 25 You can find guide for these (and other) instances on our Burning Crusade Instance Guide page. For Miners you are able to find tons of the new ore type: fel iron ore, in the zone. An especially good place is around behind the Dark Portal as there are at least a dozen spawn points back. For players collecting herbs, you can find the new Dreaming Glory and Felweed throughout the zone. Zangarmarsh - Contested Zangarmarsh is the second area you are likely to explore in the Outlands and is a completely different looking zone. It is a lush swamp covered with giant mushrooms that form a forest canopy overhead. The zone is meant for level 60 - 64 players and is teaming with MOBS. Most of the creatures are swamp type invertebrates or plant life, such as Fungal Giants, Spore Walkers, Nags, Crabs and Spore Bats. Blizzards Description of Zangarmarsh: Zangarmarsh is a tranquil area that has largely evaded the demonic influence. The marsh's innumerable lakes and pools are clean of any taint, and most native animals and fungi give off soothing phosphorescent light. Only recently has the area's self-contained ecology faltered. Something is causing the water levels to drop. The marsh's giant mushrooms are dying, as are the creatures that rely upon the mushrooms for food. Zangarmash houses 2 towns per faction and a town that is visitable by both factions run by the Cenarion Expedition. There are 2 flight points per faction in the zone, one at each factional town: Telredor and Orebor Harborage for Alliance players and Swamprat Post and Zabra'jin for the Horde. There are a huge number of quests in the zone, and a complete list of them can be found in our database here: TenTonHammer Quest Database Results for Zangarmarsh along with our Map of Zangarmarsh. The zone contains a world PvP feature which is the Twin Spire Ruins. The ruins are made up of an East and West spire and a central tower and graveyard. Whichever faction holds both spires and plants a flag at the central tower gets a +5% damage buff while in the zone. You also receive honor tokens when killing enemy players in these areas that can be turned in for rewards. The Coilfang Reservoir is also located in the region, which houses four instances that you will want to explore, they are: Instance MOB Levels # of Players The Slave Pens 62 - 64 5 The Underbog 63 - 65 5 The Steamvault 70 - 72 5 Serpentshrine Cavern 72+ 25 You can find guide for these (and other) instances on our Burning Crusade Instance Guide page. For Miners you are able to find fel iron ore and Adamantite ore throughout the zone, but mainly near rocky cliffs. For players collecting herbs, you can Blindweed, Dreamfoil, Dreaming Glory, Felweed, glowcap, Golden Sansam and Ragveil throughout the zone. Terokkar Forest - Contested The Terokkar Forest is a zone with several different areas in it. To the north of the zone it is a lush forest with many types of wild life roaming though it. Also to the north the main city in the Outlands can be found: Shattrath City. However once you start heading south the zone becomes desolate as you enter the Bone Wastes. In the wastes you encounter many types of darker more sinister MOBs, such as spirits, vultures, spiders and demon worshipers. Also in the Bone Wastes you can find Auchindoun an ancient Draenei temple that is now an instance area. Terokkar Forest houses the main capital in the outlands which is Shattrath city as well as one town per faction, Allerian Stronghold for Alliance and Stonebreaker Hold for the Horde. All three have flight points for easy travel. There are a huge number of quests in the zone, and a complete list of them can be found in our database here: TenTonHammer Quest Database Results for Terokkar Forest along with our Map of Terokkar Forest . The zone contains a world PvP feature called the Spirit Towers. The Spirit Towers are five towers that surround the Auchindoun instance area. Whichever faction captures all five towers gets a +5% damage buff while in the zone which is locked in for 6 hours, at which point the buff will be lost and all towers become fair game again. You also receive honor tokens when killing enemy players in these areas that can be turned in for rewards. Auchindoun (an instance area) is also located in the region, which houses four instances that you will want to explore, they are: Instance MOB Levels # of Players Mana Tombs 64-66 5 Auchenai Crypts 65-67 5 Sethekk Halls 67-69 5 Shadow Labyrinth 70-72 5 You can find guide for these (and other) instances on our Burning Crusade Instance Guide page. Instances Hellfire Ramparts - Contested</p>
<p>Omor Defeated! The Hellfire Ramparts are the first wing of the Hellfire Citadel and are generally referred to as simply the Ramparts. The Citadel straddles the path of glory leading to the Dark Portal and contains 3 other instances. The Citadel is the home of the Fel Orcs in Hellfire Peninsula and was built by Blackhand and Gul’dan and still houses the Kargath Bladefist. The Ramparts instance is set on the walls of the citadel and you can look out and see the whole zone in spectacular view in several places. The Hellfire Ramparts are the first instance that you are likely to do in the Burning Crusade. Much of the loot that is found is on par or will replace tier 1 epic gear. Players that have not raided in the past will be very happy with the rewards and should run this instance several times to get all gear for their class. You can find all the quests in our WoW Database here, and a complete walk through guide here: TenTonHammer's Guide to The Hellfire Ramparts. Blood Furnace - Contested</p>
<p>Keli'dan the Breaker The Blood Furnace is the second wing of the Hellfire Citadel and are generally referred to as the Furnace. It is meant for players level 61-62. The citadel itself straddles the path of glory leading to the Dark Portal and contains 3 other instances. The Citadel is the home of the Fel Orcs in Hellfire Peninsula and was built by Blackhand and Gul’dan and still houses the Kargath Bladefist. There are many new mobs and several interesting trash MOBs in the Blood Furnace. While making your way through the instance you should be aware of at least the following: Shadowmoon Technicians (who throw dynamite at you), Nascent Fel Orcs (a new type of orc), and Laughing Skull Rogues (who can pop out of no where and gut your casters and healers). You can find all the quests in our WoW Database here, and a complete walk through guide here: TenTonHammer's Guide to The Blood Furnace . The Slave Pens - Contested</p>
<p>Mennu the Betrayer The The Slave Pens are meant for players level 62 - 64 and are the first of four instances located in the Coilfang Reservoir deep in Zangarmarsh. The Coilfang Reservoir is a strange instance area as it is an underwater pumping station built for some as yet unknown reason adjoining a complex of caves. Even though it is located underwater they are full of air. The predominant MOB type in the instance are Nagas and aquatic wild life in many different forms. The Slave Pens themselves house mainly Naga MOBs and their Draenei slaves, but the bosses (other than the first) are various forms of sea and swamp life. You can find all the quests in our WoW Database here, and a complete walk through guide here: TenTonHammer's Guide to The Slave Pens . The Underbog - Contested</p>
<p>Ghaz'an The Underbog is the second instance in the Coilfang Reservoir area and meant for players level 63-65. Even though most of the instances in the Coilfang Reservoir are mainly full of Nagas, the Underbog is more occupied by wildlife than anything else. There are some naga, but predominantly it is full of sporebats, giants, wasps, and other creatures. You can find all the quests in our WoW Database here, and a complete walk through guide here: TenTonHammer's Guide to The Underbog .</p>

A quick guide to players' tools of destruction in World of Warcraft Perhaps you thought your warrior was stuck with the big hammer he was born holding, or that your mage couldn't equip a sword in the tradition of a certain white wizard of yore. I did, until a kindly soul introduced me to the local weapon master, and unwittingly prompted the idea for the guide set before you know. While weaponry is more crucial for front-line melee'ers, just about any class can benefit from an understanding of the attribute boosts provided by weapons and other equipment; something discussed later in this article. Before we get into the crux of the issue, let's take a moment to understand the weapon's stats: the information presented to you when you mouse-over the weapon's icon. Understanding Damage and DPS Damage is a hitpoint range describing how much hurt you'll put on your target per hit, and speed is how often you'll have a chance to hit. The damage range and speed (or "delay" between swings) in your weapon stats culminate in a value called "damage per second." This number is a simple average of the damage range divided by speed; it does not take into account critical damage, weapon bonuses (which typically benefit fast weapons more than slow ones; since bonuses are applied to each hit and faster weapons obviously hit more often) and the range of special abilities your character may enjoy by using a certain type of weapon. Nonetheless, DPS is an important baseline value when comparing weapons which otherwise similarly complement your skills and abilities. Weapon Speed (Or Why a Slow 44 DPS Weapon May Beat Out A Fast 44 DPS Weapon) There are times when you want a fast weapon, such as when you're fighting casters and want more chances to interrupt their spellcasting. More often, however, you'll want to use as slow a weapon as you can find with the biggest max damage. Many abilities cue off of the weapon's damage to determine ability damage. Also, many of these abilities are "instants" - or instantly applied within the same combat round as your normal melee swings. This means that if you have an ability that does a bonus of 100% weapon damage, and you only have a 2.0 speed weapon that hits for 75-100 per hit (or roughly 44dps) , it will do 100 base damage + 100 bonus damage. If you had a 4.0 speed weapon that did 150-200 (still roughly 44dps), it would do 200 base + 200 bonus damage. Since most of these abilities are on a cooldown timer of some duration (10-30 seconds) it means you will get to use it the same number of times per minute for each weapon. Assume a 10 second cooldown and the ability above. With the fast 44dps weapon you would get additional 600 damage over the course of 1 minute (assuming you have mana, rage, energy to use the ability every 10 seconds). If you did the same with the slow 44dps weapon you would cause an additional 1200 damage over the same time (Thanks to Messiah for this explanation!). One-Handed (1H) &amp;Two-Handed (2H) Weapons, and Dual Wield The pros and cons of using 1H vs. 2H vs. a Dual Wield setup is a hotly-debated topic. To my mind, you can't go wrong if you accomodate your playstyle, maximize your crucial stats, and finally maximize your overall DPS (as opposed to the simple DPS reported in your weapons stats - a UI mod like CTMod is useful for computing "overall" DPS), you can't go far wrong. I'll leave a detailed statistical analysis to the mathmaticians; we'll stick to the basics. The primary benefit to using a one-handed weapons is that your off-hand is free to carry a shield or stat-boosting item. Other advantages include the aforementioned damage bonus being applied more often, the fact that more "hits" due to the higher speed of these weapons give you more chances to interrupt a caster (not to mention a higher chance of your weapon proc'ing- for a definition of proc, see below). Dual wield allows some classes (at a later point in the game) to equip a second one-handed weapon in exchange for a higher percentage of misses. Slower two-handed weapons do an incredible amount of damage for the reasons mentioned in the "Weapon Speed" section. So which is the right approach for you? It pretty much comes down to playstyle and stats. A shield opens up a whole line of abilities for warriors and paladins geared toward protection, so its probably pretty important for meatshields to carry a one-handed weapon. Rogues need a dagger (a weapon seemingly favored by many DPS classes) to carry out their backstab-related abilities. Casters need a lot of intellect, and staves, polearms, and daggers typically provide. For all the classes however, stats are king, and your weapons loadout should perhaps be slightly more geared to stats than DPS performance. To a point. It's hard to see how a 15 DPS weapon could ever win out stats-wise over a 25 DPS weapon for a melee-intensive character. You might have seen this graph before, but it's important to understand what attributes contribute to your playstyle: Stat Bonuses from Weapons &amp; Other Equipment Stat Benefit The "Math" Best for... Strength Higher DPS, better chance to block 1 Strength = +2 Attack Power 14 Attack Power = +1 DPS (Damage per second)... Therefore, 7 Strength = +1 DPS Balanced melee roles Agility More melee critical hits, better chance to dodge, primary attribute for damage (rogues &amp; hunters only) 2 Agility = 1 Armor point 20 Agility = +1% to Critical hit (Rogues require 29 agility points to generate +1% Crit, +1% Dodge, Hunters require 53 points per pecent increase of Dodge and chance of Critical Hit) 20 Agility = +1% to Dodge Offensive roles / burst combat (PvP) Spirit Increases health &amp; mana regen 4 Spirit = 1 Mana regenerated every 2 seconds Magic users in an evenly-paced setting (e.g. a PvE dungeon crawl) where limited rest time is available between battles Stamina Increases hitpoint pool 1 Stamina = 10 Health points Defensive roles Intellect Increases mana pool, slightly more magical critical hits 1 Intellect = 15 Mana 1 Intellect = +.01% to Critical Hit on spells (small, but it can add up!) All casters As I was saying, some weapons are better suited to some of these stats rather than others. Swords, axes, and maces are more likely to carry bonuses to strength and stamina, while some say daggers and staves are more likely to provide intellect and spirit boosts. Agility seems pretty well divided between all the weapons (from my cursory overview of the market on my shard). Be sure to look into the higher branches of your talent tree to see if you'd like to build your character to take advantage of any particular weapon-based abilities. Procs &amp; Other Weapon Bonuses A proc is a chance to trigger a special bonus attack. The percentage chance of a proc is measured in PPM, or procs per minute- weapons with procs usually have a set PPM. PPM is then compared to the weapons speed and converted to a percentage base per hit.</p>
<p>So for example if you are dealing with a 6ppm weapon proc: 2.0 spd wep: 2.0 (seconds per swing)/ 10 (seconds per proc) = .2 procs per swing. = 20% proc/swing</p>
<p>3.5 spd wep: 3.5 (seconds per swing)/ 10 (seconds per proc) = .35 procs per swing. = 35% proc/swing What this means is that in general you are much better off with a slower weapon to get procs on more hits. Other weapons offer bonuses to healing skills, shadow, etc. Be sure to read through all the information available on a weapon before committing to buy it (or sell it at a certain price, for that matter). Some weapon bonuses can really rack up the damage; e.g. a fire damage bonus would tear up against "cold" enemies. Ranged Weapons From my own unofficial analysis of the DPS stats of higher-end bows, crossbows, and guns, the three types of melee-class ranged weapons seem fairly similar. Crossbows are toughest to find (having the least variety), and are slow, but hit for the hardest- which might be best for one-shot pullers like warriors. Back-row death-dealers might enjoy using bows (which hit for slightly more) or guns (which are oh-so-slightly faster, and look wicked cool!). Mages and warlocks have their own form of ranged weapon: their wand. Wands can be interrupted just like traditional ranged weapons, but can be used when a caster is stifled, but have no activation cost to use and generate little aggro.. Weapons Each Class Can Equip Either through inherent knowledge, weapons master training, or talents, each class can learn to use a variety of weapons. The "Xs" and notations below indicate which class can equip which weapon type.

<p>Blacksmithing Guide The profession of Blacksmithing is a primary trade skill in the World of Warcraft. When choosing Blacksmithing as a primary skill, make sure you really want it, as you may only have two skills at one. Also when you choose Blacksmithing you are pretty much locked into taking Mining as your second primary skill. You are able to unlearn trade skills but if you do this, you will lose all your skill points in it. If you were to start Blacksmithing again you would have to start from the bottom, not at your last skill level. What items do blacksmiths produce? Blacksmiths produce a variety of useful items, the main two types however are armor (mail and plate) and Weapons. Blacksmiths also produce: • Sharpening stones and counterweights for boosting weapon damage for short periods of time. • Keys for unlocking chests • Rods for enchanters • Buckles for leather workers • Spurs for boots to increase mount speed • Shield spikes to cause damage to enemies when you block their attacks Is there a complete list of Blacksmith produced items? YES! We at TenTonHammer have produced a complete list of blacksmith items, their abilities skill and items required to create them and much more. We maintain them in HTML format and as a PDF ready to download and print as a handy reference.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>TenTonHammer's Reference Guide to Blacksmithing TenTonHammer's Reference Guide to Blacksmithing (PDF)</p>
<p>Who uses Blacksmithing? Usually classes that can use mail and / or plate armor benefit from Blacksmithing. Warriors and Paladins benefit the most as they are able to use all the armor that can be produced by blacksmithing. Other classes can gain some benefit from blacksmithing for example: key creation, weapon creation, profit, etc. Why should I be a Blacksmithing? Blacksmithing is an excellent choice if you want to make your own armor and weapons, or if you want to make armor and weapons for your friends or to sell and trade. Being a Blacksmith can save you a ton of money on "Blue" weapons and armor later in the game. What other skills go well with Blacksmithing? Mining is usually paired with blacksmithing, as you can find your own materials to use while blacksmithing, instead of having to buying them. While it is possible to go without mining, it would be extremely expensive to do. Where do I train to be a blacksmith? All major cities and most towns have blacksmith trainers. Most major cities and towns also have journeyman blacksmith trainers. To train as a journeyman you need 50 skill points in blacksmithing and at least level 10. Once you get to higher levels you must journey to a few specific towns to get training. To train as an expert blacksmith you must have 125 skill points in blacksmithing, be at least level 20 and then journey to Ironforge (Alliance) or Orgrimmar (Horde). To become an Artisan in blacksmithing you must first get to 200 skill points and level 35 and then journey to Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale to train with Brikk Keencraft (Both Alliance and Horde). What are Armorsmiths and Weaponsmiths? These are specialized areas in blacksmithing. You can only specialize in one area so be sure to chose the right one for you. Armorsmiths create some other the best plate armor items in the game. Armorsmiths have a limited market to sell to, but those players need multiple armor items, where as they generally only need one weapon. Weaponsmiths create some of the best weapons in the game. Many of the patters require many expensive ingredients. Weaponsmiths sell to many different classes so can generally make more money reselling items. Where do you train to be an Armorsmith or Weaponsmith? This depends on what faction you play. For Alliance players both the trainers can be found in Ironforge by the great forge in the center of the city. For Horde players the trainers can be found in Orgrimmar in the Valley of Honor. For both factions you must have at least 215 skill points in blacksmithing and at least level 40. The trainers will give you a quest that you must complete before they train you. What are Axesmiths, Hammersmiths and Swordsmiths? As a weaponsmith, once you reach level 54 and have a blacksmithing skill of at least 250 you can choose to further specialize in a specific type of weapon creation. The trainers will give you a quest that you must complete before they train you. Choose carefully as there is no going back once chosen. Which specialization should I chose? There is no right or wrong answer here. Some people like to make armor, while some prefer weapons. Also it may depend on what your fiends or other players in your guild have. Just be aware there is no going back. Even if you unlearn blacksmithing, and start from scratch you will still be bound to your previous choice. This is the same for both the general specializations (Weaponsmith / Armorsmith) and the weaponsmith specializations. How do I make blacksmithing items? In your skills section, there will be a blacksmithing icon, click it to bring up your list of patterns. If you have the required ingredients and tools a number will show up beside the pattern, this is how many you can make of that item. I find it easiest if you put the icon on hot bar. The required tools to blacksmith are: a blacksmiths hammer and a forge. Forges are found in most major cities and towns, and several areas in the wild. What ingredients are used in blacksmithing? The primary ingredient in almost all blacksmithing recipes is some type of metal ore. Many recipes also use gems found in ore veins as ingredients. Some ingredients used are made from blacksmithing or other trade skills are also used such as: grinding stones, potions, leathers, linens, etc. Lastly blacksmiths use store bought items such as flux and coal. Why can’t I make a Mithril Belt? You can only make those items which you have the patterns for. You are given some basics one when you first start, but for the rest they have to be found on mobs, or bought from NPCs or other players. Some of the best patterns are only found as rare drops from high level instance dungeons. Also you can only use the patterns that you have the required level of skill in blacksmithing for. What level requirements are there for Blacksmithing? Rank Skill level (min - max) Min. Character Level Apprentice 1 - 75 Level 5 Journeyman 50 - 150 level 20 Expert 125 - 225 Level 20 Artisan 200 - 300 Level 35 Armorsmith or Weaponsmith 200 - 300 Level 40 Axesmith, Hammersmith or Swordsmith 250 - Level 54 How do I increase my Blacksmithing skill? Your increase your skill by creating blacksmithing items of a progressing level of difficulty. Why didn’t my skill increase 30 points when I made 30 belts? Your skills increase only if you produce item that have a high difficulty rating. All production patterns are color coded for complexity. What are the difficulty ratings for patterns? From easiest to hardest the color are grey, green, yellow, orange and red. Patterns that are red will never be in your list of patterns, but they are visible at the blacksmithing trainers. Orange patterns will always increase your skill, yellow patterns sometimes increase your skill, green patterns will rarely increase your skill, and grey patterns will never increase your skill. What is the best way to level Blacksmithing? There are two main things to remember when trying to level your blacksmithing skill. The first is to only make orange difficulty items whenever possible. Only make yellow difficulty items when they are significantly cheaper to produce than orange difficulty items. The other secret to leveling blacksmithing is to always create the item at each skill level that has the lowest ingredient cost. Always check all the recipes that you are able to make at the time and build the cheapest one. For example one item may require 10 copper bars, while another requires 15. If they are the same difficulty rating, then you should always make the item requiring only 10 bars. Our guide to blacksmithing recipes is a great help in planning items to build to level as it shows when the item drops to green difficulty and not worth producing any more. Our guide can be found here or a downloadable PDF version here. Are there Quests for Blacksmithing? Yes Currently there are a ton of blacksmithing quests. At low level there are 2 for Alliance Players and 5 for Horde players. There is also a quest chain for both factions title "The Mithril Order". Alliance Quests Level 5: Supplying the Front Bring 6 Copper Axes and 6 Copper Chain Belts to Thorvald in the southern guard tower of Loch Modan. Level 5: Gearing Redridge Tormus Deepforge wants you to bring 4 Runed Copper Belts and 4 Heavy Copper Mauls to Verner Osgood in Redridge. Horde Quests Level 32: Barbaric Battlements Bring two Patterned Bronze Bracers, two Bronze Greatswords, and two Sharp Claws to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. Level 32: On Iron Pauldrons Bring four Bronze Battleaxes and four Bronze Warhammers to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. Level 32: Trampled Under Foot Bring four Green Iron Helms, four Green Iron Bracers, and two Green Iron Leggings to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. Level 32: Horns of Frenzy Bring two Solid Iron Mauls, two Silvered Bronze Boots, and two Silvered Bronze Gauntlets to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. The Mithril Order The Horde start with the quest “The Old Ways” which is given by Aturk the Anvil in Orgrimmar. He’ll need 4 Steel Breastplates and 4 Steel Plate Helms. From here Ox will give you the quest Booty Bay or Bust. The Alliance start with the quest “The Origins of Smithing” in which he’ll want six Golden Scale Bracers. He will then give you the quest Booty Bay or Bust. Head to Booty Bay and pick up the quest The Mithril Order from McGavan. This quest takes you to Galvan the Ancient. Galvan will have three quests: Smelt On, Smelt Off, The Great Silver Deceiver, and The Art of the Imbue. When all three quests are done you will be sent to Trenton Lighthammer in Gadgetzan. (You need to have all three done before you can continue) and be given the Expert Blacksmith rank. At this point you can continue for more recipes or stop. If you want the recipes or to become an armorsmith then continue on. Once in Gadgetzan you’ll be given three quests again: The World At Your Feet, The Mithril Kid, and A Good Head On Your Shoulders. Complete all three and you will be allowed to start the path to become an armorsmith (along with picking up recipes). Specialization Quests Armorsmith To become an armorsmith you must first complete all of the Mithril Order quests. When all of them are completed you can then pick up the quest Did You Lose This? Which will show your true dedication to the Mithril Order. When finished (it’s a simple quest) go to Grumnus Steelshaper or Okothos Ironrage with 4 Ornate Mithril Helms, 2 Orante Mithril Boots, and 1 Ornate Mithril Breastplate and become an Armorsmith. Weaponsmith To become a Weaponsmith seek out Bengus Deepforge in Ironforge or Saru Steelfury in Orgrimmar. They will send you around to an NPC next to them who will give you “The Way of the Weaponsmith”. You’ll need 4 Massive Iron Axes, 2 Heavy Mithril Axes, 2 Big Black Maces, and 4 Moonsteel Broadswords. Two of these are from the trainer and two are recipes that sell in limited quantities. Craft them all and turn them in to become a weaponsmith. Once you are a weaponsmith you can specialize further in certain weapons. Axesmith Find Kilram in Everlook who will give you Snakestone of the Shadow Huntress. Head into Blackrock Spire (the lower section) and kill Shadow Hunter Vosh’Gajin with only one group. Return to Kilram with the Vosh’gajin’s Snakestone. You’ll then become an Axesmith. Hammersmith Locate Lilith the Lithe in Everlook who will give you the quest Sweet Serenity. Head into Stratholme and take out the Crimson Hammersmith (in the Scarlet side) who will drop a Crimson Hammersmith’s Apron. Turn it in to Lilith to become a Hammersmith. Swordsmith Talk to Seril Scourgebane in Everlook and get the quest Corruption. Head into Stratholme and take out the Black Guard Swordsmith who will drop the Insignia of the Black Guard. Head back to Everlook and turn in the insignia to Seril. Where can I find info from other WoW players? Item Type Stats Items Level Req.

4 x Enchanted Leather Mining Mining is a gathering skill that allows you to take a mining pick to various veins that litter the landscape and attempt to get raw metals and gems for crafting armor, weapons, potions, jewels, and many other items. Some of the materials can even be used in quests! Mining is a primary skill, meaning that it counts towards the two profession limit. Keep this in mind when you learn Mining, as unlearning it to learn a new profession will reset your knowledge of mining to zero if you ever pick it back up. Either for making new things with tough metals or just for profit, mining is a great skill for any class! It goes great with several other professions as well!</p>
<p>Getting Started To begin you must seek a &lt;Mining Trainer&gt; out in order to pick up the mining profession. From there, simply interact with the trainer who will teach you the rough and gritty art of mining! When you begin you will be an Apprentice Miner and have to pay only a few copper to pick up the profession. There are several ranks to mining and as your skill progress you’ll find yourself at a point where you can’t continue without further training. At this point return to any mining trainer and pay to increase your rank in mining, except for the Master level. You must seek out a Master trainer in Outland to obtain that rank. Apprentice 1-75 • Smelt Copper (1) • Smelt Elementium (1) * • Smelt Tin (50) • Smelt Bronze (65) • Smelt Silver (75) Journeyman 76-150 • Smelt Iron (125) Expert 151-225 • Smelt Gold (155) • Smelt Steel (165) • Smelt Mihtril (175) Artisan 226-300 • Smelt Truesilver (230) • Smelt Thorium (250) • Smelt Dark Iron (230) * Master (Burning Crusade) 300-375 Master skill is learned in Outland, making it a requirement of having the expansion in order to train. • Smelt Fel Iron (300) • Smelt Felsteel (300) • Smelt Adamantite (325) • Smelt Etenium (350) • Smelt Khorium (365) Any character of any level can pickup mining and train it to any level (although Master trainers are only located in Outland, requiring the expansion). This means you can have a level twenty character with 300 in mining, although it would be difficult to mine things requiring 300 skill at level twenty! A list of where Mining Trainers are located is right here. Choosing a Second Profession Mining fuels many professions, although it goes well with some more then others. The following is a list of comparisons between the other professions and mining. Remember, if you choose mining, you will only have one profession left. Alchemy: Mining and alchemy do not go along together very well. While alchemy can transmute metals and some potions may need metals, herbalism would always be better. Blacksmithing: Most everything a blacksmith makes is done with metal and gems obtained through mining. You should rarely pick up blacksmithing without mining, as the ores required to skill up are extremely expensive. Enchanting, Skinning, Talioring: These three professions do not require mining nor interfere with it. Skinning is an exceptional choice to take with mining though, as with two gathering skills you can bring in the money fast. Engineering: Like blacksmithing, engineering requires rare gems and metals. If you plan on becoming an engineer then you will want to bring mining along to fund your crafts. Herbalism: Herbalism and mining do not go together very well. There is good reason, of course. Mining and herbalism use the mini-map to detect “nodes” (locations veins and herbs). You can only detect one type of node at a time, so you can’t detect both mineral veins and herbs. Jewelcrafting: You will need mining to take full advantage of jewelcrafting. Most items created with jewelcrafting will require rare gems which can be found easier with prospecting (a jewelcrafting skill). Leatherworking: Mining and leatherworking do not go along together as leatherworking requires leather from skinning. Mineral Veins Mineral veins are scattered across the landscape on rocky mountainous areas, hills, and inside of various caves. They have static spawns, but random respawn times. This means that all veins can be reached on foot (they will very rarely spawn in a way that is unreachable) and can be mapped out. The respawn time can be from a few minutes to a few hours, so it’s generally a good idea to never wait around on a vein to respawn. Sometimes, certain metal veins can respawn as a special type of vein with an uncommon type of ore. This kind of ore is generally always considered rarer and more valuable then the base ore. Tin can respawn as Silver, Iron can respawn as Gold, and Mithril can respawn as Truesilver. Going out of your way for these types of metals can be a very good idea. Minerals have a certain “difficulty” rating. Each mineral vein requires you to be near the skill level of that vein in order to mine it. Its color coded so it’s easy to figure out. Red: Can not mine, you can attempt to mine it to see what skill level is needed before you can begin to mine it. Orange/Yellow/Green: You can mine it with 100% success. Orange has a great chance to give you a skill gain, yellow has an alright chance to give you a skill gain, and green has a fair chance to give you a skill gain. Grey: You can mine it with 100% success, but there will be no skill gain. Mining Minerals Mining is a rather simple process. First you need a mining pick which is available at many general stores and all mining suppliers (who are almost always located near either a forge or a mining trainer). With the pick in hand it’s time to mine! You need to first find a mineral vein. They are on hills, rocky surfaces, cliffs, and in caves. You can use the skill “Find Minerals” which will show any nearby mineral veins on your mini-map. They will be small yellow dots and if you hover your mouse over them you will see what kind of mine they are. As a small note, tracking abilities such as Find Herbs, Track Humans, and Sense Undead will be overridden when you use Find Minerals. You can only have one type of tracking/finding ability going at once. From there you just need to adventure until you come across a mineral vein. When you spot one you would like to mine, simply walk over to it and defeat any enemies in your way. If there is an enemy attacking you while you try to mine, the mining will fail. Smelting Smelting is taking the raw materials (ore) and turning into refined materials (bars). All of the non-rare metals simply require one ore to smelt it into a bar. Rare materials, such as Dark Iron require multiple ores and some even require other materials! To smelt something you first require a forge, which can be found at multiple locations (mostly in major cities). From there you can open your mining skill from your skillbook and begin smelting! It should be noted some metal, such as Dark Iron, require special forges that are not always easily accessible!</p>
<p>If you are looking to smelt Thorium into Arcanite then you will need to seek out an Alchemist. Alchemist can transmute one Thorium bar and one Arcane Crystal into Arcanite once a day. A table of what is required to smelt the various metals: Bar Requirement Copper Bar 1x Copper Ore Tin Bar 1x Tin Ore Bronze Bar 1x Copper Bar 1x Tin Bar Silver Bar 1x Silver Ore Iron Bar 1x Iron Ore Gold Bar 1x Gold Ore Steel Bar 1x Iron Bar 1x Coal Mithril Bar 1x Mithril Ore Truesilver Bar 1x Truesilver Thorium Bar 1x Thorium Ore Dark Iron Bar 8x Dark Iron Ore The Black Forge (Located in the Blackrock Depths) *</p>
<p>Elementium Bar 1x Elementium Ore 10x Arcanite Bars 1 Fiery Core 3 Elemental Fluxes Fel Iron Bar 2x Fel Iron Ore Felsteel Bar 5x Fel Iron Bars 2x Eternium Bars Eternium Bar 2x Eternium Ore Adamantite Bar 2x Adamantite Ore Hardened Adamantite Bar 10x Adamantite Bar Khorium Bar 2x Khorium Ore</p>
<p>Minerals and Outland In Outland there are four new mineral no des: Fel Iron, Adamantite, Rich Adamantite, and Khorium. These of course smelt into three new base metals: Fel Iron, Adamantite, and Khorium. Inside of any mineral node in Outland you will find the new metal, Eterninum, at an uncommon rate. Felsteel and Hardened Adamantite can be made through smelting. Leveling Mining to 375 is not as daunting of a task as it may seem. When you first begin your adventures in Outland simply mine any nearby mineral nodes as you are leveling up. Fel Iron (skill 300) starts in Hellfire Peninsula and isn't a very rare node. Getting those last 75 points should be no problem between smelting ores and the large amount of mineral veins located in Outland. Etiquette Claim Jumping is the process of stealing another miner’s mineral vein. If they are busy fighting enemies near the vein, assume that they are doing it to reach that vein. If in doubt, ask. Never steal another person’s vein, it’s just not fair! Even if they are above level, once come is first served always. If you begin constantly jumping other peoples claim then you’ll eventually find yourself blacklisted on your server. This means many guilds won’t have anything to do with you which no amount of ore is worth! That doesn’t mean that you can’t ask nicely to gain skill off of the vein. Several miners can gain skill off of one ore vein. You can use the vein until you gain skill then not loot it. The original person with the claim them can hit it and loot the ore. Everyone profits! Veins, Metals, Stones, Gems</p>

<p>Special Skills Smelting Dark Iron An NPC known as Gloom’rel can be found inside of the “Chamber of the Sevens” in Blackrock Depths. He’ll want two Star Rubies, ten Truesilver Bars, and twenty Gold Bars to teach you how to smelt Dark Iron (if you have 230 mining skill). Afterwards, you can begin smelting Dark Iron at the Black Forge which is also located in the Blackrock Depths. Eight Dark Iron is needed to create one Dark Iron bar! Learning Smelt Elementium In Blackwing Lair you can learn how to make this extremely rare and valuable metal. It’s only for a few epic and legendary items, but it still scarce! You must venture into Blackwing Lair and seek out Master Elemental Shaper Krixix. He’ll be aggressive, so have a Priest mind-control him. A skill will appear on the pet bar called “Smelt Elementium”. Cast this on any player who seeks to learn it.
