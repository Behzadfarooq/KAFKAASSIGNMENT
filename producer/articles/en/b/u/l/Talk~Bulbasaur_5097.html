<p>I just did a copy edit of the article, so please don't revert it without reading this. Generally, what I fixed was the pluralization of the article, Bulbasaur are a species, so from the intro until the end of the videogames should refer to Bulbasaur as a species (from anime downwards, it refers to individual Bulbasaur). Other things fixed are linking, I tried to cleanup the intro, it was a tip.

<dd>I don't get it. People say "tyrannosaurs" when they talk about species.

<dd>Because the plural and the singular are the same thing, <i>One Snorlax, Two Snorlax.

<dd>I still don't get it. Why are the plural and the singular the same with Bulbasaur? "One tyrannosaur, two tyrannosaurs. Tall tyrannosaurs, small tyrannosaurs." --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 04:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And why do we need to refer to it as a species, when it's much simpler to just treat it as a common noun? "One dog, two dogs, red dogs, blue dogs." Treating it as a species just seems to be an artificial distinction. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 05:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Because it's like "fish" and "sheep", that is how the grammar works. We are treating it like a proper noun <b>and</b> a common noun, because we are referring to Pokémon <b>called</b> Bulbasaur, and <b>the</b> Bulbasaur. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">H</a><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_Esperanza_6275.html" title="User:HighwayCello/Esperanza"><font color="#009933">ig</font></a><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">hway</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighwayCello_d327.html" title="User talk:HighwayCello">Batman!</a></sup> 11:51, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, and you have to understand this: probably all of those people have no experience with Pokémon . I know I don't.</dd>
<dd>Normal rules of English grammar, and similar words (such as tyrannosaur) suggest "Bulbasaurs" is the "acceptable" plural. If you don't want people changing it back, you might want to mention it in the article instead of including it in the talk pages. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 13:06, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you check it, to be sure, please?

<dd>As far as I know, all Pokémon names are like this because a lot of the names (Pikachu, Ariados and so on) use names taken directly from Japanese, which has no plural (フシギダネ could mean Bulbasaur or Bulbasaurs). The in-game Pokédexes definitely don't use "Pokémons" or "Bulbasaurs"; Clefairy's entry reads "On every night of a full moon, groups of this POKéMON come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired CLEFAIRY return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other". Not tired Clefairies; tired Clefairy. <font style="color:#5500BB"><b>s</b>murrayinch</font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font>ster<sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 14:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I can see how the word <i>Bulbasaur</i> would be a portmanteau if it were a combination of <i>bulb</i> and <i>dinosaur</i>, but if it's merely a fusion of the words <i>bulb</i> and <i>sauros</i>, how is this a genuine portmanteau? By the same logic, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a>, derived from combining the words <i>dinos</i> ("terrible") and <i>saura</i> ("lizard"), is a portmanteau. Heck, almost every scientific word is a portmanteau by that definition. I think you've either got the name's etymology wrong, or this is a classic case of misapplying fun terminology like <i>portmanteau</i> through arbitrary overuse. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a>, 20:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

What we should change is <i>sauros</i> not "portmanteau." Rather than misapply fun terminology, we misapplied fun Latin scientific-sounding naming conventions.

<p>I am a user who mostly uses wikipedia as an encyclopedia, I don't fully understand how it works and I only contribute through grammatical corrections! However, I was under the impression that Main Page Featured articles were locked, this is why it surprised me when I clicked on the bulbasaur link from the page page at about 01:20 on 28th July to find that the contents of the article had been deleted and all that was left was a hugely offensive message. I would just like to know how this happened - surely it is possible to avoid this kind of thing, as it could cause a hugely damaging media-storm! <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmatt52_07d5.html" title="User:Madmatt52">Madmatt52</a> 00:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Featured articles most certainly aren't locked as a rule. As for a "media-storm" because of some transient vandalism, Wikipedia would long ago have sunk without trace if such things were possible. As you get to know Wikipedia more you'll learn that vandalism is a common problem that we just live with. Revert the page and get on with your life is my advice. 86.136.2.158 01:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...or rather, Wikipedia appeals to everyone. It's as good a resource for main stream things like World War 2 as it is for niche things like specific pokemon. Whether or not people <i>ought</i> to look it up is one thing, but people <i>do</i> look it up, regardless (just look at this pages history). If they didn't do so at Wikipedia, they'd do so elsewhere. So why not have it at Wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, pursuant to that, I think all articles ought to be treated equally when being considered for the frontpage featured article of the day. To parade Wikipedia around as a more main-stream encyclopedia is to ignore one of the things that really makes Wikipedia stand out, imho. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 03:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

If that 1% amounts to more edits for Bulbasaur then it does for the Battle of Hastings then that means, quite simply, that more people are interested in Bulbasaur than they are in the Battle of Hastings. It might not be fair and it might not be right, but whomever said life was either of those two things?</dd>

<dd>Also, I might add that the article on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> mainly suffers because it covers something that is <i>old</i>. When something is <i>current</i> it is covered in such detail that it makes this Bulbasaur article look like nothing. Consider <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2003_Iraq_conflict_1944.html" title="Category:2003 Iraq conflict">Category:2003_Iraq_conflict</a>. <i>Fifteen</i> subcategories. Does that mean the 2003 Iraq conflict is one subcategory shy from being as important and as influential as that which <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_War_I_f933.html" title="Category:World War I">Category:World_War_I</a> documents? No. It means that <i>old</i> events are simply harder to write about then <i>current</i> events are. And Bulbasaur, like it or not, is more current than the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 04:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there are only 386 pokemon, rather than 403. Either this article or the wikipedia page on pokemon is wrong. - Mr Awesomeness 03:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why does it say one of the 403 <i>known</i> species of Pokemon? Pokemon is a man made thing, people know how many there are currently... --CrazyCasey 02:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It says there are 403 Pokémon because with the continuing information being released about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Diamond_and_Pearl_76c7.html" title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a>, there is constant information relating to new Pokémon that is released to the public, and so far there have been 17 new Pokémon, sixteen of which have been named.

<dl>
<dd>I also find the "403 known species" comment a bit odd, not because I dispute the number but because it implies that there 'exist' spicies of pokemon that no one knows about. Since Pokemon are fictional creatures they surely only 'exist' in that they have been invented by the shows creators, pokemon that are not known about even by the shows creators surely can't exist! That said I understand the point that the sentence is trying to make which is that within the fictional pokemon univerce there is a (fictional) posibility that more pokemon may be discovered.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 07:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But since there are going to be more Pokemon in Diamond and Pearl, that we, "we" being Wikipedia and its Wikipedians, really <i>don't</i> know about yet, the comment is valid. Plus, they give the "species of Pokemon we don't know about yet" line in the game and anime, too. Mostly to give them wiggle room to make up more species as they come about.</dd>

<p>Ryūlóng is mistaken. The Talk page is indeed the place to discuss whether an article is of Featured Article quality. In my opinion, this one isn't. The sections are long and unstructured, and have a number of grammatical errors (particularly comma splices). I think we blew it on this one. I would have opposed it if I had been paying attention.

<p><i>evidently the work of a 12 year old who hasn't been getting enough of the good stuff, eh?</i> Swish.

<dd>actually, you might be. See, most teenagers around here (Brooklyn), at my age (15) like Pokemon. Not in the "ooh saw that episode last night lets trade cards" kinda way. More of a nostalgic kinda way. See, as kids, we traded cards, saw the show, etc. It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse, ask an 18 year old if it's a good show and they might say yes, just cause they grew up on it. See, I grew up on this stuff, and so did everybody else, and it was popular when I was a child, so if you had the cards, you're considered to be among the poular ones. The true geeks are those kids that play with Yu-Gi-Oh cards (a show that wil never match up to Pokemon). Oh, and no, they aren't "geeks" or "nerds". They're quite the opposite.</dd>

<p>Using Geography as a guide, I'm guessing people are bandalising as soon as they see it, in the morning... at the moment, it's round about the right time in Europe, and soon it will be morning in the middle of the atlantic, so there'll be a low point then, then a massive boom as America wakes up.

<p>Why is CNN mentioned in the lead section? What does CNN have to do with Pokemon? Are they leading experts on Pokemon or something?

<dd>I agree with Carcharoth. I find the mention of CNN and Time to be awkward. It should simply say something like "Bulbasaur is considered one of the more popular and iconic Pokemon" and add a citation at the end that directs to the CNN and Time articles.

<p>I've quickly scanned through the article, and the lead section is OK, and there are a few interesting tidbits scattered throughout the article, but in the main, after the lead section, the article is heavily detailed and probably only of interest to Pokemon fans. Sounds like its been written by fans for fans. Not much here of interest to the reader of a general encyclopedia.

<dl>
<dd>To explain this a bit more. The detail I refer to is excessive. Some detail is OK, but not this level of detail. If this level of detail is desired, then a lot more explanation is needed. Currently, to understand much of what this page is talking about, I have to follow the links and read several other articles, and I will probably encounter the same problem there. Essentially, what I am saying is that this article does not cater for those who arrive knowing nothing about Bulbosaur or Pokemon. There should be a warning that the casual reader needs to read the Pokemon article first, as much information that would be useful here, is there instead. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's deliberately written for everyone. If someone mentions "Bulbasaur" to you now - you know what they're on about roughly, don't you? A green dinosaur-like Pokémon?</dd>
<dd>This other issue is a bit of a double-edged sword, I'm afraid. On the one hand, one could include reams of stuff not-relevant to Bulbasaur directly, massively upping the article's length, but making it totally understandable to the lay reader or not include any at all, having an article totally inaccessible to lay readers. Both sides have followings. We've tried to compromise here, by including bits in parenthesis and little introductions to sections. If you have any particular advice about a particular bit that you don't understand though, please say so.

<dd>I could have found out that Bulbasaur was a green dinosaur-like Pokemon without reading the Wikipedia article. I expected more, I'm afraid.</dd>
<dd>The lay reader versus fan/expert is always a problem, but I have seen far too many articles leaving out basic stuff that can be found by following a link, but should really be put in the article. As an example, for biographical articles about people, at what point do you give someone's birth/death dates, or their nationality, rather than relying on someone to click through to the article. There is a good example here - the inventor of Pokemon, Satoshi Tajiri, is mentioned in the article, but the article doesn't say that he was <b>Japanese</b> and was born in <b>1965</b> - stuff which might be relevant to this article (sadly, the article on the artist for Bulbasaur does not even have a birth date). This article fails to make clear that Pokemon is Japanese, or at least originated there - you have to click through to the Pokemon article to find this out, or at least infer it from the numerous Japanese references (eg. the bit about the Japansese names). The article also fails to give the historical context of Bulbasaur within Pokemon history - the Pokemon article says that it started at least by 1995, and since Bulbasaur's debut date is given as 1996, it would seem relevant to know that Bulbasaur was one of the first Pokemon. There is a fleeting reference to "original series", but this is not made clear. Also, it would be nice to say how many Pokemon existed before Bulbasaur, and how many have been invented since.</dd>
<dd>And the general problems of lay reader versus fan reader have been discussed at <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> (a guideline for writing about fiction). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what the problem is. Yes, you need to know what Pokémon are like for a full understanding of Bulbasaur. This is similar to the way in which you need to know what <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> are like and what <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> is to get a full understanding of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It all depends on context. Here, there is definite need to introduce the Japanese origin of Pokemon, and to put the date (ie. 1990s) further up the lead section. These are basic "where?", and "when?" questions that people should be able to find the answer to in this article, rather than clicking through. I came here because I was interested in the number of people who were defending against the "why is Pokemon on the front page" people, by saying that this was a "well-written article", so I'm not going to apologise for pointing out some basic deficiencies quite separate from the 'suitability' issues (I think the variance in styles is detrimental to Wikipedia, though the diversity in content is a strength). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that was very inappropriate indeed — but a quite clever find (they vandalised the stupid {{<a href="../../../p/o/k/Template%7EPokenum_5cf7.html" title="Template:Pokenum">pokenum</a>}} template, which appears in the first paragraph). I take it that this shows the dangers of Pokemon-cruft... — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 20:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nasty. I removed the image. Please check that I didn't remove anything else. Ooops this may be a second spam incident another inappropriate image was added to the links section--86.48.1.176 20:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congrats, Bulbasaur!</p>
<p>Damn straight lol! (I do not actively play pokemon anymore, yet i still have very fond memories, bulbasaur being one of them =) ) (Daydreams21 22:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>How the hell is Bulbasaur NOT the article of the day? Good for you, Bulbasaur!</p>
<p>Frankly, I find it funny that so many people can be that insecure in their masculinity. It's a fun game and certainly deep and complex enough that adults can enjoy it, too. --Capibara 05:37, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know how this article got featured while being so bloated with information not directly related to Bulbasaur. Maybe if this was a text encyclopedia and Bulbasaur was the only pokemon article or something, but this is ridiculous. All the info explaining generalities about Pokemon should be (and I think is) talked about elsewhere, in other articles. In addition, WP is not a gaming guide, so info on strategy is very, very iffy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 00:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've killed off all the strategy info, at least. I have no idea how it got there without me noticing. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 00:39, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
