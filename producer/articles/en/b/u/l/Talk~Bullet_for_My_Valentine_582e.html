<p>They are a very popular band in the rock community and are often seen as screamo. Should Screamo be put in with their genre?</p>
<p>Bullet for my valentine is Emocore and Metalcore. Just listen to the name BULLET FOR MY VALENTINE (TOTALLY EMO), listen to the lyrics its so emotional and depressing.</p>
<p>Emocore is a mashup with Post-Hardcore/Metalcore/Screamo/Emo and I think it fit BFMV pretty well</p>

<p>No. Bullet ain't screamo. They're <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killswitch_Engage_0eb2.html" title="Killswitch Engage">Killswitch</a>-lite, and to boot they only got signed for two reasons; 1) the success of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral_for_a_Friend_ef25.html" title="Funeral for a Friend">Funeral for a Friend</a> and 2) the singer looks a tad like <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Watkins_a57b.html" title="Ian Watkins">Ian Watkins</a>.</p>
<p>I Agree Bullet aren't <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screamo.html" title="Screamo">screamo</a> but they may be catagorised as Emo-Metalcore but to be honest as a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_for_my_Valentine_9bc4.html" title="Bullet for my Valentine">Bullet for my Valentine</a> fan I would call them just <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">Metalcore</a> they may not be as heavy as Kilswitch engage or <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_I_Lay_Dying_b4ec.html" title="As I Lay Dying">As I Lay Dying</a> (other metalcore bands) but They are still called <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a>.

<p>I know. Let's call them "post-screamo"! Aren't I smrt</p>
<p>dude, AMG calls them screamo, and i don't really disagree. if <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorne_heights.html" title="Hawthorne heights">hawthorne heights</a> is screamo, B4MV is definetely also screamo. 66.57.12.148 00:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I think you have a little bit too much time on your hands if you feel the need to write such unfounded garbage about such a talented band. Sure, they may be arrogant, they may be unoriginal (although I wouldn't say that) but they play passionately and with great skill.</p>
<p><br />
Anyways, in regard to their genre; yeah I think metalcore pretty much covers it at the moment, but I have a feeling someone might have to change it in a few years when they hone their sound and the scene finds some new bandwagon.</p>

<p>Bullet is a great Metalcore band and just because the vocalslist brags about haveing sex with so many woman, doesnt make him arragant. If you were to have sex with alot of woman wouldnt you brag to? yes they may have an additude doent mean there a bad band. I think Bullet is going to be a great band, that many Heavy metal fans will enjoy listening to.</p>

<p>I know its a bit of a moot point that a band like B4MV sing about their feelings (as do many 'emo' bands, and funnily enough; 99% of all musicians - yes that even includes Deicide) but that doesn't warrant them to be labled as an emo band. My personal take on bands genre is for me defined my their actual sound, and as far as Bullet goes, their threadwork is waaay too sick for your typical emo band...okay so they may not have Metallica-like hooks and it MAY sound a bit contrived but that in my honest opinion does not mean they are an emo band...etc etc&#160;:)</p>
<p>So...please consult this comment when thinking about changing their genre (as it is 2006).</p>

<p>Their lyrics are emo, their music isn't.</p>
<p><br />
"B4MV sing about their feelings (as do many 'emo' bands, and funnily enough; 99% of all musicians - yes that even includes Deicide"- Deicide sing about asatan and decapitating animals.... Not emotions. BULLET OFF WACKEN</p>

<p>Aren't they also thrash metal or crossover thrash. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidJJJ_edc7.html" title="User:DavidJJJ">DavidJJJ</a> 18:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not necessarily, There are differences between crossover thrash and metalcore, i.e. crossover thrash is thrash metal (or just metal) crossed over to punk music and its stylistic origins. While as metalcore is heavy metal with hardcore punk or just hardcore and that is a hybrid genre.</p>

<p>Now maybe I just haven't heard enough BFMV and I can't speak for what the band themselves are influenced by, but I can't hear much melodic death metal influence in their music.

<p>BMFV really is sounding more and more like Screamo now. With lyrics like, "your tears don't fall, they crash around me" you really can't argue that they are not. They also have the clean/gutteral vocal combination that is prevalent in Screamo bands. I think however, they have recently developed into a Screamo band, it might just be them wanting to get some money off of the recent popularity, but you have to admit that the newest album is entirely more Screamo then their previous releases. Lots of bands undergo changes throughout their careers, I am not saying BMFV is a bad band, I am just saying that the recent release for now makes them a bit Screamo.

<dd>Dude, they're not screamo. Do some research before calling them screamo, like listen to Saetia then to Bullet or whatever other band you think is screamo. <a href="../../../x/d/i/User%7EXdiabolicalx_68c5.html" title="User:Xdiabolicalx">Diabolical</a> 01:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How the hell could these losers be nihilists? I SEVERELY doubt you are a nihilist, you are just labeling yourself that to make yourself sound smart. You are probably an atheist or agnostic.

<p>I reverted the genre in the infobox and in various places in the text from heavy metal to metalcore. I also removed the following quote:</p>
<p>"Matt seem's to constantly wear either Metallica's ...And Justice For All album t-shirt, a Famous Stars &amp; Straps t-shirt or Avenged Sevenfold's 'Love It Or Die' slogan t-shirt."</p>

<p>I'm proposing the removal of "Emo" from their genre types. I am not saying this because I see Emo as some kind of insult, as many people seem to, but simply because I can't see how Bullet fit into this category of music. As some on here have already said, singing about feelings does not make you an Emo band. If it did, a good 90%+ bands out there would be Emo. Unless someone can come up with some solid reasoning behind this label, it will have to be removed. Prophaniti 03:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"They play a unique kind of metal, inspired by <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal.html" title="Heavy metal">heavy metal</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash</a>, resulting in diverse songs, some more melodic, but — especially in the older ones — much screaming can be heard, causing them to have a sound that is categorized into <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a>."</p>
<p>This part really bugs me, it sounds like it's trying to make them seem to be unfairly put in with the "unpopular" metalcore genre. I would say they're a pretty standard metalcore band, their sound isn't dramatically different from <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killswitch_Engage_0eb2.html" title="Killswitch Engage">Killswitch</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atreyu.html" title="Atreyu">Atreyu</a>, etc. And they've got no more influence from older heavy metal than any other metalcore band (although we shall see when the new album comes out). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamravenscroft_a1e0.html" title="User:Adamravenscroft">Adamravenscroft</a> 11:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree entirely, I feel the sentence needs reworking, possibly just be removed altogether and replaced with something simpler. I cannot perceive any significant difference to any other metalcore band in Bullet. They sound, as you say, very similar to Killswitch, Atreyu, etc. There may be some light differences, but a genre is a broad category, and not every band within it has to sound identical to be considered a part of it. The "Big Four" of thrash, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthax, all sound very different (including at their start), yet are all still thrash. And Bullet are still very much metalcore. The article does not need an opening that sounds like it's trying to imply they're not metalcore after all. Prophaniti 23:44, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so I removed the sentence entirely. If anyone sees it as really necessary, add something more appropriate regarding their style. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamravenscroft_a1e0.html" title="User:Adamravenscroft">Adamravenscroft</a> 17:29, 10 March 2007 (UTC)\</dd>
