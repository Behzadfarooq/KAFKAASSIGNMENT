<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Talk%7EBulgaria_c8ea.html" title="Edit section: Macedonia and Bulgaria">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Macedonia and Bulgaria</span></h2>
<p>I do not understand why Macedonians hate Bulgarians so much. I have to say, as a representative of the general Bulgarian public, that we Bulgarians do not have anything against Macedonians. The general opinion in Bulgaria is that Macedonians are in fact Bulgarians, given that they fought for their unification with Bulgaria only 100 years ago in the dumb ass Balkan War and then in the stupid World War 1. It appears that this statement is extraordinary ofensive to the people of FYROM and my question to any person from this country who reads that (beacause it appears that quite a lot are reading it) is: Why are you so offended? Why are you not flattered by the fact that another nation wants to find historical roots with you and embrace you? Isn't it flattering rather than offensive that Bulgarians want to be recognized as one with the great Macedonian nation!? Your hatered seems very revealing to me. It is as if Macedonians are running from some ugly truth, which is none of my concern or, in fact, none of the concern of most peacefully living Bulgarians. We are not worried about history and we really do not care about the big controvrsy about it. What I am concerned about is all this hatered. I will take the liberty to represent the Bulgarian opinion on this matter: Macedonians, We do not hate you! We have nothing against you. But I have to say it gets tiring to listen about historical problems delivered to us with this extreme hatred. To those of you who are sensible: just forget about it and live in the present! We do not care, why should you? And maybe if you redirect all this hatered into something constructive Macedonia will truly become a greater country(if any more greatness than the present is possible).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I suggest that Bulgaria stops using the term Macedonia for anything else than the country Macedonia (also Macedonia or RoM, not FYROM) as this might misslead. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnegjor_9bd7.html" title="User:Arnegjor">Arnegjor</a> 10:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Svetlo, Macedonia will always be to the Macedonian people, just am "sorry" for u that ur brain has been washed away, its a common thing in bulgaria</p>
<p>Well, officially you are still F.Y.R.O.M, you haven't won the name yet <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvetlyo_1bc1.html" title="User:Svetlyo">Svetlyo</a> 13:13, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm from Bulgarian Macedonia and since the end of Yugoslavia I have to change the name of my region, cause some other people</p>
<pre>
want to monopolise something that they don't have (less than 50%) and historically don't deserve. 
</pre>
<p>At least they can give the opportunity for others to use the name Macedonia. How can I describe my region? Macedonia (Pirin), bordering Macedonia? Am I Macedonian, or not? And then if Macedonian I'm not Bulgarian? I can be Bulgarian Macedonian and they can be Slav Macedonians and Greeks can be Macedonians but they don't want to and you support them, they want to monopolise the name. I suggest that we change the name of the country to FYROM <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvetlyo_1bc1.html" title="User:Svetlyo">Svetlyo</a> 19:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We use the term "Republic of Macedonia" simply to distinguish the country from all the other places called Macedonia. It doesn't imply endorsement of that name - see <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html#Note" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia#Note</a>. The reason we don't use "Republic of Bulgaria", "Republic of Greece" etc. is because those country names aren't the subject of confusion with other names. See <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> for a comparable example. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 19:35, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You see how tricky it gets with the name Republic of Macedonia? Go get another name <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvetlyo_1bc1.html" title="User:Svetlyo">Svetlyo</a> 00:44, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Svetlyo. Besides, Macedonia belongs to Bulgaria anyways so give the land back!</p>
<p>I personaly don't know about a country named "Macedonia" i know of a province which belongs to Bulgaria named Macedonia.</p>
<p>Most sources point that Macedonia was part of Bulgaria before the Ottoman Empire but it is no longer. The only opinion that really matters is the Macedonian people’s. Nobody can force them to call themselves Bulgarians unless by exercising the Ottoman way of conversion which we Bulgarians know all too well. Therefore I must sadly disagree with some of the former statements.</p>
<p>Well the Serbs forced the Bulgarians in what is now Republic of Macedonia to think they are Macedonians when they failed to force them to think they are Serbs. And this was achieved after decades of terror. Tell me why you concider yourself as a Macedonian? Isn't it better to think more seriously and come to the conclusion that you and the population of Macedonia is Bulgarian.</p>
<p>OK I red all you guys said, and I must call in most parts bullsh*t. Let me tell you just one thing. Was Alexander or the people of Ancient Macedonia Slavs? NO.</p>
<p>You are very smart you should know – he he! What so ever with Alexander? Europa from the legend – who was a Thracian girl – gave her name to the whole continent. But she was Thracian – ohooo – Therefore FOLLOWING YOUR LOGIC – NO ONE IN THE CONTINENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE EUROPEAN, BECAUSE NO ONE OF COURSE IS THRACIAN??? Maybe only Bulgarians could be Europeans – because they can be regarded as Thracian descendants? SO WHAT YOU SAID IS AT ALL BULLSH*T!</p>

<p>If the Ottoman empire had tried to proselytize the ethnic Bulgarians to Islam over a 500 year period, there would be no christian ethnic bulgarians left. Instead the majority of ethnic bulgarians are orthodox christians, the only muslims are the Turks and Tatar minorities, while only a small minority of muslims is ethnic bulgarian.</p>
<p>Why are there not more ethnically bulgarian muslims? why did the empire not try to make more bulgarians muslim? Is it because Turks and Bulgars are ethnically related? --Kahraman 11:01, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bulgarian and Turks are NOT ethnically related. In a few words the cristians in the borders of the Ottoman empire were forces to pay much bigger taxes (including the Blood Tax, which consisted of giving every first-born son to become a soldier in the Ottoman army), so it was better for the empire to have the majority of people with different religions.</dd>

<dd>Yes, there are two different systems of transliteration - the first one uses diacritic symbols from Czech or Croatian (I don't remember exactly), the other one uses only the letters which exist in the English alphabet. The one which should be applied is the second one - the first one is practically never applied, at least not in Bulgaria. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 14:33, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In general, is there a standard accepted way of transliterating Bulgarian names from their original alphabets? Right now it's a mess, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>ъ is sometimes u, sometimes a (I've seen ǎ and ŭ as well),</li>
<li>ю is sometimes iu, sometimes yu,</li>
<li>ц is sometimes ts, sometimes c,</li>
<li>х is sometimes kh, sometimes h</li>
</ul>

I think the United Nations system (with the Czech/Croatian diacritics) is not practical for Wikipedia. The BGN/PCGN and the official Bulgarian system are quite similar, except for х (kh vs. h), ц (ts vs. c), ъ (ŭ vs. a) and ь (' vs. y). Apart from the fact that the a's in Varna and the a in Tarnovo will not be distinguishable, the official Bulgarian system looks OK to me.

<dd>Well, on my ID card it is "tz", but basically you can just choose the kind of transliteration for your ID card for yourself. I expressly wanted to spell my name that way, because I think this is the most understandable way for all the nations (in English "tz" is spoken just like in German and so on) and in my eariler international pass (when I was too young to say personally what kind of transliteration I would like) it was also "tz". In many web pages containing bulgarian transliteration I also found "tz", look at <a href="http://www.veliko.info/more/en_veliko/vt1/1/3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.veliko.info/more/en_veliko/vt1/1/3.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example. I think the "c" spelling is totally wrong, it is used only by Bulgarians in the chat rooms for shorting the words when there's no cyrilic font, just think about it, it can be spoken as "s" or "k" or "tz" in the different languages.</dd>

<p>That's funny, that you can choose your own transliteration. Was this before or after 1999? To me (I'm Dutch) "tz" is a bit strange because in Dutch (French, Polish, Czech likewise I think) it would be a voiced consonant. In German and Italian, "z" by itself would be the same as ц. You're right that "c" is ambiguous in many languages. I would prefer "ts" then. BTW I did the Google test for "Vratsa" (only English language pages), that was ts:tz:c = 91k:44k:7k. "Berkovitsa" ts:tz:c = 17k:12k:360. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 20:53, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you can see, the variant used is "ts" - although I think that "tz" also can be used. May be Tzeck has right that it can be optional. Anyway I agree with him completely as the present transliteration system is based solely on English and I have noticed that English speakers tend to pronounce "tz" as a voiceless affricat [ts] whereas "ts" brings about horrific problems and an unsecure prononciation somewhere around the voiceless fricative [s]. You shouldn't think too much about how the letter combination can be pronounced in different languages as the transliteration system is based solely on the English pronounciation; it is anyway impossible to invent a transliteration system which is universally valid for all languages, right? The problems come from the fact that before 1989 there were two transliteration systems. One used French as a model ([u] for example by "ou") and the other one diacritic signs. Afterwards there was a complete chaos and everyone transliterated as they wished. Well, enough for the lyrical digression - I think we should follow the offical system of the MIA (the same as the one you found for the Bulgarian Embassy in D.C.). <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 23:54, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is the point - this is an English speaking Wikipedia and it doesn't matter if some letter could be spoken otherways in other languages different than English. And, Markussep, I forgot to make mention about the "ts" spelling, that I also find alright, but as VMORO said the most English sreaking people use "tz", that's the result of my personally "investigations", too. However, I find both of them ("tz" and "ts") usable for the Wikipedia (I just prefer "tz"), but not the "c".</dd>

<dd>The transiteration in Bulgaria is optional only for some difficult letters like this and I think when you say nothing about than it will be "ts" on your ID card. And that was in year 2000, but I don't think it was otherways before 1999. When I made my card I was thinking about going to Germany, but in German the most correct spelling of my name begins with "z" . But in England (and by any English speaking man, and there are many of them in the world) it will be pronounced totally wrong, as the bulgarian "з", not "ц". When it begins with "tz" there will be no problems pronounsing it right in both languages (the too most popular, not to forget). Well, I'm maybe influenced by these too languages and the fact that I had the idea to go to Germany, but still I think "tz" is the best choise for the English Wikipedia, "ts" the second. --<a href="../../../t/z/e/User%7ETzeck_f269.html" title="User:Tzeck">Tzeck</a> 14:36, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I remember my primary school lessons correctly, "ц" should be transliterated as "ts" just because they use to describe it as the union of "т" and "с". As for "х", I believe it should be "kh", based on my experience with Armenian. In it there are three Hs:Խ, Հ, Յ&#160;; each with a different pronunciation. The one corresponding to the bulgarian "х" is "Խ", which is transliterated as "kh". Unfortunately my knowledge of linguistics is very limited and I can not describe the pronunciation of the sounds in question so that we can agree on a transliteration. However, I can tell you for certain that the pronunciation of the bulgarian "х" is stronger than that of the english "h", just like "Խ" is compared to "Հ".

<p>When Bulgaria occupied Macedonia during World War Two, Bulgarian officials rounded up the Jews of Skopje in the city's main tobacco factory. From there they were handed over to German officials who sent them to their death in Treblinka. For this reason, I am not sure that it is balanced for this article to include the unqualified statement that Bulgaria was not involved in sending Jews to concentration camps. I can provide sources for my comment should these be requested. (This comment is by no means motivated by any sort of anti-Bulgarian sentiment. Please do not understand it as such.) User: MJ.

<p>by yavor: I'm a Bulgarian, and it is true. I studied it a few months ago at University (History of The Bulgarian State and Law). Bulgarians did not have a choice and were forced to hand over the Jews. Many Bulgarians do not know this, because we don't study it at school. But what you do not know is, that when they were going to hand over those in Bulgaria (without Macedonia), there were massive protests of Bulgarians and The Government could not oppose. Those Jews were saved. <small>If you want to know more (yavor@abv.bg)</small></p>

<p>Bulgarians did not come from anywhere in 679 because the truth is they've been living in the same region even before Christ for Bulgarians are in fact Thracians. Bulgarians is the new name of the Moesians (plus some other Thracian tribes). It is not really known why they started to call themselves Bulgarians but one possibility is that they got their name from the Romans as being federates of the Roman Empire for some time. It's possible that at one point around the time of Attila they mixed with one part of the "wandering thracians" or Schythians called Huns as Attila's son Irnik is said to be the second prince of the Bulgarians as stated in "List of Bulgarian kings". 83.228.61.152</p>

As for the geographic distribution that site gives few details, mentioning Sofia and Ferdinand (present Montana).

Of course the figure of 4.7% is wrong. The Roma minority in Bulgaria is around 10% out of around 7.5 million citizens in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>4.7% are those that consider themselves to be Roma. Many Roma although consider themselves to be Bulgarian or Turk, and even have Bulgarian surnames. They speak Bulgarian with a pecular accent some Turkish and Roma words thrown in or Turkish with some Roma words. Many Roma words have entered Bulgarian slang. Some of them have fully assimilated and you cannot tell them apart from the Bulgarians or the Bulgarian Turks. -dimitar ouzounoff</p>

<p>If you do not know what the terms romantic and beautiful are supposed to mean, how can you refute them when applied to state institutions? Perhaps you mean that these terms are not 'suitable'.

<p>Generally I think the article is very good. I have only one question - Why it doesn't say on the left banner what year Bulgaria was christianized? I mean, this is an important information, being the first slavic country to aqcuire the Christian religion.

<dd>Evgeny, the title <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">tsar</a> itself means "emperor". It is a contraction of the Roman title <i><a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar.html" title="Caesar">caesar</a></i>. The lesser one that cowprresponds to "king" is "kral", as you might know. The medieval Bulgarian state was never ruled by a "kral". How do you understand the difference between an empire and a kingdom in this context and in general? <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov"><span style="border:1px solid black;color:black; padding:1px;background:#fff">Todor<span style="color:white;background:#584">&#160;Bozh<span style="background:#e00">inov&#160;</span></span></span></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 19:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe the relevant explanation is (1). Then, there is my general understanding, which is somewhat supported by Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">empire</a>: a supranational or superethnical political entity that is ruled by a monarch (with absolute power). In this sense Bulgaria has been an empire for short period of time: maybe under <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon.html" title="Simeon">Simeon</a> and then around the years of <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Asen_II_496e.html" title="Ivan Asen II">Ivan Asen II</a>. However, this doesn't turn Bulgaria into an empire for the genral case (so First, Second or Third Empire is meaningless). Now, we should also remember that the Bulgarian use of "tzar" has little to do with "emperor". To say the least, our current Tzar Simeon II was never a ruler of more than one (major) nationality within the borders of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. I will not change the terms before I get some response in the near future. However, it is my firm belief that they have to be changed. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryout_b7ad.html" title="User:Cryout">Cryout</a> 06:49, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emperors are autocrats with absolute power elected by the people represented by their electives. For example Julius Ceaser was elected Emperor by the Roman Senate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or Napoleon Bonaparte was (at least technically) elected by the French Parliament.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since the etymology of Tsar is from ceaser some confuse Tsar with Emperor, however the term Tsar clearly changed its meaning in Bulgarian (more about this here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) and should be translated as King, respectively Tsarstvo is Kingdom.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In contrast, the Serbian language (along with the closely related Croatian, Bosnian, and Slovene languages) translates "emperor" (Latin imperator) as tsar (car, цар) and not as imperator, whereas the equivalent of king (kralj, краљ) is used to designate monarchs of non-imperial status, Serbian as well as foreign, including Biblical and other ancient rulers.</dd>

<dd>Since Tsar in Bulgarian is the hereditary title of the ruler of a sovereign state appointed by god, the article is incorrect and should be edited to use King or Tsar and Bulgarian Kingdom. 66.194.227.150 16:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone tell me who removed the sections about John Atanasoff, the Pravetz and military aeronautical achievements of the Bulgarians? I am curious, is someone here unhappy about Bulgaria's achievements. If you don't believe thees things, do the research yourself. Furtherstill, you can look at the genotype studies done in recent years and you will see that 60% of Bulgarian phenotypes are Eastern Mediterrenean in origin, which is directly descended from the Thracians. Recent studies in BAN, also show that the Bulgars originated in the Hindu Kush and were not Turkic in origin. In fact, they were as previously stated of Aryan Persian descent. And Aryan has nothing to do with blond hair and blue eyes, as the real aryans were dark. If you want to re-invent Bulgarian history or simply ommit facts, such as the computer industry developed in the 1970s, or world firsts such as those made by Bulgarian pilots in the Second Balkan War then you obviously have complexes that make you fear the truth. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Monshuai (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonshuai_5ae1.html" title="User talk:Monshuai">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Monshuai_24ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Monshuai">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>OK, first of all Mr. Bozhinov, you don't have the ultimate right to decide what should and should not be in the history section. Second, your perception of what is subjective or invented is yours alone, and if you want sources, I'll give you sources. I'm leaving for Shanghai on Thursday, but in approximately five weeks I'll be back with those additions and their respective academic sources. Would you prefer them in MLA or APA?&#160;:) BTW, I'm not going to go into your education vs. my education, but if you prefer I'll be more than happy to tell you what I do and thus likely imply to you that my knowledge and authority on history is well regarded in national circles. Furthermore, what you do not seem to realize is that history is one lie built on top of another, and the way in which you portray Bulgarian history supports some of the lies built from imperial propaganda that spawned in classical Europe just two centuries ago. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, than I'll be happy to enlighten you on this issue. It is thus critically important to portray Bulgarian history from our perspective with our studies and interpretations at the forefront, because after all we are its agent and trans-generational carriers. There is already too much anti-Bulgarian propaganda due to multiple failures on our part in international relations and in particular due to the volatility and strategic importance of the region where our country is located. I will however say that what I write is an integral part of the modern curriculum in Bulgarian schools and universities. If you feel you have the authority to go against that curriculum and the way in which it interprets history, versus what is likely a history you learned in communist days from Mother Russia and its scholars, then you have a psychological inadequacy that is exacerbated by delusional visions of personal grandeur Mr. Bozhinov. However, if you accept the material as it was, with a list of sources, then I will gladly reconsider my last statement. And parenthetically, the oldest country in Europe refers to Bulgaria being the only one with a national identity of the so-called 'Bulgarian sovereignty' since 681 (despite repeated invasions from external entities). Our culture goes back much further than this date, but only since 681 have we called ourselves Bulgarian (as a reference to a people of multiple cultural origins and not only Bulgar), whilst the general central geographic area of the country has remained the same. No other country in Europe can claim the same status as applied to the last 1325 years; thereby this perspective is correct as based on the modern understanding of nationality (identified by the majority of the united populace as belonging to an internal collective) and geographic cohesiveness. On the other hand, if you have been influenced by Western Europe's interpretation on the matter as expressed in the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), then you probably feel that no country existed in the modern sense before this date. That said, the historical subjectivity born from the said treaty is rather West-Euro centric and does not take into consideration the developments of nationhood in other parts of the world, which came much earlier than its own entrance into the world of lawful international politics.</p>
<p>Once again, you leave me no choice but to prove you wrong, and your comment on recent studies not convincing you is beyond the issue. You are not the one who even needs to be convinced as you do not hold the key to Bulgaria's history, and as far as I know, in no way are you a prominent individual within our society. If I'm wrong about that please correct me, and then I shall also gladly tell who I am and what my position in our society is. I will write again what you removed, and therein it will be your futile job to prove me wrong in order to try and establish your opinion as one that carries higher ground. So in fact, it is your comments that don't convince me, and I must be brutally honest with you, as I feel I need not be convinced by someone who thus far has given me a negative impression of their intellectual capacity. I realize this may lead to a nasty argument, but do remember that I added to what was written and only removed the 'turkic' connection from the article as this has been proven to be incorrect. You on the other hand feel you have the clout to simply remove everything someone has contributed... So why should we not talk about our Bulgarian achievements and someone like Atanasoff. This is about as much as most foreign people will read on the Bulgaria section, and it certainly is beneficial to our country to showcase facts that elevate the status of the nation beyond its miserable current international reputation, or lack thereof. What you don't seem to realize is that this article is also a virtual advertisement for Bulgaria. Please don’t convulse and then try to explain that history does not have a commercial implication. That’s not what I’m stating, as history is always written in the best interests of the victors. It’s time we write in this way too, as no one else will go out of their way to emphasize those facts that place a little more light on our civilization, both from collective and individual achievements. Do you even know the meaning of socio-cultural marketing? If you don't, I suggest you research the masters at this game, primarily the USA, England and recently China.</p>
<p>I truly hope that you are not the kind of thickheaded fool that I have visualized upon my first impressions. Indeed, I am sincerely optimistic that some part of what I said will permeate into your psyche, thereby giving you the opportunity to see the value of what I just wrote along with what I had written two days ago in the main article. The best way to resolve this issue is through intellectual dialogue and a unified national spirit... So as you say, "consider that!"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please refrain from personal attacks. Now, if you're willing to provide very serious referencing for the things you believe in, and acknowledge they're not the accepted and universal history of Bulgaria, then they might be suitable to include. I'm not any authority on the subject or anything like that, I'm only one Wikipedian following Wikipedia principles, guidelines and policies, and they say "no original research" and "neutral point of view". New theories may be true, but they also may be wrong — time will tell. Until then, the history of Bulgaria is as established by the authoritative sources and books on the topic. When you add content here, you're supposed to follow the rules — no matter what your education is and anything else, you're just a Wikipedian.</dd>
<dd>Also, I haven't removed Atanasoff from the article, he's part of the Culture section already. Note that this article is supposed to be a concise summary, with the vast majority of the actual content being located at other, specific topic-related pages (like, for example, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Bulgarian_Empire_840b.html" title="First Bulgarian Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> or <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Asen_II_of_Bulgaria_c3bb.html" title="Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria">Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria</a>). This is one of the reasons I've removed your additions — they were in the inappropriate article, and content like this, generally considered to be controversial, is as a rule removed until (or if) it can be made neutral and perfectly referenced. So it's your turn now. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 17:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>May I ask you Mr. Bozhinov, what are these authoritative and established books that you have been reading? I'm curious, because the most authoritative Bulgarian books say different things then what you have presented thus far. In consequence, I'm led to believe that your identification of authority is something external to the Bulgarian academic environment. Bulgaria does not write the history of other nations, and if we were to do so, then their populaces would contest many facts due to disagreements in the matter of perspective and the consequent interpretations. After all, history is simply an interpretation of a past reality as inflated and deflated by internal and external sources. What is left is never "universal." If your reference books are not written by Bulgarian historians, anthropologists, archaeologists and sociologists, then I suggest you give your ancestral academia a chance. If by "universal" history you mean the history written about Bulgaria in western literature then I would advice you to reconsider this stance. Tell me, do you feel Ethiopians are best suited to write and interpret the "universal" history of Sweden, or likewise the Swedes to do the same with respect to Malaysia? How about Englishmen and Americans writing about Bulgaria and vice-versa? Would you call it universal history if the way in which Bulgarians interpret western Europe was published in their history books? What if a Bulgarian historian wrote an entire chapter in the Encyclopaedia Britannica about how the Bulgars inflicted one defeat after another on the Crusaders, who acted in barbarous ways everywhere they went and were in no way upholding the ideals of Christianity? Do you feel that Britannica's chief editor would even dare allow such material? Is that a part of your so-called "universal" history and if not, why not? Is it because Western literature somehow chooses to omit such facts by blinding its readers with what are always naturally slanted versions of reality? Even if three people see the same event, they will always interpret it in a slightly dissimilar fashion. Now multiply that over thousands of years and you get the point. Taking this to nth degree, if a fact is maximally proven, then the way in which it is interpreted will eventually make it contestable anyway. In today's world, this same western literature is arguably the most influential in the world due to capital resources that are the pillars of its propaganda mechanisms, upon which much of history is based. In reality, just because something is said to be 'established' and 'universal' from the western perspective, does not mean it is so in other parts of the world. Based on this, I have a feeling that you don't live in Bulgaria...</p>
<p>This is not about personal attacks, but it's about someone who claims objectivity in the face of a subjective world. Perhaps you have academic potential, and your ability to identify truth from fiction may yet develop, but you must sink you psyche into the depths of Bulgarian literature, both ancient and modern. Then and only then, will you have the chance to truly see the meaning of neutrality. Knowing the issue from one side of the equation leads only to a disequilibrium that is anything but neutral. Please think carefully about what I have said. As stated, I will re-write all those things previously mentioned according to the guidelines of Wikipedia. Further still, I will include those things that I believe are most beneficial to the presentation of Bulgaria in the main article. Have a great day and thank you for understanding.</p>

<dd>I hate to be rude, but this funny quote from a ridiculous source is too much for me to take ... even on a forum. Here is the quote: <i>Republic of Bulgaria. Narodna Republika Bulgaria. 7,517,973. National or official languages: Bulgarian, Turkish. <b>Literacy rate: 90%</b></i> . First of all, "Narodna Republika Bulgaria" is the former, communist, name of the country. Second, you only show the 90% literacy rate. Well, your source claims: "90% to <b>98%</b>". Even if you take the average of this rather large band, it is 94%, and this number is still below the true value. Only then could we discuss Turkish being an official language in Bulgaria. Well, it is not. It is an important language, and one our official institutions respect and provide some services in (e.g. a daily newscast on public TV). So, please, please, please, don't provide these kind of data again. They are laughable, and what is worse - their rebuttal just now wasted 5 minutes of my life. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryout_b7ad.html" title="User:Cryout">Cryout</a> 03:34, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

In my amateur opinion, the schwa is the only vowel closest to ъ. Maybe there was a mistake in the chart then, because I've seen the ram's horns in two different places on the chart (one of them closer to "o"). But you definitely have to mark the difference between the stressed and unstressed "a" — Bulgarian is quite different from, say, French, in which stress doesn't noticeably modify tenseness, openess, etc. Such ambiguities are not uncommon, and I was also thinking about proposing a special template for Bulgarian IPA transcriptions, so that we can easily fix them all, once we have a policy.

I cannot download anything so please help. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 18:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Err, not sure about that. We can't determine exactly which municipalities are notable and which aren't in most cases. Also, the way I proceed with municipalities is write about them in a section on the town article, just as it is with Serbian municipalities (which you gave as an example), because I don't ever think most of them would ever grow larger than a list of places + population/area data (i.e. they wouldn't ever take up more than a paragraph or two). You can see my idea for dealing with this at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Sredets.html" title="Sredets">Sredets</a> or <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleven.html" title="Pleven">Pleven</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, there's also these municipalities which lack a municipal centre (like <a href="../../../../bg/%D0%BE/%D0%B1/%D1%89/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_b913.html" class="extiw" title="bg:Община_Добричка">Dobrichka municipality</a>, which includes the villages around <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobrich.html" title="Dobrich">Dobrich</a>, but the city itself is a municipality of its own. Other peculiar cases include Rodopi municipality and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritsa_municipality.html" title="Maritsa municipality">Maritsa municipality</a> of <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plovdiv_Province_1354.html" title="Plovdiv Province">Plovdiv Province</a>, Tundzha municipality of <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yambol_Province_8386.html" title="Yambol Province">Yambol Province</a>... there could be more. These <i>do deserve</i> an article of their own, just because we can't effectively assign them to a specific other article as a section in the same manner as those which have an administrative centre.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Do you like my idea? <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 12:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All right, sounds good. I like the your idea for Sredets, it should be therefore applied for the other cities and towns. In the Bulgarian version there are maps of the regions with municipalities, I wonder is there a way to be downloaded in the English version? I tried but without success. I think it would be useful for the articles for provinces to have those maps (up to now only <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blagoevgrad_Province_aeb8.html" title="Blagoevgrad Province">Blagoevgrad Province</a> has one). --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 16:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it's perfectly possible, but the names of places on the maps are in Bulgarian and need to be transliterated. I can deal with it, I think&#160;:) I'll also include a "munimap" (or something) parameter in {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Province_of_Bulgaria_f17d.html" title="Template:Infobox Province of Bulgaria">Infobox Province of Bulgaria</a>}}, so we could have it in the infobox. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 09:11, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks a lot. And Happy New Year! Bulgaria deserves its place into the EU - especially because of the further work it is still ready to do in order to help the continental integration. Having said that, I am not sure that the EU is something that defines our country so much as to be the centre-piece of the map that shows Bulgaria's position in the world. I mean that Bulgaria has to be in the centre of its own map and independent of the international organizations that it is a part of - e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> or even <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicef.html" title="Unicef">Unicef</a>.

<p>This are a few examples of errors or false statements that an be found in this article:</p>
<p>1. Quote: "• Founded in 681, Bulgaria is the oldest contemporary country in Europe. ". This statement can be considered true only if one wants to forget about the dissolution of the Bulgarian Empire from XIV century till the last decade of XIX century, and the Ottoman occupation of the whole Bulgarian teritory. Many other contries have been unified for some period of time during the history, but their union did not stand till the modern times. This is why I found this statement at least disputable.</p>
<p>2. Quote: "• In its modern history Bulgaria never lost a flag, captured by an enemy army. ". During The Second Balkan War Bulgaria had lost at least 3 major battles. The war ended desastously for Bulgaria, they lost a lots of teritories to Greeks, Serbians,Ottomans, and Romanians. Moreover, on the last phase of the war the Ottomans and the Romanians have entered on a Bulgaria that had most of its troops on the Serbian front. This lead to one of the most rapid defeat of a country in history, as the Romanian army marched trough Sofia, the Capital City of Bulgaria, in less than 13 days (27 June/10 July 1913). It is at least hilarious to pretend that the Bulgarian army didn't had a military garrison in Sofia, and that they didn't surrender themselves. Please see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Balkan_War" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Balkan_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Balkan_War</a>, or any other appropriate source.</p>
<p>3. Quote: "• Bulgaria has not been in a war since 1945, and has not been involved directly in any of the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. ". Bulgaria was a part of Warsaw Pact, and the country had participated in the invasion of Checkoslovakia during the Praga Spring in 1968. Please take any history book that was not written by the communists to check this fact,or visit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praga_Spring" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praga_Spring" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praga_Spring</a>. Since 1990 Bulgaria was a participant in the economical embargo imposed to ex-Yugoslavia (Bulgaria has a common border with Serbia), and has particpated to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. No more comments about the above statement.</p>
<p>This being a free encyclopedia does not mean that one can write anything he thinks about the subject and deform the historical truth any way he wanted. I'm sorry, but this is a communist manner to impose things. Maybe the site admin will check out for this facts, because it is strange to see such statements on Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bogdan0407 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bogdan0407_3b13.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bogdan0407">contribs</a>) 23:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Dear Apcbg, first of all I want to tell you that I am not a historian, I am just a person who is interested in history. As for your observations:</p>
<p>1. I did not provided any example of another country because it sounds strange to me that the Bulgarians are saying they invented the national state in Europe. After I read a little bit more about this, I found that the Bulgarian Empire (both of them) was/were located exactly on the actual teritory of Bulgaria (and partial over the actual Romanian teritory - the IIend Empire). OK. But this does not mean that we are talking about the first Eurpeean State, the ideea of STATE, as is it percived today has appeared much later, in the XVII - XVIII century. So, all I am saying is that Bulgaria cannot be considered a COUNTRY or a STATE in 681 - it was an EMPIRE, a political structure of that time, and that the "national conscience" did not appear for the first time to the Bulgarian people in 681 AD, before appearing to all the other nations in the world. It is just a question of definition of words. It seems that your acception of the term "NATION" or "STATE" or "COUNTRY" has the tendency to be more extent than the modern "western" acception. In this case, please let me provide with earlier "countries": Italy - the romans (ancestors of actual italian people) lived on the actual Italian teritory since V century BC; Macedonya: now an independent country, existed as a small (not so small during the Great Alexander rule) greek populated independent country long before AD, and they occupied almost the same teritory as the actual Macedonian State. They don't qualify for all time first "countries"? Why? Please enlight me.</p>
<p>2. Sorry, as much as want to provide you right now an example of a Bulgarian military flag from a museum in Romania, Tukey, Serbia, or Greece, I cannot. As I already told you, I am not a historian. I promise I will try to find you a good example in the following weeks. My problem is that the person who posted this information had not cited his source either. So, it is very hard for me to believe that in the context of those impressive defeats, the entire Bulgarian army had succesufully guarded all their flags. If you have any source about this things please share it with me. Please see: <a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/bulg-national-history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/bulg-national-history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/bulg-national-history.htm</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dobro_Pole" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dobro_Pole" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dobro_Pole</a> for a possible flag loss.</p>
<p>3. It seems that you agree with the Bulgarian intervention along with the soviet forces in Prague Spring of 1968, as well as for the economic embargo against former Yugoslavia. For war participation, mea culpa, Bulgaria did not participate in the Afghanistan war, I was a little carried away. However, Bulgaria was a part of the military coalition in IRAQ: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq</a> , even if it has withdrawn his troops in 04/2006. QED.</p>

<dd>Answers:</dd>
<dd>1.Bulgaria was an Empire, but it was populated mainly by Bulgarians, it was not an Empire because it ruled over many peoples, but because the Bulgarian rulers wanted to have the title of the Byzantine emperor, and after successful wars they received it. If the concsiousness of the medieval Bulgarians was not a truely Bulgarian one, we would have never liberated neither from byzantium nor from turkey. I have not heard of contemporary European state founded earlier. The example of Macedonia is ridiculous because the population of ancient macedonia was hellenistic, while of contemporary is Slavic (Bulgarian), the cont. state simply bares the name of the ancient region.</dd>
<dd>You cannot say that Japan was founded in the mid 19th cent. when it introduced a modern style of government, it existed for centuries; you cannot say that France suddenly became a state when this deffinition was introduced in the 16th cent, it existed from 978 when Hugo Capet was crowen; the same is with Bulgaria.</dd>
<dd>2.In the Second Balkan War we DID NOT lose a single battle. In Bregalnitsa the serbs were defeated (though the serb sourses tell sth else), the greeks were surounded in Kresna Gorge, and the romanians were not defeated because there was not a single soldier against them. The war ended before the romanian army enter Sofia (they never did, they were at 30 km) =&gt; the garrison (if there was one I am not sure) did not surrender to anyone. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 09:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. If you look at the <a href="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0700.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0700.htm" rel="nofollow">map of Europe as of 700 AD</a> you would see that surely Bulgaria was not the only European state at that time, nor was it the first one; however, none of those European states survived except Bulgaria. The Frankish Kingdom evolved in several modern states (including France, Germany, Holland etc.); Byzantium was still Roman Empire, and for the Byzantines themselves it always was; they called themselves Romans (ρωμαϊ) and their empire Roman not Hellenic (Greek). Of course the dominant language and culture was Hellenic yet the concept of that empire was not ethnocentric but claimed universality and exceptionality based on special religious ‘mission’ (similarly to the Ottoman Empire later). The Bulgarian Empire followed no such ‘universality’ pattern; even if multinational it was clearly ethnically dominated by the Bulgarians, e.g. like the medieval Hungarian Kingdom in Central Europe was Hungarian dominated while comprising a number of other ethnic groups too. Ancient Macedonia differs from the present Republic of Macedonia geographically, ethnically, and culturally. It comprised the territory of present Greek Macedonia proper; its people, originally related to the Greeks, were Hellenized few centuries BC so their true successors today live in Greece rather than in Skopje or in Bulgarian Macedonia. The changes in the geographical notion of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28region%29.html" title="Macedonia (region)">Macedonia (region)</a> in the subsequent over two millenniums, after Ancient Macedonia was annexed by Rome, were changes made by other peoples, not by the ancient Macedonians themselves.</dd>

<dd>2. You are basing your allegations regarding Bulgarian battle flags on <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_ignorance.html" title="Argument from ignorance">arguments from ignorance and incredulity</a>. The story of all such flags (since the 1878 liberation) was well documented, and the flags safely preserved in Bulgaria. Regarding the flags of military units that were in danger of being taken by the enemy at the end of WWI (there were 12 such flags I believe), none of these was lost. To commemorate the heroism of the Bulgarian officers, sergeants or soldiers who carried those flags across enemy controlled territory back to Bulgaria a special award was established in 1922, <a href="http://www.plevenmuseum.dir.bg/BG_version/photogall/38pfoto.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.plevenmuseum.dir.bg/BG_version/photogall/38pfoto.jpg" rel="nofollow">“For the Salvation of a Flag: 1915-1918”</a>. Just a couple of examples. As you mention Dobro Pole, one of the units fighting there was the 19 Shumen Infantry Regiment, the flag of which was saved and brought from Dobro Pole to Bulgaria by <a href="http://www.vi-books.com/lib/dnev/uvod.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vi-books.com/lib/dnev/uvod.htm" rel="nofollow">Lt.Col.

The Iraq War ended with the fall of Saddam Hussein, following the end of that war Bulgaria participates in a UN-sponsored peacekeeping mission invited by the internationally recognized government of Iraq; Bulgaria is not at war with Iraq (whether declared or not) and has never been.</dd>

<dd>Once again, this is not a discussion forum; I provided the above information as an exception, having neither the time nor the obligation to do your homework; it’s up to you to educate yourself why no other European state has its (widely accepted) date of establishment before that of Bulgaria, who captured whose battle flags, who took part in what war etc. If you are "just a person who is interested in history" as you say, then you might as well pursue your interest, having in mind that history does not value <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_ignorance.html" title="Argument from ignorance">arguments from ignorance and incredulity</a>.

<p>Dear Apcgb, thanks for your answers. I want to say that if what you are saying is the truth, and I am not saying that it is not, I am really impressed with the fact that Bulgarian army didn't lose a flag in its modern history, my respects. As for the military participation of Bulgaria in Iraq, I have to say one more thing. "The Multinational force in Iraq, also known as the Coalition" was not a blue helmets mission, was not a UN mission. Please check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq</a> , and you will see that the Bulgarian forces were part, and still are (as "troops guarding Camp Ashraf in Iraq") part of the coalition, not UNAMI (UN operation in Iraq).</p>
<p>Thanks again for your answers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Bogdan, please read carefully before responding, and deal correctly with your sources too. Nobody says that the Multinational Force in Iraq is a UN force; I wrote "UN-sponsored", and your quoted source confirms that indeed the Multinational Force in Iraq (of which Bulgaria is a part) operates "under a United Nations resolution".

<p>Can we consider Old Great Bulgaria as the same state like contemporary Bulgaria? In my opinion no because the population itself differs, in Great BG it was only by Bulgars, while in Danube BG they merged with the Slavs and formed the Bulgarians; it is the same with Volga BG, it cannot be considerred as our state although its population was Bulgar; the territories were different; from Great BG emerged two seperate states so I think it should be considerred as one of the several BG states, for example Prussia cannot be considerred as Germany, it was found in 1871. What do you think? --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 10:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes we can, at least as much as we consider modern Bulgaria a state that has evolved from Asparuh Bulgaria. In terms of territory Asparuh Bulgaria overlapped more with Great Bulgaria than with modern Bulgaria; it resulted from the expansion of the former to the south of Danube River. The larger portion of Asparuh Bulgaria was situated north of the Danube, and south and east of the Carpathians and along the northwest coast of Black Sea, which were Great Bulgaria's territories. The minor portion of Asparuh Bulgaria situated between the Danube and the Balkan Mountains (Moesia) is the only territory in which it overlaps with present day Bulgaria. Similarly in terms of population, in all those territories it was mixed Bulgar and Slavic people as well as others (dozens of ethnic groups from the Great Migration, also Romanized and Hellenized native population in the cities etc., which subsequently assimilated); it is well established by archeology that the Bulgars lived together with Slavs in the territories north of the Black Sea, while Bulgars and Slavs, both separately and jointly migrated and settled on Byzantine territory south of the Danube on a number of occasions already in the 6th century. The merger of the Bulgars and Slavs into a single ethnic group speaking a common language was a process of change that did not happen to differentiate Great Bulgaria from Asparuh Bulgaria, it happened more than a century later to reach its final stage maybe in the second half of the 9th century. As for Volga Bulgaria, it was an offspring of Great Bulgaria indeed, yet unlike Asparuh Bulgaria that country had no direct territorial or possibly state continuity with Great Bulgaria; it was established on an entirelly new territory, according to some historians that happened not in the 7th century but much later. Still later they changed in a more radical way, and today the languages they speak (Tatar, Chuvash) derive from none of the original languages spoken in Great Bulgaria (Bulgar and Slavic). And finally, unlike the successor state of Asparuh Bulgaria, the successor states of Volga Bulgaria have not even kept the name 'Bulgaria' today. <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 14:27, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It depends on what we consider to be the western border of Great Bulgaria. On most of the maps and till now officially it was the Dneper river (as it is on the map above), while the same river served as an eastern border of Danube Bulgaria so in this case there is no coincedence. I have read the new theories that Great Bulgaria could have reached the Dnester or even the Danube, and if this is true we can accept that Danube Bulgaria is simply extention to the west of Great Bulgaria and both states are one whole, but the question here is "Is it true, are there any proofs for this?" Lastly, if both states were one and the same, why then we say Old Great Bulgaria instead of simply Bulgaria? --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 15:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The map you quote is apparently based on a Byzantine source describing certain Bulgar territories at Azov Sea, Don and Kuban Rivers. However, that source did not specify the western borders of Great Bulgaria. Speaking of those borders ask yourself the question, border with whom? Who was the western neighbour of Great Bulgaria? Before becoming independent, the Bulgars were under Avar domination, or rather a partner/component in a joint Avar-Bulgar state. The Avars were based in Panonia, and eventually retreated there following their defeat at Constantinople in 626. While there is no archeological evidence of Avar population east of the Carpathians after that, there is such ample evidence of the Bulgar population in the steppe region north of Black Sea between the Carpathians to the west and Caucasus to the east. For instance, detailed archeological data presented in the monograph by Rasho Rashev, <i>Die Protobulgaren im 5.-7. Jahrhundert</i>, Orbel, Sofia, 2005 (in Bulgarian, German summary), confirms the Bulgar culture in the 5th-7th centuries not only on the territory around the lower course of Dnieper River (present Herson Oblast), but also well to the west of the Dnieper, in the lower course of Southern Bug River (present Mykolaiv Oblast). On the map <a href="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0600.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0600.htm" rel="nofollow">Europe in 600 AD</a> you may see Bulgars shown in few regions including the territory between Danube and Dniester Rivers. The map <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khazar0.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khazar0.png" rel="nofollow">The Pontic steppe region, c. 650 AD</a> shows Great Bulgaria as extending west of Dnieper River. By the way, there is no reason why in time of peace the head of state of Great Bulgaria should be buried on the border rather than near some important centre of the state; and Khan Kubrat’s grave in Mala Pereshchepina is even wrongly shown on the map you quote (it is actually located further to the northwest in present Poltava Oblast). (One plausible explanation of Kubrat's burial at that particular place would be that the Bulgar tradition was to have two state capitals, a 'winter' and a 'summer' one; and it could be that the 'summer' capital of Kubrat was in Mala Pereshchepina area.) Why Old Great Bulgaria? Because that is the documented name. It exists both in Byzantium documents in Greek, and in its Latin version <i>‘Antiquitus Vulgaria est Magna’</i> (Anastasius Bibliothecarius). Of course, <i>‘Old’</i> was added subsequently by authors who were not contemporaries, so the actual name was more likely just <i>‘Great Bulgaria’</i>. <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 18:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well this is by no means my original research, but what apparently is becoming established among leading Bulgarian historians at least. There is really no serious reason to object the date 632 AD. As for the "official position", that is presently moving towards the possible acceptance of the date 165 AD — not as the founding date of the state of Bulgaria but as the beginning of Bulgarian statehood. This is supported by such historians as Prof. Georgi Bakalov, Vice-Rector of Sofia University, and Prof. Georgi Markov, Director of the Institute of History at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. That idea was presented at a high profile <a href="http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=396&amp;sectionid=1&amp;id=00001" class="external text" title="http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=396&amp;sectionid=1&amp;id=00001" rel="nofollow">conference</a> held at Sofia University in March 2005, with the participation of the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov (himself a historian). It was announced at the conference that this understanding of the early Bulgarian history would be included in the school curricullum. As for 632, Prof. Markov maintained that <i>"Danube Bulgaria was not a new state formation built with the collective effort of Bulgars and Slavs, but a continuation of Kan Kubrat's Bulgaria"</i> (<i>Kan</i> is the form considered more authentic for the Bulgar rulers than <i>Khan</i>.) <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>San Marino is a very old European state, with a fascinating history indeed, yet one should compare equal qualities – in this case the dates of founding as independent states. Yes according to tradition, San Marino was established in 301 AD. However, nobody says that it was an independent state in 301 AD, nor in 632 AD for that matter. As seen from a more detailed narrative of the <a href="http://www.libertas.sm/Storia_generale/In/History_San_Marino_1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.libertas.sm/Storia_generale/In/History_San_Marino_1.htm" rel="nofollow">San Marino history</a> (a San Marino source), “Until 1300 San Marino was a feudal possession of the bishop of Montefeltro, whose diocese, a part of the Papal State was centred at San Leo.” San Marino was originally established as a community of Christians fleeing from persecution, developing (as evidenced from a 1243 document) as an autonomous commune with their own rules, represented by two Consuls (today called Captains Regent), but “still under the feudal authority of the bishop of San Leo”. In the 14th century San Marino succeeded in breaking its feudal dependence; its independence was formally recognized by Pope Pius II in 1463, reaffirmed by the Pope in 1631, and successfully defended with two brief interruptions during the centuries. Therefore, San Marino may possibly qualify as Europe’s oldest distinct ethnic-territorial entity, however countries like Bulgaria or France were founded much earlier as independent states (in 632 AD and 843 AD respectively). <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 09:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>For some year, Bulgaria had the lowest population growth compared to the growth of any country of any year since 1950</li>

<p>(1) seems more plausible, although both seem hard to believe. What about war-torn countries, such as Rwanda or Chechnya? Disregarding reality checks, (2) may be understood considering the reference to the 1990s which is near the sentence.</p>
<p>Also, which population growth was low due to the high emigration rate -- the Bulgarian or the one of Saint Kitts and Nevis?

<p>I see some recent reverts/controversy on that subject. According to some <a href="http://balkani.hit.bg/podanstvo.htm" class="external text" title="http://balkani.hit.bg/podanstvo.htm" rel="nofollow">Bulgarian data</a>, 2/3 of the population there was Bulgarian as of 1941. However, the situation was quite different in Vardar Macedonia on the one hand, where the population was mostly Bulgarian (more so that the Albanian-majority districts in the west were not included), as opposed to eastern Aegean Macedonia and Western Thrace, where the pre-1912 Bulgarian relative majority had shrunk to tiny minority as a result of (1) massive exodus of ethnic Bulgarian refugees after the two Balkan Wars and WWI, partly regulated by the Mollov-Kafandaris population exchange agreement between Bulgaria and Greece; and (2) a population exchange of even larger scale between Greece and Turkey following the 1919-22 Greco-Turkish War. As a result of that radical demographic change, the ethnic Greeks apparently formed a significant majority in the Bulgarian-administered Greek territory during WWII. <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 10:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, which is why it is inconceivable to describe the Bulgarian-<i>occupied</i> (its "administration" was illegal) Greek territories as "inhabited mostly by Bulgarians". <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 11:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But before the awful represions by the greeks after 1912-1918 Western Thrace was populated mainly by Bulgarians who were after the WW1 forced to flee to Bulgaria and many who did not were killed. This is why in WW2 we only returned what was ours and these lands were to be settled again by the refugeees who the greeks expelled.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And, the occupied lands of Yugoslavia (mainly Macedonia) WERE inhabited by Bulgarians and they were not expelled. You remove "Bulgarian-populated" even to those lands.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And what does <i>illegal</i> administration mean??? It might have been illegal for the greeks but NOT for the Bulgarians. Western Thrace was one of the many injust and unreasonable territorial changes made after WW1. Why did the greeks need it? For us it was precious because it gave Bulgaria outlet to the Mediterranean, and for Greece it was just a territory without any significant value, and it is still much inderdevelopped even today. And please, don't even try to tell me that the majority of the population used to be Greek before 1912 because it is ridiculous.</dd>

<dd>I will not change the edit, but you will change it in an approprite way. I know that in 1940s Western Thrace was no more inhabited by Bulgarians, but Macedonia was, so you should leave Bulgarian-populated land for Yugoslavia. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 12:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"We only returned [sic] what was ours"? You've got to be joking. Are you laying claim to Greek territory now? As for the "awful represions by the greeks", you might wish to read up on the treatment meted out by the Bulgarians to the Greeks of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Rumelia_c32b.html" title="Eastern Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a>, not to mention the atrocities committed against the Greeks during the World War II occupation of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Macedonia_and_Thrace_2127.html" title="East Macedonia and Thrace">East Macedonia and Thrace</a> when Bulgaria was a Nazi puppet state. <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 12:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't claim Western Thrace now, though I would like it to be in Bulgaria; but I understand the difference between what I want to and what is possible. What was the treatment of the greeks in Eastern Rumelia? There were not so many greeks there: only in Plovdiv and in some towns along the Black Sea coast. You know perfectly well that 100 ago the vast majority of the population lived in villages, and in Eastern Rumelia there were almost no greek villages (in fact I have never heard of any, but still there might have been a few). We have always respected our neighbours but they never responded with the same; there is now a village on the coast called Irakli, which is inhabited by Greeks who fled from their country to settle in Bulgaria, why did they choose Bulgaria if it was famous with represions against the greeks?</p>
<p>And about the atrocities against Greeks in WW2: these people were not killed because they were Greeks, but because they sabotaged the Army. Thousands of Bulgarians have been killed too throughout the whole country because of the very same reason. In the war there used to be guerilla movements not only by Greeks burt also by Bulgarians who opposed the government and in wartime this is considered treason and the penalty is death.</p>
<p>While the Greek repressions against the Bulgarian population were exactly because these people were Bulgarians, and this repression was much stronger between the two world war than in any war. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 13:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK Gligan, you may like it and its 70% Greek majority to be in Bulgaria, but don't you think it sounds unreasonable?

<p>The list of dates in the info-block in the upper right corner is a mess! First of all the dates are not the officially known or thought at school. They are what some believe was true (as opposed to the official position). Then, little explanation is given on which dates and why are chosen. This is very judicious. For example, it can be argued that the Bulgarian state created in 680 (and recognized by Byzantium in 681) was very different from Great Bulgaria. For one, Bulgaria in the Balkans was ethnically mainly a Slavic state, while Great Bulgaria was a Middle Eastern country (Turkic, or whatever you want it to be). Wikipedia is *not* a place to debate the facts. It is instead a place for the facts themselves. Finally, the will to believe that modern Bulgaria was founded in 632 doesn't make that a fact! --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryout_b7ad.html" title="User:Cryout">Cryout</a> 22:05, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
