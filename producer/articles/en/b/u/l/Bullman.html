<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullman.html" title="Edit section: Bullman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bullman</span></h2>
<p>Once thought to be a mythical creature, created first through the lore of ancient Greeks, and later Romans. He was incorporated into the Eqyptian religion as a gate keeper in place to defeat demonic gods for escaping the underworld. He is often depicted holding a shield made of gleaming silver, splattered with the blood of his enemies. He also is depicted with a large axe, usually oversized for his body. This axe is said to be forged from the souls of all that have fallen to Bullman in battle, and holds their life force within its structure. Bullman has the legs and feet (hooves) of a bull, and the upper body of a man. His head is a morph between both a man and a bull, with a long snout, and horns. On his back there are sometimes said to be leathery wings that enable him to fly (in myth).</p>

<p>In contemporary culture the Bullman remained a myth until the early 2000's, when the world was threatened by the diabolical Ethan James Frost, a billionair who had scoured the globe looking for the lost key (an amulate made of green jade) of Athaulpa Amaru, a key that would create a doorway between worlds, and would merge our world with the world of the damned. When Frost succeeded in finding the lost amulate, he merged the worlds, and gained control over an army of millions of "darklings", shadows of past souls whose souls had been tainted by an eternity in hell, and who lusted for revenge on the living.</p>
<p>The U.S senate, up in arms over the sudden appearance of a national/world threat, and sensing that an apocalypse was nigh, lost all hope, and the nation became shrouded in dispair. One man though, the aging Strom Thumond, the last living member of the Brotherhood od the Bull, knew the time had come to unleash man's last hope for survival. The Brotherhood of the BUll (BOB) had harbored the worlds greatest secret for thosands of years, the existince of a creature that possessed unthinkable strength and power, a being that could bring balance to the world once more of good and evil. As Frost's army of darkness began marching all over the globe, the dying Strom Thurmond traveled to Gastuphual (Minator's Rock) which lay under the ruins of the ancient Inca's in Peru. Here he awaoke for the first time since WW2 Magnus, the last remaining Bullman. As he briefed Magnus on the plight of earth, Thurmond passed away, leaving Magnus alone for the first time in thousands of years. Rage filled his being, and he vowed from that time on to be earth's last stand against evil. Today Magnus still carries out his battle against Frost and his army of "Darklings".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullman.html" title="Edit section: Powers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powers</span></h2>
<p>Bullman has a myriad of powers. He has enhanced intelligence, hundereds of times that of a normal human. His body is nearly indestructable, as his skin is imbued with magical protections from being a gaurdian of the Ancient Eqyptians. He has superhuman strength, and is rumored to be able to cause earthquakes around the world when he beats his fists on the ground. Magnus also has super speed, and can attain the speed of sound when he has room to sprint. At these speeds almost nothing can stop him. Since he is half bull, Magnus can communicate with other animals as well as humans. He has energy manipulation powers in which he can make anything he thinks of manifest into the real world. Magnus also has the gift of forsight, in which he can see a short time into the future to see all the actions he could take in a situation, and their possible outcomes. Magnus, imbued with the powers of the ancient Eqyptians, retains many mysterious powers attributed to ancient religions/magic. These may unfold as the story of Bullman unfolds.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullman.html" title="Edit section: Past Battles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Past Battles</span></h2>
<p>Magnus has battled such forces as the Nazi powers during WW2 after they gained control of the spear of destiny. President Roosevelt called upon Magnus to aid the Allied forces, and because of his presence on the beaches of Normandy the Nazi's fell. Myth attributes Bullman as the reason the following armies fell: Napolean, Gengis Khan, The United States South, Alexander the Great, and the Roman Empire in 476 A.D.. Magnus has also fought and defeated the villan Galactus, Phoenix, and Dr. Doom all at once, and come out the victor.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullman.html" title="Edit section: The Order of Morte">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Order of Morte</span></h2>
<p>In mid- 2006, while on vacation in Boston, a young man named Joshua Blain Lee (JBL) encountered Dark assasins from Ethan Frost's army of attempting to lay seige to the city. Caught in the crossfire JBL was struck down by Frost's soldiers. As he looked upon the shrouded face of the darkling he thought he was drawing his last breath, when suddenly, out of the chaos and destruction that surrounded them, a towering figure with horns protruding from his head walked through the fire. It was Magnus The darkling looked up just as the heroic figure swung the blade of his axe, cleanly cleaving the darkling's head from his shoulders. From out of the smoke filled street emerged more darklings, hundreds, and they threw themselves upon Magnus with a ferocity unequaled. Magnus tore them from his body as if they were rag dolls at first, but soon their dark power began to wear on him. As Magnus killed the last Darkling, he fell to the ground, exhausted, and nearly dead. He noticed the hunched figure of JBL, and felt that his llife force was also low. Knowing the young man would die if he didn't help him, Magnus imparted some of his ancient magic on the young man, and the boy began to morph. JBL morphed into something part man, part Tiger, becoming Talon the first of the future Order of Morte. Talon's power was less than Magnus's abilities, but he did possess the ability to morph between human form and manimal form. In time JBL's two friends, Adam Patrick Marty, and Nick James Fiege woudl also have the power imparted on them. APM became a being that was part Falcon part man, known as Falco. NJF became a being that was half man half shark, known as Tiburón. These three would round out the Order of Morte, and were available for the world to call upon when it was in need.</p>
