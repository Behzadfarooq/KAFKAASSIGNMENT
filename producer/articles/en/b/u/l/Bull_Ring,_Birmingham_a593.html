<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_Ring%2C_Birmingham_a593.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The market began in the year <a href="../../../1/1/5/1154.html" title="1154">1154</a> when Peter de Bermingham a local landowner, obtained a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_charter.html" title="Royal charter">Royal charter</a>. Initially, a textile trade began developing in the area and it was first mentioned in <a href="../../../1/2/3/1232.html" title="1232">1232</a> in a document, in which one merchant is described as a business partner to William de Bermingham and being in the ownership of four weavers, a smith, a tailor and a purveyor. Seven years later, another document described another mercer in the area. Within the next ten years, the area developed into a leading market town and a major cloth trade was established.</p>
<p>The name, Mercer Street, is first mentioned in the Survey of Birmingham of <a href="../../../1/5/5/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>. This was a result of the prominence of the area in the cloth trade. In the <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500s.html" title="1500s">1500s</a> and <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600s.html" title="1600s">1600s</a>, Mercer Street rapidly developed and became cramped. Mercer Street had become known as Spicer Street in the early <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700s.html" title="1700s">1700s</a> and by the end of the century, had developed into Spiceal Street. The result of this name was due to the growing grocery and meat trade on the street which had began to take over the cloth trade. Despite being overcrowded and cramped, many houses on the street had gardens as indicated by an advertisement for a residential property in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1798.html" title="1798">1798</a>.</p>
<p>On a map produced by Westley in <a href="../../../1/7/3/1731.html" title="1731">1731</a>, other markets had developed nearby including food, cattle and corn markets with other markets located nearby on the High Street. This cornmarket was moved to the Corn Exchange on Carrs Lane in 1848. The Bull Ring developed into the main retail market area for Birmingham as the town grew into a modern industrial city.</p>
<p>The earliest known building for public meetings in the town which has any architectural record is the High Cross which stood within the Bull Ring. The last known construction work completed to it was in <a href="../../../1/7/0/1703.html" title="1703">1703</a> before being demolished in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1784.html" title="1784">1784</a>.</p>
<p>A series of events in Birmingham's political history saw the area become a popular meeting place for <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_%28people%29.html" title="Demonstration (people)">demonstrations</a> and speeches among the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> leaders during the <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830s.html" title="1830s">1830s</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840s.html" title="1840s">1840s</a>.</p>
<p>The area, along with Smithfield and Digbeth, became the only place where fairs in the centre of Birmingham could be held in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a> due to disorderly behaviour witnessed at the fairs. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> all fairs were banned from the town.</p>
<p>The area around the market site developed and by the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>, a large number of shops were operating there. Immigrants set up businesses such as flower-sellers and <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella.html" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a> vendors. The <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Nelson_31ea.html" title="Lord Nelson">Lord Nelson</a> statue became the location for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preaching.html" title="Preaching">preaching</a> and political protests. Well known preachers of the time were nicknamed <i>Holy Joe</i> and <i>Jimmy Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700s.html" title="1700s">1700s</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Street_Commissioners_5653.html" title="Birmingham Street Commissioners">street commissioners</a> were authorised to buy and demolish houses in the town centre including houses surrounding the Bull Ring and centre all market activity in the area. This was a result of new markets being established across the city in scattered locations creating severe congestion. Demolition of these properties began slowly however after the Act of <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>, the speed of demolition increased and by <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a>, all properties in the area had been cleared as according to the <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a> Map of Birmingham by Kempson. During the clearance, small streets such as The Shambles, Cock Street and Corn Cheaping, which had existed before the Bull Ring, were removed.</p>
<p>There was a wide area fronting <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Martin_in_the_Bull_Ring_3092.html" title="St Martin in the Bull Ring">St Martin's Church</a> and this was used as the market place for markets. It was decided by the Street Commissioners that a sheltered market hall was needed. They bought the market rights from the lord of the manor and by <a href="../../../1/8/3/1832.html" title="1832">1832</a>, all properties on site had been purchased, with exception of two, the owners of which demanding a higher price. To fund the purchase of these properties, two buildings were constructed either side of the market hall and the leases sold at auction. Construction of the Market Hall, designed by Charles Edge (an architect of <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Town_Hall_7403.html" title="Birmingham Town Hall">Birmingham Town Hall</a>), began in February <a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>. It was completed by Dewsbury and Walthews at a cost of £20,000 (£44,800 if the price of acquiring the land is included) and opened in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> and contained 600 market stalls. The building was grand and the facade consisted of stone mined from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>. Two grand Doric columns were used supports for both wide entrances. At the end of the market day, metal gates were pulled in front of the entrances. In the centre of the 365 foot long, 180 foot wide and 60 foot tall hall was an ornate <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain.html" title="Fountain">fountain</a>, given by the Street Commissioners upon their retirement in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_lighting.html" title="Gas lighting">Gas lighting</a> was introduced to the building which extended the business hours for the market. Installments to the market hall included a clock crafted by William Potts and Sons of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> which consisted of figures of Guy, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Warwick_bf81.html" title="Earl of Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>, the Countess, a retainer and a <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saracen.html" title="Saracen">Saracen</a>. It was moved from the Imperial Arcade at Dale End to the market hall in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> however this was destroyed, along with the rest of the Market Hall, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> by an <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incendiary_bomb.html" title="Incendiary bomb">incendiary attack</a>. Enquiries into the market hall found that <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickpocketing.html" title="Pickpocketing">pickpocketing</a> was commonplace in the building.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_market.html" title="Fish market">fish market</a> was completed on the site of the Nelson Hotel (formerly the Dog Inn). The Dog Inn was located at the top end of Spiceal Street and the land above was owned by the Cowper family. The fish market was built upon Cowper Street, which was named after the Cowper family, on Summer Lane. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>, a sheltered vegetable market in Jamaica Row was also completed.</p>
<p>The trade of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a> prospered in the area with over 3,000 horses for sale at its peak during the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>. However this fell into rapid decline with the last horse trading fair taking place in 1911 with only eleven horses and one donkey in attendance.</p>
<p>A large amount of the area survived <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> however nearby <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Street%2C_Birmingham_0caf.html" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street</a> was heavily bombed. Shops sold tax-free products to encourage shoppers to buy them as it was difficult for the public to buy goods even a decade after the end of the war. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths_Group_f332.html" title="Woolworths Group">Woolworths</a> set up on Spiceal Street in the Bull Ring and became a popular shop, becoming the largest store on the street. The old Market Hall remained as an empty shell and was used for small exhibitions and open markets. No repair work was conducted on the building and the arches which housed the windows were bricked up.</p>

<p>As the redevelopment of 2000 began, archaeological excavations were conducted on the site. Finds dated back to the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> with a ditch being discovered on where the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfridges.html" title="Selfridges">Selfridges</a> store and Park Street carpark are now situated. Archaeologists discovered that this was a boundary that separated houses from a deer park located on an area covered by <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Moor_Street_railway_station_7a7d.html" title="Birmingham Moor Street railway station">Moor Street Station</a>. Rubbish which had been disposed of in the ditch had been discovered too including the fragments of misfired pottery with criss-cross patterns. This indicated that pottery kilns had been located there in the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a>. Many <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather_tanning.html" title="Leather tanning">leather tanning</a> pits dating to the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th centuries</a> were found on the Park Street car park site. These contained fragments of <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucible.html" title="Crucible">crucibles</a>, pottery vessels in which metal was melted. The residues in these were alloys of copper with zinc, lead and tin.</p>
<p>On the site where the Indoor Markets are now located, archaeologists again discovered leather tanning pits dating from the 13th century.</p>
<p>Burials had also been discovered in the churchyard of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Martin_in_the_Bull_Ring_3092.html" title="St Martin in the Bull Ring">St Martin's</a> dating to the 18th and <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Records of families were used to identify the bodies.</p>
<p>Four information panels providing information on the discoveries and history of the site are located in the Bullring at St Martin's Square, Edgbaston Street, Park Street and High Street.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, shops began to close down as the redevelopment of the area was proposed. Plans drawn up showed the creation of new roads and the demolition of old ones and all the buildings on the proposed site. Eleven companies submitted plans for the new Bull Ring however, Birmingham City Council elected to go for Laing's proposal which used substantial material from designs by James A. Roberts. Demolition began in the late 1950s beginning with the demolition of the old fish market. Construction commenced in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>.</p>
<p>The outdoor market area was opened in June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> with 150 stalls within the new Bull Ring, which was still under construction. The demolition of the old Market Hall began in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> construction of the 'new' Birmingham Bull Ring Centre neared completion. It was a mixture of traditional open-air market stalls and a new indoor shopping centre, one of the first of its kind in the UK. It was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip_ba9c.html" title="Prince Philip">Prince Philip</a> alongside Alderman Frank Price and Sir Herbert Manzoni on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, 1964 and had cost an estimated £8 million. The shopping centre covered 23 acres and had 350,000 sq feet of retail trade area.</p>
<p>The market area was submerged and had approximately 150 stalls with the majority selling food. It was split by a large road which connected to the inner ring road which was built from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> till <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. There was direct access to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_Station_d49a.html" title="Birmingham New Street Station">New Street Station</a> and the market area could be easily accessed from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Moor_Street_railway_station_7a7d.html" title="Birmingham Moor Street railway station">Moor Street Station</a>. A multi-storey car park was also located within the complex. Access to roads by foot could be achieved through a network of subways.</p>
<p>Jamaica Row and Spiceal Street had been demolished and removed during the development, being replaced by a submerged market area.</p>
<p>There were 140 shop units located on 350,000 square feet of room on a four acre site. The designers had designed the shopping centre to have air conditioning and had <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> to be played to create an intimate atmosphere within the building.</p>
<p>Near New Street Station was the Old Market Hall which had been destroyed by fire. This had been left derelict for years before being demolished in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> and replaced by Manzoni Gardens, an open space designed for shoppers to relax.</p>
<p>A mural of a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull.html" title="Bull">bull</a> was located on the side of the building as visitors entered via the road splitting the market area.</p>
<p>However, the 1960s Bull Ring Centre had problems from the outset and was very much a product of its time. At the time of its opening it was considered the height of modernity however higher rentals within the shopping centre meant that traders turned away from it. The public were also less inclined to use the subways and escalators, which stopped working regularly. Also, it did not age well and soon became generally regarded as an unfortunate example of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutalist.html" title="Brutalist">Brutalist</a> architecture, with its boxy grey <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a> design and its isolation within ringroads connected only by dangerous subways. It was, in later days, much disliked by the public.</p>

<p>Plans for redevelopments were first aired in the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> and a masterplan was produced. However, soon after the publication of the masterplan, changes were made to the design. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Selfridges voiced reservations about opening a store in Birmingham due to restrictions on doing so and considered opening a store in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> instead.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> Bull Ring Shopping Centre was demolished in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> with the traders moving to the Rag Market in Edgbaston Street. It was replaced by a new design, mixing both traditional market activity with modern retail units. The first building to be completed was the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationwide_Building_Society_d0e4.html" title="Nationwide Building Society">Nationwide Building Society</a> which, while not directly connected to the shopping centre, was part of the development. A new indoor <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_mall.html" title="Shopping mall">shopping centre</a>, "Bullring" (as the commercial entity is branded) opened on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">September 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and features a dramatic new landmark building, housing a branch of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfridges.html" title="Selfridges">Selfridges</a> department store. The latter is a novel, futuristic design from the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Systems_f5f2.html" title="Future Systems">Future Systems</a> architectural practice, clad in 15,000 shiny aluminium discs<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, inspired by a <a href="../../../p/a/c/Paco_Rabanne_95f4.html" title="Paco Rabanne">Paco Rabanne</a> sequinned dress<sup id="_ref-Selfconstruct_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Selfconstruct" title="">[4]</a></sup>. The Selfridges store cost £60 million and the contractor was <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laing_O%27Rourke_013a.html" title="Laing O'Rourke">Laing O'Rourke</a>. Covering an area of 25,000 m², the designs for the Selfridges store were first unveiled in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, not long before demolition of the original shopping centre began. The Selfridges store has won eight awards including the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects_5536.html" title="Royal Institute of British Architects">RIBA Award for Architecture</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and Destination of the Year Retail Week Awards <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first week saw the shopping centre under considerable pressure due to the large crowds it attracted. On September 4, 2003, the day of opening, 276,600 people visited the shopping centre<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The shopping centre is comprised of two main buildings which are connected by an underground passage lined with shops and is also accessible from St Martin's Square via glass doors. Touchscreen computers, developed by Calm Digital<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup>, are located throughout the building which allow a user to search for the location of a certain store or browse a map of the building.</p>
<p>The entire redevelopment was accompanied by an official project magazine and then commemorated with an 'art book' style book which covered the Bullring's transformation in illustration and photography. Both book and magazine were produced by specialist publisher Alma Media International <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> on behalf of the developers.</p>
<p>The doors to both wings from New Street can be removed when crowds get large and queues develop at the doors. This feature also allows cars which are often on display to be driven into the building.</p>
<p>It is part of the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_redevelopment_plan.html" title="Birmingham redevelopment plan">Birmingham redevelopment plan</a>. The centre contains the second of only six <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Retail_Store_7748.html" title="Apple Retail Store">Apple Stores</a> to be opened in the UK, and a large <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixons.html" title="Dixons">Dixons</a> store, originally opened as Dixons XL, and rebranded as <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currys.digital.html" title="Currys.digital">Currys.<i>digital</i></a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> along with the rest of the chain. The Dixons store has had disappointing sales and a section of the store which has been used predominantly for the sales of video games and games consoles has now been closed to the public. A number of shop units have also closed down due to the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administration_%28insolvency%29.html" title="Administration (insolvency)">collapse of their national retail chains</a>, including shops such as <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike%2C_Inc._7cbe.html" title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a>, Elle, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gadget_Shop_bb05.html" title="The Gadget Shop">The Gadget Shop</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_Zone_e61e.html" title="Music Zone">Music Zone</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A part of the James A. Roberts design for the first Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12 storey circular office block. However, upon revising his design this was increased to 25 storeys. As a result of this, plans for a rooftop restaurant and a cinema were dropped. This became the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotunda_%28Birmingham%29_54de.html" title="Rotunda (Birmingham)">Rotunda</a> and is a surviving component of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> development.</p>
<p>It which is currently being converted into apartments by developers <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Splash_84ad.html" title="Urban Splash">Urban Splash</a>. Although being located close to the development and constructed at the same time as the 1960s centre, it was not part of the development despite being included in the design. A poem is engraved into one of the stones in the wall of the Bullring dedicated to the Rotunda.</p>
<p>The public space to the front of both malls facing the High Street and New Street is named Rotunda Square after the building.</p>

<p>In its first year of service, 36.5 million visitors to the new Bullring were recorded, making it the most visited shopping centre outside the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_of_London_ea44.html" title="West End of London">West End of London</a><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup>. This exceeded even the most optimistic predictions, and for the Bullring's supporters has justified the £530 million cost of building it. The new Bullring is now one of Europe's largest city centre shopping centres.</p>
<p>An advertising campaign begun during the year to attract visitors. The campaign consisted mainly of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_advertisements.html" title="Television advertisements">television advertisements</a> which used the slogan; "Europe's shopping capital is no longer on the mainland."</p>
<p>Leaflets were handed to the public so that the managers of the shopping centre could hear of the views of the people who visit it.</p>
