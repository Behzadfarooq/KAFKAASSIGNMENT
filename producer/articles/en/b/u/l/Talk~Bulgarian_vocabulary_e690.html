<p><a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> is insisting on the title "Bulgarian lexis" to the extent that he is making cut'n'paste moves of the article right now and is regarding my move as unjustified since I did not make an inquiry about it on the talkpage. I would like to point out that the move was very uncontroversial, since "vocabulary" is the most commonly used term and is the most desierable since it is both more general and better known than "lexis".<br />
If anyone wants to insist on "lexis", then you'll have to build consensus on the talkpage rather than revert warring and making crude and unsatisfying moves of article content. Currently, the consensus is very clearly that "vocabulary" should be used.<br />

<p>I would like to get an explanation as to why the article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> was blocked by you after <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">User:Peter Isotalo</a> repeatedly moved the content of the article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_lexis.html" title="Bulgarian lexis">Bulgarian lexis</a> to the new name, Bulgarian vocabulary, without justification and without giving a plausible reason for that. Let's look at the meanings of the two words in the first online dictionary I came upon (it happened to be wordreference [www.wordreference.com ]):</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocabulary: (1)a language user's knowledge of words. (2)the system of techniques or symbols serving as a means of expression (as in arts or crafts); "he introduced a wide vocabulary of techniques. (3)a listing of the words used in some enterprise</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lexis: (1)all of the words in a language. (2) all word forms having meaning or grammatical function:</li>
</ul>
<p>As the article refers to the whole body of words in the Bulgarian language, I would like to ask you: which word refers better to the meaning of the article, vocabulary or lexis? Don't tell me - because the dictionary has already stated it explicitly, it is <b>lexis</b>!!!</p>
<p>In view of the above, could I get an explanation as to why, you, in your capacity of administrator, have sided with an editor in order to institutionalise a wrongful edit? I would like to ask you to remove the protection of the article or give me a very reasonable explanation as to why this protection has been effected in the first place and as to why, since it institutionalised a wrongful edit, which wreaks damage to the overall understanding of the article, continues to be in place. I don't think it is proper and adequate of an administrator to side with an user and I will contact other administrators so that measures compliant with Wikipedia policies can be taken against the wrongful steps taken by you and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">User:Peter Isotalo</a>. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 14:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So far we have VMORO saying that "lexis" is the only reasonable option and everyone else saying that it's too obscure or narrowly-defined, that "lexicon" would be more correct and a precedent of multiple equivalent articles using <b>XXX vocabulary</b> (<a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_vocabulary.html" title="Portuguese vocabulary">Portuguese vocabulary</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_vocabulary.html" title="Spanish vocabulary">Spanish vocabulary</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_vocabulary.html" title="Turkish vocabulary">Turkish vocabulary</a>). On top of this VMORO doesn't want to recognize any dictionary definition presented other than by himself.</dd>
<dd>I think more than just good will and strict neutrality is needed to define the current sitution as anything but one user refusing to recognize a de facto and common sense "vocabulary"-consensus.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for summarizing. Based on a brief view of the debate, I feel that I can see both sides. The term "lexis" is indeed more precise for what is being discussed; however it is definitely not a word that is in common usage. Looking at other examples on the Wikipedia, the term "&lt;language&gt; vocabulary" seems to be the standard that is being used (at least, if there is a "&lt;language&gt; lexis" article, I am unaware of it). Doing a Google search on the terms, I got 170 hits when searching on "Bulgarian lexis", and 430 hits when searching on "Bulgarian vocabulary". Another related term seems to be "Bulgar Vocabulary". My own feeling at this point is that really either title would be appropriate, but if it were put to a vote, that I would choose "Bulgarian vocabulary", with redirects set up from the terms "Bulgar vocabulary", "Bulgar lexis", and "Bulgarian lexis". It might also be worth setting up a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Straw Poll</a> on this page so that other wikipedians could take a look and easily vote. I know that when I first followed the RfC link, I was a bit bewildered as to what exactly I should be commenting on, but a Straw Poll would help focus the question. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the article is now, "lexis" is not more precise, it has the same value that "vocabulary" can have: all the words of a language. See these entries from Merriam-Webster, and I rest my case:<a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vocabulary" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vocabulary" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, [<a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/lexicon" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/lexicon" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/lexis" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/lexis" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (for the definition of <i>lexis</i> Merriam-Webster directs one to the 2a definition of <i>lexicon</i>, which has the same meaning as the 2a definition of <i>vocabulary</i>...). I would like someone to bring proof that <i>lexis</i> is more precise for the current purpose of this article. <i>Vocabulary</i> has the same value, is extremely more common, and is even used in some linguistic textbooks as we intend to use it; and it is the standard in Wikipedia.

<dd>The words are different in certain situations. For example, if someone were learning a language, they might say, "So far, I have a vocabulary of 75 words," or "my child has a vocabulary of 500 words". To my knowledge, no one ever says, "I have a lexis of 75 words". But even though the word "lexis" might be more precise for what this article is about, I would still vote for the more common term of "vocabulary". For example, the Wikipedia page on dogs is labeled simply "<a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">Dog</a>", not "Canis lupus familiaris", which is set up to redirect to the "Dog" page. The general Wikipedia guideline is always to go for "most common English usage", which is why I think that the title of "Bulgarian vocabulary" is more appropriate. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 01:31, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, it is more common and sufficient. What I meant was that as the article is now, the term <i>vocabulary</i> under its 2a definition is as precise as needed ("all the words of a language"). VMORO's wordreference.com link gave two definitions for <i>lexis</i> 1) all the words of a language (see <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocabulary.html" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a>) 2) all the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphemes.html" title="Morphemes">morphemes</a> of a language. At present, the article is not discussing any morphemes that are not full words; and a definition of vocabulary can conceivably include "all the morphemes of a language" (though I have not found this explicitly stated yet). If somehow we agree to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_lexis.html" title="Bulgarian lexis">Bulgarian lexis</a> or Bulgarian lexicon, then it will have to be applied to all such articles, but it seems kind of pedantic to me. Alexander 007 02:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, since a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">word</a> is a unit of language that carries meaning, and no one can fully agree on what is and what is not a word, then any <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpheme.html" title="Morpheme">morpheme</a> (=the smallest linguistic unit that can have a meaning) can also be considered a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">word</a>; so "all the words of a language" (cf. <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocabulary.html" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a>) is sufficient and precise. But anyway, such morphemes are not discussed in the article yet. Alexander 007 02:18, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Peter Isotalo blames me that <i>"I allow only the use of the dictionary"</i>, again a statement without any justification (as usual). Check Bartleby, check American heritage, check the large Oxford, then make statements like this. Lexis has only the meaning of "all words of a language", vocabulary can have that meaning, as well - among 4 to 5 others. But the widest used meaning of "vocabulary" is the "number of words, which a speaker of a language is familiar with". Lexis is a more scholarly term and it is the only one used in linguistic literature, so the "google criteria" has only a restricted application here. I am moving the article to Bulgarian lexis where it originally belonged until the dispute is resolved.

<dd>As is plain from the talkpage, there is no consensus for this. That it happened to be created as "lexis" doesn't give it some special status to protect it against the opinions of editors other than the creator.</dd>

<ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, the choice of terms like "lexis" (and "word-stock" in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_language.html" title="Bulgarian language">Bulgarian language</a>) stems from its usage in <i>The Slavonic Languages</i> (Routledge 1993) where "lexis" is used consistently. Quite appropriate for a book intended for academics, but not for a dictionary intended for the general public. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 17:57, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(via <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_surveys_7ea5.html" title="Wikipedia:Current surveys">Wikipedia:Current surveys</a>) I'd go with "Bulgarian vocabulary" on the grounds that more people consulting a general encyclopedia such as Wikipedia would have an idea of the article's content than the overly technical "Bulgarian lexis". The article could benefit from a brief introductory paragraph, which could then contain the clarification from "vocabulary" to "lexis".

While <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocabulary.html" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a> can have this meaning as well, it’s not usual, and I would understand <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a> to mean nothing more or less than Bulgarian words. <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">Lexicon</a> is better known than <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis.html" title="Lexis">lexis</a>, and therefore it might be the best choice ... but <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis.html" title="Lexis">lexis</a> is almost as good. —<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_G._Brown_7cee.html" title="User:Stephen G.

<li>Bulgarian words is exactly the meaning we want to convey.

<ul>
<li>If that’s all you want it to mean, then it’s okay to say <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_vocabulary.html" title="Bulgarian vocabulary">Bulgarian vocabulary</a>. In this case, I think a better choice would be Bulgarian glossary. However, I thought we were trying to convey the idea of a complete <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventory.html" title="Inventory">inventory</a> of words in the language, with attention to sources of word-stock (such as Turkish, Bulgar, OCS, Romanian), how the words developed, and past and current processes for word production (such as prefixing, compounding, and so on). If this is what we’re attempting to say, then <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis.html" title="Lexis">lexis</a> or <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">lexicon</a> would be a better choice in my opinion. In particular, I don’t believe that any consideration at all should be given to how common or rare the word is ... we should select the best word for the job, and then people will easily learn it if it is of interest to them. You may recall the term Rump Yugoslavia that was popularized not long ago ... when the media first began to use <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rump.html" title="Rump">rump</a> in this sense, it was an unusual and generally forgotten meaning, but people understood it instantly and they liked it ... because it was the best word for the job. —<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_G._Brown_7cee.html" title="User:Stephen G.

<ul>
<li>"Glossary" is a form of word list. It's a publication format, not the combined mass of words in a given language. And there is simply no way for anyone misunderstand "vocabulary" unless there's a clear intent to split hairs. It's <i>just a simpler choice of words</i>, not a different meaning and our interest is <i>not</i> to spread certain vocabulary (heh), but first and foremost to inform about a topic. Popularizing ink horn terms is something best done in your own work and writings or Wiktionary, not in Wikipedia. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 08:03, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree that there is no way for anyone to misunderstand "vocabulary", splitting hairs or not. To me, it’s a stretch to use "vocabulary" to mean what you want it to mean, the combined mass of words in a language. On the few times that I have encountered this usage, it always surprised me, because I expected it to mean a form of word list (glossary). I agree with you that it is not our job to spread vocabulary, but neither should we shrink from taking the best word without regard (as I explained above) to how rare or common the choices of word might be. You are implying that my motive is popularizing ink horn expressions, and that is incorrect and unjustified. I’m not going to argue with you anymore ... I said I strongly favor <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis.html" title="Lexis">lexis</a> or <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">lexicon</a> over the alternatives, and that’s how it is. <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocabulary.html" title="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> is at the bottom of my list and nothing you say can change my understanding of good English and my feel for the language. This is my last word on the subject. —<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_G._Brown_7cee.html" title="User:Stephen G. Brown">Stephen</a> 07:54, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of the two, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Lexis (linguistics)">lexis</a> is actually more correct than <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">lexicon</a> if it is agreed that this article will detail <i>lexis</i> in the full linguistic meaning of the term.

<p>I'll get back to the dispute over the title, which is not a big deal, but should be standard for all Wiki articles of this type. Back to the article's text itself, the sound-change patterns on loanwords entering Bulgarian should be detailed. Alexander 007 03:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
