<p>Has Zeraeph done anything at Wikipedia that made you think that he or she is a bully? How about a target? How about a bystander? What is it that he or she did? Why did you think like that? ~~ Raistlin Majere ~~</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Raistlin, it's ok, it's just somebody I know for years who wanted his own way and didn't get it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Over the years a lot of people connected to abuse support related issues have got used the internet as a place where they can just wake up one morning and announce that they are an expert in something, and then reinforce it by promoting themselves as an expert on as many sites as possible, particularly those where you can self publish text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They aren't all bad people, they don't all mean harm as such (very few really do, they just want kudos and affirmation), what they don't understand is that nobody gets to be an *expert* through personal experience, enthusiasm and opinion alone. The sad part is that, as you watch them, over the years, they seem to get more and more spiteful and unscrupulous with every obstacle they encounter, and it seems that, whatever abuse they began by opposing, becomes nothing more than a pejorative term for anyone who does not give them blind, unquestioning support.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing these people never seem to understand easily is that Wikipedia is not just another self publishing site where they can promote their self appointed expertise. Wikipedia is a serious attempt at a serious encyclopaedia, where information must be verified from reliable sources, and where recognised and qualified expertise trumps all claims, and that a serious Wikipedia editor is only interested in running down and posting that information, not in promoting personal agenda.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, anyone can edit, but there are a feck of a lot of us, who take Wikipedia very seriously, to jump on, and revert, misinformation, often in minutes rather than hours, and we do. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just had to remove a lot of text, some of which suggested important information to me, all of which was posted in a single hour without one single citation.</p>

<p>There is an growing volume of subjectivity, partial information and misinformation on this topic on the internet posted by self appointed experts, most usually individuals who self report as "victims of bullying", which, however well -intentioned they may be, makes them too subjective and inclined to over identify to the point of not just POV but some serious distortions.</p>
<p>The trouble is it is just TOO EASY fall into the trap of assuming that some of this misinformation is established and verified fact or academic theory, when, too often it is just one person's, subjective, thinking.</p>
<p>I think it is very important on Wikipedia to dismiss all that misinformation and get back to established and verified fact or academic theory, from reputable sources and objective experts.</p>
<p>I personally feel bullying is a very important topic and that we owe it to those who have been bullied, are being bullied and will be bullied to present the most thorough, valid, objective and balanced information we can find.</p>
<p>Because of the plethora of misinformation already available, I am hoping we can try to achieve this by sticking to citing sources that people can, at least partially, check for themselves, rather than obscure paper only sources?</p>

<dd>I think you may mistake me, because I certainly do not think "Bullycide" a word invented, rather cynically, to promote a book in 2001, is an important subject at all.

<dd>Me neither. I actually contributed somewhat to the article to add a few examples of people dying as a result of bullying, but since this word is a neologism (I guess I should have paid attention to the first sentence!), I fully agree with the delete decision. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>Ê•</b></a> 02:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair enough. But is there someplace else we can put the information from that article, perhaps a section in the bullying article? <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 19:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, that is a really valid point that was occurring to me, because, though the word may be new and artificial, the phenomenon of people being literally bullied to suicide is very real and very significant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you could come up with something? Always remembering that the more valid, verifiable and reliable the sources, the more significant the subsection will be and the more impact it will have on readers...and, out of respect for those who have been literally "bullied to death" I would like to see the subsection have a great deal of impact. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 20:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may be biased against "fictional examples", but I went to the deleted article and looked at the real-life examples. If we decide to use these examples, I'll probably need to undelete the history of the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullycide.html" title="Bullycide">bullycide</a> article and redirect it to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bully.html" title="Bully">bully</a> to preserve <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> attribution requirements. Therefore, please just look at these examples and discuss them before we put them in the main article. I need to preserve GFDL before we put this content up:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Curtis Taylor</b> committed suicide on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> when he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the head after three years of bullying.</li>
<li>Thirteen-year-old <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jared_High_a337.html" title="Jared High">Jared High</a> was brutally assaulted by a known schoolyard bully. After he and the bully were both suspended, he became depressed, and eventually committed suicide.</li>
<li>Twelve-year-old Debbie Shaw died from injuries received from fighting a bully at a British school.</li>
<li>Jean Evans, a teacher in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_b9b2.html" title="West Midlands">West Midlands</a>, committed suicide because of bullying from students. Another teacher at the same school committed suicide shortly afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, these need to be cited per <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>.

<dd>We already have Curtis Taylor as an example of school bullying. Debbie Shaw should really being in the school bullying section too, because her tragic end was not suicide but certainly needs recognition.

<dd>What is far more unique in bullying is how bullied victims sometimes take revenge by murdering classmates and coworkers. While it is relatively rare for a victim to seek retaliation, bullying revenge results in mass murders, often indiscriminate, and then suicide by the victim.<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.129.94.161 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.129.94.161.html" title="User talk:172.129.94.161">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.129.94.161_6c71.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.129.94.161">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>As a word, "Bullycide" means bully-kill, not "death by bullying". So it applies to bullies being killed by their victims, not how sometimes victims of bullying commit suicide. In any event, the word should be used in a reliable source before we use it in this article. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 00:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zeraeph is right, according to the article and the AfD, the term "bullycide" is a neologism invented in a book and is of insufficient notability to warrant its own article. The concept of people dying through bullying (whether by suicide or homocide) itself is not new, so therefore, examples of this may warrant inclusion in this bullying article, as long as the examples are well-sourced. BTW, in case Zeraeph wasn't clear enough, it's best to sign your comments using the following four characters: --~~~~ --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>Ê•</b></a> 02:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you're looking for sources, just google "bullycide". I guarantee there will be more than enough results. And like I suggested, we wouldn't necessarily have to even use the word "bullycide". If, for example, it was a section in this article, it could be called "Cases of death as a result of bullying" or something to that effect. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 20:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I don't think we should use the word "bullycide" (there is too much jargon and too many faddish "buzz words" already, without making more) if you look under "Effects of Bullying" you will see that a small beginning already sort of made itself on introducing the topic of death due to bullying. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 21:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it seems to make sense to add to that. The word "bullycide" doesn't even need to be mentioned. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 01:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since everyone seems to agree on this issue, I have added the examples from the defunct Bullycide article to the Effects section of this article, plus a source. If anyone doesn't agree with this, please discuss changes before making them. Many thanks, <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 23:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The additions are fine, but they really do need to be properly cited. The only citation included is basically from a one man website that does not satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in this capacity. There surely must be press sources? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 00:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only problem now is getting permission to use the sites. ZackM 01:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)ZackM</p>

<dd>Fortunately there is no need for permission to cite publically accessible articles. As I have now done. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 01:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, I was just looking for some sources myself. However, I have added <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reena_Virk_852d.html" title="Reena Virk">Reena Virk</a> as an example, because I think we should have at least one example that was not suicide. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 01:51, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Totally, that is brilliant...also it would be a shame to miss out any other deaths that are the subject of WP articles? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 01:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Excellent addition. As a fellow Canadian, I should have thought of Reena Virk immediately. Actually, these cases set a good precedent, they either have their own articles or are properly sourced. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>Ê•</b></a> 03:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Definately felt the list needed a bit of "internationalising" too myself. Truth is, when you go looking there are SO MANY examples of children dying in a manner that has been connected to bullying that it would make your blood run cold. The important thing is to only include those examples where the connection has been established beyond allegation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to include an example of at least one adult conclusively proven (which rules out Deepcut Barracks which, as far as I know is still contested) to have died as a result of bullying. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 11:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Were you thinking of adults dying as a result of workplace bullying or as a result of bullying by youth? <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 23:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either, both...it's not important, what IS important is that they be verifiable, and established to be bullying related, not just claimed or alleged to be (or worse, sub judica)...that's why it wasn't possible to use Jean Evans, there is no way of knowing to what extent the claim was substantiated, or even what form the bullying took. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 23:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, and on another note, I think we should consider making the names of the examples we have, except those who already have their own pages, to redirect to this article. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 23:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On this I don't know...not sure how it would sit with criteria for notability? Also, if the search engines pick it up how will it add to the search listings? I would love to honor all these people to the limit...but there are SO MANY of them, we cannot even begin to list all the established cases, just examples, and every one of them is equally important. Let's see what others have to say?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A further thought, might there be a sufficient case for a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_died_due_to_bullying.html" title="List of people who died due to bullying">List of people who died due to bullying</a> article, with a cited paragraph for each case, to be able to list more of them? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 23:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Its starting to sound like a good idea, since there are so many cases. And I agree that we should include some examples from outside North America, though these seem to be hard to come across, unfortunately. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasiscool_b2fc.html" title="User:Thomasiscool">Thomasiscool</a> 15:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In Delaware, United States ... and perhaps in other states ... legislation has appeared in the form of the "School Bullying Prevention Act" <a href="http://www.legis.state.de.us/lis/lis144.nsf/vwlegislation/D8E206BE3B23259B8525725E00673294?open" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legis.state.de.us/lis/lis144.nsf/vwlegislation/D8E206BE3B23259B8525725E00673294?open" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which aims "to provide a safer learning environment for students attending public schools". I am not familiar with the topic in general and thought I would mention this here in case anyone would like to pursue it from any suitable angle.

<p>It just occurred to me that protection rackets are organised, profit-orientated bullying and a large part of the Gang Culture consists in ritualised bullying. Shouldn't both be mentioned here with links to main articles? Particularly if we can find sources for some academic research into the bullying aspects of either phenomenon to cite? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 18:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
