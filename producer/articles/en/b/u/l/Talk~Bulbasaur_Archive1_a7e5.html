<dd>It was argued that names in other languages aren't important information. That's why they shouldn't be put in the intro of the article.

<p>But this is absolutley inconsistent: every single Pokémon has German and French names following its Japanese name, but Bulbasaur is the only one that doesn't. Why is this? <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> 17:23, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I think it's the other articles that have a problem - Japanese and English are almost exclusively the names used for Pokemon as they are created in Japan and widely marketed in the US, and this is the English Wikipedia, not German or French. —<b><a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen"><font color="darkgreen">Cuiviénen</font></a></b> <font size="1">(<b><a href="../../../c/u/i/User_talk%7ECuivienen_9aca.html" title="User talk:Cuivienen"><font color="darkblue">Cuivië</font></a></b>)</font> 18:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But why does this one have to be different?

<p><i>During the grass field battle of the Indigo League tournament, a battle competition that takes place on the Indigo Plateau, Ash’s Bulbasaur defeated two of the opponent’s three Pokémon on its own (a Beedrill and a Scyther), despite little fighting experience as a part of Ash’s team.</i></p>
<p>I don't understand the last part. Bulbasaur was part of Ash's team for the majority of the first season. If anything, the victories were notable in that Bulbasaur defeated two Pokemon in a row whom he had a type disadvantage against (Bug is strong against Grass). Anyway, I would be bold and change it, but since this is a FA now, I wanted to see if there were any objections first. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a> 07:13, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think what it means( how I read it, anyway,) is that Ash didn’t use it in battles very often before the League competition. Though for that matter, Beedrill’s other type is Poison, and Scyther’s is Flying, so they Both had a double advantage! Unless Poison is resistant to Poison... hmm... I think it is, actually... -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 21:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is, partially. In the games, a poison attack like Poison Sting is not very effective on Bulbasaur. He still did use Bulbasaur a bit though. Bulbasaur fought Tangela for the Rainbow Badge, despite losing. Didn't it fight Ditto, too? And then that Rhyhorn, in the episode where it almost evolved. And Venonat, which it beat (again, a type disadvantage). <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic</a><a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">Acid</a> 08:42, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the original Red/Blue/Yellow series of games, Bulbasaur was strong against Poison attacks because it was part Poison itself- this took precedence over Grass's weakness. After Pokemon Stadium and in all subsequent games, the two multipliers simply cancel each other out- Grass type makes the Poison attack twice as effective, Poison type makes the Poison attack half as effective, so the net effect on the attack's strength is zero. The same applies if you use Bug type, since the same weaknesses and strengths apply. Also, as a long term player of the game, I can tell you right now that a Bulbasaur beating a Beedrill, Venonat or Rhyhorn is nothing special- the first two are rather ineffective as offensive players and don't have any moves which are super effective against Bulbasaur, apart from Venonat's Psychic-type moves, which they never use in the anime(IIRC), and Rhyhorn has a double weakness against Grass types, making them four time as effective, and low Special stat/Special Defence Stat, depending on generation. Scyther also has a very sparse movepool that's actually strong against Bulbasaur- Wing Attack is the only one is learns naturally, IIRC, and it doesn't do much good, considering Bulbasaur's respectable Physical Defence stat, and the low base attack of Wing Attack(60, boosted to 90 by STAB)- and this is all academic anyway if that Scyther didn't use it. Scyther also had a *BEEP*ing atrocious Special Stat in the original games, meaning it's resistance, which meant half instead of quarter damage in that generation, was cancelled out, so Bulbasaur didn't really have a net type disadvantage against Scyther in that generation. Anyway, as far as low battle experience goes, maybe Ash had Exp All, or that Rhydon was very high level- I can see Bulbasaur being able to beat a Rhydon that was 15 or 20 levels above it, since it would be a OHKO if the Rhyhorn first attack missed or was just plain rubbish. Also, we don't know how much experience Bulbasaur had before joining Ash's team, and starter Pokemon are always have higher base stats than regular Pokemon, anyway.
