<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Dealing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dealing</span></h3>
<p>The entire deck is dealt one card at a time facedown to the players. It is generally considered more important to have every card in play than for each player to start with exactly the same number.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the game is played with only two players, one should not use all of the cards, because both players will know what cards the other player has; instead, both players should be dealt about a dozen cards each, and the rest go unused.</p>
<p><a name="The_Stack" id="The_Stack"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: The Stack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Stack</span></h3>
<p>The center of the table will hold a pile of cards played during the game. Play starts differently according to different rules. Some people play with whoever has the two of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suit_%28cards%29.html" title="Suit (cards)">clubs</a>, others start with ace of clubs, or spades, and yet others start with the makers card in some versions of the game in their hand and continues clockwise.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Player Turns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Player Turns</span></h3>
<p>On each turn, the player must play the cards he has of a certain rank. There are two common variants of the game. In the first, the rank must be one above the rank played by the previous player (twos, then threes, then fours). The player selects the cards to play, announces how many are being played (any number) and their rank ("two fours"), and places them facedown in the pile in the centre. If the player doesn't actually have the cards needed to play at least one of the correct rank, he is still required to play, and so must bluff, or bullshit (lie about it), hence the names of the game. It is also permissible to bluff if the player does have cards of the given rank, for example, by playing and announcing "two Kings" when he has only one.</p>
<p>Optionally, jokers may be used as either a "wild card" or as an automatic bullshit.</p>
<p>In a much rarer version of the game the players should only play one card and play the same suit that the previous player. The version's tactical elements are very different from the one dealt with in this article.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Bullshit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bullshit</span></h3>
<p>The next part of the game is subject to two major variations. After each player takes his turn and before the next player has, one of two things can happen. In the first variant, any of the other players can yell out "Cheat" or "Bullshit" to challenge the cards that were just played. In the second variant, only the player about to lay down cards can yell out "Cheat" or "Bullshit" to challenge the cards laid down instead. In some games, the players agree to either wait before playing their turn so other players can think carefully about challenging, or to rapidly take their turns to put more pressure on challengers. Also, some games require a player who bluffs and gets away with it to announce the word "popcorn" or "peanut butter" after the next player's turn. When a player yells out to challenge, they turn over enough cards from the top of the pile to decide if the cards just played were legitimate (this should be the number of the cards that the player who just took his turn announced; however, it is generally acceptable to turn over more if cheating as described later is suspected). If it turns out that the player played the amount and rank of cards that he announced, the challenger takes the whole pile that had accumulated in the centre. If the player was bluffing and did not put down what he announced, he takes the whole pile.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Endgame">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Endgame</span></h3>
<p>Depending on the version of the game, either the first player to get rid of all their cards (and not lose any challenge on their final play) is the winner, or the game may continue to determine second place, third, etc. Since Bullshit is almost never played for money or other stakes, players who don't have cards because they've already won may decide to a challenge that they intend to lose so they can get cards to continue playing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Other methods of cheating">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other methods of cheating</span></h2>
<p>While bluffing is a necessary rule of the game, there are additional ways to cheat. Some players find these unacceptable, while others consider them to be part of the game. Probably the most common technique is to play more cards than you announce, but keep legitimate cards of the number you announce at the top of the stack. If you are challenged and the challenger turns over only the number you announced, this cheat will not be detected. This cheat can be compensated for by turning over more cards than the number announced, but this may have the undesired side effect of revealing whether previous players were lying about their cards, even though their turn passed unchallenged. Such a player would not be required to pick up the pile at that point, but this revelation could give away information about the contents of their hand, or playing strategy.</p>
<p>Another method of cheating is to hide cards from your hand so you don't have to play them, or hiding cards to lead the other players to believe you have less cards than you actually have, causing them to resort to "panic" solutions. Other techniques can be adopted from those of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_poker.html" title="Cheating in poker">cheating in poker</a>.</p>
<p>One more method of cheating is to put down cards of the rank that is assigned to you for that turn and begin to call them some other rank, correcting yourself midsentence. Other players will think that either you had a slip of the tongue and accidentally admitted to the (wrong) cards that you put down, or lost track and put down wrong cards, and will call bullshit. This usually only works once per game, as the other players will soon catch on.</p>
<p><a name="Strategy" id="Strategy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Strategy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy</span></h2>
<p>When playing with the most limited number of cheating options, strategy is relatively simple, making the game trivial and mostly chance for adults. Calculate ahead which cards you will need for the next few rounds so you can maximize your legitimate plays and bluff away the cards you won't be able to use legitimately.</p>
<p>Strategy becomes more complicated as more cheating options become available:</p>
<p><b>For all rules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, if you find yourself almost certain to be called on your turn, consider taking the risk and calling someone before you so that the penalty incurred is less. Sometimes, the penalty will be so small players will decide not to call you out.</li>
<li>If you have exactly the cards you need to win without ever having to lie, generally it is best to not to call bullshit on anyone unless they will definitely win before you.</li>
<li>If you have a very large hand, you can sabotage other players by switching legitimate cards that you do have with a variety of cards. For example, you have 4 aces and it's your turn to call aces. However, instead of putting 4 aces down, put down a King, a Queen, a jack, and a ten. When another player gets bullshit called on them, they will find themselves with 3 additional sets of cards to get rid of.</li>
<li>Sometimes it's best to let a losing player slide in order to increase the penalty on the winning player.</li>
<li>Act. As in poker, sometimes having a good poker face or intentionally having a bad one can minimize the number of times you are called.</li>
<li>Appear to be lying when you are not.</li>
<li>Strength in numbers. It is usually an advantage to have 4 cards of a rank over 3 cards of that rank, 3 over 2, and 2 over 1. The more cards you have for a rank the more you can discern another player's level of deceit on a play. For example, if you have four Aces, and it's another player's turn to lay down Aces, you know for sure that they're bullshitting and therefore can call bullshit worry free--unless they have a wild card. If you have three aces, it is very likely that player is lying, 2 aces and it is a little less likely, and so on. This strategy has the potential to not be effective, however, if you do not get a chance to play that rank legitimately and will have to Bullshit out the rank.</li>
<li>When BSing, only do it one card at a time. For example, if it is your turn to lay down a 7 and have none, but have three 4's, lay down one 4 and call it a seven. If you lay down all of your 4's and call "three 7's", it will appear highly suspicious.</li>
<li>When starting a new stack, bullshit as much as possible. You have zero chance of gaining more cards than you started with.</li>
<li>Call it bullshit if you've got it. If another player is starting a new stack and you have one or more cards for that rank, call Bullshit. If you are right, the other player must pick up the cards. If you are wrong and must pick up the stack, you are only adding your 'Strength in Numbers' of that rank.</li>
<li>Make a mental note of what cards you put into the stack. If you put two 5's in the stack, you know that there are at least two 5's in the stack; you also know that whoever eventually gets the stack gets at least two 5's. Now, suppose that Little Johnny has to put down a 5. You know that you have a 5 in your hand. You also know that there are <i>at least</i> two 5's in the deck, and there is a very large deck. There are also several other players, who might have that last 5. The chances of Little Johnny actually having a 5 is virtually nil.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you call BS on Little Johnny, and he gets the stack. Next time around, if he says he is putting three 5's in the deck, and you only have one, he is probably correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate what cards you will need and save them. Suppose you are player with three other people and it is your turn to lay down a 2. If you do not have a 2, do not lay down a 6 or a 10, because you will need them in your next few turns. Instead, lay down an ace and say, "one 2." With this stragedy, you will have exactly the cards you need at the end of the game.</li>
<li>Hoard the wild cards. Do not use them until the very end of the game, or else somebody else will eventually get the stack and be able to use the wild cards. This makes it very difficult for you, because, in theory, there could be five of a certain rank of card if a player uses a wild card, and you would not even know.</li>
<li>When a player put down his last few cards, call bullshit. If you are right, you have successfully prevented that player from winning. If you are wrong, you would have lost anyway. You probably will be right, because the chances of one's last card being exactly what it needs to be is fairly remote, unless they have deliberately saved them in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>When lying about the number played is allowed:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>When the game starts, know what your next cards must be. Determine what the last card you would have to play to win on is (requires quick thinking). <i>Only applies to incremental rules</i></li>
<li>When playing your turn, if there is already a stack, try to throw in an additional card or two so that the last card you must play to win on is shortened.</li>
<li>When playing your cards, play them as a neat stack, as this makes it more difficult to determine the true number.</li>
<li>If you have a large hand, use that opportunity to remove even more cards, as most players won't call unless you've constantly BSed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One strategy, not widely known, is for a player to call "Bullshit" consistently until he or she has a hand containing at least one card of each rank. Since the number of ranks, 13, is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_number.html" title="Prime number">prime</a>, each player will have the opportunity to play each rank with each rank cycling through exactly every 13 turns. And as a result, with the exception of a player being dealt specific hands, and assuming each turn can and will result in a call of "Bullshit," the winner of the game will be the player that can acquire at least one card of each rank. And clearly, this is most easily obtained by calling "Bullshit" on the first 13 turns of the game.</p>
<p>The major dilemma caused by this strategy is that most other players will believe the player calling "Bullshit" early and consistently is only doing so to be annoying and obnoxious and could potentially end the game shortly after it started.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Russian Bullshit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Russian Bullshit</span></h2>
<p>Some people find this variant, also known as <b>Chinese Bullshit</b> or (ambiguously) as <b>Cheat</b>, to be more interesting than the regular variant. The strategy for two-player Russian Bullshit is particularly intriguing.</p>
<p>Deal out all the cards to all players, as evenly as possible. The first player to go chooses any rank to start with, and places any number of cards of that rank face-down. For example, the player may play "three Kings" or "five fours" or "eight jacks". Bluffing is, of course, permitted.</p>
<p>The next player chooses from these options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Play more cards of the same rank, <i>not</i> the next higher rank as in regular Bullshit. The player may add any number of cards.</li>
<li>Say "I Doubt It" (i.e., "Bullshit"). Note that you may only say "I doubt it" if it is your turn. If you are right, the previous person picks up all the cards and you start a new round. If you are wrong, you pick up all the cards and the next person (in some variants, the previous person gets the right to start a new round) starts a new round with the rank of his choice (there is a variant rule where, upon a call of "Bullshit", the caller only reveals one of the cards played at random. If the card is of the declared rank, the caller picks up the cards; if it is not, the previous person picks up all the cards and you start a new round).</li>
<li>Say "I Believe". If you are wrong, you pick up all the cards and the next person starts a new round with the rank of his choice. If you are right, all the cards on the table are removed from the game and you start a new round with the rank of your choice. Another variant involves forcing the last player to pick up the pile of cards if the caller was correct. This option is not used in some variants.</li>
<li>Pass. This option is not used in some variants; it allows more skill in bluffing because nobody is ever forced to lie. If every player passes, the cards on the table are removed from the game, and the last player to play a card starts the next round.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although you cannot challenge if it is not your turn, you are usually allowed to verbally advise the person whose turn it is to challenge.</p>
<p>The bluffing encouraged by this game becomes apparent when, for example, there are 16 supposed "queens" on the table from two decks of cards. Some rounds of play will escalate to the point that there are ludicrous numbers of cards in play, but nobody wants to challenge, because of the risk of picking up all the cards if the previous player was telling the truth.</p>
<p>After one player goes out, the game may continue to determine second place, third, etc.</p>
<p>There exist many variations of the game, including one where there are no turns and anybody may play or call another player's bluff at any time.</p>
