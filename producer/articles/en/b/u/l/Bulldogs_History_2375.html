<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_History_2375.html" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury.html" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>-<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankstown.html" title="Bankstown">Bankstown</a> region in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>'s outer southwest had a thriving rugby league culture and local competition in the 1920s and 30s and had applied repeatedly to join the Sydney competition from 1930 onwards, finally being successful in September 1934, and taking part for the first time in 1935.</p>
<p><a name="Early_success" id="Early_success"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_History_2375.html" title="Edit section: Early success">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early success</span></h3>
<p>Canterbury's initial season was a remarkable one - for the wrong reasons: arguably the worst season on record. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, at one point losing in successive weeks, 6-91 to St George and 7-87 to Easts - the two heaviest defeats in the history of the competition.</p>
<p>Amazingly, though, 1935's two wins were improved to nine in 1936 and netted a place in the finals. By 1938, the season featured only one loss, and a first title, defeating former nemesis <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Easts</a> 19-6 in the final. Instrumental in the club's success was the front row combination of props <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Burns_9bf3.html" title="Eddie Burns">Eddie Burns</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Porter_df96.html" title="Henry Porter">Henry Porter</a> and hooker <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Kirkaldy_4be7.html" title="Roy Kirkaldy">Roy Kirkaldy</a>. The club also won the reserve grade premiership the same year. Canterbury made the grand final two years later in 1940 but lost to the Easts 24-14. In 1942 Canterbury finished on top of the ladder with Balmain, though secured the minor premiership after the NSWRL ruled that a play-off would be necessary, which saw them beat the Tigers 26-20. Canterbury were defeated by St George 25-10 in the semis, but as minor premiers had the right to challenge in a grand final which saw them defeat the Dragons 11-9 in wet conditions after the scores were locked 7 all at half-time.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_History_2375.html" title="Edit section: Decline as a Power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline as a Power</span></h3>
<p>Remarkably - though largely due to the influence of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> - Canterbury fell from premiers in 1942 to wooden spooners in each of the following two seasons. As players returned from service in the war, the club did regain its strength, finishing sixth in 1945 but third in 1946 and finished on top of the table in 1947. They finished the competition 3 points clear of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balmain_Tigers_a6ae.html" title="Balmain Tigers">Balmain Tigers</a> with Newtown and Wests making up the four. They beat Newtown 25-15 in the first semi but lost to Balmain 25-19 in the final. As they had been minor premiers, they had the right of a rematch to force a Grand Final. However, Canterbury were unsuccessful, going down 13-9 after leading 7-4 at half time.</p>
<p>However, their loss of the 1947 campaign was, more than the lapse of 1943-1945, the end of their first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Burns_9bf3.html" title="Eddie Burns">Eddie Burns</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Kirkaldy_4be7.html" title="Roy Kirkaldy">Roy Kirkaldy</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Porter_%28rugby_league_footballer%29_4c23.html" title="Henry Porter (rugby league footballer)">Henry Porter</a> (remarkably, none ever played for <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_rugby_league_team.html" title="Australian national rugby league team">Australia</a> owing to the war), the club was unable to develop top-line players or attract them to their ranks. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Willey_f9db.html" title="Ron Willey">Ron Willey</a> was their sole Australian international between 1948 and 1962, and never played a Test match.</p>
<p>In 1948 they won only seven games, and from 1954 to 1959 never won more than six in a season. Between 1952 and 1959 they were second last on five occasions (only <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Parramatta</a> denying them the wooden spoon in the last four cases) but in 1960 they made the semis in an unparalleled <i>four-way play-off</i>. However their finals campaign only lasted one match a they lost to <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Easts</a> 16-9 in the second semi-final. In the following years, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts in 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skilful fullback <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Johns_0b3e.html" title="Les Johns">Les Johns</a> gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.</p>

<p>In 1967 they were captained by tough forward <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Ryan_%28rugby_league_footballer%29_45a0.html" title="Kevin Ryan (rugby league footballer)">Kevin Ryan</a>, who had joined them from St George and helped them break his former club's extraordinary run of eleven straight premierships by beating them 12-11 in the preliminary final after being down 9-0 early on. Prior to this, Canterbury had finished third in the regular season, 3 points behind <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Sydney_Rabbitohs_ffd9.html" title="South Sydney Rabbitohs">South Sydney</a> and 4 behind minor premiers St George. Their semi-final campaign started well, beating Easts 13-2, before victory over the Dragons. Unfortunately they lost to Souths in the premiership decider, in a match best remembered for <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McCarthy_69f1.html" title="Bob McCarthy">Bob McCarthy</a>'s famous intercept try. The match had been a close one, with Souths leading 10-8 at half time, before Canterbury drew level for much of the second half. Souths gained the lead 4 minutes from full-time with an <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Simms_b28c.html" title="Eric Simms">Eric Simms</a> goal following a penalty for an incorrect scrum feed by Canterbury half Ross Kidd. For the losers, fullback Les Johns, Second-row <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Goldspink_c940.html" title="Kevin Goldspink">Kevin Goldspink</a> and Centre <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hagan_%28rugby_league_footballer%29_1404.html" title="Bob Hagan (rugby league footballer)">Bob Hagan</a> all stood out.</p>
<p><a name="Reformation_and_rebuilding_years" id="Reformation_and_rebuilding_years"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_History_2375.html" title="Edit section: Reformation and rebuilding years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reformation and rebuilding years</span></h3>
<p>The following few years saw mixed fortunes for the club on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out of the semis losing 12-7 to St George) and a return to mid-table in 1971 and 1972. However, off the field the club was developing administrative strength that would restore it to the status of a "power" for the following thirty years.</p>
<p>Canterbury made the semis again in 1973, coming fifth in the first year the competition had a final five rather than four. Though they lost to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown_Jets_d7e4.html" title="Newtown Jets">Newtown</a>, this heralded better times as the club made the semis every year for the rest of the decade, apart from 1977 when the team was heavily hit by injuries.</p>
<p>1974 proved more promising, as the club finished third on the ladder behind a runaway <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Roosters</a> outfit coached by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Gibson_09c6.html" title="Jack Gibson">Jack Gibson</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manly_Sea_Eagles_05ea.html" title="Manly Sea Eagles">Manly</a>. They then defeated both clubs - Manly 20-14 and Easts 19-17 to be the first through to the Grand Final. However, missed opportunities in an initially tight game lead to a 19-4 defeat. This had been the first Premiership decider Canterbury had played in since 1947.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_History_2375.html" title="Edit section: The Entertainers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Entertainers</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bullfrog_Moore_d111.html" title="Peter Bullfrog Moore">Peter 'Bullfrog' Moore</a> was the top administrator at the Canterbury Bulldogs from 1970 to 1995. During this time the Bulldogs climbed to the very top of the game. In the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">70s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">80s</a> the Bulldogs under coach <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Glossop_5ddc.html" title="Ted Glossop">Ted Glossop</a> who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named <b>The Entertainers</b>. With brilliant halfback <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a> the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was the envy of the Sydney Premiership.</p>
<p>The arrival of youngster <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a> and veteran <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_McCarthy_69f1.html" title="Bob McCarthy">Bob McCarthy</a> in 1976 signalled a new beginning at the Bulldogs. McCarthy only had two seasons at Canterbury but his experience, knowledge and effect left a lasting impression with a new generation of forwards coming through the ranks, which included <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Folkes_f263.html" title="Steve Folkes">Steve Folkes</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeme_Hughes_baca.html" title="Graeme Hughes">Graeme Hughes</a> and Geoff Robinson.</p>
<p>Hints of future heroics came in 1976, Canterbury scraped into the final five, finishing 5th, then beat Easts and St George before losing to Manly 15-12 at the last hurdle before the Grand Final, a Bob Fulton field goal breaking hearts late in the match.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs started off with promise but missed the semis in 1977, losing 4 out of the last 5 of their regular season matches and coming 7th. They then scraped into 5th position again for 1978, but were the first team out of the playoffs losing 22-15 to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Parramatta</a>.</p>
<p>They came fifth for a third time in four years in 1979, with the following four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Peponis_8151.html" title="George Peponis">George Peponis</a>, the Bulldogs disposed of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronulla_Sharks_36a6.html" title="Cronulla Sharks">Cronulla</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Suburbs_Magpies_27ff.html" title="Western Suburbs Magpies">Wests</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Parramatta</a> to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St George</a> won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.</p>
<p>During the 1979-80 seasons, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Peponis_8151.html" title="George Peponis">George Peponis</a> would captain Australia in 5 Tests and became the first captain to lead Australia to a 3-0 series victory against Great Britain in 1979. Peponis led Australia on the 1980 Tour of New Zealand, winning both Tests.</p>
<p>The 1980 season was a watershed year for the Bulldogs and they would win their first Premiership since 1942. Canterbury played consistent football all season to finish in a tie for top position with <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Eastern Suburbs</a> having the superior for and against. The Bulldogs defeated <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Suburbs_Magpies_27ff.html" title="Western Suburbs Magpies">Wests</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Easts</a> to make it through to the Grand Final having the week off. The Roosters were favoured to win the decider but the unheralded Bulldogs pack outmuscled the Roosters pack with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a> doing the rest. Mortimer completely outplayed opposing half <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Hastings_4cfd.html" title="Kevin Hastings">Kevin Hastings</a> with the Bulldogs winning 18-4. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28Rugby_League%29_0ff6.html" title="Chris Anderson (Rugby League)">Chris Anderson</a> scored the Bulldogs first try but the Grand Final will always be remembered for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Gearin_3199.html" title="Steve Gearin">Steve Gearin</a>'s performance where he landed six goals from six attempts and scored one of the all-time greatest tries in Grand Final history. Gearin chased through a bomb by fullback <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Brentnall_735b.html" title="Greg Brentnall">Greg Brentnall</a> 40 m out and caught the ball in mid-air despite the best attempts from Hastings and David Michael to prevent the try. The Grand Final was also famous for the three Mortimer and three Hughes brothers playing in the clash.</p>
<p>As premiers, the Bulldogs did not buy significantly in the following couple of years and paid the penalty. Crippled with injuries they fell to 10th in 1981, and in 1982 9th of 14 clubs in the newly expanded competition. Despite finishing third in 1983, the gap between Parramatta and Manly and the rest of the Premiership was massive. The style of football that worked for Canterbury in 1979-80 was now outdated with the club looking in a new direction. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ryan_2028.html" title="Warren Ryan">Warren Ryan</a> would be appointed coach and the Bulldogs would quickly go from the <i>Entertainers</i> to the <i>Enforcers</i> in very quick time.</p>

<p>At the end of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> the board decided to go on a major rebuilding exercise. New coach <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ryan_2028.html" title="Warren Ryan">Warren Ryan</a> was brought on board, together with a collection of new players. Some of the major signings by Ryan and Chief Executive <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bullfrog_Moore_d111.html" title="Peter Bullfrog Moore">Peter Moore</a> included <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> Dally M Player of the Year <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Lamb_d386.html" title="Terry Lamb">Terry Lamb</a> and Brian Battese from Wests, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> forward <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darryl_Brohman_ff73.html" title="Darryl Brohman">Darryl Brohman</a>, hooker Mark Bugden, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Gould_de5e.html" title="Phil Gould">Phil Gould</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kelly_9f89.html" title="Peter Kelly">Peter Kelly</a> from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown_Jets_d7e4.html" title="Newtown Jets">Newtown</a>, and prop <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tunks_471c.html" title="Peter Tunks">Peter Tunks</a> from Souths. The Bulldogs went from the "Entertainers" to the "Enforcers". Young fullback Mick Potter also had a great year, becoming 1984 Dally M Player of the Year. The club finished the season as minor premiers four points in front of rivals St George and Parramatta. They beat the Eels in the Major semi-final 16-8 before marking their fiftieth season by beating them again for the 1984 Premiership. However, it didn't come without controversy. Ryan would drop long serving veterans Garry Hughes and club captain <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28Rugby_League%29_0ff6.html" title="Chris Anderson (Rugby League)">Chris Anderson</a> to Reserve Grade and the style of football didn't win Canterbury many admirers outside their own circle. The Bulldogs set the football world on its head with a new aggressive, defensively oriented way of playing, that was later named by some as <b>Wozzaball</b>. The brand of football worked with Canterbury nullifying the brilliant attacking football of Parramatta to win the decider 6-4 at the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Cricket_Ground_b665.html" title="Sydney Cricket Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs started the next year patchily but won their last seen matches to lie third on the ladder at the end of the regular season behind minor premiers St George and Balmain. They accounted for Balmain 14-8 before being beaten by the Dragon 17-6. Then they comprehensively beat Parramatta 28-0 before making it back-to-back titles when they defeated St. George 7-6 in the Grand Final. Brilliantly led by captain <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a>, the Bulldogs bombed St. George out of submission, which forced a rule change in the catching of the ball in the in goal area.</p>
<p>Finishing third in the regular season behind Parramatta and a rejuvenated Souths, the Bulldogs couldn't follow up with a hat-trick of titles losing the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> Grand Final 4-2 to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Eels</a> in a classic game of football. No tries were scored as both sides tackled as their lives depended on it.</p>
<p>Ryan's era at Canterbury ended after the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> season when he left the club on bad terms despite the success that came the Bulldogs way. He is the only Canterbury coach to win two Premierships and when the Bulldogs named their greatest side in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, no coach was named, which many believe should have been Ryan. Others believed that Ryan was simply a professional coach rather than a 'true' Bulldog and the choice of Moore as Manager of the greatest ever side was more appropriate.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Gould_de5e.html" title="Phil Gould">Phil Gould</a> succeeded Ryan as coach and in his first year was in charge as the Bulldogs won the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> Grand Final against the Ryan-coached <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balmain_Tigers_a6ae.html" title="Balmain Tigers">Balmain Tigers</a> 24-12, the first at the new <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Football_Stadium_86d8.html" title="Sydney Football Stadium">Sydney Football Stadium</a>. It was a great and consistent season following the disappointment in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> marked the final season for Canterbury legend <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a>, who stood down as captain after Round 4. Mortimer suffered a broken wrist in the second last round but was fit enough to play off the bench in the Grand Final victory. Mortimer retired with a club record 267 first grade games next to his name and at the time the most first grade games for one individual club. Mortimer captained the club the Premiership success in 1984 and 1985 and was a member of the 1980 and 1988 triumphs. He captained <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> in three <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_State_of_Origin_ca8b.html" title="Rugby League State of Origin">State of Origin</a> matches, winning all of them, giving the Blues their first triumph in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>The "Wozzaball" era came to an end in 1989 when the Bulldogs struggled and Gould leaving the club to join <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith_Panthers_8773.html" title="Penrith Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28Rugby_League%29_0ff6.html" title="Chris Anderson (Rugby League)">Chris Anderson</a> returned as coach for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> season and cleaned out the Ryan era building the club around another club great in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Lamb_d386.html" title="Terry Lamb">Terry Lamb</a>.</p>

<p>Chris Anderson had left the Bulldogs in 1984 and played the remaining years of his career with <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_RLFC_835e.html" title="Halifax RLFC">Halifax RLFC</a> where he was captain-coach. Anderson coached Halifax to <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_Challenge_Cup_b39a.html" title="Rugby League Challenge Cup">Challenge Cup</a> success in 1986-87. Anderson's return to Canterbury was a natural process but his commitments with Halifax in 1987-88 meant he couldn't take on the coaching position until 1989. Phil Gould's success in 1988 saw Anderson take on the Under 21's position in 1989 but his promotion to first grade was inevitable, which saw Gould leave on bad terms and join the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith_Panthers_8773.html" title="Penrith Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a>.</p>
<p>One of Anderson's first jobs as head coach was appoint <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Lamb_d386.html" title="Terry Lamb">Terry Lamb</a> as captain ahead of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Langmack_eeb2.html" title="Paul Langmack">Paul Langmack</a>. This caused some controversy at the time, though in hindsight was a good decision. Anderson was in the first stages of cleaning out the 'Wozzaball' era and builds his team around Lamb. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ryan_2028.html" title="Warren Ryan">Warren Ryan</a>, now coaching Western Suburbs, would snare four former Canterbury players Langmack, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Farrar_66f7.html" title="Andrew Farrar">Andrew Farrar</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gillespie_0838.html" title="David Gillespie">David Gillespie</a> and Joe Thomas whilst Paul Dunn followed Gould to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith_Panthers_8773.html" title="Penrith Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a> and Jason Alchin joined <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a>.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs enjoyed encouraging results in 1991 led by Lamb with support from 1991 Rothmans Medal winner <a href="../../../e/w/a/Ewan_McGrady_a719.html" title="Ewan McGrady">Ewan McGrady</a> and the Welsh Wizard <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Davies_00eb.html" title="Jonathan Davies">Jonathan Davies</a> with youngsters such as <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Smith_10c7.html" title="Darren Smith">Darren Smith</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarrod_McCracken_63af.html" title="Jarrod McCracken">Jarrod McCracken</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Pay_d3ff.html" title="Dean Pay">Dean Pay</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gillies_7697.html" title="Simon Gillies">Simon Gillies</a> coming through the ranks. The Bulldogs were inconsistent in 1992 and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bullfrog_Moore_d111.html" title="Peter Bullfrog Moore">Peter Bullfrog Moore</a> went on a recruitment drive snaring <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bella_496f.html" title="Martin Bella">Martin Bella</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Dymock_3a2b.html" title="Jim Dymock">Jim Dymock</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Serdaris_ebd7.html" title="Jim Serdaris">Jim Serdaris</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Connolly_48ab.html" title="Gary Connolly">Gary Connolly</a>.

<p>Goal kicking wizard <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Halligan_5211.html" title="Daryl Halligan">Daryl Halligan</a> joined the Bulldogs in 1994 and he booted a then club record of 270 points including the match-winning drop goal in the 1994 Major Semi-Final against <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra_Raiders_face.html" title="Canberra Raiders">Canberra Raiders</a> at the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Football_Stadium_86d8.html" title="Sydney Football Stadium">Sydney Football Stadium</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Britt_57a8.html" title="Darren Britt">Darren Britt</a> added much steel to the pack and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Smith_4bd4.html" title="Jason Smith">Jason Smith</a> emerged as a player of world class. Canberra were far too good on Grand Final day winning 36-12 with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal_Meninga_533b.html" title="Mal Meninga">Mal Meninga</a> enjoying a great exit from the game.</p>
<p>Canterbury were confident heading into the 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_League_%28Australia%29_adad.html" title="Super League (Australia)">Super League War</a> saw the Bulldogs ripped apart like never before with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Dymock_3a2b.html" title="Jim Dymock">Jim Dymock</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Pay_d3ff.html" title="Dean Pay">Dean Pay</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Smith_4bd4.html" title="Jason Smith">Jason Smith</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarrod_McCracken_63af.html" title="Jarrod McCracken">Jarrod McCracken</a> announcing mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and it was to get worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26-0, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Queensland_Cowboys_d03b.html" title="North Queensland Cowboys">North Queensland Cowboys</a> to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belmore_Sports_Ground_fd8e.html" title="Belmore Sports Ground">Belmore Sports Ground</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28Rugby_League%29_0ff6.html" title="Chris Anderson (Rugby League)">Chris Anderson</a> dropping Kiwi International <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarrod_McCracken_63af.html" title="Jarrod McCracken">Jarrod McCracken</a> to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66-4 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs took all before them in the Finals defeating <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> 12-8, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> 24-10 and destroyed 1994 Premiers <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra_Raiders_face.html" title="Canberra Raiders">Canberra Raiders</a> 25-6 in one of their finest ever displays. The Grand Final saw them up against the ARL's pin-up club <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manly-Warringah_Sea_Eagles_7c30.html" title="Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles">Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles</a> in an ultimate Super League-ARL grudge match. The Bulldogs were never headed winning 17-4 with Lamb leading the way in an inspirational (and controversial) performance. One of the tryscorers that day for Canterbury was future club captain <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Price_7671.html" title="Steve Price">Steve Price</a> who was starting in only his 3rd first grade match.</p>
<p>The Anderson-Lamb coach-captain era at the Bulldogs lasted six seasons and they worked on a very successful rebuilding programme that bore fruit at the end of the day. Lamb announced his retirement after the Grand Final but would play on for another year in 1996 to help the sudden loss of players due to the ARL departures. Lamb however decided not to stand for the leadership leaving it for <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gillies_7697.html" title="Simon Gillies">Simon Gillies</a>. When Gillies was injured, Lamb again opted not to be captain with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Britt_57a8.html" title="Darren Britt">Darren Britt</a> taking control for the final nine matches. Lamb's six seasons as Canterbury captain saw the club rebuild and emerge back again as a force following the great 1980s era and Lamb in 2004 would be named captain in Canterbury's Greatest Ever Team. Lamb in his six seasons as captain led from the front and was one of the most inspirational leaders in the game.</p>
<p>Another era ended following the 1995 season with the retirement of Chief Executive <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bullfrog_Moore_d111.html" title="Peter Bullfrog Moore">Peter Moore</a> after 26 years in power. Moore came into power in 1969 with the backing of captain-coach <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Ryan_99ee.html" title="Kevin Ryan">Kevin Ryan</a> and brought in a complete reformation of the Bulldogs club, which saw it emerge as a competitive force in the 1970s and a <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> powerhouse in the 1980s. Moore took on a position as <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_League_%28Australia%29_adad.html" title="Super League (Australia)">Super League Australia</a> recruitment officer and he would retain his position on the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and beat the first round but it returned in 2000 and lost his battle of life on 5 July. Moore's record at Canterbury was five Premierships and nine Grand Finals in 26 seasons.</p>

The Bulldogs were a shadow of their three previous seasons in 1996 and scrambled to finish 10th in the ARL Premiership. It was a season that never got off the ground but did show promising form later in the year before it was too late.</p>
<p>The 1997 season saw Canterbury play in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_League_%28Australia%29_adad.html" title="Super League (Australia)">Super League</a> competition and was the first without club legend <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Lamb_d386.html" title="Terry Lamb">Terry Lamb</a> who finally hung up the boots after 349 first grade matches.

<p>Super League and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rugby_League_6ca4.html" title="Australian Rugby League">ARL</a> compromised at the end of 1997 and formed the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">National Rugby League</a>, which saw Canterbury playing arch-rivals <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Parramatta Eels</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Suburbs_Magpies_27ff.html" title="Western Suburbs Magpies">Western Suburbs Magpies</a> once again.</p>

Canterbury won their last four matches to scrape into 9th position as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">National Rugby League</a> that season used a 'Top 10' Finals format.</p>
<p>Just prior to the Finals, it was revealed that former Chief Executive <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bullfrog_Moore_d111.html" title="Peter Bullfrog Moore">Peter Moore</a> was diagnosed with cancer. The Bulldogs lifted to new levels as an inspiration to 'Bullfrog' and in the first two weeks of the Finals defeated <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> 20-12 (ultimately their last match as a stand-alone club) and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sydney_Bears_aa2c.html" title="North Sydney Bears">North Sydney Bears</a> 23-12, both victories on away soil. The followed week without the inspirational <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Polla-Mounter_1ff9.html" title="Craig Polla-Mounter">Craig Polla-Mounter</a> the Bulldogs came from 16-0 down to defeat the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johns_e6d9.html" title="Andrew Johns">Andrew Johns</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_Knights_9152.html" title="Newcastle Knights">Newcastle Knights</a> 28-16 with the scores locked at 16-all at full-time.</p>

It was all one-way traffic in extra time as Polla-Mounter steered the Bulldogs to an emotional 32-20 victory.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> won the Grand Final 38-12 (after leading 12-10 at half time) but the Bulldogs lost no admirers for the way they competed throughout the entire Finals series. The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_League_War_10d2.html" title="Super League War">Super League War</a> was now forgotten in a short space of time as they forged into a new era under the guidance of coach <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Folkes_f263.html" title="Steve Folkes">Steve Folkes</a>.</p>
<p>The 1998 season also marked the farewell to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belmore_Sports_Ground_fd8e.html" title="Belmore Sports Ground">Belmore Sports Ground</a> as the Bulldogs home ground. The decision to leave Belmore upset many of the Bulldogs' loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it. Belmore was Canterbury's home for 547 matches between 1936-98 and they had a great record on home soil. Belmore was also the home ground for the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta_Eels_b207.html" title="Parramatta Eels">Parramatta Eels</a> between 1982-85 as their new stadium was being built and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> played at Belmore in 1988.

<p>The Bulldogs fallout from a disappointing 2000 season saw a "new breed" of players coming through for 2001. Canterbury's outfit aged badly in 2000 with many players past their best and a massive cleanout happened with several new players on the way including <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Vagana_842e.html" title="Nigel Vagana">Nigel Vagana</a>, Luke Patten, Brett Howland and Darrell Trindall. The Bulldogs finished the Minor Premiership in second position but crashed out of the Finals. The Dally M Rookie of the Year that season was <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braith_Anasta_970f.html" title="Braith Anasta">Braith Anasta</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_O%27Meley_d797.html" title="Mark O'Meley">Mark O'Meley</a> was signed up for the 2002 season as the club said farewell to captain <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Britt_57a8.html" title="Darren Britt">Darren Britt</a> and his deputy <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Polla-Mounter_1ff9.html" title="Craig Polla-Mounter">Craig Polla-Mounter</a>.

<p>Trouble, however, returned in a big way in 2002, with the Club being found guilty of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salary_cap.html" title="Salary cap">salary cap</a> breaches described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as "exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature". The club received a $500,000 fine, and was stripped of all 37 competition points. The latter action was particularly harmful, as the club were poised to take the Minor Premiership and had won 17 consecutive matches.</p>
<p>Club legend <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a> was brought in to save the club. He did much more than that, bringing much needed stability and passion back into the joint. The Bulldogs finished one game short of the Grand Final in 2003 as their season never really got going due to the fallout from the year before. But the hard and honest work of Mortimer allowed Canterbury to remain competitive and at the top of the tree as they were heading for a big 2004 season.</p>

<p>The Bulldogs endured a nightmare start to the season only to bounce back in true Bulldog fashion to defeat new arch-rivals <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a> 16-13 in the Grand Final. The Bulldogs season started slowly but they worked their way into being genuine Premiership contenders, which included big wins against the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith_Panthers_8773.html" title="Penrith Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> to finish the regular season on equal standing with eventual runners-up the Roosters, however due to points differential the Bulldogs were deemed to have finished second.</p>
<p>At the start to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2004_e7a1.html" title="National Rugby League season 2004">2004 season</a> a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_gang_rape_allegation.html" title="Bulldogs gang rape allegation">major off-field scandal</a> allegedly involving Bulldogs players in Coffs Harbour saw long serving Football Manager Garry Hughes sacked and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Mortimer_e0d3.html" title="Steve Mortimer">Steve Mortimer</a> step aside as Chief Executive. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Peponis_8151.html" title="George Peponis">George Peponis</a> was believed to be behind both changes with former Test forward <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradley_Clyde_7f0c.html" title="Bradley Clyde">Bradley Clyde</a> the new Football Manager and News Limited Executive Malcolm Noad taking over from Mortimer. Both decisions were controversial but the Bulldogs performances on the field remained strong.</p>
<p>Finals newcomers <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Queensland_Cowboys_d03b.html" title="North Queensland Cowboys">North Queensland Cowboys</a> upset the Bulldogs 30-22 in the first week of the Finals. The Bulldogs powered past the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Storm_52f7.html" title="Melbourne Storm">Melbourne Storm</a> 43-18 in the second week of the Finals. Three tries and five goals from <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazem_El_Masri_2d06.html" title="Hazem El Masri">Hazem El Masri</a> saw the Bulldogs topple 2003 Premiers <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith_Panthers_8773.html" title="Penrith Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a> 30-14 in the Preliminary Final.</p>
<p>The Grand Final against the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a> was always going to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much punishment and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Utai_77ed.html" title="Matt Utai">Matt Utai</a> scored two tries with <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazem_El_Masri_2d06.html" title="Hazem El Masri">Hazem El Masri</a> also scoring. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mason_ff00.html" title="Willie Mason">Willie Mason</a> was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner amongst a host of other good performers including Utai, El Masri, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bill_Williams_b212.html" title="Sonny Bill Williams">Sonny Bill Williams</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_O%27Meley_d797.html" title="Mark O'Meley">Mark O'Meley</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Sherwin_c23f.html" title="Brent Sherwin">Brent Sherwin</a> and stand-in captain <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Ryan_c36e.html" title="Andrew Ryan">Andrew Ryan</a>, who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crocker_912a.html" title="Michael Crocker">Michael Crocker</a> from scoring the final seconds of the match.</p>

<p>The Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2005_9043.html" title="National Rugby League season 2005">2005</a> as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2006_1986.html" title="National Rugby League season 2006">2006</a>, little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a>.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs' <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2007_6d2f.html" title="National Rugby League season 2007">2007</a> campaign began against the Newcastle Knights. While the Knights won 25-24 in a dramatic NRL season opener, the game will long be remembered for the sending off of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Bill_Williams_b212.html" title="Sonny Bill Williams">Sonny Bill Williams</a> for a swinging left arm which left <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johns_e6d9.html" title="Andrew Johns">Andrew Johns</a> lying face down on the turf unconscious in the fourth minute.</p>
