<p>This article has the potential to be large, detailed and possibly even featured.</p>
<p>First, I think it needs to be sectioned off into numerous sections. First will be history of the site so the markets etc. Next is the 1960s shopping centre. The next section will be about the current centre and this will have subsections.</p>
<ul>
<li>First subsection: Demolition</li>
<li>Second subsection: Archaeology (information about archaeological findings underneath the centre)</li>
<li>Third: Construction and completion</li>
<li>Fourth: Advertising and first week</li>
<li>Fifth: Artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the usual see also's, references and external links. As well as that we need to fill the table up completely. Any objections?--<a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 20:03, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have created some subsections. The first is history of the site and a subsection of archaeology as there have been excavations on site during construction. The next section is about the 1960s Bullring. I have not done the demolition section I had outlined above as there is currently very little information for it. That is the same for construction. I created a section about the Rotunda as it is commonly wrongly believed that it is in fact a part of the Bullring when it really is not. I also made the artwork section. There is a list of references of two books which could be used to give information on this and I added two links to Birmingham.gov.uk pages which give significant info on the Bullring. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 20:31, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a feeling this article would be better moved back to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_Ring%2C_Birmingham_a593.html" title="Bull Ring, Birmingham">Bull Ring, Birmingham</a>, being as that is the historical spelling, with <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullring%2C_Birmingham_bacc.html" title="Bullring, Birmingham">Bullring, Birmingham</a> as a redirect. It somewhat depends on the focus of the article; if we are trying to cover the whole history of the market, then "Bull Ring" is more appropriate. At the moment, the article seems to be trying to achieve this. If the article were more narrowly focussed on the 21st Century development, then obviously "Bullring" would be the correct choice. Thoughts? <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 17:22, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article may be trying to focus on the Bull Ring's history, but the infobox does not. If the article were to be renamed to Bull Ring, I think it would need a lot of re-arranging so that it doesn't look like one third of the page is about the Bullring and the other two thirds is about the Bull Ring market. The first time the article's name is used, it says Bull Ring market, but then an infobox with information about the shopping center is directly to the right of that. See what I mean? <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 17:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I believe this article should be about the whole area as the development of the Bullring was on the historical area of the Bull Ring. Confusing, I know. But the 21st century development is on the old market area and the market area has moved east somewhat out of the original area which the shopping centre is on now. The markets are also smaller and are on the land once known as Smithfield (the only thing that shows the area was called Smithfield is an 1960s office block called Smithfield House which is directly above what was Reddigntons Rare Records). Therefore, I think this article should be moved back to Bull Ring and should focus on the area not exactly the markets and shopping centre separately. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 18:15, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That sounds good, but if the article is meant to focus on the area, this should be made clear in the first sentence. At the moment, it isn't. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 18:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with J Di. As long as it shows that there it is a commercial area with both a market and a shopping centre then I am happy. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 11:06, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I added the West Midlands ref as most other articles referring to Brum include the ceremonial county name, but it isn't really necessary. I'll make the change. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 18:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
