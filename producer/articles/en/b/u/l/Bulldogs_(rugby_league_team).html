<p>Based in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belmore%2C_New_South_Wales_24d0.html" title="Belmore, New South Wales">Belmore</a>, a suburb of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the Bulldogs were admitted in 1935 to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_premiership_a0cf.html" title="New South Wales Rugby League premiership">New South Wales Rugby League premiership</a>, a predecessor of the current NRL competition.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs won their first premiership in just their fourth season (1938).

In the 90s they featured in the 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the former.

<p><b>The Country Bumpkins</b></p>
<p><br />
Thirteen years after a meeting above "The Ideal Milk Bar" in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campsie%2C_New_South_Wales_e174.html" title="Campsie, New South Wales">Campsie</a> created the Canterbury-Bankstown Junior Rugby League, football lovers of the working class south-west of Sydney finally got their own team in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_f16a.html" title="New South Wales Rugby League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> premiership.</p>
<p>The year was 1935. Sydney was in the grip of the Great Depression and training was on McMahon's paddock near Belmore Station with car headlights an occasional luxury on dark nights.</p>
<p>But right from the start the men who laid the foundations for the Bulldogs thrived on adversity. It took the new club, nicknamed "Country Bumpkins" because of their rural recruiting &amp; CB emblem, just 3 years to win their first premiership.</p>
<p>The grand final winning effort was repeated again in 1942 before a 25 year drought set in.</p>

<p><b>The Berries</b></p>
<p>In 1967, having ended the 11-year premiership reign of the great <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George_Dragons_d9ed.html" title="St George Dragons">St.George</a> by knocking them out in the final, "The Berries" as they were known at the time, went down to the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Sydney_Rabbitohs_ffd9.html" title="South Sydney Rabbitohs">South Sydney Rabbitohs</a> in the grand final. But the return to the top end of the table set the scene for off-field restructuring that laid the foundations for the club to become one of the most consistent achievers in the remaining decades of the century.</p>
<p><b>The Entertainers</b></p>
<p>In 1978 Canterbury-Bankstown became known as "The Bulldogs". "Cantabs" "See Bees" &amp; "Berries" were seen to be "soft" nicknames and the club wanted something to signify determination and grit.</p>
<p>A grand final appearance in 1979 followed by a grand final win in 1980 with a young, enthusiastic and free-running side dubbed "The Entertainers", was the beginning of a golden era that was to produce three more grand final wins in the 80's: 1984, 1985 and 1988.</p>
<p><b>The Bulldogs</b></p>
<p>In 1998 the Bulldogs came awfully close to adding another trophy to the cabinet after battling their way to the Grand Final where they met the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> and went down 38-12. On the way to the 1998 Grand Final the Bulldogs pulled off one of the most remarkable victories in the history of the game. After trailing by 14 points with ten minutes remaining, the Bulldogs somehow got home 32-20 winners in extra time thanks to a brilliant try to <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Silva_b502.html" title="Rod Silva">Rod Silva</a> and two pressure conversions from <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Halligan_5211.html" title="Daryl Halligan">Daryl Halligan</a>.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs did well in 2003, however they fell one step short of yet another Grand Final after going down to the Roosters 28-18 in the Preliminary Final.</p>
<p>Year 2004 was a tribute to both <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Folkes_f263.html" title="Steve Folkes">Steve Folkes</a> ability as a coach and the determination of a squad that refused to buckle. Despite the clubs well-documented off-field dramas, the Bulldogs somehow managed to maintain their focus on football and were rewarded with the ultimate prize when they held out arch rivals the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a> in a 16-13 thriller, the perfect ending for departing captain Steve Price and a fitting way to cap off the clubs' 70th anniversary season.</p>
<p>Their eighth premiership trophy moved the club into a clear 5th place in the all-time tally.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2005_9043.html" title="National Rugby League season 2005">2005</a> as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_season_2006_1986.html" title="National Rugby League season 2006">2006</a>, little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a>.</p>

Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs logo 1988</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The initial emblem was a 'C-B' in a shield and nickname 'C-B's or (derisively) 'Country Bumpkins'. By the mid 1940s the club were nicknamed the Berries, a name which persisted until the 1978 season when the bulldog emblem was chosen. There have been at least two versions of the logo, although the latest version has seen two styles, the latest with larger 'Bulldogs' text to make it friendlier to the eye. The earlier style of the currently logo can be seen at the top of this page, and is characterised by the smaller lettering.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs started life as Canterbury-Bankstown. The club had the semi-official nickname of the Berries up until 1978 when the name was changed to the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs. In the 1990s the official name was changed around a few times. From the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs, it went to the slightly grander title of the Sydney Bulldogs for two short seasons, and then returned to simply 'Canterbury', before becoming the geographically indistinct "Bulldogs" in 1999 - an attempt to broaden their appeal across the Rugby League community. Despite this, many supporters, TV and radio commentators continue to refer to them as 'Canterbury'.</p>

<p>The Bulldogs have played in predominantly blue and white strip since the club entered the league in 1935. The only exception to this was during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, when rationing meant they had to wear a maroon jersey with a blue 'V'.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>There have been three basic strip designs since the club's inception in the top flight league competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now known as the <b>Vintage Strip</b>, which has been used recently in occasional 'heritage' matches, this jersey had alternating thick horizontal blue and white bands with thin blue and white borders, with black shorts. This was used from 1935 until at least 1962.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>From 1970 to 1972, the club adopted a jersey of <b>thin blue and white stripes</b>. This reverted to the 'V' from 1973 onwards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>'V' Strip</b>, which was first used sometime before 1965. This consisted of a blue 'V' with a blue saddle over the shoulders on an otherwise white jersey with blue shorts. The current design is a little more 'aerodynamic' with the 'V' having a concave shape. The club also has an away strip in which the blue and white are reversed. There was an alternate design in the late 90s where the 'V' strip had a grey trim and was worn with white shorts.</li>

<p>In the clubs first season, they were not allocated many home games, and instead took what clashes they did have to Marrickville or Pratten Park.</p>
<p>Belmore became the spiritual home of the Bulldogs for the formative years of the club, right until the NRL era, where criteria issues meant they had to shift to the newly constructed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium_Australia_46d6.html" title="Stadium Australia">Stadium Australia</a> in Homebush Bay. They varied between this venue and its neighbouring RAS Sydney Showground until 2005, when overwhelming demand from fans saw them ditch the Showground, thought to be a very poor Rugby League venue, to move full-time to the Olympic venue.</p>
<p>The club's training and head office remain at Belmore Sports Ground, however in 2007 it is believed all facilities will be shifted to Homebush Bay's Olympic Park Site.</p>

<p><b>Back to Belmore</b></p>
<p>In August 2005, the <a href="http://www.backtobelmore.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.backtobelmore.com.au" rel="nofollow">Back to Belmore</a> campaign was launched in support of upgrading Belmore Sports Ground for a select number of the Bulldogs' NRL home games in the long-term future. The campaign's protest is mainly aimed at the Federal Government to grant funding to an upgrade of the Canterbury-Bankstown district's premier sporting facility and the Bulldogs to allocate a select number of their home games at an upgraded Belmore Sports Ground in the future.</p>
<p><b>The Bulldogs and Australian society</b></p>
<p>The Bulldogs are known to have some of the most devoted fans in Australian Rugby League. There are a small group of supporters which are known as the 'Bulldog Army'. Their fans behaviour has also been highlighted in recent years with fans causing trouble at Bulldogs matches. The Bulldogs club is trying to stop the fan violence by re-naming and moving the Bulldog army into a season ticket only bay 'The Kennel' as well as a campaign to encourage Bulldogs fans to dob in people causing trouble. They have dedicated fans and a huge fan base.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs players' off-field behaviour has also come under the spotlight, for both good and bad reasons. In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, six Bulldogs players were accused of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldogs_gang_rape_allegation.html" title="Bulldogs gang rape allegation">gang rape</a>; although all the players were subsequently cleared of the charges, this incident had placed considerable strain on the club and its supporters alike. One of the leading detectives in the investigation, Detective Gary McEvoy, has come out publicly and stated that he believes there was no credible evidence to support the allegations but there were members of the New South Wales Police Force who acted inappropriately in the conduct of the investigation. The New South Wales Police Force Internal Affairs division is currently investigating the conduct of the Bulldogs gang rape allegation with particular focus on the unauthorised disclosure of police reports to radio shock jock Ray Hadley.</p>
