<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_catch.html" title="Edit section: In performance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In performance</span></h2>
<p>The trick usually involves a gun which is loaded and operated by someone with a knowledge of firearms to give the illusion that no deception is being used. In most instances, the bullet is marked by an audience member so that it can be identified later. Great efforts are made to show that the person firing the gun does not come in contact with the person catching the bullet. When magicians <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_and_Teller_2119.html" title="Penn and Teller">Penn and Teller</a> perform the bullet catch, a line is drawn down the center of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_%28theatre%29.html" title="Stage (theatre)">stage</a>, demonstrating that neither will cross to the other side.</p>
<p>The gun is then fired through a target (usually a pane of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glass.html" title="Glass">glass</a> which shatters) to add to the illusion that the gun has actually fired a bullet and the catcher didn't just hide a bullet in his/her mouth all along. The performer catching the bullet collapses, apparently as a result of performing such a feat, and then rises to produce the bullet which is most often spat onto a plate or tray. Historical accounts of the bullet catch describe the bullet being caught in a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handkerchief.html" title="Handkerchief">handkerchief</a>, in a bottle, or even on the tip of a <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a>. The gun that Penn and Teller use in their effect is fitted with a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_applications.html#Laser_sight" title="Laser applications">laser sight</a> to add to the suspense and drama of the trick. The duo performs a double bullet catch where each one will fire a gun and catch the other's bullet at the same time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_catch.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>One of the earliest documentations of the bullet catch appeared in the book <i>Threats of God's Judgments</i> by Reverend Thomas Beard in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1631.html" title="1631">1631</a>. Fifty years earlier in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, a magician by the name of Coullew of Lorraine had been successfully performing the bullet catch, demonstrating that he could catch bullets in his hand. (This early performer was clubbed to death with his own gun by an angry assistant in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1613.html" title="1613">1613</a>.) Throughout the 1700s, variations of the bullet catch were developed by a number of street performers.</p>
<p>In his <a href="../../../1/7/8/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a> book, <i>Natural Magic or Physical Amusements Revealed</i>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Astley_e75a.html" title="Philip Astley">Philip Astley</a> wrote that he himself had invented the trick in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1762.html" title="1762">1762</a>. However, two books published in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a> mentioned the bullet catch as described by Reverend Beard: <i>The Conjuror Unmasked</i> by Thomas Denton, and <i>La Magie blanche dévoilée</i> by Henri Decremps.</p>
<p>Around <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> magician <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Anderson_7477.html" title="John Henry Anderson">John Henry Anderson</a> began demonstrating the gun trick in theatres throughout <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. Anderson, or <i>The Great Wizard of the North</i> as he was called, performed for <a href="../../../p/2E/t/P.T._Barnum_c023.html" title="P.T. Barnum">P.T. Barnum</a>, <a href="../../../c/z/a/Czar_Nicholas_a7f3.html" title="Czar Nicholas">Czar Nicholas</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Albert_7a9e.html" title="Prince Albert">Prince Albert</a> and toured in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, thus bringing the bullet catch into mainstream magic illusions. At least four of Anderson's rivals adapted and imitated his trick in their own performances.</p>
<p>The bullet catch is arguably one of the most dangerous and daring illusions that a magician can attempt, even when performed in a controlled situation. Legends surround the trick, claiming that more than twelve magicians have been killed while performing it <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although there are few documented cases of actual death, there are several accounts of the performer actually being shot. The number of deaths surrounding the bullet catch has given rise to a story that the trick carries with it a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a> to those who attempt to perform it, though in reality there have been far more successful performances than fatalities. This is a bit suspect, as magicians will often include stories of death, dismemberment, and curses as part of the staging of many tricks.</p>
<p>Thomas Frost in his <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> book <i>The Lives of the Conjurors</i> wrote of two separate performers in the 1820s named Torrini De Grisy and De Linsky who were responsible for the deaths of their son and wife, respectively. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, a performer by the name of Dr. Epstein was killed when the tip of the wand he was using to ram the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosive_material.html" title="Explosive material">charge</a> into the gun broke off inside and was subsequently launched at him when the gun was fired.</p>
<p>The best documented instance of a performer being killed while performing the gun trick is the case of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chung_Ling_Soo_5cd6.html" title="Chung Ling Soo">Chung Ling Soo</a> who was shot dead by a malfunctioning firearm in London in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. This event ended the popularity of the bullet catch trick for nearly 70 years. Escape artist and daredevil <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Houdini_b143.html" title="Harry Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> wrote a historical account of the illusion and considered adding it to his repertoire but is said to have been afraid to actually perform it. To his friend Houdini, fellow magician <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Kellar_394b.html" title="Harry Kellar">Harry Kellar</a> offered this pleading advice in the early 1900s:<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the 1950s, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> magician Maurice Rooklyn survived being hit in the shoulder by a bullet while performing the bullet catch. After this event, he wore a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chainmail.html" title="Chainmail">chainmail</a> vest under his shirt for safety. When he was later hit in the scalp by another bullet, he decided to completely remove the trick from his repertoire.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Magician Jean Hugard demonstrated the bullet catch for his retirement performance in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. He survived after taking three bullets in the chest when a spectator dropped them into the gun as a joke.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Also in the 1950s, German magician Ralf Bialla started to perform the bullet catch, for a fee of 2,000 <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_mark.html" title="German mark">DM</a> a performance. He wore bullet-proof glasses, strong gloves on his hands with which he covered parts of his face, and his front teeth were made of steel. A .22 rifle was fired, and the bullet had to go through three glass panes before Bialla caught it with his teeth. He was seriously wounded nine times, but survived. He was portrayed in the 1972 documentary film "Wer schießt auf Ralf Bialla?". In 1975, he died by falling off a cliff, supposedly because of constant dizziness caused by the injuries.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, a little-known magician named <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Skenes_be63.html" title="Carl Skenes">Carl Skenes</a> attempted what is the only verified performance of the bullet-catch (which is arguable because of Ralf Bialla's performance) using a .22 rifle firing actual bullets. Skenes wore a tooth-guard mouthpiece, and then placed a steel box into his mouth. A sharpshooter then fired the bullet into the dime-sized opening at the front of the box. Skenes first performed this stunt in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> on the television show <a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_Incredible_7059.html" title="That's Incredible">That's Incredible</a>, and later performed it on similar shows in <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, magician <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Dietrich_3b62.html" title="Dorothy Dietrich">Dorothy Dietrich</a> performed the bullet trick in a performance at Resorts International in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_City_b273.html" title="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</a>. This was shown throughout the world on a TV special called "Just For The Record, The best of everything." She also performed it as a featured performer for a world wide yearly convention of The International Brotherhood of Magicians that was featured on Network TV's "Evening Magazine", and on another occasion for the television show "You Asked for It" with Rich Little as host. On another occasion she performed it for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on a show called "Autobus du Canada," and was paid the highest amount ever paid a magician on Canadian television. She advertised that she was the first and only woman to perform the illusion of catching a bullet in her mouth. (In the 1850s, a young woman named Annie Vernone had performed the trick with her sister, and in the 1890s, Adelaide Herrmann, wife of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Herrmann_e17f.html" title="The Great Herrmann">The Great Herrmann</a>, continued to perform her husband's routines after his death; however, they usually caught it in a plate held in front of them, and neither of them caught it in her mouth.) Dietrich advertised a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove that a bullet did not actually leave the rifle. She has been called "The First Lady of Magic," America's Number One Female Magician," and "The first woman to saw a man in half." She was also featured in a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Box_Office_11e2.html" title="Home Box Office">Home Box Office</a> special starring Tony Curtis, who played Houdini in the Paramount bio-flick, doing a straitjacket escape 15 stories in the air from a burning rope. She is currently head of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA, and appears on national TV several times a year.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the bullet catch trick was tested on the TV show "<a href="../../../m/y/t/MythBusters_976a.html" title="MythBusters">MythBusters</a>". The crew used a slaughtered pig's head to see if it was actually feasible for a human jaw to withstand the force of a bullet. Despite having stronger teeth than a human, the pig's teeth and jaw were badly damaged. After judging the trick "busted", the crew was challenged to design a precisely timed mechanical bullet catching rig. This device was only modestly successful at actually catching a bullet, and only after the "jaws" were switched from a human shaped metal jaw to a longer duckbill one with more surface area. Even with perfect timing aided by ultra-high speed photography, the bullet deteriorated into an almost unrecognizable mass of metal upon impact.</p>
<p>The trick was featured in the 2006 movie <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prestige_%28film%29_f547.html" title="The Prestige (film)">The Prestige (film)</a>.</p>

<p>No matter what speed a bullet leaves the <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzzle.html" title="Muzzle">muzzle</a>, it must eventually come to rest. If the gun were perfectly aimed using an appropriate distance, such a trick would seem plausible. This is the line of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reasoning.html" title="Reasoning">reasoning</a> the performer of the bullet catch encourages the audience to accept.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>The following section <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exposure_%28magic%29.html" title="Exposure (magic)">reveals a magic secret</a>.</i></b></div>
<p>As is often the case with other magic illusions, there is no single way the bullet catch is performed. The method a magician may use will vary from performer to performer. It should come as no surprise that the gun or the bullet is rigged in some way. In the simplest form of the bullet catch, the gun is made to fire <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blank_%28cartridge%29.html" title="Blank (cartridge)">blanks</a>. The target through which the "bullet" passes is set to destruct using a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squib_%28explosive%29.html" title="Squib (explosive)">squib</a>. All the performer must do is keep the bullet in his mouth until ready to produce it.</p>
<p>If the gun is to be loaded in front of the audience, a <a href="../../../w/a/x/Wax_bullets.html" title="Wax bullets">wax bullet</a> is loaded into the firearm. The spray of liquid wax from the barrel of the gun is enough to break the pane of glass. A good magician is able to use <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misdirection.html" title="Misdirection">misdirection</a> to exchange the marked bullet with one made of wax and place the marked bullet into his mouth. There are also electronic guns which will simulate the sound, smoke, and flash of a firing, but not actually affect the bullet. Another method when loading in front of the audience or by an audience member is to have a small <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet.html" title="Magnet">magnet</a> attached to the loading stick, that removes the bullet immediately after loading. When the magician takes the stick, he removes the bullet, and holds it in his mouth until producing it. In that case, the gun is always gimmicked, it only simulates a shot.</p>
<p>In cases where the bullet is marked by an audience member, the marked bullet is then transferred to the magician through sleight-of-hand, or a similar bullet is duplicated by an off-stage assistant and transferred to the magician.</p>
<p>The gun that <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chung_Ling_Soo_5cd6.html" title="Chung Ling Soo">Soo</a> used was set to fire a blank in an adjacent <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrel_%28firearms%29.html" title="Barrel (firearms)">barrel</a>. When the gun malfunctioned, the bullet that had been loaded into the main barrel was accidentally fired into Soo's <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung.html" title="Lung">lung</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Skenes_be63.html" title="Carl Skenes">Carl Skenes</a> used no gimmicks in his performance. The .22 rifle was mounted onto a number of gun stands to keep it steady, and the protective gear and target box he placed into his mouth were put in as part of the performance.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Despite frequent rumors to the contrary, in a radio interview with <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_Jillette_dd28.html" title="Penn Jillette">Penn Jillette</a> in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, magician <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criss_Angel_f54d.html" title="Criss Angel">Criss Angel</a> seemed to indicate his unaired performance of the bullet catch was an illusion, saying that it "was so believable" that television network <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_Network_d385.html" title="A&amp;E Network">A&amp;E</a> barred it from airing.
