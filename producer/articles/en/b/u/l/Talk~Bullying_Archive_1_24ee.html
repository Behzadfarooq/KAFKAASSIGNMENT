<p>Just a note, I've removed the link in the "see also" section to the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bully_%28video_game%29.html" title="Bully (video game)">Bully</a> videogame being developed by Rockstar games. I really don't think a fictional RPG/action title has much (if anything) to do with bullying in the real world. The only reason I can think of it being there is to showcase the sensitivity of the issue of bullying by highlighting the attempts to have the videogame banned, but it seems pretty far off the track to me. Does everyone think removing it was ok?</p>
<dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Victims, not bullies lack social skills and are often loners.</span></h2>
<p>"Students who are victims of bullying are typically anxious, insecure, cautious, and suffer from low self-esteem, rarely defending themselves or retaliating when confronted by students who bully them. They may lack social skills and friends, and they are often socially isolated. Victims tend to be close to their parents and may have parents who can be described as overprotective."</p>

<p>This above statement makes me mad. Bully victims are often high achievers and very clever making the bully feel inadequate and jealous. Also bully victims are often in the wrong place at the wrong time or have some vulnerability for example an employee has to stick at a job where he is being bullied because he has to pay off his mortgage and can't get another job. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenbat_0359.html" title="User:Penbat">Penbat</a> 18:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think victims are forced into social situations that they find it difficult to deal with in the face of aggressive behaviour for example. You don't choose your school or workmates do you? Victims therefore take a background stance (avoidance). This stance is open to abuse by a bully to describe the victim as lacking social skills for example. Makes the victim stand out therefore open to abuse. Quite often given a choice of companions, a victim will do well in social settings. Other times a victim will be so used to being ignored or ostracised that he or she will avoid social situations altogether.</p>

<dd>The above statement is largely correct. However that behavior is, at least in my case and no doubt many others, a direct result of bullying, not the cause. Also, I would have to say that someone who inflicts pand and/or suffering upon others for amusment is seriosly lacking in social skils. 70.80.107.221 22:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, bullies are usually popular kids with many friends, while the victim is usually unpopular. So I would argue that the victim, not the bully, is the one who is insecure and lacks social skills. The fact that they may be intelligent and a higher achiever is irrelevent, because one can be very intelligent and still insecure. At least that's how it is in school. In adulthood things may be different. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 16:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is true. In school and other youth activities power is derived from ones social standing. Bullying is a abuse of power on a victim who lacks it. Somebody can still be sadistic while being a charismatic person with many friends. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowcheetah_40f8.html" title="User:Slowcheetah">Slowcheetah</a> 03:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strange coincidence, this issue and discussion is just creeping into <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workplace_bullying.html" title="Workplace bullying">Workplace bullying</a> too. My feeling is that both are true, that there are different kinds of differently motivated bullies, and thus different kinds of victims. One kind derives satisfaction by duelling with "loaded dice" and picks a weaker target where he CANNOT LOSE, another kind derives satisfaction from the challenge of the toughest target he can find, and maybe another kind again is drawn to the kind of victim who looks strong, but has underlying vulnerabilities that make him a soft target? After all serial killers and rapists (often just extreme forms of bullying, particularly rape, which is about imposing control) have various motivations and pick various types of victim, don't they? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 09:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aren't there a few POV statements here?</span></h2>
<p>I think we have POV problems the last paragraph in the Locations of Bullying section: "Bullying in the military can occur when a superior misuses their power to get subordinates to do whatever they want including sexual favours. However the excuse for this sort of behaviour is that the military is not subject to normal civilian laws so they should be allowed to do what they want. This can lead to a high number of sucides [sic] and mysterious deaths of subordinates which are not investigated openly. Deepcut Barracks in the UK is one example of this where the UK government refuses to do a full public enquiry."</p>
<p>My main problems with this paragraph is the sweeping, unsupported comment about the acceptance of bullying in the military; it relies completely on generalization. Any idea on how to incorporate specifics into this paragraph, or should I just delete the part about "normal civilian laws"?</p>

<dd>I don't like the bit about "so they should be allowed to do what they want" but it is true that the military is not subject to normal civilian laws. - 67.172.124.99 07:19, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The purpose of bullying and how to stop it</span></h2>
<p>Bullying is a form of <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggression.html" title="Aggression">aggression</a>. Aggression has helped man fight predators and now agression is part of his genes. Bullying is fun because it lets you express your (agressive) genes. The way to stop bulling is by both by making the bully understand that he is acting like a caveman and by countering the fun he had bullying with a larger punishment. - fvdham</p>
<p>Bullying at work is a method of motivating others by short-cutting social or organisational rules of interpresonal equity. It might be used to make a person work harder, or to get them to leave, to cover up perceived or actual inadequacies in one's self or one's friends, to impress upon others that one is tough (and not to be challenged), or for little more than sadistic pleasure. It is akin to <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a>. It can be justified by ignoring the facts of a persons merit, and by spreading and embellishing rumours about a person's shortcomings. A person who bullies would not describe their behaviour as bullying, and would have a potentially infinite number of plausible-sounding reasons to justify their actions.</p>
<p>It is near impossible for a target to stop bullying by asserting their right not to be bullied, particularly when the bully has the support of (or is) the employer. Exceptions to this truism include the conversion of Biblical character <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus" rel="nofollow">Saul</a>. The only way to stop bullying in a workplace is for someone of higher authority than the bully to recognise the behaviour as misconduct, incompatible with the employer's objectives, and to deal with that misconduct by the same procedures as any other misconduct might be dealt with. -- <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustdignity_8ff7.html" title="User:Justdignity">Justdignity</a> 22:52, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Actually no. Regular disciplining of a bully just causes them to change tactics-- and start again. Bullies are serial (compulsive) offenders and the only safe way to deal with them is to fire them.</b></p>
<p><b>People underestimate the destructive power (and cleverness) of many workplace bullies (especially social bullies, which can often be men, contrary to what is stated elsewhere on this page)-- sadly, it is not until a lawsuit threatens the economic survival of a company that people wake up to how much serious damage bullies actually do to a company.</b></p>
<p><b>And even then, the company will sometimes foolishly rally around the bully. That is how sophisticated some bullies are at social manipulation.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are in management and you see a sophisticated social bully operating below you-- cut them out of your organization like a cancerous tumor-- before it all goes to civil court.</b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hold on a second. "Getting a victim into trouble with authority" is bullying?</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that "getting a victim into trouble with authority" is bullying. If someone has done something wrong, they asked to get into trouble. I think that getting bullies into trouble with authority is the only way to stop bullies. I think that "getting a victim into trouble with authority" should be removed from the list of bullying actions, since it is just and a possible way to STOP bullying.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that reporting a bully to an authority is an effective and just way to stop bullying. However, I believe that reporting someone to an authority can be, in itself, a form of bullying sometimes. Realistically, everyone occasionally breaks the rules in every environment. Repeatedly reporting someone's minor infractions with the intention of harming the victim can be a form of bullying. For example, a bully could make a point of reporting a victim every time the victim whispers to a classmate, passes a note, doodles on a page, or surreptitiously chews gum. I'm not making the case that one should never report another to an authority, but it is certainly possible to bully someone in this manner. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I question the assumption that the person being reported actually broke a rule. A bully can get an innocent person in trouble by pinning blame on him or reporting incidents that didn't happen. We certainly shouldn't remove the text, but perhaps it can be reworded to cover the points TomTheHand and I raise. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThrobblefoot_a5f1.html" title="User:Throbblefoot">Throbblefoot</a> 19:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point being made is about false accusation (a common tactic used by bullies). It's not sating that someone who really does wrong should never be gotten in trouble.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Bullycide" rant</span></h2>
<p>I'm aware that "bullycide" is a term used by the mainstream media to describe a suicide in reaction to bullying. I'm not suggesting that it be removed from the article, but I wanted to rant: "bullycide" is a stupid, stupid word. The prefix indicates who has been killed: therefore, bullycide is killing a bully. Again, just a rant. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't think it's the most elegant word, but what's your rationale in stating "the prefix indicates <b>who</b> has been killed?" Suicide means "death caused by oneself," homicide means "death caused by another," so why wouldn't bullycide mean "death caused by a bully?"</p>
<p>Also, "bullycide" does not mean "suicide in reaction to a bullying," but refers to all types of death caused by bullying -- including suicide, homicide, and accident. Rebekah Zinn 23:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The prefix refers to who has been killed, not who caused the death. Two examples: regicide means king-killing, and fratricide means brother-killing. Suicide means self-killing and homicide means person-killing (the most general of the terms). Use of the word "bullycide" to refer to a death caused by bullying, whether a suicide or a bully-perpetrated homicide, is silly. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 01:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He thought there was problem with the group administration that didnt exist. He deleted the group without permission or knowledge of the other four moderators or the group owner. He intended to immediately recreate the group with himself as the owner but Yahoo does not allow recreation of groups at short notice.

<p>I just expanded the section on workplace bullying, and I have endeavoured to write as aobjectively as possible. I recognise the need for neutrailty. My objective has been to inform an impartial observer with no previous knowledge of the subject. Just as with subjects like murder, it is impossible to describe the pros and cons. With murder, one must describe it as including the death of a person. With bullying, one must cite the action and its effects in order to educate a reader. The only people who would regard these as controversial are those who regard bullying behaviour as somehow creative and positive. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustdignity_8ff7.html" title="User:Justdignity">Justdignity</a> 18:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well thanks for nothing Zeraeph. The material I wrote is based on personal experience plus years of research into the subject plus talking to hundreds of bully victims plus reading many books/websites in to the psychology of the subject. The things I wrote are based on far more than my personal experiences and opinions and include the psychological basis of bullying which has been overlooked. I could have easily expanded it to include citations and I also included links to other relevant sections of Wikipedia. What are your credentials Zeraeph, do you know more about bullying than I do&#160;? I very much doubt it&#160;? Yes the original had 1 source cited but not a very useful one. I had 6 links to other Wiki topics which are closely related to my text which themselves have citations. Have you read "Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality" by Elsa F.

<p>Most of the other text (for example School Bullying) on the Bullying Wiki is not supported by academic research so I am not sure why I am being picked on. My text is intended to be read in conjunction with the 6 linked Wiki topics which have their own cited references and incidentally a fair number of improvements could be made to those topics as well. I had only just finished polishing the text to the Characteristics of Bullies section a few days ago and if you really want me to cite some academic research then I will but give me a chance. What in particular do you want me to cite on&#160;? Its no good throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

I was just giving the stuff away cos I was in a good mood. Sometimes its good to have the input of someone who makes a living from their knowledge of a subject. I expect if Einstein had contributed an article on Nuclear Physics, you'd have deleted it as unverified... Thanks to your coaching and input I am already very bored with Wiki.

But you consider yourself a guardian of Wiki and you delete their posts, and you justify this by quoting from a set of basic rules whose spirit you have wholly failed to grasp. Objectivity - citing references - you're good at that part. Dealing with and understanding other people - you're trailing well behind the back of the field. I would welcome some guidance, but not in the manner you dish it out. You are ineffective as a Wiki guardian. You are putting off contributors. Your <a href="../../../j/o/b/Jobsworth.html" title="Jobsworth">jobsworth</a> manner was not part of the plan. For one moment STOP thinking about the shortcomings of others' contributions, and think about the shortcomings of your own. All mine needed was a few citations and references to put it right. The effect of yours is to totally bore and put off a new contributor. Try putting that right. Start moderating yourself.

<p>Thanks Penbat - I have inserted info on "workplace" into the bullying section - Justdignity.</p>
<p><b>This webpage is to be complimented but more work needs to be done in this section here.</b></p>
<p><b>The workplace bullying section needs to be hugely expanded</b>.</p>
<p><b>I'd like to call for people who are experts in workplace bullying to contribute generously here (I'm not such an expert but I am a surviver of serious social bullying and have learned the hard way that this is a major problem and that adult social bullies can be formidable and very sophisticated operators).</b></p>
<p><b>Best and thanks for the good start here.</b></p>
<p>--Sean7phil 18:43, 9 July 2006 (UTC)Phil</p>
<p>Phil, you DO know that there is a seperate <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workplace_bullying.html" title="Workplace bullying">Workplace bullying</a> article? That's why it really wouldn't be a great idea to expand the section here UNLESS the two articles are merged, which is an option worth discussing though I confess I can't make up my mind about it, I just think it's an option worth talking about.</p>
<p>Also, trust me, you DON'T need to be an expert to participate, you just need to be able to stay objective and neutral, refrain from personal opinion and experience (which are valid in their own right, but inappropriate here) and able to locate and cite reputable, mainstream published, sources for all the information you post. Copying this to your talk page too --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 21:28, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughtful reponse Zeraeph! I can see your point. It might be nice to merge them, but if not, perhaps a link from your smaller workplace bullying section to the other one would suffice (so people who need help can find it).</p>

<p><br />
Thanks also for the encouragement-- I am learning more everyday as well -- a large percentage of bullies (not all) are sociopaths, which are very charming manipulative people who often are big time social game players. While the stereotype that sociopaths are violent usually isn't accurate-- it apparently is true that sociopaths are incapable of feeling compassion for others. And not only that-- they are often socially predatory and get a thrill out of socially attacking/psychologically damaging others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The incidence of sociopaths is actually much higher than once thought-- approx. 1 in 25 people!! Chilling! Most are non-violent, but most are also clever and enjoy social power games-- hurting and exploiting others. And they feel no remorse (they can't-- it does not exist for them, nor can they feel love or shame). They also tend to be charismatic (although far more charismatics are not sociopaths than are).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the more sophisticated adult bullies may in fact be sociopaths. Who by the way are often very successful in business!</p>
<p>Just think-- there are so many of these people (4 percent of the population) that we pass them every day in our cars!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The majority will never break a law (not because they feel any guilt but because they don't want to go to jail). Although they can do much damage in other ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just saw a book listed called The Socipath Next Door-- I can't reccomend it it however as I haven't read it yet.</p>
<p>Apparently also, sociopaths are usually not the quiet sneaky types that you would think they are-- they are often big time power players and bullies-- and they get a thrill out of abusing others (they can feel sadistic pleasure).</p>

It made a sudden switch from bullying by school peers (a commonly acknowledged form of bullying) to bullying by school authorities, notably teachers. I'm not sure it belongs under <b>Bully</b> at all -- it really seems personal rant, and wanders from the topic -- but since it survived more than a month without being cut, I want more eyes to review it for potential salvage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bullying in schools (or other institutions of higher education) may also take the form of reduced grading, non-return of assignments, segregation of competent students by incompetent/non-performing teachers, for example, to protect the reputation of a college. This is so that their programmes and internal code of conduct are never questioned, and that parents (usually the ones paying the fees), are made to believe that their children are unable to cope with the course. Typically, these attitudes serve to create the unwritten policy of 'if you're stupid, you don't deserve feedback. if you're good, you don't need it.' Frequently, such institutions (usually in Asian countries) run a franchise programme with foreign (usually Western) institutions with the clause that foreign partners have no say in local grading or codes of conduct of staff involved on the local end. It serves to create a class of 'educated fools', people with degrees who have not learned to adapt to situations and create solutions by asking the right questions and solving problems.</p>

<p>You have just muscled in and reinstated the old text for Characteristic of Bullying section without even responding to all the comments I have made on that section further up in this discuision tab. I am incensed at your second paragraph in particular in the Characteristic of Bullying. Where are the citations for it&#160;? Have you seen the lastest research&#160;? Yes for sure it is true that your implication that people with Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder bully but that is a diversion - it is people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Psychopathic Personality Disorder who are the main culprits. You have completely ignored any kind of psychological analysis of bullying and linking it to mobbing etc etc. Your text is fundamentally flawed and inaccurate. I still dont know what your credentials are for claiming to be the ultimate bully guru on the planet.

<dd>I am afraid those search results are not valid references (as search results are often not in the internet world of "self appointment to online pseudo-expertise) as "Psychopathic Personality Disorder" does not exist in either the DSM or the ICD, therefore it is no more than a misguided pop psych label with no real existance in the world of Professional Psychiatry and Psychology.</dd>

<p>A couple of people, who are very new to Wikipedia, made sweeping edits that replaced, admittedly incomplete, but fairly valid, information, with unsubstantiated personal opinion, presented as fact, in very subjective terms. Of course there is nothing wrong with unsubstantiated personal opinion, in it's proper place, but not here, and I seem to be making a total Pig's Ear of explaining to them how and why that is.</p>
<p>On closer examination, I realise the whole article has much room for improvement, but, objectively, substantiated, and in accordance with Wikipedia Policy, not personal opinion or agenda.</p>
<p>I don't think they really understand yet that Wikipedia is not an appropriate place to "make their case" AT ALL, let alone "make their case" based only on personal experience and opinion.</p>
<p>I think bullying has many aspects, as both an informal term, AND a serious subject, and all aspects should be covered properly. Perhaps the more formal subject of "Bullying" should have it's own article and the term "Bully" should be covered more generally and informally? Or the Bully article, as it stands, should cover the general and informal aspects while specific types of bullying should be covered, to the extent they deserve, in seperate articles? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 05:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that there are not serious aspects to bullying, as of course there are serious aspects.

<dd>Bullying is a complex subject.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can see why it might be a lot easier for someone to say to themself "Hey, I was bullied for years, which wealth of experience has to make me an expert, so let my personal experience define bullying, not only for me, but for anyone else I can persuade to identify with me."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can also see why someone else, in such a harrowing position, might grasp frantically for, and hold fast to, the first thing they can begin to identify with.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But while every individual's experience is a valid part of the whole picture, it is only a tiny, brushstroke of a part that does not define the whole subject, or even come close. Any attempt to use an individuals experience to define the whole subject is bound to ultimately exclude the majority of those adversely affected by it, leaving them with a choice as to whether to edit their own reality to fit the subjective definition, or remain out in the cold, alienated, and alone.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merging et al.</span></h2>
<p><b>Merging</b> ======= I think the page should be merged with workplace bullying. Also I think that there should be some structure to the page and Workplace Bullying should be a sub heading. There is so much similarity between Mobbing, and Bullying that we ought to be thinking about pseudonyms. Bullying, AKA Mobbing for example.</p>
<hr />
<p>I disagree - mobbing is not a pseudonym for bullying. Bullying is one individual engaging in hostile activity toward another. Mobbing is when the bully involves a group in his attacks. Slandering the target to co-workers and management, for example. Coercing others to join in the bullying creates the toxic GROUP dynamic known as mobbing. This distinction has become blurred enough, don't add to the confusion. - webmaster mobbing.ca (<a href="http://mobbing.ca" class="external free" title="http://mobbing.ca" rel="nofollow">http://mobbing.ca</a>)</p>
<p><b>Military Section</b> ================ As far as the removal of the military section goes, then I see this as workplace bullying with the introduction of the malicious use of rank and corporal punishment by the perpetrator. I am a bit miffed as to why this section was removed when several attempts had been made recently to improve it.</p>
<p><b>KISS</b> ==== Like other pages, this one needs to be succinct and contain links.</p>

<dd>Dixx, how would you feel about also simplifying and merging cyber-bullying?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, I am a bit puzzled by the removal of the Military Section too?</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>:Dixx added - IMHO Cyber Bullying is bullying using a delivery tool. The deletion of the section on military bullying was a serious ommission. Incidentally, also IMHO military bullies have an array of tools similar to workplace bullies, rank (promotion prospects, demotion opportunities, recourse to bigger bullies etc) also a range of punishments, from field punshments to right the way up to summary execution etc.</i></p>

<dd>I don't think mobbing and bullying are the same thing, but I can see how mobbing could be considered a subsection of Bullying?

<dd>The scientific discussion I know is that there some authors see I difference between bullying and mobbing and others don't. The problem is that the term mobbing was used by Konrad Lorenz for animal behaviour. In Sweden the term mobbing (or <i>mobbning</i>) was taken up and used for human behavior first. Then the concept of mobbing was expanded by Swedish everyday language for negative behaviour by one against others. Later when the concept was internationalised, some researchers refered to mobbing as mobbing. Others who think that the term mobbing is cumbersome use mobbing (especially in English speaking Europe). In Ireland and UK, the term bullying refers even to a generally autoritarian leadership style, what is not usually considered as mobbing on the European continent. Due to the history of the terms bullying and mobbing, it's difficult to grasp the demarcation of each term. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_Europa_96d0.html" title="User:Sampi Europa">Sampi/€</a> 22:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Btw, mobbing usually refers to workplace bullying (sometimes to childhood bullying). Merging mobbing with workplace bullying would be better, although it would cause some problems. Merging the parts of workplace mobbing with workplace bullying should work. Merging bullying and workplace bullying is probably not the best idea because the articles are too long. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_Europa_96d0.html" title="User:Sampi Europa">Sampi/€</a> 22:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I suggest the inclusion of Lucy from the Charlie Brown comic strips. Or is there a difference between being bossy and being a bully? The football thing seems to qualify her for me. I question the inclusion of Mike TeeVee and Violent Beauregard from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I read the books and saw the Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka movie and remember general brattiness but not bullying. This is an interesting discussion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bullycide</span></h2>
<p>I agree with the above commenter about this coinage being awkward. Not only that but I keep seeing the topic recurring as one of the only forms of death that happens as a result of bullying. It doesn't take into consideration all the murders committed at the hands of students and peers from what I can tell, only the suicides caused by teasing. I realize that such murders would be murders and not mere bullying but there doesn't seem to be a suitable word or reference to the topic since bullying can escalate <i>into</i> homicide by peers.</p>
<p>The bullycide article could probably make use of the bullycide miscoinage. As for children killing children, is there a proper term like -cide. <a href="http://www.fun-with-words.com/cide_words.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fun-with-words.com/cide_words.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fun-with-words.com/cide_words.html</a> didn't list anything useful. Homicide is pretty general. Parvulus (child but not sure the usage or context) + cide could be parvulicide. But peer would be a better word (albeit I can't find any Latin for it) than child as adults can be bullied of course as well and this captures it a bit more accurately.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I know this isn't a place to promote a new theory or coinage but I think some more dealing with that possibility in the topic would be in order.</p>

<dd>Tricky...because all you could use and be NPOV would be summaries of transcripts (personal experience would be "original research"), properly cited and I don't see how you could include enough detail to make it valid without the article growing to immense proportions? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 20:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although it may seem like a good idea, we would have problems prevening no original research being used. I personaly don't think that NPOV would be an issue as long as the examples are given without commentary (which would again mostly be POV). The biggest problem is that individual bullying episodes tend to be poorly documented, more normally only coming to light after the bullying has become connstant and no one episode is then detailed. I'd like to say that I'm rather happy bullying has been included under articles relating to abuse, that made me happy&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 12:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issue: Photos/Artwork for Bullying</span></h2>
<p>There is a MAJOR problem in the use of photos/artwork. How, exactly, does one "portray" bullying? Search for representations, and all you find is photos of big mean looking boys physically intimidating little fearful looking boys. This is a very limiting and selective in scope of the topic. Plus, it is very POV, that a bully needs to be big, obviously mean-looking and physically agressive, and that victims are small, fearful-looking and helpless.</p>
<p>What else could possibly suffice? I did find ONE GREAT graphic that applied ONLY to childhood bullying, but to be useful (to see all that is written on it) it would be much larger than is feasible or workable - plus there would be tracking down ownership and permission to use).</p>
<p>If there is room for ANY photos, it would be for the most distinguished people in the field -- and that would be a photo of author, advocate and lecturer Tim Fields, recently deceased. He accumulated and utilized a great amount of journal research to substantiate his work.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The first real stalling point we have is artwork is virtually always of little boys with fists in action. Physical bullying is obviously most easily depicted in artwork -- but it is a highly limited notion of bullying and most limited to school-aged boys. And, as I've said, I would prefer to see childhood bullying have its own topic page.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>How do you depict bullying between neighbors. Through a comic strip, perhaps, where a story can be told. How do you depict a woman being shut out of a neighborhood or church clique? How do you depict all the ways of bullying?</dd>

<dd>The only photo I can conceive of would be of Tim. There is no way to match him. I am certain his widow would give permission for his photo to be on Workplace Bullying. I would hope she would consider this topic, also, for he has done far more than anyone to heighten an awareness of the social and economic impact of bullying.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for using material from bullying awareness groups, again it is all geared to childhood bullying, thus highly limited for a general bullying topic. I would be a bit cautious about using artwork that is strongly identified with a group, like the symbol they use, which is rather like their trademark? Using something like that might indicate giving some sort of preferential recognition of them? I think it is something to be discussed, though. Perhaps I am wrong about that.</dd>

<dd>But again, I will encourage you (or anyone) to feel free to track down artwork and secure permissions if needed. You can upload a photo, tell what you know about its copyright, give the webpage it was found on, and Wiki will make a determination on it, letting you know whether it can be used.

<dd><b>argh, stop!</b> I'm guessing you used something like google image search to find those, which really was not a good idea. Most images out there are not licenced compatably with the GFDL, and if a GFDL-compatable illustration <i>can</i> be aquired, no <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">fair use</a> claims can be made. As such, it is strongly recommended that you <i>never</i> use an image search without restricting results to those under the GFDL or CC-atribution licence. Although some people may be willing to grant us permission to use the image, it must be under a GFDL-compatable licence, and we should never send frivolous requests.</dd>
<dd>Contrary to what you say, I know there are anti-bullying campaigns targeting workplace bullying (in the UK, at least). Our best bet to get high quality images without making them ourselves would be to work with these groups and send them formal requests for help in detailing the issue, by asking for stills from documentaries and the such they have done, depicting bullying.</dd>
<dd>That brings me to my next idea - we could do far worse than asking on the requested images page for a group to set up a shot depicting workplace bullying, shunning, etc. That's what the community is for.</dd>
<dd>Now, counter to your claims about there is no photographs of real bullying, you may wish to look up such things as <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_slapping.html" title="Happy slapping">happy slapping</a>. This is a real and growing problem, and has been in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/5344470.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/5344470.stm" rel="nofollow">news</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 04:51, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lina!!!! I am SO ignorant (more so than I even dreamed!!!). I am such a rank amateur here at Wiki. I have zip knowledge of all the things you are talking about. I defer to you regarding all these terms and places other than Google. My stupidities are legion. *sigh*</dd>

<dd>I just got to trying to help, not knowing (I realize now) just how long that message has been up, saying graphics were needed. Obviously there are people eminently more qualified to address this whole issue. I am excited and looknig forward to what you come up with!!</dd>

<dd>Now I am concerned that my posts today may have seemed awfully presumptious, coming out of the blue. I was just brainstorming and have no intention trying to railroad anyone into going along with my ideas, just because I have them. -<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">I am Kiwi</a> 05:38, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issue: Topic Title is Poor Choice</span></h2>
<p>I am not certain who created this topic with the title of Bully, rather than Bullying, but it is way past time to get this topic moved to the other page.</p>
<p>Here is what I have to substantiate my thought processes</p>
<ul>
<li>The TOPIC is bullying rather than a focus on only one side of what is a 2-part (or multi-part) dynamic. What? should there be a separate topic for "Victims of Bullies"? Of course not. It would be like having two topics for Rape - Rapist and Rape Victim.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ABUSE CATAGORY topic-linking box at the top of the page <b>does not specify <i>Bully</i></b> (a noun describing the perpetrator/instigator in the dynamic -or- a verb to describe certain types of abusive behavior with a particular specific goal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, the ABUSE CATEGORY topic-linking box <b>DOES specifies <i>Bullying</i></b> (a noun naming the FORM OF ABUSE dealt with or a verb denoting the ACT/ACTIONS of this type of abuse, ie Bullying)</p>
<ul>
<li>The word Bully is linked, at the top of the page, to the disambiguation page for Bully (disambiguation). If the topic were (correctly) Bullying, there would be no ambiguity about what the topic is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, if you click on Bullying it brings you to this page without a halt. The disambiguation page would, of course, contine to link to this topic, as before.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that the Bully (disambiguation) needs to be the primary bully page, and this entire Topic moved, in toto, to the currently unused Bullying pages.</p>
