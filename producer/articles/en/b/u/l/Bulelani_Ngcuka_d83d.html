He spent eight months in solitary confinement in 1981 and was jailed for three years in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> for refusing to give evidence in the political trial of Patrick Maqubele and others.

The same year he was elected onto the panel of the <i>Independent Mediation Service of South Africa</i>. Ngcuka was also member of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_National_Congress_8427.html" title="African National Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC)'s delegation to <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codesa.html" title="Codesa">Codesa</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and to the multi-party negotiations in <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kempton_Park%2C_Gauteng_ae96.html" title="Kempton Park, Gauteng">Kempton Park</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. Ngcuka was the leader of the ANC Preparatory Delegation to parliament from 1993 to 1994 and in February <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> he was elected permanent Deputy Chair of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_Provinces_096f.html" title="National Council of Provinces">National Council of Provinces</a>, and was largely responsible for implementing the provisions of the Constitution relating to the council.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulelani_Ngcuka_d83d.html" title="Edit section: Controversies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversies</span></h2>
<p>Prior to his appointment as the head of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Prosecuting_Authority_of_South_Africa_7e12.html" title="National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa">National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa</a> the opposition <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28South_Africa%29_b89c.html" title="Democratic Party (South Africa)">Democratic Party</a> opposed him on the grounds that Ngcuka was already too involved in the ruling ANC to exercise judicial independence. Ngcuka created a very efficient prosecuting authority and a special investigations unit, popularly known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scorpions_%28South_Africa%29_79ea.html" title="The Scorpions (South Africa)">The Scorpions</a>. He then without fear or favour began to investigate alleged corruption, notably including senior figures in his own party related to the controversial $5.35bn arms deal.</p>
<p>In October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> Ngcuka raided the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation_fc10.html" title="South African Broadcasting Corporation">South African Broadcasting Corporation</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> this week to confiscate footage of former Hard Livings gang leader Rashaad Staggie who was beaten, shot and then set alight outside his home in Woodstock in August 1996.</p>
<p>In January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Ngcuka started investigating the Chief Whip of the ANC <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Yengeni_340e.html" title="Tony Yengeni">Tony Yengeni</a> and Deputy President <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Zuma_f4b9.html" title="Jacob Zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> for abuse of power allegations. This concerned improper influence in the controversial arms deal, and the question of financial benefit as a result of such influence. Tony Yengeni was found guilty in March 2003 and sentenced to 4 years in jail for fraud. In August 2003 Ngcuka concluded his investigation against Jacob Zuma by stating that there was prima facie evidence of corruption, but insufficient to win the case in court. Some people in the opposition and legal profession complained that by saying this, he was acting as prosecutor and judge: if there is prima facie evidence, then the courts should decide on its sufficiency. This case brought him in direct confrontation with leading figures of the ANC.</p>
<p>A Johannesburg newspaper <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Press_08b4.html" title="City Press">City Press</a> published a sensational report under the headline: "<i>Was Ngcuka a spy?</i>" on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">7 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. It emerged in the next few days that a senior political reporter of the rival <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28South_Africa%29_f8c4.html" title="The Sunday Times (South Africa)">Sunday Times</a>, Ranjeni Munusamy, had passed the story on to City Press after her own paper declined to publish it. She was suspended by the Sunday Times, and then resigned. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schabir_Shaik_5e75.html" title="Schabir Shaik">Schabir Shaik</a>, former transport minister <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_Maharaj_3176.html" title="Mac Maharaj">Mac Maharaj</a>, and Vusi Mona, all facing investigation by Ngcuka, also started to made allegations that he was once an apartheid spy against the ANC. Their counter-allegations were that such investigations against them and Zuma were part of a conspiracy by former apartheid agents, still in government to undermine the ANC and leaders of the struggle. They accused him of spying against the ANC while working for the assassinated anti-apartheid spy Griffiths Mxenge. By the end of the month President Thabo Mbeki had to step in and appointed retired Judge Joos Hefer to investigate the allegations against Ngcuka. The (Hefer Commission of Inquiry) finds Ngcuka was "probably never" an apartheid spy. Public Protector Lawrence Mushwana launches probe into allegations by Zuma that Ngcuka abused his office. Ngcuka said at the Hefer commission that "nobody, however rich or powerful, is above the law". According to Minister Penuell Maduna the Hefer Commission of Inquiry cost a total of ZAR1.9m.</p>
<p>By July 2003 the Ngcuka saga finally came to a head when Ngcuka asked the president Thabo Mbeki if he could be relieved of his position early. His departure defused some of the political mobilisation that supporters of Zuma have been able to achieve within the ANC. Jacob Zuma became in increasingly suspect person during the trial of his financial advisor Schabir Schaik resulting in his own indictment.</p>
