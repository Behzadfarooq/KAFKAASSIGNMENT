<p>This little bit toward the start seems totally biased from someone anti-PETA: " "PETA" (the first show of the second season), they illustrate the absurdity of a PETA campaign comparing the slaughter of animals with the Holocaust by cutting between shots of PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk and Hitler."

<dd>I got the opposite impression. To me, that part of the article seems to imply that Penn &amp; Teller are too harsh â afterall, it's inappropriate to attack somebody by suggesting they're like Hitler. I understand what Penn &amp; Teller's point was, and when watching the show their point is entirely obvious, but when reading the article I got the feeling that somebody wanted to suggest that Penn &amp; Teller go too far. If anything, this whole article seems a bit POV against the show. -<a href="../../../e/i/s/User%7EEisnel_29f7.html" title="User:Eisnel">Eisnel</a> 06:47, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In spite of its <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_skepticism.html" title="Scientific skepticism">skeptical</a> natute, this show is not without its share of flawed logics. For example, in one episode to prosecute <a href="../../../f/e/n/Feng_Shui_b6a2.html" title="Feng Shui">Feng Shui</a>, they hired three Feng Shui experts to the same house. They provided different and often very contradicting opinions. Therefore Feng Shui must be totally wrong.</p>
<p>But the same logic is also applicable to <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. Take <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetics.html" title="Arithmetics">arithmetics</a> for example, if we ask <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Stooges_5408.html" title="Three Stooges">Larry, Moe, and Curly</a> to solve 123 + 456 what will it be? Probably they will still give me three different answers? Their attack is very often not that strong.

<p>If there is no school, every scientist could be a self-claimed one. I can easily find myself dozens of badly trained losers who are building space rockets, but actually no better than Moe, Larry, and Curly.</p>
<p>I was talking about P&amp;T's sarcastic logics. There is not a single Feng Shui school that is teaching well-accepted Feng Shui anywhere on Earth. So every so-called Feng Shui expert is a self-claimed one. If Master Windu says this house should be flooded to add more water, maybe Master Yoda will want to burn the same house to add some fire. Every so-called Dashi (great teacher in Chinese) can disagree with the others and still be taking $500 per hour.</p>
<p>Pseudo sciences are unlike the science we know about. If we could find a hole in basic part, say to overthow the atomic theory, both physics and chemistry will need to be rewritten. All scientists are standing on the same common ground. But this Feng Shui joke is different. It was based on many different ancient @#$%s. You just don't know where your target is.</p>
<p>Pseudo science could be more like medicine. If you visit three doctors, they may give you three different answers. However, with medicine, probably three doctors will cure you. It's just with some of thm, you end up spending more time, money and pain. But with is Feng Shui, you are just wasting money.</p>
<p>A better way to debunk Feng Shui is to let them explain. They have to disclose their rules. Then we'll investigate if they do follow their own rules. Or they just move things around and charge by the hours. Then we'll see if different experts' rules are in conflict. Then ...</p>
<p>It's a waste of time. I'd rather watch Moe, Larry, and Curly and let others worry about it. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a></p>
<p>The beneficial claims of Feng Shui is laughably obvious bullshit.

<dd>Fung Shei aims to create a flowing and peaceful environment. It does not provide longer life, longer pet life, healthy children, no deaths in the family, no starvation, and constant wealth. The things that make you unhappy really aren't related to where your couch is sitting.</dd>

<dd>Ayeum, the benefits and origins of Feng Shei are far from mystical. At its most literal level, it is a system of advice for organizating a place. If anything, this episode is yet another example of how little the West understands the East. I mean, sure, if you choose to focus solely on the mystical tradition of feng shei and weigh 'chi' against the modern standards of science, it won't hold up. Do any amount of research, however, and you're bound to realize some wisdom in it.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 18:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that the "West" often doesn't understand the "East". But that easy aphorism glosses over the reason why Feng Shui earns so much contempt from skeptics, at least through its Western practitioners. Systems of organization that flow from logical analysis of patterns of use and from aesthetic appeal can be understood by both cultures, and are not at issue. It's the mystical explanation of why A works well and B doesn't that doesn't go down well. I certainly can't speak for whether there's any more testable logic to Feng Shui as practiced in the East, as I've never seen it, but Penn &amp; Teller made clear that there are Western practitioners who have an unearned surety that what they're doing is useful or even sensible (although it's obviously quite profitable). Skeptics can be forgiven for expecting no better from Eastern practitioners when the same kind of mystical explanations are used for Feng Shui as for other implausible Eastern practices. In the end, proper scientific testing (not quite what P&amp;T did) is the only thing that can demonstrate the supposed cause and effect espoused by these folks. If A is better than B, then one should be able to demonstrate the advantages through controlled tests, not just by manifestly subjective opinions from people who are motivated to justify their investment of thousands of dollars so as not to look like fools. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 19:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I felt the criticism of the show is a bit off the mark especially this section:</p>
<hr />
<p>For example, on the episode "Environmental Hysteria" they treat one random girl at an environmental protest as some sort of official spokesperson for the environmental movement. While the long clips of her stumbling over their most basic questions can be humorous, the fact that they didn't try to find anyone more articulate doesn't inspire confidence in the show's position.</p>
<hr />
<p>Penn repeatedly comments on why they are talking to Kate. Here are the relevant lines from the show.</p>
<p><br />
"...and one of the main groups participating is the Rainforest Action Network, we asked the group to hook us up with someone we could spend the day with, a knowledgable representative of their enviromental ideals, they introduced us to this woman."</p>
<p>"...once again she is the hand picked representative of the Rainforest Action Network."</p>
<p>"...lets check back with Kate, remember she is a prominent member and chosen spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network."</p>
<p>"...We keep saying that Kate is the chosen spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network because if we don't keep saying that it seems like we are just picking on somebody, she is not some poor little girl, she is a woman, and she is the woman they chose to represent them. Sure we are a piddly stupid crap show so maybe they sent in the junior Varsity speaker but has no one ever asked any of these very basic questions that we asked? Has she never asked any of these god damn basic questions of the group she so fervently supports?"</p>
<p>"...Lets ask the spokesperson of the Rainforest Action Network."</p>
<p><br />
Just a little different from <i>one random girl</i>.</p>
<p>Penn also acknowledges that the Enviroment isn't a Black &amp; White issue right at the beginning, including the comment "...but one thing is clear, there is <i>some bullshit</i> here"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Totally agree. I vote for removing that part of the criticism section, for what it's worth. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMortene_dc8c.html" title="User:Mortene">Mortene</a> 12:57, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From these quotes, I think it's pretty clear that Penn is lying. First they ask someone for a "knowledgeable representative" then she becomes a "prominent member" and then just the "spokesperson". It seems pretty obvious that they saw a bunch of people protesting, asked them for someone they could interview, got the girl, saw she didn't know anything, and didn't bother to do anything about it.<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_9541.html" title="User:AaronSw">AaronSw</a> 04:04, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how these quotes indicate any lies. A Group is participating in some sort of enviromental protest the representatives from the show go up to the group and ask for someone to speak to. Do you not think the group would select a prominent member to represent them rather than some random member of the group. A 'knowledgable representative' is asked for, this person then becomes the 'spokesperson' of the group. He then uses 'spokesperson' three times, I don't see how those phrases indicate lies. It certainly doesn't put her comments into a better light either way. --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBathTub_c622.html" title="User:BathTub">BathTub</a> 14:29, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the article: <i>" In particular, their libertarian view often leads them to make strange arguments. For example, in "Second Hand Smoke" they close by admitting they don't like second-hand smoke and would in fact prefer if it was banned from restaurants, but they don't support such a ban because it takes away people's freedom to smoke in their faces."</i> Whoever made this comment clearly doesn't understand the libertarian argument Penn &amp; Teller were making; there is nothing strange about it. P&amp;T are simply saying that although they may not like smoking, they acknowledge they don't have the right to arbitrarily interfere in the free association and actions of other people. If a restauranteur wants to allow smoking in his (or her) restaurant, any you don't like that, that is no justification to ban smoking there. No one is forcing you to go to the restaurant. -- <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirstPrinciples_f0ae.html" title="User:FirstPrinciples">FirstPrinciples</a> 20:52, Oct 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Which one is the worst episode of Bullshit? To me it's "Exercise vs Genetics". They conclude exercising is something that will make you feel better, but not actually look better, they somehow construct it from the Interviewed folks opinion that "not everybody can be a fitness model/buns of steel". They go as far and attempt to make it look like all the sports models were just born that way, an insult to the hard, hard work they do. And it gets even worse, when they try to explain that every human is genetically of one of three physiological types... And then come the 1850 or so dated stereotypes. Otherwise, I love the show. With a 'they tone of the episode is right' quota of over 80% (personal assessment) I consider them some of the most reliable news formats. They believe in what they do and it shows.

<dd>It's an interesting discussion.

<dd>You misunderstand the premise. They never claimed nature is the only important variable. The genetic predisposition (see <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somatotypes.html" title="Somatotypes">somatotypes</a>, they're from the 1940s, not the 1850s) just supplies the BASIS, that is, what you can work with.</dd>
<dd>Nurture is what you do with that predisposition. Of course it requires a lot of maintenance to keep that physique a fitness model has, but the genetic predisposition determines what kind of body type you can archieve.</dd>
<dd>I can't think of any particularily bad episode, but the inherent Americanocentrism (is that even a word?) tends to show in some episodes more than others, which is why I find some episodes factually flawed (for example, their take on circumcision ignores the prevalence (or rather, especially where I live, absence of) of infant circumcision outside the US).</dd>
<dd>Considering it's not intended to be an international programme, I guess nobody can't blame them for that, though. All in all I find their shows rather informative (more so than most of the "docu-/infotainment" on TV around here) and considerably less biased than some other shows I've seen (in fact, I even think they're less biased than any other American show I've ever seen).</dd>
<dd>I think most people who hate it "because it's biased" only hate it because they have an opposing POV more so than simply because it HAS a POV. Considering it gets flames from both sides of the political spectrum, they're probably doing something right. -- <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 04:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought the BSA episode was pretty weaksauce. Yes, the organization can kick people out for being gay or atheist, but they don't. It all comes down to whether or not the troop they want to join is a group of bigoted people or not. 97% of the troops are not, but they harped on those few cases for the whole episode.--155.246.126.73 03:56, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You know, it really helps convey your point when you make up bullshit statistics. Not only does the Mormon church sponsor a great deal of the troops (all of which discriminate against both atheists and homosexuals) but the BSA has specifically and repeatedly stated that gays may not serve as role models, and thus may not perform the function of scout leader. That, my friend, is bigotry. On a lighter note, I must say that the worst (but not necessarily bad) episode thus far has been "The Business of Love" from season two. Its thesis is not nearly as clear or important as any of the other shows. Still, I enjoyed it. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetalrobot_5ab9.html" title="User:Metalrobot">Metalrobot</a> 10:54, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seems to me the paragraph about the guy speaking at the "Ground Zero Lounge" should not exist. It is presented as if the speaker at the lounge is some how "pulling a fast one" on Penn and Teller by reciting some Bill Hicks piece. The speaker restating what Bill Hicks said does not absolve the speaker of fitting the profile of who they were 'after' in this episode (those who believe in conspiracy theories). (i.e. If someone wrote a piece stating that grass is purple, and I re-recite it, does that make it somehow less absurd?) If there is a point to be made, it should be made by someone elaborating on this "Rant in E minor", and explaining why this is somehow a 'jab' at Penn and Teller, otherwise it should be removed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Deviant_2fb9.html" title="User:The Deviant">The Deviant</a> 01:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have some real criticism of the show (and I've read this criticism online; I wasn't the one who noticed this). In one episode (the one about tree huggers I believe), Pen and Teller interview a "typical" treehugger. In the interview, she states that she that people "shouldn't use paper to write [or paper at all, depending on how you interpret this]". In other words, the show tries to depict the tree-hugger as arrogant and basically an extremist. What the show DIDN'T show or include in the interview was her next statement; and this was not included in the show at all -- that "she feels people should use recycled paper". So, Pen &amp; Teller basically cut off the context of what she is saying, and make their opponent look like a bulshitter; when in fact, Bullshit! are the liars. You would think this show would at least TRY to be objective and truthful in their approach. For those who want to read the evidence, simply google the search terms "pen &amp; teller paper recycled environmentalist" or something like that. I personally haven't seen this particular episode myself; but is that what happened? Did she state that she doesn't like using paper? I kind of want someone who HAS seen this episode to confirm this.</p>

There's actually more to that, but I'd have to return to the past edit to see the rest. Is there a reason this was removed, or was it simply a result of vandalism / bias? If there is no one against this, I'd like to copy &amp; re-paste a lot of the old information back into the article (the person who removed the info/paragraphs didn't give any explanations.) I won't revert to that older edit obviously, as it was erased back in the beginning of May; but I do intend to copy and paste most or all of the information regarding the Second Hand Smoking episode.</p>
<p>I also noticed a lot of information being deleted in this article over the months (some information that is worth keeping, or are still very encyclopedic and helpful to the community). I may try and copy and paste some of that "stuff" as well back into this article, but I'll try and ask if any one is against this first (there may be a GOOD reason the information was removed from the article in the first place).

<p>While of course critism is allowed here on wikipedia, there is a line in this article that says:</p>
<p>"In edited interviews."</p>
<p>However, is it not already obvious these interviews are edited? After all, we never here the producers and staff talk.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up? In reality shows where the contestants are interviewed, we never see the interviewer, just the interviewie.</p>
<p>Same on network or cable news: All the interviews are edited.</p>
<p>But why, specifically, is the Bullshit! article mentioning this? I think its a subtle play at undermining the show more than accuracy.</p>
<p>While it would indeed be accurate to note to all readers of wikipedia that all interviews seen on TV have some form of editing, I think its just subterfuge thats put it in this article, so until I begin (perhaps tommorrow?) to catalogue and then edit every article about a TV show with interviews to include that interviews are edited, I am removing it from this article for fairness.</p>
<p>"All TV interviews are edited," a claim that is at most a half-truth because of the fact some interviews are live, it is impossible to cut material from a live interview. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetsconspire_79f6.html" title="User:Planetsconspire">Planetsconspire</a> 00:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The final bullet point in the trivia section discusses the "trapped in the closet" episode of South Park, and writes: 'That episode, after broadcast, has resulted in several disputes, including the "alleged" resignation of Isaac Hayes (the voice of Chef and which later resulted in Isaac staying on after all,) the episode's non-broadcast in the UK and the episode being pulled from circulation on Comedy Central.' I've looked in all the other related articles to the "trapped in the closet" episode and checked a few news sources and i cant find any evidence that Isaac Hayes has rejoined South Park.

As such I chopped the whole Recycling section as it seemed like pure Original Research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This episode borrows heavily from an article from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> entitled <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/cities/recycling/recyc/appenda.asp|" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/cities/recycling/recyc/appenda.asp|" rel="nofollow"><i>Recycling is Garbage</i></a>. The episode went on to debunk recycling as being economically profitable. However, it made no mention of the reduced <a href="../../../e/x/t/External_cost.html" title="External cost">external cost</a> involved in recycling old materials versus producing new ones, such as plastic which is derived from <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil.html" title="Oil">oil</a>. While using raw materials may generate more profit for a particular firm, the environmental impact may greatly offset this. Also, many programs are not profitable, or require great subsidies, yet have social benefitsâ<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subway.html#Finance" title="Subway">subway</a> systems are one example. The episode cites a statistic claiming that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> has more trees today than it did in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, However, this figure makes no distinction between <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">tree farms</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_growth_forest.html" title="Old growth forest">old growth forests</a>, which house complex ecosystems and never fully regenerate after logging. There is little controversy that these forests are becoming more scarce worldwide. Moreover, there are no mainstream environmental efforts to stop logging in tree farms.</p>

<dd>I wrote that and agree to an extent. I suppose this particular episode struck me as one of the most blatantly one-sided and it was less a response and more of an example.

<dd>We should cite some of Penn's specific statements within the show about its non-theistic, libertarian, and aggressive attitudes. I'm sure I recall him saying citable evidence in passing in a few episodes. Just pointing out that Teller is a libertarian is not proper evidence of the show's attitudes. (I believe the statement in question is true â and I happen to favor this attitude myself, when I'm not maintaining an NPOV for Wikipedia editing purposes â but, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, mere "truth" doesn't relieve us from the need to source such extrapolations.) ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 13:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding atheism, Teller said this when receiving an award from Atheist Alliance International:
<blockquote>
<p>I want to thank Penn, for bringing me out of the closet as an atheist.

<dd>About two and half minutes into the 6th episode of the 2nd season, "The Bible: Fact or Fiction?", Penn says:

<p><i>Bullshit!</i> is an evangelical show. TV preachers are doing <b>exactly</b> what we're doing: they are telling the truth as they see it.</p>

<dl>
<dd>So TV preachers are telling the truth as they see it (according to Penn), and P&amp;T on Bullshit! do the same. Therefore, <i>Bullshit!</i> reflects Penn &amp; Teller's point of view.

<dd>My example is more specific than it could be, but I'd want more examples to demonstrate the general aggressive and somewhat lopsided approach. I say "somewhat" because I've noticed P&amp;T are often careful to express opposing opinions in terms that would be acceptable to the opposition, before they proceed to mock them, which is a courtesy I rarely see from their usual opponents.) All I'm really saying is that, to counter the obvious desire of anti-P&amp;T editors to shed the worst light on them (and not incidentally to keep the pro-P&amp;T editors honest), it's necessary to find a general set of examples to match the general statement. (If you went with the earlier wording and cited only the above examples, you'd already be ahead of the game compared to most WP articles, but when dealing with passionate controversies like skepticism vs. faith/credulity/fraud/popular cultural notions, it's a good idea to be thorough.) I wish I owned the DVDs; I could fetch some examples myself. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 23:35, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've twice removed a link to a supposed blog, bullshitlinks.blogspot.com, whose actual purpose is to, as it advertises, provide "Free full length episodes of Penn&amp;Teller: Bullshit!".

<p>This is not a forum to go into how companies routinely dodge responsibility for illegal acts committed using their resources, as this is a complex and evolving issue that will take years to be worked out in the law and courts. My basic point is that the failure of copyright holders to stem the tide of illegal distribution of their works does not excuse responsible editors from the need to avoid promoting this behavior. My position is that, by adding links to such information, Wikipedia is supporting this, even though the link presented on one of our pages is not itself a copyright violation.

<dd>I suppose I do not see any reason for WP to take a stance until these issues you illustrate are worked out. My position is that WP doesn't support anything, but serves as a repository for resources regardless of your particular ethical dilemma with them. There are plenty of clips--particularly by Comedy Central--who's works appear extensively on Google Video without their doing yet who effectively allow it by their inaction. Until there's reason to suspect Penn and Teller have a problem with it, I do not see why anyone else should.</dd>

<p>We CAN'T know if a video on Google Video is there because the owner of the copyrights wants it to be there or not - so should we just completely stopp linking to videos on GoogleVideo or other video sites??! Of course NOT! Video hosting sites and their users (people who upload the videos) are responsible for possible CR violations - NOT THE PEOPLE WHO LINK TO THOSE VIDEOS! Amen.&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My apologies to Yeago for the assumption. But for the poster who hides behind his unsigned comment, I'd point out that we actually can be sure about the provenance of videos on Google and YouTube â they're prerty much <i>all</i> copyvios unless they (A) are posted by the <i>original</i> creator; (B) include a license statement from the copyright holders, or (C) are cited as insubstantial samples for fair-use purposes. Were I a copyright holder, I would be faced with thousands of violations of my rights by thousands of people. Am I supposed take each and every one to court? This is nothing more than the shameless acceptance of criminal behavior because you know you won't get caught.

<dd>I would point out that Wikipedia <i>does</i> take a position on copyright violations â it expects its readers not to commit them.

<p>Okay, Yeago wants policies and citations? Here they are. From the very first line of <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wikipedia has no tolerance for <b>copyright violations</b> in our encyclopedia, and we actively strive to find and remove any that we find.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a firm, unambiguous stance. The only real questions here are (A) whether this policy applies to linking to sites that are copyright violators, and (B) if the site in question is participating in copyright violation. "A" is not a direct consequence of Wikipedia's official policy, but it is the height of hypocrisy to encourage the use of others' copyright violations by linking to them, while not tolerating our own. It should not be difficult to see this as analogous to someone saying, "We don't fence stolen goods in this house. If you want something illegal, you should go three houses down on the left and ask for Joe Blog. He's got a full inventory of goods that Victor Google is ready to give you for nuthin'." This is exactly the situation that this external link puts us in. We are knowingly abetting a crime. If someone complains, as happened to fr:Wikiquote (which was shut down over copyright issues and has yet to be restored), I will happily point to the edit history that documents who the abettors were. (I'm sure that doesn't scare Yeago or the anons at all, because they know no one is likely to coming knocking specifically here over specifically this issue. In other words, as I said above, they know this is a crime they can get away with. QED.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You've taken to repeating yourself in hopes I'll mistake something new. There's nothing new here, friend. I've already validated your stance; I explained to you that you exist on a spectrum and that you are at an extreme end of it. You can choose to call all else the "height of hypocrisy" (or even "moral abyss" below). When you call a monster a monster, he becomes even more monstrous.

<p>As for "B", U.S. copyright law, while unclear on many issues, is very clear about the origin of copyrights. From <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#mywork" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#mywork" rel="nofollow">"Copyright in General"</a>, U.S Copyright Office:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>When is my work protected?</b></dd>
<dd>Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Do I have to register with your office to be protected?</b></dd>
<dd>No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section â<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr" rel="nofollow">Copyright Registration</a>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It should be obvious that both television broadcasts and DVDs are "perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device". Thus, <i>Bullshit!</i> is copyrighted. You don't need to see the copyright message that always appears at the end of any show's credits, or the FBI warning that everyone ignores when playing the DVDs, although in true American legal fashion, they're plastered on everything to reinforce the point. In short, every episode of <i>Bullshit!</i> is copyrighted by the entities displayed in these telecast and DVD-based materials <i>unless and until they say they aren't</i>. They don't need to go to court to assert their copyright; court is only for prosecuting people who may be violating it, which they are unless they can justify their distribution under "<a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>".</p>
<p>Are these Google videos "fair use"? Check out <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html#Fair_use_under_United_States_law" title="Fair use">Fair use#Fair use under United States law</a>. A key component of the 4-part test for fair use â the one that is likely to result in big fines if violated â is the consideration of "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work". It doesn't take a lawyer to see that free copies of entire episodes, downloadable by anyone, anywhere in the world, 24x7x365, will signficantly undermine the market for DVD sales, rentals, rebroadcasts, syndication, etc.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no excuse for insisting on having this questionable link, or anything like it. Its only benefit is to allow people to avoid paying the copyright holder to access material well beyond the bounds of fair use. We can't pretend we are ignorant of this activity. (And anyone who tries can be pointed to this argument.) I don't ordinarily countenance the use of loaded terms, but in this case, I'm afraid Phil Sandifer has a point by referring Yeago to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_dense" class="extiw" title="m:Don't_be_dense">m:Don't be dense</a>. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 04:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"I'm afraid" your sense of self is deluded when you say you don't countenance the use of loaded terms. I wholeheartedly agree: there is no use for insisting on having this questionable linkâand nobody has. Watching you embarass yourself is far more valuable. Nobody ever suggested the work is not copyrightedâsuch a suggestion could only be drummed up in your mind, which in the desperate struggle to defend itself is reinterpreting all other viewpoints to become even more simple-minded than your own, on this matter.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 22:35, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of those Penn&amp;Teller:Bullshit! episodes were uploaded by "<b>Showtime</b>" (this is the premium cable channel which is running this show). E.g. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6789340038877644331&amp;q=Bullshit%21&amp;hl=en" class="external free" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6789340038877644331&amp;q=Bullshit%21&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6789340038877644331&amp;q=Bullshit%21&amp;hl=en</a> So I guess those videos are there because THEY want them to be there.</p>
<p>There's lots of good stuff on Google Video because it has become a great tool for promoting a tv show, a film or a music clip. Anyway, <b>you can't violate copy rights just by linking to Google Video</b> or YouTube, the one who is responsible for the content is the person who uploads the videos. Further I don't understand what should be wrong with a webpage which is collecting links to Google Video for a special tv series - anybody could go to Google Video, search for Bullshit! and would find exactly the same episodes. The blog we are discussing about just makes it a bit more convenient - NOTHING is wrong with that!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the legal status of linking to material that infringes copyright is far from clear (c.f. the shutdown of BitTorrent sites). <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't it ironic? We're discussing about Bullshit! one of the most libertarian tv shows ever and some on this site try to be holier than the pope when it comes to copyvio. Removing this link just doen't make any sense in my opinion.</p>

<dd>I'll tell you what - I'll create policy now.

<dd>I must say that anonymous poster raises an interesting point. There are Google Videos that have been uploaded by a user named "Showtime". Again, it would be very naive to <i>assume</i> this is someone officially connected to the Showtime Network. (I'd be surprised if our own <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShowtime_5737.html" title="User:Showtime">User:Showtime</a> has any connection to the network; I'd expect GV to be as open on usernames.) On the other hand, it's not impossible. I didn't see a convenient way to find information on this user (like a user page), so I checked out <i>Bullshit!</i> on the Showtime website. Showtime offers some of their programming for download through iTunes. It wasn't obvious to me whether it would charge for these downloads (which is, I believe, the usual practice), but that may be moot, as <i>Bullshit!</i> did not seem to be on their list of downloadable programs. I didn't find anything else in a cursory search that suggested whether Showtime had relinquished its rights or licensed distribution under GFDL, CCL, or some other "free" license.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it can be verified that the Showtime Network is officially behind the free distributions â not an ordinary person or even a rogue employee â I'll shut up. But the burden of proof remains on the folks who support ostensibly illegal practices. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 23:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quote:"There are Google Videos that have been uploaded by a user named "Showtime". Again, it would be very naive to <i>assume</i> this is someone officially connected to the Showtime Network."</p>
<p>I'm not defending or promoting copyvio and don't "support ostensibly illegal practices", but I really don't get why a site that links to Google Videos should be a problem. We are talking about GOOGLE video (we are not talking about BitTorrent, Kazaa, etc.), they have a strict policy on copyright infringement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quote: "Google respects the rights of copyright holders and publishers and is only accepting video uploads from persons who hold all necessary rights to the uploaded material. Our policy is to respond to any notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that content you submitted infringes another party's copyright, your account may be terminated and the video removed from Google Video. More information about our DMCA process is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/video_dmca.html" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/video_dmca.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/video_dmca.html</a>."</dd>

<p>So my point is that we can be quite sure that the material on Google Video is kosher - and if not, that it would be removed quickly (especially if it's a popular tv show like Bullshit!).

<dd>I agree that you don't get why this is a problem. What I can't figure out is whether you are deliberately ignoring the impossibility of a company filing thousands of complaints against every instance of illegally copied material with every Google Video or YouTube-like website, or if it's just incredible naivete about the reality of copyright enforcement. (It doesn't take much thought to recognize that there are, worldwide, tens of millions of illegal copies of music, and yet only thousands of reported prosecutions. Most people who illegally copy music <i>will</i> get away with it, just like most highway speeders do. The same goes for videos now.) As I pointed out above, even as they offer to investigate copyright violations, their fine print specifically disclaims responsibility for the material while it's on their site, and will only remove if told to do so. Google's official statement is backed up by a process that requires a copyright holder to (A) discover the problem, (B) file a form, and (C) wait for an investigation. In the time it takes them to go from (A) to (B), thousands of downloads can be performed, now in the hands of people with no legal right to the material. The material harm is already done.) Yes, it isn't an automated system like BitTorrent, but that doesn't make it legal. You simply refuses to acknowledge copyright law, pretending that not getting caught is the same thing as doing right. <i>That's</i> what I meant by a "moral abyss". ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 10:23, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a clear statement in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html#Linking_to_copyrighted_works" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights#Linking_to_copyrighted_works</a>:</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd><i>External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us â see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> and in particular Contributors' rights and obligations. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From what I see above, it appears that efforts have been made to determine whether the material is copyrighted, but that the issue has not been resolved - the fact that Google says it will take action if copyright violations are reported does not in any way imply that materials hosted by them are not infringements of copyright. I would remove the link pending confirmation of the copyright status.</p>
<p>The simplest solution would be to report the content to Google as a possible copyright infringement and allow them to resolve the status. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that would make sense, except that the process that Google Videos provides is clearly intended for the copyright <i>holder</i> to perform, not just anyone who can observe the bleedin' obvious fact that entire copies of TV shows are being uploaded and downloaded for free. What's more, Google Video prefaces the instructions with scary text about how a person can actually be sued for misrepresentation if they don't make their case. (They specifically cite a $100,000 penalty.) Even though this appears to be primarily to prevent companies from their own use of scare tactics to stop legitimate "fair use" applications (like illustrative excerpts from shows), it's got to have a chilling effect any concerned honest citizen. I know <i>I</i> certainly don't want to file a complaint I can be sued about unless I can confirm this situation either with Penn &amp; Teller or Showtime beforehand, and if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't have to file the complaint. Catch-22. In the end, it's not in Google's business interests to discourage <i>any</i> activity, as long as they are legally protected by their disclaimer. While the courts take years to thrash out the legal issues, Google and YouTube will pull a Microsoft on the marketplace and rake in ad money. By the time they're called to court on it, they'll be able to afford the best defense our 1-lawyer-per-268-citizens legal system can buy. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 11:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, so that's going beyond what could reasonably be expected from an "uninterested" party, but the important thing here is not whether the content should be removed from Google, but whether the link to it should be removed from the article.

<hr />
<p>We need to back away from the insults here, folks. I'll start by apologizing for my unnecessarily passionate and pointed arguments about the "height of hypocrisy" and a "moral abyss". However, the meat of my arguments is backed up by citations of both Wikipedia policy and U.S copyright law and guidelines. These citations specifically refute <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a>'s unsupported statement that <i>my</i> statements about automatic copyright are "speculation, conjecture and hypothetical musings". Yeago, on the other hand, has provided nothing but unsupported opinions. (This lack of sourcing of statements is what motivated my use of the word "lazy", for which also apologize. One should let the evidence, or lack thereof, speak for itself.)</p>
<p>I also specifically reject Yeago's statement above, where he says: "I wholeheartedly agree: there is no use for insisting on having this questionable linkâand nobody has". 85.5.224.99 (<a href="../../../8/5/2E/User_talk%7E85.5.224.99.html" title="User talk:85.5.224.99">talk</a> <small>â¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.5.224.99_00a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.5.224.99">contribs</a>) has repeatedly restored this link and has made numerous unsigned postings to support including this link. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> has now pointed out that Wikipedia policy specifically advises against links that involve it in possible "contributory infringement" situations. That policy allows fair use, but I have already made the case (again, supported by facts, not opinion or conjecture) that demonstrate why full episodes of <i>Bullshit!</i> cannot be considered fair use. Neither Yeago nor the anon editor have provided any evidence that the Google Video users "Showtime" and now "Penn and Teller" are who their names imply, any more than a Wikipedia username can be assumed to represent the implied legal identity. Unless this evidence is provided, those users have no legal standing to void Showtime's <i>automatic</i> copyrights (as defined by U.S. law).</p>
<p>The anon's argument that "we can be quite sure that the material on Google Video is kosher" is supported only by a self-protecting legal statement from Google that is manifestly self-contradicting. If Google truly was "only accepting video uploads from persons who hold all necessary rights", there would be no need for removing infringing videos, because they would never get uploaded. Clearly, this is nothing but policy â not a representation of actual fact. The anon's argument is akin to saying, "the law says that drug use is illegal, and the schools have a zero tolerance for drug use, therefore students cannot be taking drugs". There is a <i>world</i> of difference between policy and practice, and Wikipedia's position on this issue is that we err on the side of caution, per Yomangani's citation of WP:COPY above.</p>
<p>In summary, I apologize for my own heated words, but I will continue to respond to misleading and mistaken statements by anyone who claims that this link is perfectly acceptable, or who misrepresents my own statements. And I will continue to ask for evidence to the contrary, and point out any time when it fails to accompany the arguments. Wikipedians are full of opinions (and often full of themselves, as Yeago appears to suggest of me), but what counts in decision-making is <b>sourced facts</b>. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no way to prove their identity through public means because it would be a violation of privacy. Do you think your lowering of the limbo bar is fooling me? Just as nobody suggested that these videos are not copyrighted, nobody suggested that it would be fair use to post episodes in their entirety. In acknowledging and "repenting" for being a monster, you've just become a more subtle monster. Your argument is valid: these videos are potential copyright violations. Your overzealous opinion that WP is somehow "morally" responsible for this mere potential violation is hard to watch. You should simply say "I am proud of my opinion to the point of defeating all others!" I could appreciate that honesty.

<p>The prior discussion looks, unfortunately, a bit like navel gazing to me. A bunch of non-lawyers with no deep access to the underlying facts have speculated on whether Google video may or may not have violated copyright. It is not our job to appoint ourselves as Google's lawyers (I guarantee that they retain quite good ones already). If these possibly copyvio videos were uploaded to Wikipedia itself, that would be a real concern: but it is no concern at all that some third party is conceivably in violation. None of us really know who holds the copyright on these videos, and none of use knows what sort of contract Google might (or might not) have with that copyright holder, and moreover none of us is in a legal position to judge fair use on these external materials.</p>
<p>That said, while the copyvio argument against including <i>links</i> to external sites that <i>might</i> violate copyrights is bunk, I'm not sure I see the need for the link on WP's external linking policy. It would seem to me that a rather generic comment on their availability is perfectly sufficient here; WP isn't a link farm, after all. For example, perhaps the article could state something like "Episodes of <i>Bullshit!</i> have been widely distributed on popular video syndication websites". <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>Ã<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 01:56, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason why I'm posting anonymous is, that I'm new to Wikipedia and I don't have a profile on Wikipedia (I don't need one and I don't want one anyway). <b>I'm not going to add the link again -</b> <b>I thought it would be a valuable contribution, but if some people really, really don't want to have it here, I'm not going to insist.</b></p>
<p>What pisses me off is that this whole discussion has the title "Links to copyright-violating webpages". The site with the links to Bullshit episodes on GoogleVideo <a href="http://bullshitlinks.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://bullshitlinks.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bullshitlinks.blogspot.com/</a> <b>certainly doesn't violate any copyrights</b>, otherwise the millions of weblogs which are linking to or even embedding Google Videos would all be violating copyrights - this is absurd!</p>
<p>I'm not a suspicious person so if I see that some videos were uploaded by Showtime (the producer of the show) I tend to believe that this really is Showtime (In my opinion I don't have the obligation to doubt this - if Google offers this video service, they have to take care of any copyvio issues themselves).</p>
<p>If you would like to be 100% sure, that the material you are linking to on Google Video doesn't violate any copyrights, you would have to contact Google (or the producer of the video) for every single video, because you never know if CNN, ABC, AOL, Sony Pictures etc., really are CNN, ABC, AOL etc. or just somebody using it as a nick.</p>
<p>My English is not very good so it's quite a pain for me to argue with you guys - my chances to convince you don't seem to be very good anyway - but I'm quite sure, that half a year from now this internet fladiscussion will look rather absurd, because it will be so normal to link to GoogleVideos.

<dd>You are correct that my title isn't quite accurate, in that the actual link is to a pseudo-blog that serves as an index for the Google videos. I couldn't come up with a succinct way of saying that in a heading, but I felt that the indirection was irrelevant because that page was not a blog or other discussion that just <i>happened</i> to mention the videos; it was created specifically for the purpose of providing easy access to them. As for being sure, I filed a question with Showtime two days ago, asking if they either released or gave permission to release the full <i>Bullshit!</i> episodes through Google Video. I don't know if they'll bother to get back to me, but I would hope that this will call some attention to the problem. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 11:34, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I received the following response from Showtime Customer Service 3 days ago about my inquiry about the legality of the Google video uploads:</p>

<p>Indeed, <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahWolfe_9d4e.html" title="User:NoahWolfe">NoahWolfe</a> has already removed a Google Video search link that had been added, because the link now displays the message "We're sorry, but this video may not be available." I also checked the former "Episode Guide" blog link that was the original subject of this dispute. <i>Quel surprise</i> â it's been removed by Blogspot. Clearly Showtime didn't appreciate its name being used to illegally upload its copyrighted material. I hope this puts to rest the unsupported, rather naive claims that just because something is uploaded to a free video service by "Showtime" or another user name intended to imply legality, it doesn't mean the upload is, in fact, legal. The default assumption should be, as it is in U.S. copyright law, that such materials are <i>always</i> illegally uploaded unless there is a specific license statement backed up by a responsible website, like Internet Archive does with some â but not all â of its movie uploads.

<p>Hate to be a bugbear, but in the grand scheme of things, sourcing a reference from "The Onion"; a tiny little site compared to other sites who have commented on it, seems to just be adding personal criticism and referencing it with one step up from a blog.

<dd>Actually, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a></i> is a quite popular, well-known satirical news group, not completely unlike <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a></i> in some ways, in that it satirizes newsmakers and is (on very rare occasions) taken seriously by people who don't know any better (I recall there being a big thing a few years ago, for instance, with panicked people forwarding an <i>Onion</i> article about how children were turning to Satanism after reading <i>Harry Potter</i>, without realizing that the article itself was satire) - the main difference between it and TDS is that <i>The Onion</i> is print-based and internet-based as opposed to TV-based, and isn't nearly as famous or influential as TDS is at the moment. Still, it's not completely unknown, and contrary to what you say about it, its website is not "a tiny little site"; it's quite massive, actually, if you'd actually take a good long look at it. Furthermore, <i>The Onion</i> is a well-known comedic entity that has been around for <i>almost two decades</i>, and which is devoted to doing an awful lot of the kind of thing that Penn &amp; Teller do an awful lot on their show, except <i>The Onion</i> does it through hugely exaggerated satire only - hardly what I'd call "one step up from a blog", since they know the business of bullshit quite well, having made a living off of it for ages. They've also got one or more books in print (I don't think self-published, but I'm not entirely sure), because I've seen them at Barnes &amp; Noble before.

<p>I want to provide some explanation on why I removed a whole sub-section from the criticism. The section is quoted below.</p>
<p>I'm mostly against removing information of any kind. But I spend almost half an hour trying to make this fits into the criticism, and I just couldn't. It is about a critic made 2 or 3 years after the episode release and using information out-of-range of the episode itself.</p>
<p>More than that, it is focusing on the episode's subject rather than criticising the show as a whole. Maybe someone could use something like that to say "look, Penn &amp; Teller are pointing out things today that may be wrong 3 years from now". But I couldn't be sure about that after digging up on this subject. And, anyway, that's already done on the other subsection, in a much stronger way.</p>
<p>If we were to add criticism in such way, there could safely be someone arguing against every single episode of the show, and that would be too big and ultimately irrelevant to the article.</p>

<p>I'm glad you liked the article. Apparently it's against the rules for me to add it to wikipedia as I'm the author. Some user thought it wasn't appropriate in the "external links" section although I'm not sure why as there are certainly links to other reviews. So if an opinion based review is allowed certainly a fact based review should be allowed as well. He also thought my page was a strawman argument even though it's little more than a series of time stamped quotes that were are debunked by links to peer review journals. So if somebody else can add the <a href="http://www.logicalscience.com/skeptics/bullshit.html" class="external text" title="http://www.logicalscience.com/skeptics/bullshit.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> I would be grateful.

<p>It is interesting to me that, in spite of the idea that Wikipedia be as impartial as possible, the continuing representaiton of those who question Global Warming simply based on their affiliation with oil companies is permitted. This is fallacious logic. It is a possible explanation for the motives of bad science, but in and of itself it is simply an indictment based on guilt by association. It has no place in the determination of which side of a debate is correct. --Brett Orlob</p>

<p>The information alone, of course, is perfectly legitimate, and I won't take a stand against it if someone insists we mention it right now.

Somewhat to my surprise, I recently received a response from an employee of Showtime who said they would check with their management on this issue.

<p>I've removed the following trivia item for the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the "Profanity" episode, Penn and Teller themselves did not use any profanity, even changing the name of the show to "Humbug!" for that episode. However, at one point Penn exclaims "Jesus Christ!" (althought the intention is ambiguous, he was about to say it in a proper way, but <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teller.html" title="Teller">Teller</a> dropped a heavy object on his feet, causing Penn to scream it).</li>
</ul>
<p>This text, both before and after someone added the ungrammatical parenthetical clause, fails to make its point properly. What it <i>should</i> be communicating is that the only instance of <i>possible</i> profanity in the episode was when Penn was saying something that might logically end in the phrase "Jesus Christ", but Teller's drop made his yelp ambiguously profane. (My phrasing isn't satisfactory, either, but it comes from being unable to fill in Penn's prefacing words.) If I could remember what Penn was saying, I'd have fixed it myself. Perhaps someone who has the DVD can rewrite this to make the point clear? ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 00:46, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The snippet about CATO getting funds from Exxon Mobil is a pretty clear ad hominem attack. CATO gets funding from lots of sources, and as they are very free market it is not surprising that businesses would support them. Many environmentalist groups recieve funding from organizations that would directly benefit from the continued spread of global warming legislation. Does that invalidate THEIR argument?</p>
<p>I'm tempted to delete that snippet or to present a caveat, but I'll let the author of that point think about it for a bit. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.208.9.10_b338.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.208.9.10">63.208.9.10</a> (talk) 15:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>I came here to argue the same point. Since Cato is coming from a Libertarian POV, they see Global Warming as a vehicle for various groups to argue for the vast expansion of government powers, something that Libertarians are intellectually opposed to. They don't need corporate funds to arrive at this position. "Attack the Funding" is a favored tactic of those who try to silence the global warming debate. It's a logical fallacy. It doesn't belong here. --208.204.155.241 19:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The paragraph on Global Warming reads like a blog entry from someone who firmly believes in man-made global warming. Well, nice, but not particularly encyclopedic. Apparently in response to complaints about non-sourced criticism, notes have been added which don't address the fact that this is a controversial topic. For instance, there's the sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Every single scientific "fact" presented by the experts during the show is at odds with the current scientific consensus."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This links to a blog entry which simply states that there is a consensus in favour of man-made global warming. That's not good enough; you could easily find a source that stated the opposite. There are also several ad hominems whose "sources" constitute original research; for instance, the statement that "Penn Jillette is a research fellow of the Cato Institute" doesn't refer to any off-Wikipedia debate on the topic, but just points to the Cato Institute contact pages. You don't need a particular opinion on the subject to think that this whole paragraph should be reworked or removed. --Kaffedrake 19:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The research is appreciated, but so <i>much</i> information overwhelms the article, which is about an entire series, not just this one episode/issue. Can't we boil this done to a few sourced sentences that make the point?

<dd>I updated the text Wacki added, in an attempt to explain who "William Connelly" is that we should be interested in his refutation. I found <a href="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/index-work.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/index-work.html" rel="nofollow">a page</a> on <a href="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">his website</a> (mentioned in the text of the cited article) that says he works "for <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">BAS</a> as a climate modeller", so I added the linked British Antarctic Survey website as his credential. However, their staff directory does not list him, so I'm confused. Can anyone shed light on this?

I kept the criticism that relates to the program itself, since that was all that was relevant here. There are plenty of links to other pages where readers can research if they want to find out more!

<dd>@ Jeffq. William Connelley is a moderator at wikipedia. He is also a contributer to Realclimate.org and the IPCC. His work is displayed here <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/wmc/" class="external text" title="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/wmc/" rel="nofollow">link</a> The blog belongs to Coby Beck who writes for Grist magazine and has been referenced by climatologists at NASA when explaining concepts to laymen. ---@all, I like the shorter version.

<dd>It's a moot point now, but I find the statement that "William Connelley is a moderator at wikipedia" to be quite troubling. What the heck is a "moderator", and how would it confer any kind of in-article authority on any subject but Wikipedia? And being a <i>contributor</i> is rather vague. I would recommend describing him as "Dr. William Connelley, BAS climate modeller", based on his <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/wmc/biog.html" class="external text" title="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/wmc/biog.html" rel="nofollow">BAS bio</a>, to clarify his scientific credentials, which are what matter here. As far as citing a blog, I'd say the least we would have to do is make an explicit, sourced reference to how NASA uses the blog in order to give it more credence than other blogs. It skates a thin line of wiki source reliability, but is perhaps arguable. I raise these issues in case someone wants to re-use Wacki's conscientious work on this subject here or elsewhere. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The new version is much better, thanks. I was concerned not just with the sources but the whole "Never fear, we at Wikipedia are here to tell you that this show is wrong" tone. "No mainstream scientist from the area of climatology" certainly gives a different impression than "no mainstream scientist". --Kaffedrake 17:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>@Kaffedrake you said "No mainstream scientist from the area of climatology" certainly gives a different impression than "no mainstream scientist". The problem is that statement is misleading. They didn't have a single mainstream scientist. The only person that isn't an obvious industry lobbyist is Bjorn Lomborg and even that is debatable. Bjorn is by far the most respected of Penn &amp; Teller's experts. Despite this, National Academy of Science member Norman Myers says Lomborg has not done "a fraction of the homework that could give him a preliminary understanding of the science in question." There have been articles in Science which state Lomborg 'employs the strategy of those who argue that... Jews weren't singled out by the Nazis'. Both of those criticisms were from people who are not involved in climatology. So to limit the 'controversy' to just climate scientists is severely misrepresenting the situation. And to merely imply that Lomborg (or anyone on that show) is mainstream, or even an accomplished scientist, is also very misleading. Nobody on that show has even managed to get a research paper published in Science or Nature.
<dl>
<dd>I've tried to sort out this particular issue once and for all (I bet I've failed!). Rather than convey <i>any</i> judgement about Lomborg or Moore, I've simply said what they are and will leave the reader to judge. The sentence now ends "instead relies on figures such as the statistician Bjorn Lomborg and Greenpeace founder-member and now critic Patrick Moore." To say that Lomborg is not an 'accomplished scientist' is a rather large claim - he may not be a <i>research</i> scientist but he is a professor of statistics, a theoretical discipline on which climatology rests very heavily. His criticism of some climatological research was that the mathematics and statistics were poor or flawed; his critics may not have been solely climatologists, but were they statisticians? The best thing here (as elsewhere) would be to let the reader judge.</dd>
<dd>As regards his not having things published, this is partly because some journals have refused to publish his rebuttals of attacks on his work, which suggests a bias among the scientific establishment in favour of the "consensus". That point equating Lomborg's work to holocaust denial should signal to any intelligent observer that the controversy is beginning to generate more heat than light and that it has moved beyond criticism and debate to an attempt to besmirch Lomborg's name. It would not be the first time that scientists exhibited bias against critics in their ranks; nor, sadly, will it be the last.</dd>

<dd>Wacki, "common knowledge" is what any Wikipedia reader can be expected to know before reading an article. The year is 2006 AD/CE. The Earth is round. English is read left-to-right and top-to-bottom. <i>These</i> are common knowledge. The names of the people above are not "common knowledge". If these people are not mentioned in any wiki-reliable sources that can be cited, they probably won't be useful as sources for information. You cannot assume someone reading an article about a TV show would have <i>any</i> knowledge whatsoever of scientist bloggers covering a particular topic discussed in that show, any more than I could expect readers of <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_b5cb.html" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a> to know the origin of "Hi-keeba!", which is "common knowledge" among fans of that show. That's why we write articles â to explain these things â and that's why we need proper citations of reliable sources. If you haven't read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>, and their associated documents, you really should. It should answer some of your questions, even if they were meant rhetorically. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 09:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I used "common knowledge" in the sense it's common knowledge for anyone who is either in the scientific community or follows these topics. As for reading the reliable sources wiki says: <i>Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications, and they are writing under their own name or known pen-name and not anonymously.</i>. I would think that somebody that writes for Grist, has had those specific blog entries endorsed by the scientists at Real Climate/NASA, and sources every sentence/fact he claims, is a reliable source. The only reason I linked to the entry is because it was far easier than entering 20 sources by hand. A lot of the best scientific literature is currently on blogs. If you don't believe me just go to SEED and read the science blogs there. Good luck finding that kind of coverage in popular press. Mass media tends to do a horrible job at covering science. Coby Beck will republish that specific entry on Gristmill shortly. When he does so will that be considered a source I can put on wiki? Wacki 19:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While it is quite reasonable â even necessary â to include criticisms of <i>Bullshit!</i>, it is absurd to have sections that discuss criticisms in such detail that they exceed the material in the subject's article. The information in the current "Apollonius of Tyana" section is nearly as long as the text of the article on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollonius_of_Tyana_d1c2.html" title="Apollonius of Tyana">Apollonius of Tyana</a>, even though the <i>Bullshit!</i> episode was not about Apollonius, but about Jesus. I hate to delete information that someone took the trouble to research and cite sources for, but it's ridiculous to have more than a few lines of well-sourced criticism on any single episode. (In fact, one could make the argument that the criticism section should be kept to a few specific instances that amply demonstrate the biases and other problems presented in the show. In any case, the criticisms shouldn't overwhelm the subject itself, any more than they should be ignored.) Wikipedia provides links to other articles for folks who wish to know more about the subject, so it's not necessary to make entire cases for a single point here. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 22:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't quite follow that argument, Phil. Citations should only be of reliable sources. If they are, then the editor is doing a proper sourcing job of others' work; if they aren't, they're not proper sources and should be deleted or replaced with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags. Either way, it's not original research, just a sourcing issue. I feel that the undue-weight situation is the real problem here. But to address the reliable-source issue, I did what I should have earlier and examined the sources. The article currently cites information from the following six websites:
<ul>
<li>Tektonics ("Tekton Apologetics Ministries"): Alexa rank = 215,391</li>
<li>Livius ("Article and photographs on sites, cities, civilizations, and empires): Alexa = 91,935</li>
<li>The Mystica ("Encyclopedia of the occult, mysticism, and the paranormal"): Alexa = 161,038</li>
<li>The Alchemy Lab ("Alchemy resources"): Alexa = 394,997</li>
<li>Answers in Action ("The ministry of Bob and Gretchen Passantino"): Alexa = 687,005</li>
<li>Encyclopaedia Britannica Online: Alexa = 4,489, but we hardly need that to know it's reliable</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Except for the Britannica citation, not one of these qualifies as a reliable source, leaving most of the section improperly sourced, anyway. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 09:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the Criticism section, there's this:</p>
<p>"Still, some critics sympathetic with the duo's over-arching message have expressed regret that they can occasionally slip into the same sensationalism as their targets, including validating their points with pundits who possess dubious qualifications, such as controversial rock star Ted Nugent."</p>
<p>This does not sit right with me. I can't pull out the DVD right now so I'm not sure of the exact wording, but in the context of the episode Penn remarks that PETA seems to think its going to win because they're fanatical, and introduces Ted Nugent by saying something along the lines of "You want fucking nuts? I'll show you fucking nuts...", the only point they intended to validate by introducing Ted Nugent is to show that he's anti-PETA, and "fucking nuts".&#160;:) Ultimately the whole point was in fact to show that he *isn't* a qualified, sane and reasonable source. Thus I feel he's a bad example to back up that statement. I've decided to be bold and delete it. Someone may want to revise the whole section, its wording seems kind of awkward. 71.87.55.36 09:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I had the appropriate episode(s) handy for sourcing, I'd like to add the following preface:
<dl>
<dd><i>Penn and Teller freely admit their show uses the same tactics of sensationalism as many of their ideological opponents, in order to stimulate thinking and discussion while entertaining. But even critics sympathetic with the duo's over-arching message sometimes express regret this slide into sensationalismâ¦</i>, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My point would be to make clear that they aren't trying to be precisely scientific, but rather to add a showman's flair for making their points, as this kind of non-rigorous but greatly entertaining presentation gets the messages out more effectively in some ways than dry scientific explanations. Some of that is said elsewhere in the article, but I think the point needs to preface the very real discomfort the skeptic and scientific communities may feel with these shows.
