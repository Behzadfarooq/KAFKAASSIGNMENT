<p>Please, stop. Or at the very least, do some maths -- every one of your templates so far has some seriously skewy formatting. 2004 is twice as wide as every other year, and about four times as wide as 2007. Are you just copy/pasting from somewhere else, because that somewhere else needs fixing, not spread all over other articles like a layout virus. And why are you only doing North American markets? How encyclopedic is it to just omit the rest of the world? If you don't <i>know</i> about the rest of the world, maybe you're not the ideal author to create such templates? That's certainly true if you're not willing to do any research to <i>discover</i> what's beyond your shores.</p>
<p>The annoying thing is, Mitsubishi Motors has a .pdf, freely available from its global website, which gives a complete automotive timeline including the first years of its existence. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 20:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Replacing a list template with a timeline is not vandalism. I did that to several articles a while back, so the article for a specific car would have more relevant context. It makes little sense to have a huge template for every vehicle Ford has built worldwide on something like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Galaxie_1f19.html" title="Ford Galaxie">Ford Galaxie</a>. It is far more useful to have a timeline for that market during that time period.</dd>
<dd>Now, I can't speak for what he's doing here and I don't know if it's right or not, but I do not believe the intent is vandalism. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 16:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Boy, where to start...
<ul>
<li><i>"Replacing a list template with a timeline is not vandalism...I do not believe the intent is vandalism."</i> Who said it was vandalism? The above template is not {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-test3_aa87.html" title="Template:Uw-test3">uw-test3</a>}}, it's {{<a href="../../../u/w/-/Template%7EUw-delete3_6134.html" title="Template:Uw-delete3">uw-delete3</a>}}, for "Page blanking, removal of content <b>or templates</b>". Please read <a href="../../../t/u/s/WP%7ETUSER_02e4.html" title="WP:TUSER">WP:TUSER</a> if you need to familiarise yourself further with maintenance templates. Meanwhile, you might consider retracting that particular comment.</li>
<li><i>"I did that to several articles a while back..."</i> Great, so if someone like myself prefers a single template covering a company's entire history, we're to have our preferences disregarded entirely, even if our style of navigation template is there first? How would you like it if someone started over-writing your templates without discussion? I dare say there might be mitigating circumstances in your situation though. I'm guessing here that your timelines were to stuff like Mercury, which is primarily a North America-only marque? You can therefore provide a timeline which will include <i>all</i> the vehicles the company sold, and will still be comprehensive? And your edits, I assume, did not therefore involve the removal of useful navigation links? Read my fourth bullet point with regards to this...</li>
<li><i>"...so the article for a specific car would have more relevant context."</i> The article already has that context. Predecessor, successor, years of production and car classification are all included in the infobox, and to my knowledge almost every MMC vehicle now has at least one infobox containing such info.</li>
<li><i>"It makes little sense to have a huge template..."</i> Please compare "BD's" {{<a href="../../../m/i/t/Template%7EMitsubishi_Motors_0e94.html" title="Template:Mitsubishi Motors">Mitsubishi Motors</a>}} with "my" {{<a href="../../../m/i/t/Template%7EMitsubishi_Motors_vehicles_38a2.html" title="Template:Mitsubishi Motors vehicles">Mitsubishi Motors vehicles</a>}}. Despite the fact that the latter is a far more comprehensive template, offering links to 117 vehicles (including regional naming variations) and three MMC categories, and includes almost every one of the company's passenger vehicle since 1960, it takes up less space on the page than the North American timeline template which has only 17 discreet vehicle listings and covers only the period since 1980. 320 pixels deep compared to the timeline's 357, at a screen res 1024 pixels wide. And bear in mind that since the Diamante (one of the articles where a substitution was made) is a globally available car, if it deserves a North American template it also deserves a Japanese, Australian and European template too -- Mitsubshi sold the car at different times to each of those markets. So how big is a truly <i>encyclopedic</i> set of templates going to be? Four times bigger? More? I don't think size is a big issue here, but if other people want to make it an issue, my template is far, far more compact and space-efficient.</li>
<li>On the same topic, a single global timeline would be <i>much</i> bigger. Before the "compact" row we're going to need to put a subcompact segment (for the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Colt_722d.html" title="Mitsubishi Colt">Colt</a>) and a <i>kei car</i> section which would have to be four rows high to accommodate the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_eK_f7a8.html" title="Mitsubishi eK">eK</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Minica_4b8f.html" title="Mitsubishi Minica">Minica</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Pajero_Mini_9750.html" title="Mitsubishi Pajero Mini">Pajero Mini</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_i.html" title="Mitsubishi i">i</a>, which have been sold concurrently.</li>
<li>Expounding further on the same topic, I personally dislike timelines because they expand widthways. This limitation is why timelines only ever cover short time periods,and why there's so many "early" and "late" timelines in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Category%7EAutomotive_timeline_templates_a26c.html" title="Category:Automotive timeline templates">Automotive timeline templates category</a>. Web pages expand down the way as they get bigger. Templates do not, therefore, offer "more context" unless you're willing to accept the compromise of only looking at a relatively short timescale (which rather renders the point of a timeline redundant). But that's my personal opinion, so I'm not going to just arbirarily start over-writing them with my preferred nav-template layout.</li>
<li>There wasn't a single undoing of his edits where he simply added the template alongside what was already there. That brings us full circle. If we're to cater to different personal preferences, we shouldn't be deleting one template in favour of another. That's what BD was doing, and that's what I reverted. He apparently arbitrarily decided that someone reading the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Diamante_fbb8.html" title="Mitsubishi Diamante">Mitsubishi Diamante</a> article was going to be allowed to navigate directly only to other vehicles sold in the United States. Despite the global market MMC operates in (it sells cars in 170 countries), readers are no longer going to be provided with a link to non-U.S. cars.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Two more minor points I should also mention. First, I can spot a couple of factual errors in the template. No surprise there; I'd be surprised if BD's used the &lt;ref&gt; tag once in his 5,000+ edits. That's why so much of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_Galant&amp;diff=102947682&amp;oldid=101617793" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_Galant&amp;diff=102947682&amp;oldid=101617793" rel="nofollow">factually incorrect</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_Endeavor&amp;diff=92533061&amp;oldid=91569519" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_Endeavor&amp;diff=92533061&amp;oldid=91569519" rel="nofollow">original research</a> has to be reverted. Second, it's named "Mitsubishi Motors", as if it's some kind of overall template covering the whole company. On that issue alone I'm going to move/rename it, so that it will better match any future MMC regional timeline templates which have to be created. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 19:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should have looked harder. I saw the notice but didn't read it. You're absolutely right about the global vehicles, actually I agree with you about the full list template. But on something like <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Raider_123d.html" title="Mitsubishi Raider">Mitsubishi Raider</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_Quest_09d1.html" title="Nissan Quest">Nissan Quest</a>, which were single-market cars, the timeline (if cleaned up) is as valid as the full list. I'm sorry if I was unclear.</dd>
<dd>Maybe, for the timelines, we could add a link to the comprehensive list? That would bring a reader from the specific-market car right to the global.</dd>
<dd>Again, sorry I wasn't very specific. I shouldn't write these things in a hurry. --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 19:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that the quality of your latest images are.......totally inferior to all WP policies. They are badly lit, bad angles, fuzzy, blurry, and the cars are full of salt. I think it is your camera phone and poor taste of cars to photograph. Camera phones are known for the bad quality of the pictures they take, and are not meant to replace digital cameras. They are meant for low resolution on etime use pics. As a result, your images are fuzzy and blurry. So, throw that camera phone in the garbage, get that camera back out, and judge the cars you take images of better. When I and your hero IFCAR take pics, we pick out cars that aren't currounded by other cars, that are mostly clean of salt erosion, and are not in bright sunlight. So, please do that, and quit uploading inferior quality pictures to wikipedia. Please let me know that you get what I am saying, adn please stop putting bad pictures on Wikipedia. Cause, if you continue u0ploading all these bad pics, you might be seeing a RfC. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a> 00:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>&lt;de-indent&gt; Sorry to step in here, but I'm also an automobile photographer when I can find the time to do so. I use a DXG DVC305 camera, which is by no stretch of the imagination a great one. I also use my mom's Kodak DX7630, which is somewhat better. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Image%7EMercedes-Benz_ML350_2003.jpg_cb27.html" title="Image:Mercedes-Benz ML350 2003.jpg">Image:Mercedes-Benz ML350 2003.jpg</a> is an example of the Kodak's output. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Image%7EChevrolet_Cobalt_sedan_2005.jpg_e4a4.html" title="Image:Chevrolet Cobalt sedan 2005.jpg">Image:Chevrolet Cobalt sedan 2005.jpg</a> is from my DXG camera.

<p>Stop replacing pictures of execeptional quailty with inferior pictures. I don't know why you feeel obligated to constantly insert IFCAR's pictures into articles.

Every time I have seen you swapping otu pictures, you have always replaced a super high quality picture with a parking lot shot. Why? Are you blind? It seems that every time you mess with the pictures on articles, you just mess everythign up. Ok, stop all the IFCAR butkissing. Maybe he would like you if you wouldn't be leaving crap like "FUCK YOU!" and comparisons of you to him on your talk page.

You ARE gifted and you will certainly find an activity that can suit your giftness and let you make the most of it. But Wikipedia does not seem to be that activity.

<p>Here we go again. Cut/pasted from the section above on your edits to <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi_Eclipse_5e23.html" title="Mitsubishi Eclipse">Mitsubishi Eclipse</a>, with adjustments as required. Apparently you haven't learned a thing since last month...</p>
<p>Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_GTO&amp;diff=118103276&amp;oldid=118102388" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitsubishi_GTO&amp;diff=118103276&amp;oldid=118102388" rel="nofollow">most recent edit to this article</a> added its successor as the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Avenger_433c.html" title="Dodge Avenger">Dodge Avenger</a>. Do you have a <b><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a></b> for this? As usual, aside from declarations in your edit summaries you offer no indication of this being anything other than <b><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></b>. According to Carsdirect.com, the 1996 Dodge Avenger coupe range had a MSRP of $14,040 - $18,121. This compared with the 1996 Stealth range's $24,461 - $34,820. Clearly, one absolutely did NOT replace the other.</p>
<p>So for the second time: you've now been at Wikipedia for over a year, and yet I don't think I've ever seen you cite a source; certainly not in an article. WP's core policies with regards to editing are that <i><b>everything</b></i> should be <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a></b> from <b><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a></b>, and that there should be <i><b>absolutely no</b></i> <b><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></b>. I know that you are aware of these policies because I've already told you about them, but you choose to ignore them. However, I expect you to provide a reliable source for these and future edits, or for you to revert them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDeLarge_8f50.html" title="User talk:DeLarge">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DeLarge_6a3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/DeLarge">contribs</a>) 11:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
