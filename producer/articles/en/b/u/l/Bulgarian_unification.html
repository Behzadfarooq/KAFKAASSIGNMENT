<p>The 10th <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Turkish_War_%281877%E2%80%931878%29_2723.html" title="Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)">Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)</a> ended with the signing of the preliminary <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_San_Stefano_568b.html" title="Treaty of San Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a>, which cut large territories off the Ottoman Empire. Bulgaria was resurrected after 482 years of foreign rule. The country's borders were equal to the ethnic borders of the Bulgarians — he lands of present day Bulgaria, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrianopole.html" title="Adrianopole">Adrianopole region</a>, the <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegean_Sea_b508.html" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean coastline</a> with the important cities of <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xanthi.html" title="Xanthi">Xanthi</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/d/Dedeagach.html" title="Dedeagach">Dedeagach</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kavala.html" title="Kavala">Kavala</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> (what subsequently would become known as the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Outlands_ab64.html" title="Western Outlands">Western Outlands</a>).</p>
<p>The Russian diplomats knew that Bulgaria will not remain in these borders for very long — the San Stefano peace was called "preliminary" by the Russians themselves. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Berlin_748e.html" title="Congress of Berlin">Berlin Congress</a> began on June 1 1878 and ended on July 1 1878 with the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berlin%2C_1878_3b6e.html" title="Treaty of Berlin, 1878">Berlin Treaty</a> that created a vassal Bulgarian state in the lands between the Balkans and the Danube. The area between the Balkan Mountains and the <a href="../../../r/i/l/Rila.html" title="Rila">Rila</a> and <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodope_Mountains_cd15.html" title="Rhodope Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a> was called <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Rumelia_c32b.html" title="Eastern Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a>. This artificially created state was autonomous in the borders of Turkey. The separation of southern Bulgaria into a different administrative region was a guarantee against the fears expressed by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> that Bulgaria would gain access to the Aegean Sea, which logically meant that Russia was getting closer to the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>.</p>
<p>The third large portion of San Stefano Bulgaria — Macedonia — did not get even this slight taste of liberty, as it remained in the Ottoman borders like it had been before the war.</p>

<p>In these conditions it was natural that Bulgarians in Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia and Macedonia all strived for unity. The first attempt was made in 1880. The new British prime minister, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Gladstone_e8ac.html" title="William Gladstone">William Gladstone</a> (who had strongly supported the Bulgarian cause in the past) made Bulgarian politicians hope that the British policy on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Question_6762.html" title="Eastern Question">Eastern Question</a> was about to change, and that it will support and look favourably upon an eventual Union. Unfortunately, the change of government did not bring a change in Great Britain's interests. Secondly, there was a possible conflict growing between the Ottoman Empire on one side and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> on the other.</p>
<p>The Union activists from Eastern Rumelia sent <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Panaretov_a214.html" title="Stefan Panaretov">Stefan Panaretov</a>, a lecturer in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_College_66a1.html" title="Robert College">Robert College</a>, to consult the British opinion on the planned Unification. Gladstone's government though, did not accept these plans. Disagreement came from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> as well, which was strictly following the decisions taken during the Berlin Congress. Meanwhile the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire had settled, which finally brought the first Unification attempt to a failure.</p>
<p>By mid-1885 most of the active unionists in Eastern Rumelia shared the vision that the preparation of a revolution in Macedonia should be postponed and all efforts should be concentrated on the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. The Bulgarian Knyaz Alexander I was also drawn to this cause. His relations with Russia had worsened to such extent that the Russian Emperor and the pro-Russian circles in Bulgaria openly called for Alexander's abdication. The young knyaz saw that his support for the Unification is his only chance for political survival.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_unification.html" title="Edit section: The act of Unification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The act of Unification</span></h2>
<p>The Unification was initially scheduled for the middle of September, while the Rumelian militia was mobilized for performing manoeuvres. The plan called for the Unification to be announced on September 15 1885, but on September 2 a riot began in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panagyurishte.html" title="Panagyurishte">Panagyurishte</a> (then in Eastern Rumelia) that was brought under control the same day by the police. The demonstration demanded Unification with Bulgaria. A little later this example was followed in the village of Goliamo Konare. An armed squad was formed there, under the leadership of Prodan Tishkov (mostly known as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chardafon.html" title="Chardafon">Chardafon</a>) — the local leader of the BSCRC. BSCRC representatives were sent to different towns in the province, where they had to gather groups of rebels and send them to <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plovdiv.html" title="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, the capital of Eastern Rumelia, where they were under the command of Major Danail Nikolaev.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, military manoeuvres were being carried out in the outskirts of Plovdiv. Mj. Danail Nikolaev, who was in charge of the manoeuvres, was aware of and supported the unionists. On 6 September, Rumelian militia (Eastern Rumelia's armed forces) and armed unionist groups entered Plovdiv and took over the Governor's residence. The Governor was Gavrail Krastevich, a Bulgarian patriot who, naturally, did not resist the unionists.</p>
<p>A temporary government was formed immediately, with Georgi Stranski at its head. Major Danail Nikolaev was appointed commander of armed forces. With help from Russian officers, he created the strategical plan for defence against the expected Ottoman intervention. Mobilization was declared in Eastern Rumelia.</p>
<p>As soon as it took power on September 2, the temporary government sent a telegram, asking the knyaz to accept the Unification. On September 8 Alexander I answered with a special manifest. On the next day, accompanied by the prime minister <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petko_Karavelov_8d1a.html" title="Petko Karavelov">Petko Karavelov</a> and the head of Parliament <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Stambolov_b7bd.html" title="Stefan Stambolov">Stefan Stambolov</a>, Knyaz Alexander I entered the capital of the former Eastern Rumelia. This gesture confirmed the unionists' actions as a fait accompli. But the difficulties of the diplomatic and military defence of the Union lay ahead.</p>

<p>In the years after the signing of the Berlin Treaty, the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_adeb.html" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> government had often expressed its view that the creation of Eastern Rumelia out of Southern Bulgaria was an unnatural division and would be short-lived. Russia knew that the Unification would undoubtedly come soon and took important measures for its preparation. First, Russia exerted successful diplomatic pressure upon the Ottoman Empire constraining it from sending forces into Eastern Rumelia. Also, in 1881, in a special protocol, created after the re-establishment of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_the_Three_Emperors_0155.html" title="League of the Three Emperors">League of the Three Emperors</a>, it was noted that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">Germany</a> would show support for a possible union act of the Bulgarians.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_unification.html" title="Edit section: Russia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Russia</span></h3>
<p>Defying most expectations, Russia did not support the September 6 act due to its open conflict with Knyaz Alexander I. Russia wanted to preserve its influence in Bulgarian affairs and feared losing it as the new state grew stronger with Alexander I at its head. As a result, Russia commanded all its officers to leave Bulgaria and suggested that an official conference be held in Constantinople, where the violation of the Berlin status quo was to be sanctioned.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_unification.html" title="Edit section: United Kingdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>The government circles in London initially thought that powerful support by St. Petersburg stood behind the bold Bulgarian act. They soon realised the reality of the situation, and after the Russian official position was announced, Great Britain gave its support for the Bulgarian cause, but not until Bulgarian-Ottoman negotiations began.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>'s position was determined by its policy towards <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>. In a secret treaty from 1881, Austria-Hungary accepted Serbia's "right" to expand in the direction of Macedonia. Austria-Hungary's aim was to win influence in Serbia, while at the same time directing Serbian territorial appetites towards the south instead of north and north-west. Also, Austria-Hungary had always opposed the creation of a large Slavonic state in the Balkans of the sort that a unified Bulgaria would become. <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Third_Republic_a254.html" title="French Third Republic">France</a> and Germany supported the Russian proposal of an international conference in the Ottoman capital.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_unification.html" title="Edit section: Ottoman Empire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ottoman Empire</span></h3>
<p>After the Unification was already a fact, it took three days for Constantinople to become aware of what had actually happened. A new problem then arose: according to the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berlin%2C_1878_3b6e.html" title="Treaty of Berlin, 1878">Berlin treaty</a> the Sultan was only allowed to send troops in Eastern Rumelia at the request of Eastern Rumelia's governor. Gavrail Krastevich, the governor at the time, made no such request. At the same time the Ottoman Empire was advised in harsh tone both by London and St. Petersburg not to take any such actions and instead to wait for the decision of the international conference.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_unification.html" title="Edit section: Serbia and Greece">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Serbia and Greece</span></h3>
<p>The Union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia made Bulgaria the largest state in the Balkans at that time, a fact that a number of neighbouring countries could not accept. Athens immediately asked for territorial compensations and even threatened it would begin military actions. There were civilian demonstrations throughout Greece that prompted the government to declare war on Bulgaria. Intervention on the part of the British government helped soothe this agitation.</p>
<p>Serbia's position was similar to that of Greece. The Serbians asked for considerable territorial compensations along the whole western border with Bulgaria. Rebuffed by Bulgaria, but assured of support from Austria-Hungary, king <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Obrenovi%C4%87_IV_ca9f.html" title="Milan Obrenović IV">Milan Obrenović IV</a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbo-Bulgarian_War_bda7.html" title="Serbo-Bulgarian War">declared war on Bulgaria</a> on November 14 1885, but the Serbs sufferred a humiliating defeat.</p>
