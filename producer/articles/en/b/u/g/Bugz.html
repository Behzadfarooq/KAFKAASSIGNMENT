	    <p><b>Karnail Paul Pitts</b> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>), better known by stage names <b>Bugz</b> or <b>Robert Beck</b>, was an up-and-coming rap artist, murdered at the age of 21. He was an early member of the rap group <a href="../../../d/1/2/D12.html" title="D12">D12</a> and was instrumental in their early formation. He was gunned down at a picnic party on <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>'s Belle Isle Park, taking three bullets. Today, Bugz is remembered and honored by D12, whose very foundation and success have been self-accredited to their late friend in the years following his death.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugz.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Bugz was well known throughout Detroit as a highly successful freestyle rap battler. He even battled against future D12 member <a href="../../../b/i/z/Bizarre.html" title="Bizarre">Bizarre</a>, and the two quickly formed a friendship to the extent that Bugz would later become Bizarre's "hypeman" for his debut album Attack of the Weirdos. Eminem was impressed by Bugz's skills, and he and Bizarre felt Bugz would make a great addition to the new group. <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> recalled that during the early days the group had struggled with members, but after Bugz joined the group, things seemed to click for D12.They were signed under Eminem's newly created <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shady_Records_ec4e.html" title="Shady Records">Shady Records</a> label, and the group was set to make their way into the business.</p>
<p><a name="Death" id="Death"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugz.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Two days after Eminem signed D12 to the label, Bugz was scheduled to perform along with the rest of D12 at a show that night in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Rapids_c456.html" title="Grand Rapids">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> as part of the Eminem tour. That afternoon however, at a picnic on Belle Isle on May 21 1999, Bugz was shot and killed.</p>
<p>One of Bugz's friends got into a heated argument with a group of people over a water-gun fight. As the argument quickly escalated into a fistfight, Bugz intervened on his friend's behalf. One of the men then proceeded to his <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Expedition_8079.html" title="Ford Expedition">Ford Expedition</a> SUV and retrieved a firearm which he fired at Bugz at close range, hitting him in the chest and neck. Bugz was shot a total of three times and hit by the assailant's vehicle as he fled the scene, dying soon after in a nearby hospital. The incident was caught on amateur video, portions of which were shown later that night on the local news. His final resting place is in Detroit Memorial Park East, and he is survived by his mother Carolyn, stepfather Jimmie, brother Ken, and sisters Nicole and Angie.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugz.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>D12 was shaken by the incident, darkening the light mood of the rap collective. One of the last things Bugz had asked <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof.html" title="Proof">Proof</a> was that if local rapper and friend <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swift.html" title="Swift">Swift</a> could join the group. Due to all six positions being filled at the time, he was unable to join, but following Bugz's death, and with Swift being a longtime friend of the group, they had no problem allowing him to take his place as the sixth member.</p>
<p>The story of Bugz was little known when the group first emerged, because they tried to suppress what they considered a "dark chapter in a book that was supposed to be lighthearted and fun," which was the original attitude before the death of Bugz. Although his career was cut short before he had a chance to become recognized on his own, D12 has continued to honor their fallen member and friend. Each of the current members of D12, including Eminem, boast a tattoo of Bugz on their wrist in his honor. On their second album D12 World, two songs — "Good Die Young" and "Bugz 97" — are in his memory, with the latter featuring Bugz himself. References to Bugz have also appeared in several of the group's other works, such as "911" — D12's 2001 collaboration with <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorillaz.html" title="Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a>.</p>
