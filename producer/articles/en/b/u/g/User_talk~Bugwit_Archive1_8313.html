<p>Welcome to wikipedia! I noticed that you listed "Gold Team" on the AFD, which is excellent! Good on you to get involved with the deletion process (believe me, there's tons of stuff to be rid of on here!)</p>
<p>The reason why I'm here is to point you in the right direction. While listing the page on the appropriate <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> page is a good start, it's actually one of three steps you have to do! (Surprising, isn't it?)</p>
<p>For more information in a nice compact catalogue, this will help you: <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_in_3_steps_6702.html" title="Template:AfD in 3 steps">Template:AfD in 3 steps</a></p>
<p>Enjoy, and good work! If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask at the <a href="../../../p/u/m/WP%7EPUMP_30d8.html" title="WP:PUMP">Village Pump</a>, or at <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">my talk page</a>! <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser"><sup>Talk!</sup></a> 02:08, 27 January 2006 (UTC)<br />

<p>Thanks for the comments and help. However you made a huge error ... it was NOT Luagalau Levalua Kamu but the Previous Minister of Works convicted with arranging Luagalau's assassination Leafa Vitale.</p>
<p>YIKES</p>
<p>By the way when refering to a Samoan who has a title (Chiefly title) you the general rule is that you should use the title not the last name.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>No worries, Actually when I wrote the article I thought that it could be missunderstood but did not have to time to rewrite it. I think I need to probably work on the pieces off line and then just paste them in latter. I was just a bit freaked out when I read it 'cause ... well I hoped no one saw it. Like I wrote YIKES</p>
<p>Re. the Samoan Titles etc it is kind of confusing for many people. For example in reference to the former Controller and Chief Auditor Sua Rimoni Ah Chong. Sometimes he is refered to as Mr. Ah Chong and other times by his title Sua. Proper etiquette indicates that once you know someone has a title you should always address him or her by that title. If they have more than one title it can get confusing. Generally you would use the higher title. Of course to know the standing of various titles in the hirearchy requires extensive knowledge of Samoan culture and the plethora of titles and how they fit in within various villages and districts and the whole of Samoa (including American Samoa). The only time one might address someone by a lesser title would be if she / he was a member of parmliament who had been elected under that title. An example would be the late Mata'afa Fiame Faumuina Muninuu II who enetered parliament from Lotofaga under his Fiame title. In itself it is the paramount title in Lotofaga but the Mata'afa title is a Tama Aiga title (one of the so called kingly or Royal Titles). In parliament during debates etc he is recorded in the Hansard as Fiame, but elsewhere he is addressed as Mata'afa. Another case would be when such a person goes to a ceremony or meets with chiefs or people from the village where he holds that title. Although he or she might have a higher title they would generally address him or her by the title that they recognise her or him by in their village, district, especially if it is in a capacity where that person is acting in a capacity as holder of that title, for eg in a village council (same as in parliament).</p>
<p>ANYWAY ... the whole thing would probably be an article of some sort. Unfortunately there are no "references" that I know of on the matter. It is just stuff you know and pick up. I looked through this section of Chinese and Japanese names etc and maybe there should be something like that for Samoan, Fijian and Tongan names. Fiji has some similarities in the proper form of address. Take for example Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. The traditional Fijian RATU honorific precedes the Knighthood. Likewise in the case of Aiono Professor Dr. Fanaafi Le Tagaloa, her title Aiono precedes her Professorship and her Doctorate.</p>
<p>Talking about references ... I read the pages explaining the need for references but have not figured out how exactly I am supposed to insert them.</p>

<p>Hello. I don't know whether you are aware of it, but there is still text on your old user pages. They are invisible unless you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bugturd&amp;action=edit&amp;redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bugturd&amp;action=edit&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">edit</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bugturd&amp;action=edit&amp;redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bugturd&amp;action=edit&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">page</a>. Normally when I find extraneous text after redirects, I delete it, but I don't feel I have the right to do this on User pages, so I am bringing it to your attention. You might want to delete the text if it duplicates what is on your current pages, or cut-and-paste to the new pages. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">(talk)</a> 12:11, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry you don't like being criticized for describing a very, very well-known and well-respected academic as non-notable, even though he obviously meets about 15 different notability criteria. Maybe if you bothered to check to be sure what you said was even remotely accurate, people wouldn't say things that get you so upset. But you deserve it. Would it kill you to try to actually improve Wikipedia rather than deleting useful articles by new editors who don't write them in a form that satisfies you? Say, by fixing whatever bothers you! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:39, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, let's be honest, Bugwit, you did make a bad call here. Better to send Mr Ego to the timeout bench and acknowledge an error made. It's actually quite rare for people with a real contribution history to work up articles on non-notable professors. If a decent-sized stub is stated in reasonably neutral terms with some credible claims to authority it's probably best to at least check Google Scholar. There are about 3,500 refs for this guy, less 500 of his own publications, which is enough to at least justify a more careful check. No harm done in the end, it's been caught at AfD. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:22, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agreed...to a point, which is why I retracted the AfD nomination as soon as some notability was provided. The article, as written when originally prodded, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_J._Gumperz&amp;oldid=44939754|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_J._Gumperz&amp;oldid=44939754|" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with the only assertion of notability listed with no citations. In that state, it could have easily gone up for speedy deletion, but I figured {{prod}}ing it was fair. Its true that the tone in which <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> contested the proposed deletion did nothing to improve my outlook on the article. But given the fact that no improvement was made to it, the nomination for AfD was made in good faith. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 23:38, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't disagree. We have processes precisely so that one person's view of what is notable does not go unchallenged. Monicasdude should not be half as aggressive - but my experience is that it is better to put your hands up to a mistake than to argue. Perhaps the best thing would be to include a longer justification in the {prod} next time? If you'd made it a full sentence I would find it much easier to support you. I think Monicasdude is being very aggressive right now, and I'd like to be able to calm the situation down without resorting to blocks and formal proceedings.

<li>I understand, and will try to include more information when prodding/AfDing articles. My reaction was primarily due to the fact that, after ignoring similar actions by <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> towards me previously, and seeing that I was not alone in being in his crosshairs, I found that this is nothing new, and that RfCs have been filed <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Monicasdude_d9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Monicasdude">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Monicasdude_2_2961.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Monicasdude 2">here</a> for exactly this kind of behavior. I realize that referring a user to <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> is generally considered bad form, but given his history, I felt (and feel) that it was perfectly appropriate, and long overdue if it had not been done previously. It seems to me that <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> likes to leave certain articles in poor states as "bait" (see <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_deletionwatch_6c0b.html" title="User:Monicasdude/deletionwatch">User:Monicasdude/deletionwatch</a>) for any poor sap who would dare come along and try to delete them. He doesn't edit them to improve them, just adds them to the deletion watch (obviously this is purely opinion, but seems like a reasonable assumption). According to the final disposition of the 2nd RfC, an RfAr is in the works, and I fully intend to participate. Users like this create vastly more harm than good, and (once again) in my opinion, have no place here. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 12:27, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No prob. I hope you read the original content of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Robber_Barons_%28band%29_945a.html" title="The Robber Barons (band)">The Robber Barons (band)</a>. It was amazingly bad. The only reason I didn't nominate Rockefeller for speedy deletion is because I thought there might be some underground New Mexico emo movement of which I was not aware, and that someone might have something to contribute. If you think it's best for speedy deletion, go for it. What do you think about the stuff at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Robber_Barons_%28band%29_945a.html" title="The Robber Barons (band)">The Robber Barons (band)</a>? I realize it's thin and from their website, but I think it's NPOV, and since they've one album available (apparently, soon two), I think it's valid to have an article letting readers know the basics of who they are and what they do. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlington_1d51.html" title="User:Turlington">Turly-burly</a> 22:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As far as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Robber_Barons_%28band%29_945a.html" title="The Robber Barons (band)">The Robber Barons (band)</a> goes, the article has already been {{prod}} ed by another user. The article does state they have have one album out, with one in the works, but I don't think that their record label (Homewreckords) would be considered as "one of the more important indie labels". That being said, you <i>can</i> buy their first album on Tower Records <a href="http://www.towerrecords.com/product.aspx?pfid=3021756" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.towerrecords.com/product.aspx?pfid=3021756" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, so it could be a case of a borderline-notable band having a non-notable article written about them. Given that, I would likely vote <b>weak keep</b> if the article were to go to AfD, but I'm also content to let the proposed deletion ride if it isn't contested. How's that for wishy-washy? --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 23:09, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
