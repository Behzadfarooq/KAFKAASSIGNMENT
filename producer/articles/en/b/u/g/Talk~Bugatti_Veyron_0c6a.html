<p>Wanted to talk about the description of the W16, specifically the following sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It features a W16 engine—16 cylinders in 4 banks of 4 cylinders, or two W8 engines mated together at 90 degrees.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I changed it to this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It features a W16 engine—16 cylinders in 4 banks of 4 cylinders, or two W8 engines mated together in line.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd like to explain why I feel it's a better description. The W8 is 4 banks of 2 cylinders, or two (theoretical) VR4 engines mated at 90 degrees. Mating two W8s at 90 degrees yields a WW16, with 8 banks of 2 cylinders&#160;;-) A W16 is two W8s in line, or two (theoretical) VR8s mated at 90 degrees.</p>
<p>When I speak of, for example, a theoretical VR4, I mean a narrow angle V4 similar to VW's VR6 design. I'm going to revert my change back. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:47, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right. I was thinking "V8" not "W8" when I read that comment. Perhaps we should add both - it's both two W8s in a line and, conceptually, two V8s intermeshed. --<a href="../../../s/f/o/User%7ESfoskett_16b5.html" title="User:Sfoskett">SFoskett</a> 13:54, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I partly agree with you, but I don't know if it's a good idea to try to explain VW's narrow angle engine concept on every page (<a href="../../../v/r/6/VR6_5728.html" title="VR6">VR6</a>, <a href="../../../w/8/_/W8.html" title="W8">W8</a>, <a href="../../../w/1/2/W12.html" title="W12">W12</a>, <a href="../../../w/1/6/W16.html" title="W16">W16</a>), so I wonder if we can explain it in one place (perhaps VR6) and then refer the other pages to that explanation. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:35, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm an idiot and don't know how to post, but the first paragraph says it was designed in the UK, and the second says it was designed by Helmut or something in Germany. If you got the first bit of info off topgear, he was referring to the gearbox, which was designed and built in the UK by Ricardo.</p>

<p>I have done my research and this is not the "most expensive" car as stated in the artical at 1.3 million. Instead the Ferrari FXX Super (seen here <a href="http://drautos.com/search/srDetails.asp?itemid=257282&amp;sessionkey={E98F7F81-2479-49C4-8F00-75E6CBC178DC}" class="external free" title="http://drautos.com/search/srDetails.asp?itemid=257282&amp;sessionkey={E98F7F81-2479-49C4-8F00-75E6CBC178DC}" rel="nofollow">http://drautos.com/search/srDetails.asp?itemid=257282&amp;sessionkey={E98F7F81-2479-49C4-8F00-75E6CBC178DC}</a>) - which looks very similar to the <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzo.html" title="Enzo">Enzo</a> appart from some noticeable differences. Also if possible add the FXX picture to the FXX page.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Veyron is the most expensive road legal car. Although the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrari_FXX_894e.html" title="Ferrari FXX">Ferrari FXX</a> is more expensive, it can't be driven on the road or even raced.

<p>Is this a W16 or a W18 the article says both</p>

<dl>
<dd>The original 1999 concept car had a W18, but the 2001 concept car and the production car use the W16. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 01:42, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's some more dispute going on over how to describe the W16 engine. Volkswagen's W16 is based on its VR6 engine technology, which is sort of a cross between a V6 and a straight six. It operates most like a straight six, with a single cylinder head and two cams driving 24 valves. The W16 is based on two of these, stretched to eight cylinders and mated at 90 degrees. It's not really accurate to describe the W16 as two V8s next to each other. It could possibly be described as two V8s intermeshed, but I think it's better to describe it in terms of other VW engines, since it really has no other automotive equivalent. The <a href="../../../v/r/6/VR6_5728.html" title="VR6">VR6</a> article explains the whole thing pretty well in my opinion, but I think it'd be a good idea to add more detail to the W pages and add more links back to VR6. I have a week off coming up, so hopefully I'll find some time to do it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:36, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just noticed this link: <a href="http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/smooth5.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/smooth5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/smooth5.htm</a> It has a nice pic of a W12 block that shows that I'm talking about. However, it says that the W12 is two VR6s mated at 72 degrees! Thought it was 90. I imagine that means all of VW's W engines are mated at 72 degrees, so I've got some updating to do. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:39, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, thanks for your explanation. Describing a general <a href="../../../w/1/6/W16.html" title="W16">W16</a> with two V8’s seemed okay with me. But, with respect to the Veyron, VW apparently really based it on their W8’s (your own edit in <a href="../../../w/1/6/W16.html" title="W16">W16</a> I think). I get the feeling your edit is more development history then explanation, but okay… <a href="../../../2/1/2/User%7E212.102.225.147.html" title="User:212.102.225.147">212.102.225.147</a> 16:01, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do understand what you mean, and I would like to offer a more complete explanation of VW's W engine line in the respective engine articles. I've been meaning to do it for some time but I just never get around to it. There are just two or three different ways to get the idea across, and trying to describe them all feels unencylopedic. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:35, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is an article in this month's Car and Driver by Csaba Csere states that he took the Veyron to 253 MPH, hitting the rev limiter as he did so. Is it acceptable to call this car the fastest street-legal production car ever, or should we wait for more substantiation?</p>
<p>Attention: The Callaway Sledgehammer Corvette achieved a top speed of 255 mph and counting as a production model, is the fastest car in the world. For more information email me at pwilson@palmertrinity.org for data.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Aero never achieved a top speed of 273, that was the capabilities due to downforce and body design.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We need to wait for independent instrumentation (Csere used the speedo in the car, I think) as well as actual production. Apparently 5 cars have been completed as of December, but none are in customer hands. --<a href="../../../s/f/o/User%7ESfoskett_16b5.html" title="User:Sfoskett">SFoskett</a> 11:04, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NEWS. "Just when you thought the supercar war was over, out of nowhere come two potentially Veyron-whopping cars from an American company called SSC." -- Road &amp; Track magazine. <a href="http://www.sscautos.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sscautos.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sscautos.com/</a> Ultimate Aero is claimed to have 1046 bhp and a top speed of 440 km/h (273 MPH). -- 4l73</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The important word is "potential". As far as I can determine, the 273 is a wind tunnel number or a paper exercise. The other thing is that SSC isn't a production company yet. Lots of people over the years have appeared, made big claims and then disappeared without selling anything.</dd>

<dd>The gearing/gearbox specification from the manufacturers own webside now indicates that 259.75 MPH is maximium achievable in 6th gear. Looking at the tire specification it appears that different (likely no road legal) tyres would/will be needed to actually see that speed as the standard pilot sport ps2's used are only rated upto 186mph by michelin. Veyron is fitted with custom version rated to 252MPH whilst still road legal, called pilot sport ps2 purely for marketing reasons, it is in reality a radically different tyre construction complete with the in wheel PAX system. --Swedishchef 02:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a note to those who care, the officially recorded top speed for the Sledgehammer was 254.76 MPH. --TBIRallySport 05:22, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Imho the Callaway Sledgehammer Corvette does not count as a production model. With (afaik) only 1 car ever produced, even if it was street legal at that time, you can not say it's a production model. --<a href="../../../l/p/j/User%7ELPJ_01dc.html" title="User:LPJ">LPJ</a> 08:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yup. Only one car was built and it did not achieve this speed in road-legal state. It used custom-made tires, leaded 107 octane fuel and the catalytic converters were removed (source: C&amp;D article). Bal00 01:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Depending on how one classifies "production car", the Hennessey Venom 1000 Twin Turbo is in fact that fastest street legal car.

<p>I've done some investigating into the Clarkson statement, and I can't find that specific quote either. However, I read <a href="http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2006/01/stories/02/1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2006/01/stories/02/1.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, in which he basically says that he used to think the Veyron was dumb but, having driven it, now thinks it's amazing.

<p>In reference to the criticism by Gordon Murray, again, I can't find that specific quote. It was added by an anon who hopefully might be able to source it. I have read plenty of criticism of the car by Murray, so I'm sure we can easily add something sourced.</p>

<p>Basically, I agree with you that the article needs sources and I can't find where the quotes came from.

<p>Just out of curiosity - as i could not find any proof - Forbes claims Saleen 7TT to be the fastest production/street legal car. This, while bold, is vague and is based on following statement: capable of speeds 240 - <b>260</b>mph (<i>manufacturer estimate</i>) Saleen 7TT is the fastest car in the world. Best i could find was that Saleen did 243 mph. I keep my heart and my desktop with Veyron.</p>
<p><br />
Yeah well im pretty sure the Barabus TKR is the fastest street legal car accelerating 0-60 in 1.67 sec and reported top speed of 270 mph heres the article:<a href="http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/07/21/barabus-tkr-takes-over-as-worlds-fastest-car/" class="external free" title="http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/07/21/barabus-tkr-takes-over-as-worlds-fastest-car/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/07/21/barabus-tkr-takes-over-as-worlds-fastest-car/</a> --Jonni ^_^</p>

<p>The article states an acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds. The specifications say zero to 60 mph in 2.9 sec, now what is it?</p>
<p>2.5 Seconds, Car January 2006 the fastest car to 60 in the world I believe.</p>
<pre>
So can you add the source to the body of the article as the reference associated with the numbers at the minute quote 2.9s? Meio

<p>Another "contradiction": a quarter mile of 10.8 seconds. What is the source of that? A simple quarter mile weight/hp calculator? I somehow doubt that will be correct. If he accelerates from 0 to 60 in let's say 3 seconds, and the "0-200mph time is quicker than the McLaren F1's 120-200mph time", he's not going under 10 seconds on the quarter mile? right ;)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the part about the quarter mile as I too have my doubts about that number.

<p>I removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some see the Veyron as being an example of a sub-par design. The car seems to have been constructed with the idea of giving up almost everything in favor of performance on top speed and acceleration benchmarks. The car delivers performance by brute force and weight rather than elegance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was thinking about it and wanted to talk about it further here. The above statement is ridiculous, and I'd love to know what the writer thinks was "given up." The Veyron is incredibly fast, powerful, and luxurious. It also offers amazing handling. I've heard of skidpad figures of 1.3 G's.</p>
<p>No, 1.3 G's is physically impossible with a 4000+ pound car and 1000hp running through the tires. The fastest skidpad belongs to the Molser Mt-900 at 1.08 G's.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Ultima GTR set a new skidpad record last year of <a href="http://www.ultimasports.co.uk/records/part4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ultimasports.co.uk/records/part4.html" rel="nofollow">1.176 G</a> and it just recently set a 0-100mph-0 time of <a href="http://www.ultimasports.co.uk/records/part6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ultimasports.co.uk/records/part6.html" rel="nofollow">9.4 seconds</a> Andynormancx 15:16, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Weight or power has nothing to do with skidpad performance. It's not even a measure of handling, just tire grip. Bal00 02:10, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Weight is a very important factor in skidpad performance. Add more weight to any car and tire grip will give up a few G's. Tire grip is only one of a few factors. --Cirilobeto 04:44, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But then you need proportional more grip to move the extra weight. Weight cancels out exactly in the equation I believe. Double the weight, you double the grip, but you need twice as much grip to move twice the weight at the same number of G's. JasonAD 19:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So at the end we conclude that weight does affect grip directly. Cirilobeto 23:35, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Weight does affect grip. The more weight a car has, the more grip it can generate. However this increase in grip is cancelled out by the higher centrifugal force generated by the increased weight. This means that _lateral acceleration_ is not affected by weight. A properly set up car on regular street tires will do somewhere around 0.9G-1.0G, no matter if it weighs 1000lb or 10000lb. 88.76.83.135 21:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand that more weight generates more grip and that the centrifugal forces in theory cancel out the grip. But that is just thinking about physics and not the whole picture. In reality, more weight reduces grip. Try this: test your car with only you inside and see the Gs that result. Then get four more people inside your car and do the test again. You will see a drop of about 0.02-0.03Gs due to the inside tires lifting up higher and sending more weight to the outside tires. So contact patch has been slightly reduced, resulting in less grip. --Cirilobeto 07:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. More weight transfer is the result of changing the center of gravity. If you simply made the car heavier without changing the CoG, the lateral weight distribution would be unchanged. Weight does not affect lateral acceleration. Bal00 11:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly the point. Whenever a car is turning, the center of gravity shifts because the car is rotating on it's own axis. Basically, a car would need to have no suspension at all in order for the center of gravity to not take an effect on it's rolling characteristics. --Cirilobeto 15:18, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not what I was talking about. In your example (adding passengers to a given car), it's the higher CoG and (now) mismatched spring rates that cause more lateral weight transfer. If you simply make a car heavier without shifting the CoG upwards and fit appropriate springs, it doesn't roll any more than it did when it was lighter.</dd>
<dd>If you double the weight of a car without changing the location of its CoG, you can simply fit springs twice as stiff and it'll have the same roll characteristics as the lighter car (and ride just as well).</dd>
<dd>In the end this means that a 10000lb car can do just as well as a 1000lb car on the skidpad.</dd>
<dd>Consider the other extreme: Model cars. The weigh like 4lb, yet they only pull the same ~0.9G as passenger cars. Bal00 09:02, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When you make a car heavier you have to make changes to the suspension so that the handling performance, including skidpad, is not affected. This is how I interpret your comment on fitting stiffer springs. This is why I'm saying weight does affect skidpad. It is all relative. Model cars have a contact patch far smaller than normal cars. I don't know if they pull the same Gs though, have never seen it. --Cirilobeto 16:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course the suspension has to be matched to the weight of the vehicle, but that's not an issue for production cars because this is taken care of in the design process. VW didn't just take a Golf chassis and added a ton of weight. Bal00 17:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, in the end, again, weight does affect skidpad which is what we've been discussing in the begining. Oh and by the way, I just saw a test of one of those model cars: an HPI Nitro RS4 Racer 2 with the body of a Porsche 911, looks very good I might add. You'll find it in the April 2001 issue of Road &amp; Track. The car posted 1.33Gs on the skidpad. --Cirilobeto 20:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, weight does not affect skidpad, mismatched suspension does, but that's not the case with production cars. In the end, a 4000lb car can pull the same numbers on the skidpad as a 1000lb car, which is what we were talking about in the first place. As for the model car you quoted, it runs a much softer tire compound, which increases the friction coefficient. The lower weight does not help it. Bal00 13:37, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't mean to just interrupt, but weight <b>DOES</b> affect the skidpad test greatly. The reason a heavy car can achieve the same figures as a lighter car is because of other factors. If you had the same car and a ton of metal on the passenger seat it would achieve different results. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086">James086</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James086_7264.html" title="Special:Contributions/James086"><font color="green">Contribs</font></a></sup> 14:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Tires don't follow the schoolboy physics friction equation. The lateral drip increases as the evrtical load on them increases, but not as quickly. Therefore, as the mass of the vehicle is increased, in general its ultimate lateral acceleration will fall, for a given set of tires. There are exceptions, it is an experiment that needs to be done carefully.

<p>On the other hand, I think the article would benefit from some sourced criticism. I read an article in either Car and Driver or Road and Track that included criticism of the Veyron design by one of the designers of the <a href="../../../m/c/l/McLaren_F1_9dec.html" title="McLaren F1">McLaren F1</a>. It was extremely interesting. When I get home I'll dig up the mag and see what I can incorporate.</p>
<p>Something that really jumped out at me was that apparently they built a concept, THEN decided that they would make a production car out of it that would manage 400 kph and 1001 hp. The McLaren guy felt this was a terribly backwards approach to making an automobile, and you should figure out your performance target, then design your engine and vehicle around that.</p>
<p>For example, the area at the back where the engine is exposed is horribly aerodynamically inefficient, and they could have saved 100 hp if they simply had a smooth transition back there. However, they were quite determined not to drop "features" that were seen on the concept vehicle. All of these issues led to a long development time and an end result that has had many sacrifices made that a better design process might have avoided.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, saying that the car gives up "almost everything else" for top speed and acceleration is a little off. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 19:13, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously I disagree. I think its a ridiculous car. Its just too much of everything. Its too heavy with too much engine. 1001 hp doesn't impress me. It actually does the opposite.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to Gordon Murray's comments, I didn't originally include them because quite frankly they come across as really childish and sore loser. The sole claim to fame Murray's BMW-powered kit-car derived F1 had was the speed benchmarks. There wasn't much else to recommend it other than the big price tag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I really don't know what you want out of a car. Is the problem a lack of practicality? If so, I'm sorry, but there is no need to note that sports cars are impractical. The car goes well, turns well, stops well, and is extremely comfortable. It may be ridiculously excessive, but it's not supposed to be a Honda Accord. "Heavy" and "too much engine" do not equate to "giving up almost everything." If the car were slow, or handled like a cow, it would be closer to a valid point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do see your points about Gordon Murray's comments. I felt sort of the same way reading the article, but I also thought he brought up many things that were valid. He would be a great source to cite, in my opinion, as long as it's made clear that it's a competitor's criticism and not without bias. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:35, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe what's meant is that if both cars were at a stop, and the McLaren was allowed a head start up to 120 mph before the Bugatti started, the Bugatti would still reach 200 mph faster than the McLaren. Does that make sense?</p>

<dd>According to the <a href="../../../m/c/l/McLaren_F1_9dec.html" title="McLaren F1">McLaren F1</a> page, the F1 could get to 100 mph in 6.3 sec, and to 200 mph in 28 sec. That means it would take the F1 21.7 seconds to go from 100 to 200. Presumably, it would take less than 21 seconds, probably less than 20 seconds, to get the F1 from 120 to 200. Now, according to this article, the Veyron takes 22 seconds to get from 0 to 200. So it's close, but it sounds like it's a slight exaggeration. However, giving the McLaren a 6 second head start (allowing the F1 to get to 100 mph before the Veyron started) would be an interesting race... --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 06:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Either way, if the article is to be completely objective, it should be clear in that the 120 mph - 200 mph (for any car) takes significantly more time than 0 mph - 120 mph. Which means that performance claim isn't as substantial as it first sounds. Perhaps this is a good spot to mention wind resistance is proportional to the square of the speed, although I am not sure if people will understand quite what this implies without further explanation.

<dd>I believe this whole Veyron 0-200MPH vs McLaren F1 120-200MPH started with Clarkson's frankly unsupported claim in Top Gear and in his Times review of the Veyron. He's using the unfairly optimistic 0-200MPH estimate of a Bugatti engineer rather than Car and Driver's published 0-200MPH times. As Serge has pointed out, even if the McLaren F1 was only given a 100MPH head start, the F1 would still reach 200MPH first (but just so). I'm rather surprised at how widespread Clarkson's statement has become, without any actual data to back it up. Sadly, I can not publish this contradiction in the wiki article for the Veyron as that would be "original research" which is not allowed.</dd>

<p>The EB110 article lists the Veyron as that car's successor, but on the veyron page it lists no predecessor. I agree that it's not a straight continuation since VW took over, but the EB110 and Veyron are both big fast cars with a Bugatti badge on the front and, to me, they look like successive models in the same line.

I'm assuming that there is a stigma that some rapper would turn the Veyron into a rolling mockery of the design with flashy rims and whatnot. My question is, is the interviewers claims right?

<dd>Like Ferrari and other respectable carmakers, if Bugatti (VW) doesn't want you to have a Veyron then you are not going to get one. They have to select deserving customers. For instance, VW was outraged when Tom Cruise showed up in a Veyron, a guy who obviously don't corner a car too hard because i) he doesn't know how and, ii) he is afraid the G forces are going to mess up his hair. Same with Rappers. You are respectable when at least you show you deserve the money you have. That means having class. There is nobody with less class than a friggin Rapper. No matter how rich you are, having 10 pounds of gold chains hanging from your neck and dressing in baggy Nike jogging suits with a big fat gold-white Nike Shox shoe is NOT class.

<dd>Is it just a worthless as all the other numbers that are thrown around in the article? I am not disputing the validity of such numbers, however, I think it is interesting to note that over 2/3 of the horespower is lost in heat. It may be better tied into the talk about all 10 radiators and such. Would you have an objection to adding it to the setion on the radiators, stated like (not word for word but a rough idea)"Of the cars maximum 3000 hp produced, over 2/3 is lost as heat, which is counteracted by the cars 10 radiators?"

There are alot of things like that that wouldent be included in, lets say an article on the Dodge SHadow, because the number is not large, or notable or nobody would find it interesting. THe fact that 2/3 of the power is is let off in heat i think is an interesting fact. It is a statistic of the car, and i believe every bit as notable as any other number thrown out in the article, such as every g force the spoiler produces, etc etc. I do no tbelieve all the other articles on a car contain this information. The thing is this car is different than most, and may require different aspects in it, that oare not contained on less impressive cars. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 22:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that over 2/3 of the chemical energy of the fuel is wasted as heat is true of <i>every automobile</i>, and therefore does not need to be noted here. The fact that multiplying 1001 by 3 results in a larger number than multiplying 150 by 3 also does not need to be noted. I agree that the Veyron is a unique automobile, but this particular issue is actually one of the things about it that is pretty much the same as every other car.

<dd>Hi Chris. What Tom is saying above is precisely the reason why I removed this section. Gasoline passenger car engines have a thermal effiency of roughly 33%, which means all of them only convert about one third of the energy of the fuel to mechanical power and the rest is turned into heat. So basically if you filter out the marketing lingo from this statement, you're left with "The Veyron's gasoline engine works just like a gasoline engine.", which isn't particularly noteworthy. ;) Bal00 06:09, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Can we get a confirmation that <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Bugatti-EB-16-4-Veyron-interior-dash-brown-1280x960.jpg" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Bugatti-EB-16-4-Veyron-interior-dash-brown-1280x960.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Bugatti-EB-16-4-Veyron-interior-dash-brown-1280x960.jpg</a> is a Veyron interior? I'm seeing an odd lack of paddle shifters, and a manual shifter with shift lines on it. Also, many features look far more different than being just custom.</p>
<p>Agreed. The TOP GEAR show, had a different interior if Im not wrong....</p>

<p>The aero drag force required is defined by 1/2 * Cd * A *rho*v^2</p>
<p>The aero power is aero force *velocity, ie 1/2 * Cd * A *rho*v^3</p>
<p>OK?</p>

<dd>That's right. Therefore, "aerodynamic drag increases as the cube of the speed" is incorrect. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>W need to protect this article to keep away vandalizers. Even though some of the anonymous users don't vandalize this article, we still need to keep it protected. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessional_Gamer_adf7.html" title="User:Professional Gamer">Professional Gamer</a> 13:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe the level of vandalism on this article is way too low to justify protection. It did have a rough couple of days back when reports of that accident came out, but that's largely died down and now we have a very manageable level of vandalism. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. However, in this case, there are not too many anonymous users vandalizing the page, and so it does not need to be protected. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
