<p>--&gt; Do you know how ridiculous this is? What do you mean "Please do not report bugs" as the first sentence of a page entitled "Bug reports"?</p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to direct users to Sourceforge, where you can report bugs. The first paragraph of <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_reports_020d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bug reports">Wikipedia:Bug reports</a> contains a link to Sourceforge's bug reports page, where you can report a bug. Hence, the sentence is there because you report bugs at Sourceforge, not here. LuckyWizard</p>
<p>I am posting this here to express my annoyance. I have <b>no idea</b> what SourceForge is and so I don't <b>want</b> to access it. What is the purpose of this page? What is the "correct" procedure if you <b>think</b> something is not working properly? I posted a question about the incomplete "list of links" at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html#List_of_links" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village pump</a>, and there someone said we might/should report this as a bug.

<dd>Sourceforge is a website where people can upload open-source software for download by others. The software that powers Wikipedia is open-source, and is on Sourceforge. For each open-source project on Sourceforge, Sourceforge provides an online message board for people to post bug reports, and Wikipedia's bug reports forum on Sourceforge is linked in the first paragraph of <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_reports_020d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bug reports">Wikipedia:Bug reports</a>.

<dd>Thanks very much. I still don't understand <b>why</b> this can't be done <b>here</b> (and then transferred to wherever by a knowledgeable developer), but then it would probably be far too tiresome anyway for little old me to try and understand everything.

<dd>Actually, Angela, it's not quite that simple: their site certainly encourages creation of an account, for which the interface is lousy and which requires a confirmation process that they say can take up to 24 hours. That's a long time for someone to get an account that lets them report a bug. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 22:15, Jun 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But setting up a user account offers basically <b>no</b> additional features anyway (no, really, the interface to the tracker is that bad even <i>after</i> you log in) - so you can happily submit a bug as an anon. The only thing you don't get is automatic e-mails when someone comments on it - but you don't get that on a wiki-page either, and before someone mentions the watchlist, that would be useless unless there was a separate page for every single bug and feature request. I'm no great fan of sourceforge - in fact, the first feature request I filed with my account was against there own bug tracker! - but I can definitely see the need to deal with bugs in one place, and with appropriate "meta-information". So, if sourceforge is where it's at, sourcforge is where it'll be at! - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 19:09, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SourceForge might like you to log in, but there is absolutely no requirement to do so. The most useful thing is to add your user name in the comment box so you can be contacted for further details by a developer if required. Not logging in does make it harder for you to know if there was any follow up to the report, but the aim is to get the bugs fixed, not to make it easy for non-developers to follow the progress of them. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 17:55, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I've found a bug, or maybe it's intentional behaviour? The <i>My Watchlist</i> page seems to display only the most recent change on each page. In other words, if somebody (or even two different people) make two changes to a page, only the most recent shows up. This is slightly irritating, especially when the diff shows changes to text I didn't even know existed on that page...</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to say is that the SourceForge pages are very Opera-6.05-unfriendly. I cannot stay logged in, and thus I cannot report this bug there.

<p>As everbody knows, wikipedia bug reports is a reference to the SourceForge, in other words: "if you don't get a SourceForge account and put your feature requests there, nobody will see them". It's not the first time. I really have a problem with that attitude -- Wikipedia is a community, and I really would like to see a place inside Wikipedia where the community and the developers can communicate. I'd like to know if I'm the only one who is frustrated by this attitude, or if there are others ... -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a> 23:33, Aug 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>...I think, this serves as some kind of "filter". If someone has a really burning issue, he will poste it to SourceForge, otherwise it is not important enough. So the developer get only the "real important" issues. I also would like a more Wikipedia-centric approach (same for MAilinglists), but it is the current way it works. Don't get frustrated by this. If you have a really good Idea how to improve this situation, please start with it. But filters are not always just bad&#160;;-) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantasy_73a8.html" title="User:Fantasy">Fantasy</a> 14:04, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should submit bug reports and feature requests in the manner that the developers wish us to submit them, out of sheer gratitude for all the hard work they put in, developing Wikipedia. Currently that's SourceForge, and not the village pump. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 11:57, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, you don't need to create a SourceForge account, you can submit bug reports without logging in. You're less likely to receive feedback that way, though; you'll automatically get e-mail on updates if you submit the report logged in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason we use the bug tracker there at all is from experience; it's very <i>very</i> hard to keep track of bugs on a wiki page. Old reports get <i>completely</i> lost, forgotten, shoved away, or deleted on an ever-growing wiki bug page, while in the bug tracker they stay there, pointing blaming fingers at us developers forever until someone finally fixes them. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 18:30, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The problem with this is that problem reports really belong in the Meta, not in the English Wikipedia. Few if any of the problems are specific to English Wikipedia. Having said that, it's a reasonable request, because many Wikipedians don't have Meta signons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MediaWiki software problems belong on Sourceforge. There are two reasons that this isn't an adequate problem management strategy in the long term. Firstly, many genuine problems aren't with the MediaWiki software at all, but with things like skins, database corruption, SQUID configuration or the like. Secondly, Sourceforge is a bit daunting for first time users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But anywhere on the Wikipedia site, be it in the Meta or the English Wikipedia, is a poor solution for two reasons. Firstly, the very time it's most important to have the problem management site available is the time that the WIkipedia site is having troubles and may not be usable. Secondly, even if the site is usable, the added stress of logging the problems is exactly what we don't want when the site is under stress already.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As an interim solution, I'd strongly support an English Wikipedia project namespace page. We would need to have a team dedicated to doing first level problem determination of problems raised on this page, and raising the problems on the Meta or on Sourceforge as appropriate, for it to work. To do this we'd also need to design the system so that a minimum of cleaning up and reporting back was necessary. It will only be possible to attract these people if the system is good enough that it saves them more time than it takes, a reasonable ask surely. For reporting back, normally only a link would be required. People without Meta signons and without Sourceforge experience can easily read pages there if they are provided with proper hyperlinks.</dd>

However, these two Meta pages total 345 MB, so the pages are very difficult to edit, and quite unlikely to be read. Bugs reported only on the village pump are increasingly likely to be ignored as the page is archived every few days and such reports are just removed. Bugs reported in the Wikipedia namespace will lead to pages that are too large for many users to edit, as shown by pages such as <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/bugs" class="extiw" title="m:bugs">m:bugs</a>. If you think it is possible to use a wiki page for this, try looking at those pages on meta - it clearly isn't working. I can't see why it would work any better on this site than it does on meta. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 00:47, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the sourceforge link for reporting bugs; is this link actually listed anywhere in the 'pedia? I think it needs to be made more obviously available. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Graham ☺</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">Talk</a> 01:02, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where one bug is dependent on another, should I transfer my votes to the "next" bug up the line? Or are the dependencies taken into account by the coders when sorting out their priorities? (BTW, the bugs I'm talking about are <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60" rel="nofollow">60</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80" rel="nofollow">80</a>) -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 02:39, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think they really take votes that seriously, so it's probably best not to worry about it to much. Voting for a bug is just an easy way to track the progress on it because you can then set it to send you update emails. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:45, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angela said about a year and a half ago that it was possible to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411192" class="external text" title="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=34373&amp;atid=411192" rel="nofollow">submit bugs without logging in</a>. Well, when I go there it points me to go to <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/enter_bug.cgi" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/enter_bug.cgi" rel="nofollow">the new place to submit bugs</a>. And when I go there, it tells me "I need a legitimate login and password to continue."</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that right clicking to edit a section isn't working, at least not on firefox. If someone would be so kind as to submit this bug for me I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>I propose to create a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_report_a490.html" title="Wikipedia:Bug report">Wikipedia:bug report</a> page. It will be user-friendly, and I will keep it on my watchlist. I am a professional software developer, I have managed a help desk, and I currently do coordination and technical support for a living. I can make this work, both for the benefit of users (who desperately need help when the software messes them up) and for developers (who need detailed, properly formatted reports for clarity).</p>
<p>Most users cannot submit a bug report. That is <b>never</b> going to change. Someone has to do it for them. So let's help them. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:26, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is definetly not average user-friendly. Somebody should explain step by step how to submit bugs, and especially how to make feature requests - after all it is counterintuitive to make feature requests at something called 'bugzilla'. I wanted to make a feature request, but honestly I am not sure were to do it (bugzilla? wikitech-I mailing list? somewhere else?).--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:23, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
