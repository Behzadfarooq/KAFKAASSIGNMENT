Whenever I click on on the button edit this page a pop up comes up. it asks to me download a file and when i download and open, it opens in internet explorer. following is the content that I can see.

<p>However I can edit anything which has some option of edit in the page. I have upgraded my internet explorer and have tried using it on other computers also but facing the same issues.

<p>I've tried editing the entry for Disscociation and it jumped to editing the Useful References section. When I changed the link from "section=1" to "section=0", I was able to edit the right section, so it's the link that's wrong.</p>
<p>I've experienced the situation where clicking on a section "edit link", edits wrong section. See for example <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_Subpage_13_60a3.html" title="User:Paul August/Subpage 13">this page</a>. It has three "sections", the first section being a table. Clicking on the first "section edit link" for the table brings up an edit window for "section two", clicking on the second "section edit link" brings up an edit window for "section three", clicking on the third "section edit link" brings up a blank edit window. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> June 29, 2005 16:06 (UTC)</p>

<p>-Addition: I agree! For many of the sections, there is no edit button and the closest one if the one for the seciton below. The design of the edit buttons is POOR and their location should be changed so that they are indusive to what section they are for. In additon, first sections NEVER have an edit button, making it difficult for users who don't know to change the section number to 0 to edit the section at all.</p>
<p>The [Edit] link that appears at the bottom-right of each section (as distinct from the "Edit this page" tab at the top of each page) has the incorrect URL. The ...&amp;section=NN variable in the URL appears to require a zero-based number, not 1-based as it currently is. When I click on a section to edit it I end up editing the _following_ section. It's impossible to edit the first section without hand-editing the URL. I am using Firefox v1.0 on Linux.</p>

<dd>I think I have seen a related problem -- somebody edited <a href="../../../m/b/t/MBTA_accessibility_a616.html" title="MBTA accessibility">MBTA accessibility</a> on 05:14, 13 November 2005 68.160.178.62, intending to add "Subway and commuter rail - Reconstruction of State Street has started", but this resulted in truncation of several sections below that, including the Red Line subsection of Subway and commuter rail. I found that if you attempt to edit the previous revision (02:34, 10 November 2005 134.174.110.5) as the whole article (and this is the version that user 68.160.178.62 would have been editing from), the deleted content is already missing in the Edit window. (And the article is long enough that if you really just wanted to edit something in the middle, you might easily not notice.) I had to go to the revision before that (02:33, 10 November 2005 134.174.110.5) to avoid this problem. Something in the 02:34, 10 November 2005 134.174.110.5 revision causes the editor to mess up, but I can't think of what it would be, since both that revision and the previous one are ones that I edited, and the only change between them was to add a note about elevators being out of service. I plan to create an account and report this on MediaZilla. 134.174.110.5 18:00, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried to create a new account. It said that there were too many new account requests and that no new accounts were being processed at the present time. That's lame. I came back every once in a while to try again. Finally, the message changed: It told me I had created more than 10 accounts and was being blocked, temporarily, from creating any more. <b>I never succeeded at creating <i>any</i> accounts.</b> I think I tried maybe three user names in total, none of them were created, I can't log in as any of them, and now I can't create an account.</p>
<p>I suppose this goes to the root problem of Wiki's: They're too easy to vandalize. As a result, you've had to put in some sort of security, but you put in place mechanisms that are subject to denial-of-service attacks and, in the end, locked out legitimate users (or would-be users).</p>
<dl>
<dd>This probably lies in the fact that account creation from the same IP is limited to a fixed number per day/week/month. This prevents vandalism by bots, but also prevents some people on shared IPs and at schools to register at all. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 19:11, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This multiple log in requirement is a real pain. It appears from this section that the issue of having to log in to virtually every page has been persistant for quite some time. Many of the other bugs reported above, such as "loss of watch list data" is directly related to this log in problem. Please move this bug up on your priority list. I would normally sign and date this input with my log in name (David.c.h); however as I am once again on a "Create account / Log in)" page even after logging in on three other pages I will just sign this with "--67.160.66.59 16:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)"</li>

<b>Summary:</b> Multiple log-in and edit-submit problems!</p>
<p><b>Details:</b> First, I noticed that when clicking on "submit," I am re-directed to a web page that says I must be logged in to modify my watchlist. I WAS logged in!! However, even AFTER I logged in and started surfing in en.Wikipedia.org, I was later directed to pages that still had the "log in" link -as if I were not logged in. Now, I did look to see if my bugs were reported, and I admit that I saw other bug reports for the latter problem (showing the log-in link even after logging in), however, I saw absolutely no other bug reports that showed a problem like my initial problem, which, after I submitted an edit, then redirected me to a page that asked me to log in. Oh, one other problem: Even AFTER I submit an edit when logged in, sometimes I see where I was not logged in -in other words, it displays my IP address instead of my User name, <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWatts_0d94.html" title="User:GordonWatts">User:GordonWatts</a> (en.Wilipedia.org) <i><b>That is, the software says I am not logged in even when I am.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b> 1. Only sometimes when I submit an edit am I redirected to the page that says I must be logged in to modify watchlist. 2. Only sometimes are my edits shown as IP addresses, but other times, it shows my user name -if I submit it real quick. (Indicates I log out real fast!) 3. EVERY time when I log in and then navigate it asks me to log in again. (This is apparently reproducible.)</p>
<p><b>Actual Results:</b> Numbers 1 and 2 sometimes work as expected. #3 has messed up every time (I only checked 2 or 3 times, I think.)</p>
<p><b>Expected Results:</b> 1. It should not redirect me to funny pages regarding my watchlist (whether or not I'm logged in) if I submit an edit. 2. When I submit an edit, it should show <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordonWatts_0d94.html" title="User:GordonWatts">User:GordonWatts</a> 3. After I navigate, it should indicate I am logged IN, not LOGGED OUT! PS: Sorry for shouting; I get a little frustrated here, no offense intended.</p>
<p><b>Additional Information:</b> I am Gordon Wayne Watts, en.Wikipedia, User:GordonWatts, formerly known as UserGordonWattsDotCom, who got his user name changes to be less self-promoting, lol.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I accidentally submitted this to the Bugzilla of the Mozilla Foundation, not of Wikipedia, but their email directed me here. I think the problem went away on its own (did I have a hard time holding current cookies?), but I shall report it all the same.</p>

<li>I'm actually having a similar problem: I can log in and go to look at my watchlist, or edit a page, and I'm no longer logged in. That is, even if I <i>immediately</i> click on watchlist, I am redirected to a page saying user:&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt; has no watchlist. If I edit a page, the edit is recorded as having been done by &lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;. The only way to prevent this is if I log in, immediately go into my preferences, and select the box next to "Remember across sessions" and save. This happens every time I log into Wikipedia now though it did not used to happen a month ago. No browser, filewall, or internet setting have changed. <font color="#6D603B">semiconscious</font> (<a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemiconscious_7225.html" title="User talk:Semiconscious"><font color="#6D603B"><small>talk</small></font></a> · <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~btvoytek" class="external text" title="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~btvoytek" rel="nofollow"><font color="#6D603B"><small>home</small></font></a>) 22:16, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I logged into Wikipedia and keep getting logged off without me doing it. All of a sudden, I notice I'm "logged off", usually because the "minor change" box isn't there when I edit something.

<p>Can a programmer help me with this? Vowel diacritics with carons (such as ǔ, as in the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">pinyin</a> article) are showing up for me when viewing WP pages as empty square boxes. However, on an edit screen I can see them fine, and on other websites like <a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/read.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/read.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/read.shtml</a> I can also see them fine. If I use a Unicode command, like this: {{Unicode|ǔ}} (shows up like this: <span class="Unicode">ǔ</span>), I can also see it fine. This tells me that there's something different/wrong with the way WP has its display set up, at least for Internet Explorer. I am using IE 6.0 and have my encoding set to Unicode UTF-8. I've asked about this on <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">pinyin</a> but received no real help after a few months' time.

<dt>An edit conflict resulted in the merging of two posts. Thus vandalism seemed to originate from another editor.</dt>

<p>Probably at the same time that I posted a comment to a Talk page, another, anonimous editor posted an insulting comment to a third editor who he identified with his real name, in violation with Wikipedia rules... and the two posts became one with my name on it! Happily the other removed it soon after, but this is a very serious flaw. It may be related to me editing the whole page, while the other editor edited a section: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Henri_Poincar%C3%A9&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35681281" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Henri_Poincar%C3%A9&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35681281" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Henri_Poincar%C3%A9&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35681281</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 17:23, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice some users on Wiki have full names like 'John Edwards' where the first letter of both names are capitalized. But when you create a new user, it seems to auto-capitalize your first letter only such as 'John edwards' - this seems like a bug to me. I now have a profile which I would like to interlink with some other wiki pages, but I don't like how my name is displayed, it's incorrect, with the 1st letter of my surname in lowercase.</p>

</dl>
<p>Addendum from user forestie January 24th, 2006: the problem seems a bit more severe, since I have first created an account using the english version from Wikipedia, (username: forestie) and this account works, but when I am logged, reading an article and I want to switch to french (my mother tongue), I can actually read the corresponding article in french but I am automatically disconnected from my session. If I try to login directly in the french version of Wikipedia, I cannot, since I correctly enter 'forestie' as my username, along with my password, but the system insists on telling me that the user 'Forestie' (notice the first capital) does not exist. So I am completely unable to login in the french Wikipedia!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The simpler issue first; we will not be providing a feature for users to delete their own accounts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To the first point; usernames must be valid titles too, and the same check is used when normalising both. As a result, we force the first letter to be capitalised, but don't touch the rest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To the third; at present, you need to create an account in each wiki; we don't yet have a single sign-on mechanism in place, although it is being worked on. I've queried the database, and the user <i>Forestie</i> doesn't exist on the French Wikipedia at present. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">talk</a>) 01:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not sure how hard it would be in the MediaWiki environment, but what about rendering email addresses as images if ImageMagick is present? There is more info here: <a href="http://www.spsu.edu/cs/faculty/bbrown/papers/web_and_email.html" class="external free" title="http://www.spsu.edu/cs/faculty/bbrown/papers/web_and_email.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spsu.edu/cs/faculty/bbrown/papers/web_and_email.html</a>
<ul>
<li>It would probably be relatively easy to generate an image (either on the fly or when the message is saved) out of an e-mail adress. However that would force people to write it off manualy if they actualy want to send an e-mail. Personaly I use a slightly obscurified JavaScript to "cloak" my e-mail adress. In a browser with JavaScript eneabled the mailto: link looks just like any other, but for a webcrawler looking for mailto: links in the source there won't be any. A very "smart" crawler could naturaly run the script or figure it out some other way, but then again a boot could be using an OCR plugin to "read" text in images too. Granted JavaScript can be turned off, but then so can images. In this case though the "best" solutiuon might be to simply use the same technique used in the Wikipedia itself. Hide users e-mail adress, and have people use an on-site web form to "relay" e-mails to each other. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> 4 July 2005 14:24 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I, myself, refuse to do any sort of munging, obscuring, or other obfuscation of e-mail addresses on any site I maintain or any posting I make to online forums, newsgroups, and the like, even though this results in my getting tons of spam. I have both philosophical and aesthetic objections to the whole concept of intentionally rendering information either incorrect or inaccessible; all of the various techniques used in that area do some combination of making the address less accessible (e.g., not working without scripting or images enabled, not copy-and-paste-able, requiring manual editing or retyping), not technically correct (as when it's "munged" by adding bogus crap in the middle), or ugly and jarring (as when it's in a graphic in a font that differs from the user's configuration for normal text display). Even the commonplace tactic of spelling out addresses like "blah at foo dot com" looks ugly and silly to me. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> July 4, 2005 15:28 (UTC)

<li>Point is, there's no real need to show those E-mail addresses in Bugzilla.

<li>Despite the recieved wisdom, I am not sure that having a publically available email address on the internet actually leads to spam. I say this as somebody with a couple of email addresses that have been languishing unmolested in the www-accessable wilds for several years. Now answering spam mails- thats a different matter altogether!!--<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergie_42a9.html" title="User:Fergie">Fergie</a> 17:38, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It would force people to type it manually? Require manual retyping? Are you kidding?? Please tell me you're joking. If someone doesn't want to type a few characters, they don't really want to email me. If anyone is unwilling to type a few characters to reach me, then let's just say I don't hold out great hope for the message they would send if they did. You would have done better to point out that an image is not accessible to the visually impaired. And, Fergie, I can only assume your email is protected by world-class spam-fighting software. I never respond to spam, but I've got an address that gets dozens of spams a day.

<p>It's a performance and difficulty of editing bug when the edit conflict page unnecessarily includes the entire page being edited when it probably can, in most if not all cases, include just the sub section that was trying to be edited (assuming a new sub section wasn't created). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 14:10, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mediawiki software is more than sufficient for handling bug reports if it can handle an encyclopedia. Some record of bugs that affect Wikipedia users should be listed on Wikipedia because of: searchability, in case the bug is specific to Wikipedia, to decrease layers of indirection (hoops users have to jump through), to gauge how many people are affected by the bug to possibly fix it before the Mediawiki developers get around to it, to have a bug status page so all users know it has been reported (without having to go venture off and search another site). Other people have noted the fact that bugzilla gives away your email address which separately isn't good. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 01:51, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure if this is a bug, but I googled an article Sir Robert Bell, and the result returned was the article and the second result was a posting from user Talk: Cambridge Bay Weather? Is wiki user talk supposed to be posted on the search engines? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sir+robert+bell" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sir+robert+bell" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sir+robert+bell</a>, I respectfully ask if you could look in to this.

<dd>Google indexes most of Wikipedia; it ignores the parts we tell it not to, such as those in our <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robots.txt.html" title="Robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request to add another bar, under the languages bar</span></h2>
<p>I have had a discussion about nav boxes. I want them and a admin with a bot have been removing them, in the discussion that followed I came up with the idea of having relevant articles in a list in the left most column below the "in other languages" box, I see that it is possible to make a template that contains other language links and if that template is used on a page, that page will get the languages, so now I wonder if there is anyway that we can implement a new box in the left hand column which would contain navigational links. Then make a template that contains the info for these links and therefore add the template to a many pages and get the all the same links in the box (preferable exluding the page itself&#160;:-) ). What I want this for is that each shark article should have links to all other shark articles but if we look at the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigational_templates.html" title="Navigational templates">Navigational_templates</a> there seams to be a lot other examples also. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefan_3752.html" title="User:Stefan">Stefan</a> 13:34, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><i>editintro=</i> should display when editing existing pages</span></h2>
<p>Using links, it is now possible to create links such as this one:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/Humanities&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/How%20to%20ask" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/Humanities&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/How%20to%20ask" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which allow one to add a new section to a page. Unfortunately, it only works partly: the <i>editintro</i> is useless in links to edit existing pages. In fact, the above link should use <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_How_to_ask_5182.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/How to ask">Wikipedia:Reference desk/How to ask</a> as an explanatory text above the edit box, but it does not. The same link <i>does work</i> if it points to a nonexistant page:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiwikiwiki:Rufus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/How%20to%20ask" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiwikiwiki:Rufus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Wikipedia:Reference%20desk/How%20to%20ask" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<dd>Bump. As far as I see it, my request is quite simple, and should be relatively easy to implement. Could someone please help or direct me to someone who can?</dd>
<dd>Following a redlink leads to an edit window, headed with <a href="../../../n/o/a/MediaWiki%7ENoarticletext_56e7.html" title="MediaWiki:Noarticletext">MediaWiki:Noarticletext</a>, while editing an existing page has no header. I'm requestion that the system be expanded so that even existing pages can be headed, so that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Ant" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;editintro=Ant" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> would show the Ant article as a header, above the edit field.</dd>
<dd>This way, the Reference Desk and Help desk can be streamlined, as I mentioned before. It might also be useful for other pages, such as semiprotected pages. Some pages currently contain commented-out warning text, so that any editor must read it. Perhaps what I am proposing could make that work-around unnecessary.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reduce vandalism: New layer of editors: mature/immature</span></h2>
<p>There is a bug in the viewing of articles (missing feature) which makes the wikipedia particularly prone to spam and deliberate vandalisation.</p>
<p>It seems to me the strength of the wikipedia is the editors. Particularly the well established editors with many good edits.</p>
<p>The other strength of the wikipedia is the users (these are people who aren't logged in). These make the wikipedia useful, and attract new editors to the wiki. These users need to see <i>well established article versions</i>, that have had a chance to be viewed and corrected by editors, and repaired as appropriate.</p>
<p>The main problem we have is low-edit editors. These users tend to 'test edit'/vandalise the wikipedia and this appears immediately to the users; but many of them also do good edits.</p>
<p>We need a mechanism for stopping the edits from low-edit editors from immediately appearing to the users.</p>
<p>My suggestion is an ad-hoc review process in keeping with the current 'esprit d'wikipedia'</p>
<p>I think that the wikipedia should follow the following rules:</p>
<p><b>An 'immature editor' is defined as any editor that has made less than 200 edits. A mature editor has made 200 or more.</b></p>
<p><b>No raw edit from an immature editor will be displayed within less than 1 day.</b> <i>(Exception: users at the same IP address will have the article displayed immediately to avoid confusion after edits); also changelists and editing is unaffected.</i></p>
<p><b>Modification within a day by another immature user resets the counter, and the article will only time out after another day</b> <i>The article displayed will be the newest article that has not been edited for a whole day, or has been edited by a mature user, or has been edited by the same IP address as the viewer. This rule can theoretically mean that a new edit never becomes visible, but in practice this will rarely happen, and the next rule helps avoid it anyway.</i></p>
<p><b>Modification of the article by a mature user makes the article immediately visible.</b> <i>This can make immature users edits visible- clearly the mature users are supposed to check to make sure that any previous edits are appropriate... the wiki software could help by pointing out if there had been recent changes...</i></p>
<p><b>Any mature editor caught making inappropriate edits has their account locked out.</b> <i>They have to start from scratch, this means that at most 0.5% of editors edits are bogus, even if an editor is a rogue.</i></p>
<p>Ok, my view is that these rules are not absolutely perfect, there's probably no such thing as perfect rules, but they are enormously better than what we have at the moment.</p>
<p>Note that these rules may seem computationally expensive to implement. However, they really aren't. Only a comparative small number of articles have been edited in the last day or so, and a list can be kept of these, and which version should be showed to the user. The rest of the articles in the wikipedia work the normal way during viewing.</p>
<p>The relatively expensive calculation only needs to be done during an edit, and the exception list is self cleaning since entries time out automatically from the list unless updated by an edit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">Wolfkeeper</a> (<a href="../../../w/o/l/User_talk%7EWolfkeeper_c846.html" title="User talk:Wolfkeeper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wolfkeeper_f5e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wolfkeeper">contribs</a>) 08:51, 17 December 2005.</small></p>

<li>Interesting idea. I think it might get more attention as a policy discussion <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Policies</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for a spell checker</span></h2>
<p>Would be nice if the editing tool offered a basic spell check facility - I usually end up copying and pasting any text back and forth from another editor just to check spelling. I'm actually surprised how good the spelling generally is throughout wikipedia (given how atrocious it is across much of the Internet!), and this feature would surely help to maintain and even improve that standard.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizofaus_3599.html" title="User:Wizofaus">Wizofaus</a> 23:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
