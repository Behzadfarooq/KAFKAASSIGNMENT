<p>Should the fact that many BB cartoons are not seen anymore due to their stereotypes against races and the disabled be mentioned (e.g. the ones with black characters having giant lips and speaking in stereotyped black "dialect" or the one with "Fruitcake Sanitorium - "We are full of nuts!)</p>

<dd>I suppose we can hope that temporal/regional taboos against racial humour, sexual-orientation humour, violence, bad grammar, etc, will eventually themselves just be footnotes in the Wikipedia and that classic art will prevail in the end. I'm sure Michelangelo's David is taboo in many places/times too. But putting our own (US, 2002) bias on the record is just that: bias on the record. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteverapaport_8edf.html" title="User:Steverapaport">Steverapaport</a></dd>

<p>Derogatory humour is the kind that has seen things like some Loony Tunes cartoons banned - are you advocating that kind of humour?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't a matter of advocacy, but of discussion from an <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. "Coal Black and de Sebbin Dwarfs" is a brilliant cartoon, one of the greatest shorts ever filmed, but it is not acceptable to mass audiences today because of the racial stereotyping, although still available on compilations. Much humor (some of the best) is derogatory, unpleasant, grating, and appeals to prejudices. In our "enlightened" times, only blondes and white southerners can be made fun of. Since I am the latter and married to the former, I notice this, but in truly enlightened times, we could make fun of everybody. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></dd>

<dd>No need to apologize. Bugs Bunny was not a particularly nice character. He might have been <i>funny</i>, but he was never a model for my behavior. I think of him as a relic of World War II. He displayed a kind of bravado that may have been useful in the face of the enemy, but no one should act like that in civilian life. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's a tough question, so I won't give a flip answer. I agree with Ortolan that everyone has to be able to laugh at themselves, and it seems to be a fact of life that most humour is at someone's expense, so "advocating" banning all humour that is derogatory to someone is just not gonna work, and tends to be counterproductive since we end up with political-correctness police.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, if some group is truly being continuously persecuted by people who don't even realize they're doing it, and humour is a large part of that, then we need to sit up and notice. This happened, for example, in Victorian England, where it was perfectly acceptable to make fun of 'wogs' and 'niggers' (and later 'suffragettes').</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Usually offensive humour is the effect, rather than the cause, of social injustice. But in the Victorian England a good case could be made for the reverse. The problem was that it was possible to laugh off any attempts for these groups to be taken seriously. If we're similarly <i>really</i> hurting some people, we should be forced to notice it. But banning all offensive humour isn't the way. Perhaps just noticing it and wondering publicly if it's harmful to someone is the middle path... --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteverapaport_8edf.html" title="User:Steverapaport">Steve Rapaport</a></dd>

Firstly a personal note so that you might contextualise my highly personal comments: I experience pejudice on a regular basis because of my personal apperance. This is in Toronto, Canada (the most successful enthicly diverse city in North America. It could easily be about race and sometimes has; its about something different.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that Bugs Bunny is a working actor whose greatest body of work occured during the Studio System years. Many of the most popular entertainment are an embarassment to watch. I think of Public Enemy and their pointed commentary in <i>Burn, Hollywood,Burn</i>.</p>
<p>Many of the racisms so flagrantly shown in Warner Brothers films continue to exist. Do you know what social class and ethnic group Elmer Fudd played early in his career? He wasn't always "Elmer Fudd, millionaire: I own a mansion and a yachat." He's not a walking talking racial slur anymore but it is little more than a stereotype (yes I know its a funny cartoon: Elmer becomes "shell shocked" from his war with Bugs. People with visible psycheatric disturbance receive more prejudice than any other group.) I was distained and tarred with detractions on Elmer's original Ethno-social group <b>inprobable as it sounds here in the Wikipedia</b>. I will provide full details in any forum that Ed Poor specifies. This occured with the full knowledge and approval of a sysop: I will provide full disclosure in forum of the wikipedia even a mailing list. I have no desire for vengance: the value of the future out weighes the value of the past. The commmunity, must however prove itself a community, by restoring adherance to the Wikipedian Ethos and <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. To find directed ethnic slurs <b>spewwed</b>in cyberspace is completely repugnant.</p>
<p>I took Bugs as one role model and am damn proud of the person I became. (even if it might be unbecoming&#160;:-]. I find inspiration in Bugs' genius. Lockdown Sv Rule.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwo16_910c.html" title="User:Two16">User:Two16</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I too am from Toronto, and would be happy to claim Bugs as a role model. And I see little or no racism in Bugs himself! (Although he's pretty contemptuous of stupid folks.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm curious what social class and ethnic group Elmer stereotypes, though... I don't see many height-challenged, mentally-challenged, speech-impaired white guys with guns wandering around in Toronto "hunting wabbits"... &#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also curious what you mean by "Elmer's original Ethno-social group" and the implications that he once was a "walking talking racial slur". Elmer Fudd has always been caucasian. Elmer Fudd evolved out of a lesser-known (but still caucasian!) Tex Avery character called "Egghead" in the 30s. His first few cartoons as the Elmer Fudd we know today were as a hunter and as a nature photographer. Are you sure you're not confusing Bugs' antagonist (the Stepin Fetchitt caricature) in "All This And Rabbit Stew" with Elmer Fudd? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_schiller_6670.html" title="User:Jeff schiller">Jeff schiller</a> 06:52, 2004 Nov 8 (UTC)</dd>

Please remember this is an encyclopedia for everyone not just for you&#160;:-P Although I would agree Buzz Bunny looks nothing like Bugs Bunny the fact remains he was the 'inspiration' for Buzz Bunny as stated by the creators and Warner Bros and is also called by them the successor of Bugs Bunny therefore mention of this needs to remain. Feel free to move it someother place if you feel the location is unsuitable or reword it or even add a bit of discussion about how little Buzz Bunny looks like Bugs Bunny but please DO NO remove Buzz Bunny altogether. Whether you (and I) like it or not, the Buzz Bunny is related to Bugs Bunny and given their connection needs to be mentioned.

<p>I remember read somewhere: "There are many veriaties of different types of animals in real life, but even more-so in animation;" thus, Bugs could be a type of rabbit that doesn't even exist outside of cartoons and still be a rabbit. So long as he's funny, what does it matter?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first appearance is listed as 'A Wild Hare', although there are also episode titles using rabbit. Elmer Fudd is always "hunting wabbit" but we can't really expect him to get anything right. Personally I prefer hare... someone must know! 88.107.7.168 05:38, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember as a kid Bugs crossdressing as a female bunny rabbit and sometimes getting involved with Elmer Fudd. Maybe I'm reading into this a bit too much but could this be a manifestation of a complex issue of LGBT issues in a repressed closeted America in the 1940-1960's era?</p>
<p>I'm not the first to argue this and I remember being exposed to this argument as a kid when watching Rush Limbaugh saying that this theme was hogwash. I tend to disagree...I think that they just don't want to tarnish (or concede LGBT influences) in the creation of an important piece of Americana.</p>
<p>What do you fellow Wikipedians tend to think of the matter? Bugs in drag innocent or something more Freudian underneath (genderbending/bestiality)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're reading just a bit too much into it. Crossdressing was a typical comedy stand-by during the first half of the twentieth century. Bugs' crossdressing isn't meant to do anything but make people laugh; he's not representing the suppressed sexualities of Hollywood (because if he did, so would <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groucho_Marx_8301.html" title="Groucho Marx">Groucho Marx</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Laurel_5068.html" title="Stan Laurel">Stan Laurel</a>, and several other classic comedians well-known for dressing in drag). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 12:04, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm gay, and I tend to agree. Bugs cross-dressing has to be seen in its historical context, which is akin to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Some_Like_It_Hot_12fd.html" title="Some Like It Hot">Some Like It Hot</a> and its drag scene. I imagine that to its juvenile fans, Bugs would probably be seen as playing 'dress up,' without the connotations that adults attach to it. As for current connotations, he is still a he, and never sustains his cross-dressing, which suggests that he is not transgendered per se. User Calibanu 14:09, 11 June 2006.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but that whole paragraph is a bit off.

<p>Bugs bunny is my idol. There isn't another cartoon that even matches up to bugs bunny. What i find completely revulting is the fact that people think they can bring bugsy back to life with new CRAPY versions. It is a disgrace to the bugs bunny name. Some people might like the new “movies”, but if they truly new bugs bunny they would say “ OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?” The back in action movie … crap .

<p>{Posted by JS on December 4, 2006}---For a good, well-research account of Bugs' evolution, see Michael Barrier's <i>Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age</i>. Also, I have a question. In the printed version of the article that I printed out some time ago, it said, "Chuck Jones noted that the <i>Of course you realise this means war!</i> line was taken from Groucho Marx in the classic <i>Duck Soup</i>." I have seen Duck Soup several times, and I don't recall Groucho ever exactly saying that. (He does say, "Then it's war!" several times before the famous war sequence.) In fact, I think that only the ambassador and the officer say that in the film. However, Groucho does quip the line in <i>A Night at the Opera</i>. Am I right about this or am I, as Daffy Duck once sang, <i>working on a broken merry-go-round</i>?</p>
