<p>Hi Bugwit- I feel like <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo.html" title="Neo">Neo</a> approaching the Architect, if you get my reference!</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_D._Moore" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_D._Moore" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_D._Moore</a></p>
<p>I note from your Biog that you're a firm believer in rational discussion so maybe throw me a bone as to how this article could be maintained on my favourite (and now homepage) site that is Wikipedia? I have had the fortune of seeing several of Luke D. Moore's works premiered and they have inspired me greatly.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you. Mark Schroeder, Musical Director, Chester Symphonia</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark, first of all...I'm just another editor on Wikipedia, no different than you...no need to feel as though you're approaching the Architect, and I'll be happy to help in any way that I can. As I mentioned in my comments at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Luke_D._Moore_6e6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Luke D. Moore">Articles for Deletion discussion</a>, I believe that the article was written by Mr. Moore himself. Autobiographical articles are generally frowned-upon (typically for good reason) in Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> for more information). While being an autobiography is not in-and-of itself grounds for deletion, the fact that the article does not provide any assertions of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> aside from the collegiate award, and does not meet the criteria set forth in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If you wish to provide verifiable, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">unbiased</a> information to the article which establishes Mr. Moore's notability and <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">importance</a>, I'm open to changing my vote in the AfD discussion. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">grunt</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 19:04, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Bigwit,</p>
<p>Yesterday the Article for NameAction was erased once more, in spite of my changes, according to your guidance. Can you please explain me what can be happening? Can I re-create the Article? (Alpinoch) 200.27.54.213 22:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the article was put up for speedy deletion due to the fact that it was a repost of an article that had been previously deleted (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#G4" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD G4</a>) Unfortunately, due to the fact that the article was essentially the same article that was deleted previously, it did qualify for speedy deletion based on Wikipedia policies. I would recommend dropping a note on the talk page of the closing admin (<a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a>), and explaining the situation with the article. The problem is the fact that the company may not yet be notable enough to warrant its own article. If you can produce more information about the company which establishes its notability and importance, without sounding promotional, I would think that the article has a better chance of being kept. Let me know if I can do anything else to help. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">grunt</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 23:30, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You tagged the article <a href="../../../p/o/w/PowerPlan_Consultants_0c97.html" title="PowerPlan Consultants">PowerPlan Consultants</a> for deletion as advertising.

<ul>
<li>The article looks much better...the only thing I'd note is that there are no external references beyond the link to the company itself. Per notability criteria listed in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>: <i>"The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</i> I have done a quick Google search, but have been unable to find any such publications (there are several different companies with some variation of the name "PowerPlan Consultants"). The company website also does not appear to cite any such coverage. Without some other sources, or some other evidence of meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, I'm still not entirely convinced that the company meets notability standards, but I'll leave the article as is for now and try to give someone an opportunity to improve it. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">grunt</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 17:00, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Thank you for your concise, swift reply – much appreciated. First of all, let me say I fully appreciate your concerns, however, I believe you have misunderstood what Celebrities Worldwide and its sister company UPFRONT TV actually does. I've just discovered how useful these services are and it would be a real shame to deny Wikipedia visitors the chance to hear about them.</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide offers official contact information for celebrities. It's an amazing resource for anyone in the media or entertainment industry to make contact within seconds with the most direct point of contact for over 20,000 celebrities worldwide.</p>
<p>It's sister company UPFRONT TV is the celebrity booking service and the vast range of celebrities booked by UPFRONT is, I notice, detailed on www.celebritiesworldwide.com.</p>
<p>Both companies have had a key role in creating some of the most high profile events which have been extensively covered by the media and consequently have had a significant impact on popular culture, trend and style over many years. This has been and continues to be a major source of entertainment and fascination to the general public as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, I notice you have listings for “Nike”, “MacDonald’s” and “Wal-Mart” on Wikipedia whose content does not seem to differ greatly from the information I have provided on the above 2 services.</p>
<p>I trust you will reconsider.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<li>As I detailed in my previous response, the primary issue that I have with the article is its promotional tone. The point I was making regarding the use of the names of Tom Cruise and David Beckham is that I believe that the names were used in order to associate their names with the company, when in fact there is no evidence provided that either of them are actually associated with the company. The article should be written in with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> in order to avoid sounding like an advertisement. The comparison of this article to articles about <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> doesn't really help much. The articles are definitely not written in a promotional fashion. In fact, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a> articles contain quite a bit of information which is negative. These are giant companies that are clearly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. It would be very difficult to argue that the articles on these companies should be deleted due to the fact that articles such as Celebrities Worldwide have been proposed for deletion. Once again, you are perfectly welcome to remove the {{PROD}} tag if you feel that I am wrong on this issue (I am just another editor like yourself, not an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a>), but I don't believe that the article would survive in its current state if it were to go to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a>. You might want to take a look at some of the guidelines and policies I have mentioned (highlighted) to get a better feel for what should be included compared to what should not be included. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">Speak</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 17:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't quite understand why this page was marked for deletion; I compared it to the pages of a handful of other independent record labels and they all seem to follow a similar format. This label is certianly as legitmate (record sales, press, client list, etc.) as the other ones that are not marked for deletion, so I'm guessing that it is the format or the presentation that you don't like. Do you have any advice on what I can do to mold this entry more into your standards as we are most certainly a real buisness and we are not on here just to shamelessly promote ourselves and our artists.

<p>sorry about starting another subject; still trying to figure out the best way to communicate with you about this. Anyway, yes it is true that we are employees of the company but we're also interested wikipedia users; it is a group account for a few co-workers so we picked a group name that made sense. We still take wikis as seriously as anyone else, and we hope to continue to add entries (both related and unrelated to the record label). We edited down the biography to make it from a netural point of view (although; on a side note, isn't acceptable (or at least slightly acceptable) for an "official" biography to have a bit of a bias, as it is implied that by being the official biography it is the one provided by the label), and please let us know what else we can do. Granted the first two entries we made were related to our buisness but they were also well-intentioned and relevant. I feel that as a legitimate, successful record label on par with the other entires in the Independent Record Label category we should have our own wikipedia entry. Thanks -- Fenwayrecordings 20:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your edits to the article have helped, but I'll let the nomination stand. The article is a vanity piece, even though it was created in good faith, and unfortunately appears to be pretty much non-notable.

<li>The article is definitely better, but one of the issues I have with the article is that the link to one of your sources (MediaWeek) directs users to the current date's edition, rather than the 13 April 2001 edition that you have cited. The link doesn't hold much value if it doesn't actually go somewhere relevant to the article. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">Speak</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 15:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Bugwit, regarding my article on Inoffical military Marches. Your absoloutly right. It should be deleted. Although I made crossrefferences because I wanted to create an article on a phenonemon, not an event or ... thing itself. But in the end I must admit, that I should rather have gone to bed that night instead of starting to write on a subject that may be interesting at 4.a.m, but is not worth the effort to do a real (first) entrence.</p>

<p>Hi, Bugwit. Newbie here... Trying to add a page like this - sans polished marketing copy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Pete" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Pete" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Pete</a></p>
<p>...and would like to index it under this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces</a></p>
<p>However, I can't seem to find the starting point to add a new hot sauce/condiment to the list/page (above). Hence, the "new" article entry... Suggestions? Perhaps this is partially why you recommended that the article be deleted, too....?</p>
<p>Also, I'd appreciate any other feedback that you might have to offer. I will attempt a re-write (using the other brands mentioned on Wikipedia as a template) after you - hopefully - get me pointed to the right spot.</p>
<p>I also have a question: your feedback said "...Some of the people, places or things you have written about in the article Cackalacky Classic Condiment may not be sufficiently well-known to merit articles of their own." However, when compared within the context of the above condiment company examples on Wikipedia, Cackalacky Classic Condiments appear to be well within the norm of “notoriety.” (Cackalacky Classic Condiments have been featured nationally and internationally on Food Network, NBC, ABC, Comedy Central, OLN, Discovery Channel, PBS, Associated Press, Public Radio International, etc. - which, I imagine, far surpasses the "notability" of a few of the examples that are currently listed on Wikipedia) So, to be clear, was the rejection due to the “where” I was placing the article...(?) As opposed to, say, the entry of facts about a new condiment...? Make sense?</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; kindest regards,</p>
<p>CJ</p>
<p>PS I want to talk shop sometime, too! Have an '05 XLR...</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all...I'd be happy to talk shop <i><b>any</b></i> time. Secondly, you've addressed my concerns about the sauce with your comments here....if you can cite <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources regarding the sauce being featured on these major media outlets, then its definitely notable. That wasn't mentioned in the original, which made it look like you were only trying to promote the hot sauce. Just make sure to add those facts to the article, and cite your sources, and I think you'll be all set. (And as a fellow Tarheel, I'd actually like to see it included). There is the issue of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>, but if the sauce has been featured as you've said, that shouldn't be a problem. I'll remove the {{PROD}} template so it won't be deleted. (You could have done that too, its OK to contest a proposed deletion that way). --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">Speak</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 21:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There's more... But, this should be enough to let you know that we are legit - and somewhat notable - AT LEAST in the sauce community.&#160;:)</p>

<li>Hi, Bugwit. Ok, I beleive I have crafted a more "neutral" version of the for the Cackalacky sauce listing - sans hyperbole.&#160;:) Also added a few more reference links... After it is tweaked/approved to your liking how might I add the link to this page? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hot_sauces</a></li>

<li>I think it will work as it is...it probably needs some expansion in the future, but I think its notability is established well enough to keep it from being deleted. One thing I do want to make sure of is that you understand that I don't have any special influence over the article (or any other article). I'm just another editor like yourself. (That doesn't mean in any way that I'm not happy to help you improve the article, I just want to be sure that you understand that I don't have any special influence on anything in Wikipedia). I did make one minor change and removed your signature from the article space. You only need to sign your posts on talk pages, not within the article itself. OK...enough of that. The XLR is the one with the Nitrogen shocks isn't it? Is that a tighter ride or does it have a little more give than a standard shock? I went from the stock 13 1/2" to the Hugger 11 3/4" shocks on mine, and its pretty stiff. I can't imagine that the Nitrogen shocks are any stiffer, but I've never been on an XLR to be able to compare. Ride safe. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">Speak</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 14:41, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the assist! Well... From where I sit YOU are the moral authority on "all things Wikipedia!" I would like to tweak the category a bit in the future, too, will defer to your wisdom and insight. (With due apologies for placing my signature all over the place!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Re. my XLR, it has a few buzzers and whistles on the motor. E.g., "high-compression, high-flow cylinder heads; performance cams, etc." But other than that, it's fairly standard. Even the shocks... But, man, I love that thing! Had it for a little over a year now... Now, I’m ready to start tinkering with the pipes and the carb jetting, etc. I just couldn't bring myself to start messing around with a brand new bike, though! Your recommendations are welcome - especially regarding pipes.</p>
<p>Here's the Harley spec's for the '06 XLR (same as the '05 - different paint scheme):</p>

<p>P.S. Looks like there is still some sort of block on the article... Is there anything else that needs to be done to make our entry "legit?" It says..."The current version of the article or section reads like an advertisement." Not sure if this is a vestigial statement. Or, if there is more tweaking required. ...Thoughts?</p>
<p>Cackalacky Jack 21:26, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looks like you've already taken care of the {{advert}} tag, which is fine. I don't think it reads like an advertisement now.</li>

<li>I <i><b>highly</b></i> recommend Cycle Shack pipes. I got a set of slip-ons for mine for about $140 through Dennis Kirk (<a href="http://www.denniskirk.com/jsp/product_catalog/Product.jsp?skuId=H252046&amp;store=Main&amp;catId=203&amp;productId=pH252046&amp;leafCatId=20303&amp;mmyId=1600587" class="external free" title="http://www.denniskirk.com/jsp/product_catalog/Product.jsp?skuId=H252046&amp;store=Main&amp;catId=203&amp;productId=pH252046&amp;leafCatId=20303&amp;mmyId=1600587" rel="nofollow">http://www.denniskirk.com/jsp/product_catalog/Product.jsp?skuId=H252046&amp;store=Main&amp;catId=203&amp;productId=pH252046&amp;leafCatId=20303&amp;mmyId=1600587</a>) and I am completely happy with them. They are an inch or so shorter than stock, but otherwise look identical (I like the stock look, and didn't want to go too over-the-top with funky looking ones). They have a <i>little</i> bit of a baffle in them, so they aren't obnoxiously loud, but they are plenty loud enough so that folks know there's a Harley coming. I read somewhere that Cycle Shack used to (and maybe still does) manufacture the Screamin' Eagle pipes for Harley, just with the SE stamp. I also read that the pipes I got are equivalent to Screamin' Eagle I, but I don't know what the difference between SE I and SE II is. Whatever you do, I wouldn't go with drag pipes...I've heard nothing but bad things about drag pipes, and you'll never get it jetted right. I also got the SE air cleaner so it can breathe a little easier (about $115 if I remember correctly). Those two things together made a world of difference in power (I'd guess around + 7-10 HP, but part of that could just be the fact that its louder). I did get a jet kit, but I haven't put it on yet. So far, I haven't needed to. I haven't had any problems with the stock jets (the slow jet feels like it could use a little more of an opening, but nothing major). It may run even better if I put the jet kit in, but I had my experience with messing with carbs on my old Yamaha, and I don't want to go cracking the carbs open unless I have to. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><strong class="selflink">Speak</strong> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 22:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ah, great minds... I was thinking the same thing re the Cycle Shack pipes. (I had thought about the V &amp; H Short Shots for about two seconds – at the behest of my local dealer) Helps to hear a similar opinion - and I was on the right track... The kid at the parts counter wants me to turn my baby into a crotch rocket, me thinks. Plus, the $140 Cycle Shack price is right, too - and the "slip-on" fix is easy! I had also heard that CS are the same folks who make the SE pipes, as well. And, to be honest, I'd rather not have the "Screaming Eagle" logo embossed on my bike/pipes, anyhow. Plus, I can keep the same "sleeper/stock" look. (I actually like the look of the stock pipes.) Plus, I don't think Drag Pipes would please our local college town constables... Also, interesting to hear that you are ok without the carb kit so far. A buddy of mine in the KC area says the same thing...: "...a decent pipes are all you really need." (So she can breathe better).</li>

<li>That's cool. Greenville is nice. I've been there a few times this summer - feeding our minions at Whole Foods. Very friendly local folks. Great local eats, too, of course! They have a Flat Rock Grille there, too. (Which carries our wares on their tables) ...And a Sticky Fingers - which isn't Carolina 'Cue. But, the owners are nice folks. So, they get my thumbs-up. Good luck!</li>
