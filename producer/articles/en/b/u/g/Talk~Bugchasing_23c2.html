<p>It isn't? If the author of the uncited material wanted to put it back, they certainly could whether I deleted the material or put cite tags on it. Likely neither will happen. Do we constantly have to leave unencyclopedic stuff in just because it isn't reverted the first time it's added? The portions I took out will never be encyclopedic- they are all "Some people believe x, while others believe y".

<p>It isn't information, it's opinon. I can't re-write opinion that I can't source, and neither can anyone else. You want me to cover this article with fact tags, I guess I'm going to have to deal with that. But it'll only make everyone think the whole thing is made up. Shouldn't the burden of proof by put on the person that added all of these dubious and opinion based claims? Why not let that person be the one to try to find support for the claims instead of the rest of us having to deal with it? How can I re-write something that I obviously can't find evidence for- I can't. By this example, you would support keeping all unverifiable claims unless someone re-wrote them into different unverifiable claims. If you have an issue with this information then you can improve it by citing it, or removing it and letting someone else re-add it with citations instead- I don't want to get into an edit war, but I don't want to have to google phrases to try and find sources for some odd editors opinon. There is no way to improve upon these spurious claims besides removal- convince me otherwise.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 19:14, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Some people edit things out of controvertial topics, to be sure, but it's just as bad to over-protect an article from being edited. I charge that I would have no problem removing speculative viewpoints written on the Carebears article, but on this page removing a sentance that starts with "It is thought that some men might" is removing information? If someone got this from a source, they could have stated the study that put forth this idea. Most likely, someone who didn't like what they thought the article said shoved a bunch of caveats and ideas on it from out of their head. So as I see it, leaving these comments in is unbased censorship, and taking them out is just editing, and not even neccessarily bad faith, as it doesn't stop the author to try to insert the sentances again. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 21:35, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is some generally discussive and non-factual stuff from the article. I think this collection of thoughts is basically a discussion of some possible aspects of the idea. So as discussion, it goes in discussion.</p>
<p><br />
It is thought that some men wish to become infected with HIV because they feel <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt.html" title="Guilt">guilty</a> (or even left out) because many of their friends are HIV-positive or because they feel <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatalism.html" title="Fatalism">fatalistic</a> about becoming HIV-positive and want to stop worrying about when they might become infected ordinarily. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Was concerned with the vague "many" which did not clarify the small extent "bugchasing" is in the gay community.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/g/Talk%7EBugchasing_23c2.html" title="Edit section: Unneeded citation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unneeded citation</span></h2>
<p>Someone has requested a citation for the statement that some gay people feel that the "bugchasing" phenomenon might give gay people a bad reputation. I am removing this request for a citation for several reasons. Firstly, a citation isn't really needed in incidents of common-sense rules. There is nothing controversial or potentially libelous about the statement; it is simply common sense. It is general knowledge that gay and lesbian people face an overwhelming amount of stigma and hatred from the global community. It is simply common sense that they would fear that a subculture within their culture wherein people are actively seeking to contract a life-threatening disease (that they then might spread to others) might make them, as a community, look bad. To insinuate otherwise would be to intimate that gay people are just plain stupid. Obviously I'm expressing some serious POV here, but I think that those you could find who DONT think voluntarily, intentionally contracting HIV is absolutely insane are in the extreme minority. Further, it is hugely documented that there are many people within the gay community at large who frown upon ANYTHING that might make them look less than "normal" to the general public, because they are afraid of discrimination and judgement; things like the leather men or drag queens. There is even a speech about it in the play/movie <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey.html" title="Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a></i> where the character Sterling says (I'm paraphrasing): "I turned on the television and there were these two men and they said 'Hi, I'm Bob, and this is my husband, Mark. And he's a construction worker and I'm a doctor. And I just want everyone watching to see us and to know that gay people are just like everyone else.' And I thought, 'Ooooh. Get <i>HER!</i> '" In short, the statement is based in general knowledge and echoes common sene, and requesting a citation is overzealous wiki-watching: your diligence is appreciated, but in this case, not prudent. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 07:53, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further, for clarification, I have edited the text to read as follows:
<dl>
<dd><i>Further, similar to the existance of NAMBLA, it is feared by the gay community at large that the behaviours of bugchasers may contribute to a public perception that the practice is common or encouraged by all gay people, and would thus cause further ill-will towards them.</i> <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 07:56, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm very, very concerned about the basic factual accuracy of this article. The lone reliable source (since the Rolling Stone article has been widely discredited) is a documentary. There's widespread evidence of a hoax or a panic. At the very least, the entire first two sections need to be meticulously sourced, adn the controversy over whether this is even real needs to be front-ended. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just looking around I've found three seemingly reliable web sources that say the phenomenon is real but that the numbers publicized are inflated. Personally I heard about this as long as ten years ago but I only recently read the terms 'bug chaser' and 'gift giver.'

<dd>I can find a general refusal to rule out the possiblity, but the cited sources (most especially the Rolling Stone article - I can't find a lot reliable on the documentary) are clearly awful.

<p>"There are various motivations for "bug chasing" and "gift giving:"</p>

<li>The element of danger in sexual encounters of this kind (including activities like "<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_roulette.html" title="Russian roulette">Russian roulette</a>") adds to the rush.</li>
<li>Once infected, the chaser feel like they finally belong to a community in which they will be accepted.</li>

<p>Who believes there are enough possible citations to expand this article? More to the point, I think that the only sections worth keeping other than the two sentence introduction is the Press section and the medical response section. If these are removed rather than rewritten and attributed, then we've got a stub, one that may not for a long time be expanded to full article status.

<dd>I'm working on citing the article and rewriting it on my user page right now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Parammon/Bugchasing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Parammon/Bugchasing" rel="nofollow">Here</a>. Though that is admittedly slow-going, very busy in RL at the moment. I'm all for shortening it and merging it as long as long as we can find and appropriate place, if that is the best course. But it is a very controversial topic and arouses all kinds of reactions. The editors on other pages might not look kindly on a merge.--<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParammon_7bc5.html" title="User:Parammon"><b>ParAmmon</b></a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParammon_d650.html" title="User talk:Parammon">cheers thanks a lot!</a>)</span> 17:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well in kind it would be merged with something also controvertial, like HIV in america, unsafe sex, etc. I would love if the place this was merged to was full of editors dubious on this article's veracity. It would mean a more concise and better attributed article. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 17:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
