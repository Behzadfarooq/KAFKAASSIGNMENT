<p>When brought to the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> where the original Budvar, the name budwiser chose to steal. While rearanging the slogan (also stolen) from "The Beer of Kings" to "The King of Beers", the Czech company was more than happy to share the European market with Anheuser-Busch. The Busch company then flew in free beer for the entire town where Budvar is produced. The Czechs bieng rather particular about their beer tasted a small amount and threw away the remaning kegs (almost unheard of in the Czech Republic, you don't throw away beer unless it is spoiled!). From this point on American BUD can only be sold in Europe under the name of BUD. Also it is a matter of more than pride the Czechs don't want to be associated with the American BUD as they are a beer drinking culture. Beer is very important to every aspect of Czech culture. Good beer, they take pride in their beer and the history of the beers. Each region has it's favorite, they were the producers of the first Pilsner AND the first Budweiser and as far as they are concerned, they are going to keep this title! No pisswater crap, chemical filled over marketed bullshit producing company will ever take away their heritage. Thanks for letting me RANT, I do think it is importaint for the world to know the truth!</p>
<p>For an example of czech culture and beer check out <a href="http://www.pilsnerurquell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pilsnerurquell.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>THIS IS <a href="../../../f/a/c/FACT_4bdf.html" title="FACT">FACT</a> YOU MAY ASK ANY CZECH FROM THE REGION THEY REMEMBER THIS WELL I'M SURE</p>
<pre>
    Maybe somone could contact budvar for a citation...
</pre>
<p><br />
The Czechs are also proud of gaining their independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which referred to the town of Ceske Budejowice as "Budweis". The Anheuser-Busch corporation did not "steal" the name "Budvar", as can be seen from the fact that they have never marketed a beer called "Budvar". They have marketed a beer called "Budweiser" because when they started marketing it in 1876, Budweis was still part of the A-H empire.</p>

<p>Is Bud really a pilsner? It sure tasted like a lager (and a very, very bland one) to me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is indeed a <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lager.html" title="Lager">lager</a>, as was virtually every mass-produced beer in America prior to 1980. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>As the lager and pilsner pages say - a pilsner is a lager. So Bud is both. (doesn't make it good though). <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 19:44 May 5, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I really kind of doubt it's a pilsner though. And admittedly, I'm basing this purely on anecdotal evidence (I remember an advertising campaign for another beer around 1980, can't remember which one, touting that beer as a pilsner and implying that was something "new and different"). I'll do some studying up on it. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a> 19:57 May 5, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As to its popularity overseas, in Australia I'd have to say that it's been responsible for giving American beer a truly appalling (and undeserved, given some of the microbrews I tried) reputation. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>

<dd>I'm afraid it'd probably wouldn't be NPOV to say that it owes its foreign popularity more to the advertising than any inherent virtues of the beer! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 18:56 May 5, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All pilsners are lagers, but not all lagers are pilsners. I don't think Bud has enough hops flavor to be considered a pilsner. It's sort of a bland, generic lager (though I must admit loving it). Then again, Miller Lite advertised for a while as a "true pilsner beer." And that stuff is dishwater.</p>

<p>A few days ago I went on the tour of the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">Saint Louis</a> brewery. When we got to the hospitality room the tour guides had a few volunteers try fresh Budweiser, and what they refered to as "punished Budweiser." This punished beer, if I remember correctly, was Budweiser that had been stored for two weeks in 100 degree heat. The volunteers didn't think it tasted very good, one said it was flat, another remarked that the beer tasted bitter.</p>

<p>As Czech and USian Budweiser are different companies producing different products, shouldn't they have seperate pages with Budweiser being a disambiguation page? --Kostya 16:59, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is this one the main article at "Budweiser"? It was named after the Czech one which is more famous... <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlensha_9238.html" title="User:Alensha">Alensha</a> 08:21, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, being US-centric, Wikipedia has a much larger article for the US Budweiser. But either way, the question is which is more famous among native English speakers, not the entire world. If an English speaker types "Budweiser" into the search box, where are they expecting to go? If you feel that other native English speakers would prefer to read about the Czech brewery, then we'll make the main page a disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">⇔</a> 14:21, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a counter argument, there are many English speakers in continental Europe, where "Budweiser" refers to the Czech not the US beer. Having the US beer at "Budweiser" doesn't bug me much as long as the disambiguation for the Czech beer is at the top of the page as it is now. However it might be argued that this is POV taking sides on which brand has more right to be considered the "real" Budweiser. A case could probably be made for making "Budweiser" a disambiguation page, with the US beer at "Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)" or "Budweiser (US)" or some similar specific title.

<dd>As a main contributor to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Beer_29b3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Beer">Wikipedia:WikiProject Beer</a>, I need to point out that we actually agreed that most beers should not have their own article, and should instead be put into the article of their respective brewery. So IMO, the best solution is to make a page for the brewery, and have Budweiser (Czech) link there.</dd>
<dd>Also, Budweiser (US) is notable because it is by far the most drunk beer in the US. This whole thing is unfortunate, because if it were any other beer, I would say that the international crowd should win out. But Budweiser and Anheuser-Busch are as iconic in the US as Guniness in Ireland. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">⇔</a> 15:33, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>having discussed this with numerous friends in Australia a few years ago after a trip through Ceske Budjevice (spelling?) it seems to me that less then 1% of australians would even realise that Budweiser was anything other then an American beer,</p>

<dd>Thanks for the links. I was aware of the legal dispute over the name between the US and Czech companies, but this gives many more details (one point in the first link I think is wrong; I believe "Crystal" was brewed by a different brewery in České Budějovice, Pivovar Sampson). That rights to the name "Budweiser" is so heavily a matter of dispute in international courts makes me think it is even more important that our "Budweiser" page be turned into a disambiguation-- Wikipedia should not be taking sides in an international trademark dispute! I'll give it a day or two for feedback here, then I will move the current "Budweiser" article to the suggested <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweiser_%28Anheuser-Busch%29_c6c1.html" title="Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)">Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)</a> (unless a better name is suggested and gets support) and will turn "Budweiser" into a disambiguation page (unless there is an excellent argument as to why it should not be) -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> June 29, 2005 21:18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is as though a Czech brewery called a beer "From Anheuser Busch" in German. When they started, they took the risk, because they did not foresee beer being shipped across oceans. So they should not have to pay past damages, only pay for a license, in the future. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R. Ingham">David R.

<dd>No, it's not that clear-cut.

<p><i>Due to Budweiser's sponsorship and therefore support of Malcolm Glazer's hugely unpopular takeover of Manchester United Football Club, many of Manchester United's millions of supporters worldwide have decided to boycott Budweiser products. This boycott may only be lifted when Budweiser severs all ties with the club or speaks out against the takeover and the level of debt that it has saddled the formerly-profitable club with.</i></p>

<dd>I would disagree. Since this article mentions the popularity of Bud overseas this is quite relevant as it's a significant movement at the current time. Perhaps when the fuss dies down this will change but not at the moment. If the Timbuktoo Curling Association supporters were boycotting Bud then I would agree it's unnecessary but MU is not the Tumbuktoo Curling Association... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the boycott is an interesting if it's a real factoid, but I wonder if it can be taken as such. Clearly it was written by someone who themselves is boycotting budweiser, but I feel that they are more calling for others to join them, than elaborating on a notable movement. I live in the US and soccer is not a big deal in my community, so I can't really say whether or not a significant number of manchester fans are actually taking part in this boycott. Regardless, the NPOV of this section needs to be addressed. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaggorama_a518.html" title="User:Shaggorama">Shaggorama</a> 08:57, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>in China, where Anheuser-Busch has had a brewery in Wuhan since 1995, 2.7 million barrels of Budweiser were brewed there in 2004, a number which is expected to grow to nearly 3.5 million barrels in 2005;</i> in the United Kingdom, where Anheuser-Busch owns Stag Brewery in Mortlake, Budweiser is the number one on-premise, premium packaged lager and the country's number two such lager; in Canada, where Labatt Brewing Company brews and packages Budweiser and Bud Light for the Canadian market; Budweiser became the country's number one brand in 2004. This section needs clarification. In the China case, sheer numbers are of little relevance, especially in a large market such as the Chinese. Percentages are much more important. If these 2.7 million barrels are only 0.1% of the Chinese market and 1% of the foreign brand market they are not a sign that Bud is doing well in China. Also what does number one brand in Canada mean? Number 1 of beers? Of lagers? As for the UK figure, what exactly is a premium packaged lager and how is it defined? Is there a well accepted definition in the UK? If not, this figure has little meaning. We also need some more independent verification of these figures. The Bud page is not independent... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added a sentence to the beer section, trying to offer some negative perceptions as to the beer's taste. I feel that if the brewery's claims as to the taste are to be included it's only fair to add the comments of those who aren't fans.

The Busch company then flew in free beer for the entire town where Budvar is produced. The Czechs bieng rather particular about their beer tasted a small amount and threw away the remaning kegs. From this point on American BUD can only be sold in Europe under the name of BUD.</li>

<li>It is interesting to note that budweisers beer clearly states on the lable that it is the most expensive to produce, also they account for more marketing than any other beer company to date.</li>

<p>I *think* the author intended to 1) repeat information in the credo section ("We know of no brand produced by any other brewer which costs so much to brew and age.") and then 2) note that Anheuser-Busch has spent more on advertising Budweiser than is/has been spent by Anheuser-Busch's competitors.

<p>FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT:</p>
<p>The only reason I came to this page was to find out if Wikipedia could be exploited to become an advertisement. Especially if none of the administrators ever got a chance to notice the entry. Anyway I also noticed that the article mentions that Bud Ice was introduced in 1984 but in the next paragraph mentions that Bud Dry took a back seat when Bud Ice was introduced in 1994. Something needs to be fixed, either the first paragraph meant to say 1994 or the second paragraph was supposed to mention that Bud Ice Light was the reason Bud Dry fell out of any kind of favor.

<p>I came to the discussion page to make a note of that...and lo and behold, over a month later, that discrepancy/error/whatever it is, is still present with no hint of resolution. However, considering there's two (now three) posts made in 2007, I suppose maintenance, or at least the commentary of this page, is somewhat lacking. Anybody with the inclination to research and fix that? =P -Fyrie</p>
