The cars could be used singly or several coupled together in trainsets and controlled from the cab of the front unit.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_and_Maine_Railroad_275a.html" title="Boston and Maine Railroad">Boston and Maine Railroad</a> owned by far the largest number of these units, but they were also very popular with the passenger heavy <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven_Railroad_f9e3.html" title="New Haven Railroad">New Haven Railroad</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> railways such as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (where they were known as <i>Dayliners</i>), the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railway_1825.html" title="Canadian National Railway">Canadian National Railway</a>, and the former <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Rail_8b62.html" title="BC Rail">BC Rail</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/a/VIA_Rail_66f3.html" title="VIA Rail">VIA Rail</a> still uses RDCs for scheduled services on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a> and in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ontario_222f.html" title="Northern Ontario">Northern Ontario</a>, and the planned <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue22.html" title="Blue22">Blue22</a> service connecting <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport_71a6.html" title="Toronto Pearson International Airport">its airport</a> will use refurbished RDCs as well.</p>

The Hurricane Turn is the last remaining <a href="../../../r/e/q/Request_stop.html" title="Request stop">flag stop</a> service in the U.S. and is the only transportation to many summer (and year-round) cabins on a stretch of track between <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talkeetna.html" title="Talkeetna">Talkeetna</a> and Hurricane Gulch.

<p>Budd manufactured five basic variants of the RDC:</p>
<ul>
<li>The RDC-1 — an 85&#160;ft (26&#160;<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">m</a>) all-passenger coach seating 88 passengers.</li>
<li>The RDC-2 — an 85&#160;ft (26&#160;m) <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_post_office.html" title="Railway post office">Railway Post Office</a> and passenger coach configuration seating 71 passengers.</li>
<li>The RDC-3 — an 85&#160;ft (26&#160;m) variant with a Railway Post Office, a baggage compartment and 44 passenger seats.</li>
<li>The RDC-4 — a 65&#160;ft (20&#160;m) variant with only the Railway Post Office and baggage area.</li>
<li>The RDC-5 (also known as the RDC-9) — an 85&#160;ft (26&#160;m) passenger coach seating 82, with no independent control cab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RDC-1 was powered by two 6-cylinder <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Diesel_eb17.html" title="Detroit Diesel">Detroit Diesel</a> engines, each of 275&#160;<a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsepower.html" title="Horsepower">hp</a> (205&#160;kW).</p>
<p>Circa 1956, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven_Railroad_f9e3.html" title="New Haven Railroad">New Haven Railroad</a> ordered a custom-built, six-car RDC trainset named the "Roger Williams". It consisted of 2-single-ended cab units, and four intermediate cars to make a complete train. The units even were fitted with third-rail shoes, electric <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traction_motors.html" title="Traction motors">traction motors</a>, and associated gear for operation into <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Central_Terminal_a5f5.html" title="Grand Central Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a>, though this was short lived. In the New Haven's later years, the set was broken up, and used with regular New Haven RDCs, and by Amtrak into the 1980s. The two cab units and one intermediate car are fully restored and operational, and are on display at the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danbury_Railway_Museum_44c7.html" title="Danbury Railway Museum">Danbury Railway Museum</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, Budd offered a new RDC model, called the <b>SPV-2000</b> (self-propelled vehicle), but only 24 of them were sold, as they proved unreliable and did not gain marketplace acceptance. The few remaining in service have long been converted to unpowered, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locomotive.html" title="Locomotive">locomotive</a>-drawn coaches.</p>
<p>Five cars were built under licence in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Engineering_61b9.html" title="Commonwealth Engineering">Commonwealth Engineering</a> for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Government_Railways_2150.html" title="New South Wales Government Railways">New South Wales Government Railways</a>. They were smaller than the standard RDC in all dimensions. One car was built with a buffet/snack bar accommodation in one end. The five-car set operated the South Coast Daylight Express between <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowra.html" title="Nowra">Nowra</a>.</p>

<p>In what was billed as an experiment toward <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_speed_rail.html" title="High speed rail">high speed rail</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Central_1d72.html" title="New York Central">New York Central</a> (NYC) fitted a pair of jet engines atop one of their RDCs and added a shovelnose front to its cab. This RDC, which NYC had numbered M497, set the United States speed record in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> when it travelled at just short of 184&#160;<a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_per_hour.html" title="Miles per hour">mph</a> (296&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre_per_hour.html" title="Kilometre per hour">km/h</a>) between <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler%2C_Indiana_b69b.html" title="Butler, Indiana">Butler, Indiana</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stryker%2C_Ohio_7ba4.html" title="Stryker, Ohio">Stryker, Ohio</a>. Most sources agree, however, that this was purely a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity_stunt.html" title="Publicity stunt">publicity stunt</a> on the part of the NYC.</p>
<p>Three RDC-1s were exported to Australia to operate with the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Railways_b840.html" title="Commonwealth Railways">Commonwealth Railways</a>. These cars ran between <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Pirie_052e.html" title="Port Pirie">Port Pirie</a> and various locations, and later by <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_National_Railways_Commission_8cbb.html" title="Australian National Railways Commission">Australian National</a> from <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> to <a href="../../../w/h/y/Whyalla.html" title="Whyalla">Whyalla</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Augusta_c738.html" title="Port Augusta">Port Augusta</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Hill_5b6d.html" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a>.</p>
