<p>I saw on the bio-pic starring Buddy Hackett and Harvey Korman, and have heard from other sources, that in comedy duos the straight man always got the 60% cut because they didn't get the laughs and were therefore less popular. Costello didn't create this he bucked it. He insisted that he get the 60% cut because the act would be nothing without him and Abbott acquiesced.</p>

<dd>His mother was Jewish. From his "Jewhoo" entry: "The straight man of the famous "Abbott and Costello" team. We got the straight story from the editor of "The Abbott and Costello Quarterly", via a friend of Jewhoo. Abbott's mother, Rae, was Jewish. She was a former circus horse rider. He was not raised Jewish. His two adopted children were not raised Jewish. However, late in life, in tribute to his deceased mother, Abbott and his (non-Jewish) wife renewed their vows in a Jewish ceremony. In an interesting sidelight, one of our visitors tells us that Bud Abbott and his wife took in our the visitor's Jewish grandmother when she was a young teenager and raised her like a stepdaughter. They were very kind to her. Much later in life she became the president of her synagogue. Bud Abbott died in 1974, at 80. A biography of Bud Abbott (but without the Jewish 'angle') can be found on the following link." You can access the database at <a href="http://www.jewhoo.com/get_entry_information.asp?p_category_id=&amp;p_parent_id=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewhoo.com/get_entry_information.asp?p_category_id=&amp;p_parent_id=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Johnny234 07:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I consider Jewhoo to be nothing more than gossip and the Abbott and Costello Quarterly a fan magazine. Based on actual records, Bud's mother Rachel Fisher, born in Maryland in 1858, is half Prussian and half Bavarian, the latter from her mother Fredericka. <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuestors_0a08.html" title="User:Questors">Questors</a> 17:43, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Excuse me, but what exactly is your source that she was not Jewish? Jewhoo has never been wrong. Obviously his mother's parents came from somewhere in Europe, and obviously there were plenty of Jewish immigrants coming from Prussia and Bavaria. If her parents were named O'Donnelly and came from Dublin, you would have a point. But this census info certainly co-responds with the information on Jewhoo or with any other source that says that his mother was Jewish. 24.226.10.98 08:13, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Never been wrong. Amazing. According to <a href="http://www.offoffoff.com/etc/nov99/jewhoo2.php3" class="external text" title="http://www.offoffoff.com/etc/nov99/jewhoo2.php3" rel="nofollow">one review</a>, "Visitors were invited to submit names of famous Jewish persons in a variety of categories. Since neither Page nor Williams had the time to do fact-checking, visitor submissions mostly went up on the site as submitted. That, predictably, resulted in many errors." Meanwhile the Bud Abbott census information is from 1860. That is long before Jews started coming to the US from Prussia and Bavaria. [1860 United States Federal Census &gt; Maryland &gt; Baltimore (Independent City) &gt; Baltimore Ward 7 &gt; Page 313.] If you have a source that is other than hearsay and repeated stories, please list it.<a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuestors_0a08.html" title="User:Questors">Questors</a> 16:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That review of Jewhoo refers to the old management of the website, dating back to something like 2001, before the current editor, and the one who was in charge of the version you see now, took over. You are not going to find a single mistake on it now. Anyway, Jewhoo's credibility is not even relevant, since the site lists their source as the Abbott &amp; Costello Quarterly. Surely they would know? 24.226.10.98 19:36, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no good source that his mother was Jewish. You can't really use sites like Am I Annoying, etc. Jewhoo credited the Abbott &amp; Costello Quarterly, and I am not so sure that the Quarterly is a reliable source. See this book biography - searchable online - Abbott's wife was a convert to Judaism and that is why they were re-married in a Jewish ceremony.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/188895261X/qid=1152647457/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_6/103-5156445-7722213?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/188895261X/qid=1152647457/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_6/103-5156445-7722213?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> The book was worked on by Abbott's family - they had every chance to mention that his mother was Jewish in the Jewish wedding thing - or elsewhere in the book - but they didn't. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 19:52, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Out of the seven sources I listed, you took the very last and most unreliable of the seven and used that for your reasoning. Very clever. The <b>first</b> source I provided appears to be part of his official bio since the copyright says "Bud Abbott" and it is <b>extremely</b> detailed about his childhood. Read it, would you please? In it, it says that as a child he had to avoid a certain part of town because Jewish boys were targeted. I don't think they would mention that if he wasn't Jewish. Again, the <b>only</b> site that disputes this is your blog, which as of yet is not considered a credible site in the least by anyone. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 09:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not my blog, it's Questors - different user - who I think is usually right - though I agree that we can't use her blog as a source. However, how do you explain the fact that Abbott's book - i.e. co-writter by members of his family - doesn't mention the fact that his mother was Jewish, even though it does mention other Jewish-related details - like his Jewish re-wedding. Web sites in general are not considered reliable sources. Did you even notice that this source was not about the same Bud Abbott?<a href="http://www.rlhleagueofnurses.org.uk/Hospital_History/Reminiscences/BudAbbott/budabbott.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rlhleagueofnurses.org.uk/Hospital_History/Reminiscences/BudAbbott/budabbott.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> - the one about the anti-Semitism in his neiguborhood. It's a source about some British Bud Abbott! LOL! "Bud Abbott was born, brought up and worked much of his life in the East End of London"... Am I Annoying, Adherents, etc. are not reliable and are not first-hand sources. I admit a detail source like the one you mention about anti-Semitism to him in his childhood may be reliable - but I find it weird that you didn't even notice that source wasn't about the same Bud Abbott! <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 07:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added "citation needed" tags where they seem warranted. I am particularly interested in the source of the statement that Costello later in his career received a 60-40 split. My understanding was that they were getting 50-50 at the time and that he once demanded 60-40 as a reflection of their poor relationship at the time, but that he did not actually get the split. There are already references in the article and it would be great if there could be more where warranted.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverscreen_4515.html" title="User:Silverscreen">Silverscreen</a> 15:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two articles posted on the official Abbott and Costello site say that Bud was living off Social Security at the time of his death. These articles were from the National Enquirer, which I would ordinarily discount if they hadn't appeared on the official website, which is run by the Abbott and Costello families.
