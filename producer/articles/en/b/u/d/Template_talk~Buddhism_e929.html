<p>I prefer the wheel because it is recognizable and actually useful as an icon, whereas this symbol was made up for Wikipedia.

<p>Is there any symbol or picture that could symbolize buddhism and satisfies all (or most) sects of buddhism? it could be the wheel, lotus, swastika, or something else. - Party A</p>

<dd>they do have a wheel ON a lotus - Party B</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The most common symbol in the Buddhist world, I suppose, is the image of the Buddha himself, as seen in the familiar Buddha statue. Apart from the image of a person, the next most common symbol, in my experience, is most likely the swastika. If we consider this to be inappropriate for use here, the dharma wheel, which we have been using, is quite common, and it was adopted as an official symbol by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Fellowship_of_Buddhists_eef4.html" title="World Fellowship of Buddhists">World Fellowship of Buddhists</a>. However, the Donut's Buddha-in-lotus image <a href="../../../l/o/t/Image%7ELotus75.png_2e57.html" class="image" title="Image:Lotus75.png"><img src="../../../upload/d/de/Lotus75.png" alt="Image:Lotus75.png" width="75" height="74" longdesc="../../../l/o/t/Image%7ELotus75.png_2e57.html" /></a> is also quite nice; I've never seen anything quite like it before, but it combines two very traditional symbols: the Buddha image and the lotus.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 22:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The oldest representation of the Buddha is a Bodhi tree (the Buddha himself gave permission to use the Bodhi tree as a representation of himself - in his absence that is). Also Bodhi leafs are also quite popular. In India some of the rockcave-monasteries of <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellora.html" title="Ellora">Ellora</a> have door-openings in the shape of a Bodhi leaf, so also the Bodhi leaf is an old symbol.<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 14:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the mention of tripartite and now the link is again called <i>schools of buddhism</i> since that term is more clear, and the link refers to an article which mentions all the many many subschools. Also in the past there were many more schools than just 3 (there were for example about 18 - 20 early buddhist schools). Tripartite buddhism should refer to an article about commonalities and differences between Mahayana, Vajrayana and whatever-you-want-to-call-it-Theravada-Hinayana-Nikaya-Buddhism, not to a list of all schools. Tripartite is also a term which is generally not used in this context, although I can see why Nat (?) choose to use it. But I think Wkipedia should better stick with what is common usage. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 00:14, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose putting the 'fundamentals' and 'philosophy/in depth' together under 'fundamental concepts' with a link to 'buddhist concepts', because they're all fundamental as far as I can see. Right now 'philosophy' is on top of the second list of concepts under the name 'in depth', but that name doesn't cover the subjects below it very well, and it might give the impression that using the four noble truths you can't go really deep? Also philosophy doesn't really do the job. A better discription would be 'in width' really, because they're just more concepts to use in contemplation or reflection. Anyway I think the seperation is quite artificial and it would be better to put them in one group. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User_talk%7ESacca_af54.html" title="User talk:Sacca">Sacca</a> 16:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think those in the fundamentals are really fundamentals.. The basic things that should be done to reach the status of nirvana, but cosmology and karma etc are, i guess, not that fundamental relatively. what do you think? i'm not an expert by the way. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanviermichelle_ce95.html" title="User:Janviermichelle">Janviermichelle</a> 17:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cosmology maybe not to reach Nirvana, but it is a integrated part of the general teachings of Buddha. But certainly when one doesn't believe bad causes have bad results and good causes have good results, this would be a big thing, and certainly an obstruction to setting the very first steps on the path to Nirvana. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User_talk%7ESacca_af54.html" title="User talk:Sacca">Sacca</a> 01:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not know which article to link <i>fundamentals</i> to, but I thought the previously existing link was much better suited for 'More concepts'. Linking 'buddhism in-depth' to 'buddhist philosophy' is not really suitable I think; it's not the same. So if anybody knows a good article to link to Fundamentals please do make the link. Also if anybody wants to add buddhist philosophy as a link on its own they are free to do so off course. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User_talk%7ESacca_af54.html" title="User talk:Sacca">Sacca</a> 18:18, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sidebar is a great overview of the Indian-style continental schools of Buddhism, but it needs some links to other national traditions. How about something along the lines of:</p>
<p><b>Japan</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nichiren</li>
<li>Pure Land Buddhism</li>
<li>Shingon</li>
<li>Zen</li>
<li>etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there's a risk of too much cluttering, but c'mon, no link to Zen?? That seems a bit odd to me.</p>
<p>Similar sections could be made for China to Ch'an and whatnot and for Tibet to the Four Schools.</p>
<p>--66.8.203.13 06:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>China and Japan fall under East Asia, just like Vietnam and Myanmar fall under South-east Asia. Also, Zen falls under Mahayana, just like the Thai Forest Tradition falls under Theravada, and the Gelugpa falls under Vajrayana. It would be too much to put all the sects in all those countries in this list.

<p>This template's border has been changed from red to grey and thinned by two pixels. Aesthetically, I don't object to this change it. (It does possibly create extra work since, for instance, a number of other Buddhism-related templates follow this template's color scheme.) More importantly, it makes me wonder what the basis for this template's colors is/was. For instance, the red and saffron scheme reminded me of the monastic robes of different schools. Was this the intent? If so, should it be restored? Or should we develop a more intentional color scheme for our templates?

<dd>Regardless, perhaps the issue of intentionally developing a Buddhism-related scheme might still have merit.

<p>Thank you for this discussion. Yes, I based the color scheme on robes (Tibetan) and generally the colors we think of when we think of Buddhism (saffron, reddish orange, yellow...etc.)...--216.254.121.169 01:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Excellent</i>! Thanks for the confirmation! Nice work! Perhaps we could put a statement between &lt;noinclude&gt; &lt;/noinclude&gt; GML on the template page itself to identify this, to discourage future changes made without a Buddhist basis. For instance:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The color scheme of this page is based on the vibrant colors of monastic robes including:
<ul>
<li>the burgundy outer and yellow under robes of Tibetan monastics</li>
<li>the black robes of Zen moastics</li>
<li>the saffron/ochre robes of Theravada monastics</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, towards this end, I'd like to try to more vigorously apply a pan-Buddhist color scheme so, with your blessing, I'll try to expand the colors used and see how long it lasts. If they last for a week, I'll see about spreading the scheme to other Buddhism templates (particularly the ones I created). (If anyone wants to join in this evolution of the scheme or simply reject it with a revert, please feel free to do so!)

(Perhaps there's a need for more Mahayana black or brown or gray?) IMHO, I think the subheader colors make the template more readable although I realize the trade-off is that the template has now expanded in length. Well, feel free to discuss here or try tweaking, etc. Any feedback appreciated. &amp; I certainly hope the changes haven't caused any negative feelings and regret if they do. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 15:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Larry, I appreciate your efforts on this matter, and your colour scheme ideas seem pretty cool in theory. However, I happen to hold the perhaps unpopular view that this template has gotten much too large and obtrusive.

The current one is multiple times over longer than a lot of articles. Your changes make it both lengthier and the colours more eye-catching.

<dd>Hi Nat! As always, thanks for the excellent feedback. I'm wondering if it might be worthwhile to create another simpler template, to re-instantiate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Buddhism&amp;oldid=54962896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Buddhism&amp;oldid=54962896" rel="nofollow">this version to which you pointed</a>. (Perhaps, "Template:BuddhismBrief"?) Personally, I think the overall content of the current template is useful and it also matches similar templates for Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, etc.; nonetheless, I can easily recall articles in which the simpler version would be far more appropriate. As for the color scheme, I respect your opinion. If you chose to revert it, I'd be happy with that. (I'll hold off on propagating these colors to other Buddhism-related templates for now and won't do so if you choose to revert this template's colors.) Thanks so much again.

<p>I posted a note to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Template_talk%7EBuddhism2_6cba.html" title="Template talk:Buddhism2">Template_talk:Buddhism2</a> suggesting a modification of its colors (and border) to match this template. The tentative modification includes a suggested simplification of the existing text as well. While the simplified text has caused the template (Buddhism2) to shrink in width, the double border has somehow caused the template to grow in height. So, at this point, I'm a wee hesitant to implement this tenative change -- especially since Buddhism2 is included in close to 250 articles. Any feedback (at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Template_talk%7EBuddhism2_6cba.html#Color_Scheme" title="Template talk:Buddhism2">Template_talk:Buddhism2#Color_Scheme</a>) is appreciated -- especially any objections (especially from Nat who originally designed the template).

<p>To the category of "Major Figures," <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagarjuna.html" title="Nagarjuna">Nagarjuna</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogen.html" title="Dogen">Dogen</a> were recently added. (I think they were inadvertantly deleted soon afterwards, during a broader revert, so I then restored them again.) I think this addition was a positive step especially given that, although myself a Theravada practitioner, I find this template to appear to be weighted toward Indian/Nikaya/Theravada content. From prior study, I'd think it would be important to add <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhidharma.html" title="Bodhidharma">Bodhidharma</a> (from Chan/Zen history) as well. Whatcha all think?</p>
<p>In addition, after seeing the addition of Dogen, I felt compelled (from a justice standpoint) to add someone major in the Vajrayana tradition; so, I added <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Rinpoche_4765.html" title="Guru Rinpoche">Guru Rinpoche</a>. Similarly, if we were to add Bodhidharma, should we also add <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilopa.html" title="Tilopa">Tilopa</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marpa.html" title="Marpa">Marpa</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milarepa.html" title="Milarepa">Milarepa</a>? -- though I'm concerned that my ignorance on the topic might offend practitioners of one or more of the other Tibetan schools.</p>
<p>Can anyone provide any suggestions on whether to expand as identified above and, if so, which Vajrayana figure(s) might be most appropriate?

<dd>To be honest, I think we're courting disaster if we add anyone from the post-canonical period other than <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagarjuna.html" title="Nagarjuna">Nagarjuna</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhaghosa.html" title="Buddhaghosa">Buddhaghosa</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padmasambhava.html" title="Padmasambhava">Padmasambhava</a>. I know those are all Indians (well, Indian, Sri Lankan, and Pakistani, to be exact), but, then, once you leave India, there's a lot less that Buddhists can agree on. Dogen was an enormously influential man, but I don't know how we can justify including him but excluding Honen and/or Shinran. Even if we did settle on just Dogen, we'd in short order get complaints that we have exalted a Japanese guy but no Chinese people ... what effrontery! What about Zhiyi, or Fazang, or Huineng? The situation with modern people is even worse. Surely, the 14th Dalai Lama is the single most influential Buddhist leader today, but we certainly don't want to perpetuate the misconception that he speaks for all of Buddhism. He isn't even the leader of all Tibetan Buddhists (shortlisting the Dalai Lama creates pressure to add the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karmapa.html" title="Karmapa">Karmapa</a>, and then, when those to are on, what, really, is the rationale for excluding the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakya_Trizin_d125.html" title="Sakya Trizin">Sakya Trizin</a>, etc.) So, I think we should stick with those three I mentioned above, or, perhaps even better, leave out the post-canonicals altogether.

<dd>Hi Nat, as always, thanks so much for your much valued wisdom and insights! In terms of a specific item: Frankly, I was tempted to add Buddhaghosa as well -- certainly one of my icons -- but I thought such might be received poorly by: (a) non-Theravada practitioners; and, (b) the increasing number of <i>Nikaya-only</i> Theravada practitioners. More generally, personally, I value adding representatives of non-Indian origin (though, ironically, I realize a number of my candidates have their origin in Indian subcontinent) because I think such reflects the "practice reality" of practitioners -- for instance, Zen practitioners who know of Bodhidharma and Dogen and Huineng, but really don't know much about anyone outside the Zen lineage. It's that social worker part of my background, wanting to be inclusive of different voices and then attempting to find some intuitive equilibrium for calibrating representation. But, having blabbed on about such, let me say I defer to your thoughts here. I simply don't have the knowledge, wisdom or motivation to pursue it further. So, thanks for the excellent responses. I'll cease &amp; desist on this thread now! Best wishes, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 10:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Template_talk%7EBuddhism_e929.html" title="Edit section: Template size: &quot;terse&quot; parameter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Template size: "terse" parameter</span></h2>
<p>As some might see above, there is concern that this template is too long. While there is a lot that can be debated about this, I decided to experiment with creating a "terse" parameter that would enable editors to (by default) use the current full template or (with a "terse" parameter) use a version of the template that just shows subheaders. Thus the coding would be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>{{Buddhism}}</b> - to show the current <i>full</i> template</li>
<li><b>{{Buddhism|terse=1}}</b> - to show <i>subheadings only</i></li>
</ul>
<p>An example of how this template might be coded is currently available at <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_sandbox2_5522.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld/sandbox2">User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld/sandbox2</a>.</p>
<p>When this example template is invoked (as {{User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld/sandbox2|terse=1}}) using the <b>terse=1</b> parameter, it looks like the condensed template off to the right here:</p>

<p>In general, the main advantage is that I believe this template becomes <b>more useful</b>. The main disadvantage is that it becomes <b>more complex to maintain</b> (given the extra complexity of meta-language material, in particular, the #if's).</p>
<p>More specifically, I think some of the advantages of adding this type of functionality would include:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>WP article-editor transparency</u></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>it's transparent to current articles with the template; no changes need to be made</li>
<li>for articles (such as stubs) where the smaller/terser template is desired, simply add the aforementioned "terse=1" parameter to the template's invocation</li>
<li>if articles that use the "terse=1" parameter are expanded, then the terse parameter could be easily removed (or set to zero) to allow transclusion of the fully expanded template</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><u>content &amp; design centralization/consistency</u></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>any changes to subheadings or overall design in this template would be apparent in both the fully expanded and terse versions of this template (as opposed to having to alternately synchronize two different templates, a full one and a condensed one).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that the main disadvantage would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>template-editing complexity</u></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>this template would become more complex for two reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>the #if expressions are sprinkled throughout the template and how they work is not intuitively obvious to many (especially newer) WP editors; and,</li>
<li>#if expressions cannot be used with wiki-tables (technically speaking, this is due to the "|" [pipe] being an "overloaded operator") and thus this table has to be converted to HTML (which, in the above example template, has already been done).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All-in-all, I'm strongly inclined to add this function but, before doing so, would greatly appreciate others' feedback. <b>Thanks</b>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 23:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been playing with the idea of <b>making this template "collapsible."</b> For an example, see the newly added "Hide/Show" field in the top right corner of the tersed template just above. Anyone else have thoughts (pro or con) on this? Thanks! <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 00:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC) (Honestly, I wish I could add Java script to make this template collapsible from its normal display mode to the tersed mode, but this is currently beyond my know-how.)</dd>

<dd>It's been about a dozen days and I find myself repeatedly wishing (when reading WP Buddhism articles) that this [<i>and other</i>] template was collapsible. So, I'm gonna implement this change momentarily.</dd>
<dd>In summary: In my mind, the primary downside of implementing this is that this will make this <i>non-collapsed</i> template appear slightly wider; the upside is that one can <i>temporarily hide</i> the bulk of the template when trying to read the article.</dd>
<dd>If anyone zealously disagrees with this change, please revert; if anyone else finds this change unpleasant, please discuss here.

<p>I feel those teachers like Dogen, Nagarjuna, Buddhaghosa and Guru Rinpoche could maybe be linked as a group (later teachers/ commentators), instead of mentioning them individually. The same is done for Buddha's disciples and it would make the template smaller and more to the point.Greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User_talk%7ESacca_af54.html" title="User talk:Sacca">Sacca</a> 13:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Greetings Saccha! Hope you're doing well. FWIW, I like your idea of condensing the teachers/founders and I think it is worth further discussion. Something that might kind of fit the bill for what you identified could be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html#Historical_Buddhist_thinkers_and_founders_of_schools" title="List of Buddhists">this list</a>.</dd>
<dd>If I may add my two cents: Without splitting hairs just yet, I intuit that it might be worthwhile to group non-Nikaya forerunners in groups according to their traditions/schools (to borrow handy terminology Nat &amp; Peter have been teaching me&#160;:-) ). For instance, if there were an article on Zen patriarchs or the Zen lineage, I'd think that such an article might be worthwhile including. Secondarily (okay, I'm about to split a big fat hair), I think one could argue that someone like Bodhidharma was <i>historically</i> more important to <i>global</i> Buddhism than <i>most</i> of the Buddha's disciples (with some obvious exceptions being, for instance, strictly from a historical standpoint, Mahakassappa, Upali, Ananda, etc.); so, if we need to condense, I could see some advocating for Bodhidharma or Nagarjuna over the Buddha's Disciples. Perhaps it might be worthwhile first explicitly articulating the criteria for inclusion in this and other sections of this template?</dd>
<dd>My two cents. I hope you are happy &amp; well, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 03:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC) [ignorant until proven otherwise]</dd>
