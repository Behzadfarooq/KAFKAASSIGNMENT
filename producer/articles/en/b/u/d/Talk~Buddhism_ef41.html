<p>I also moved the eight-spoked wheel picture next to The Eight-Fold Path section. I moved the Series Box to the top of the article so it is easier to find. And finally in order to due the last change I had to move the picture of the statue of Gautama lower thus creating less empty space next to the table of contents.</p>

<p>I have posted a link, which is very relevant and scholarly, several times and it has been removed every time. Is this a propaganda page of Buddhism, or a serious page that shows all views and sides of the issue? The articles on Christianity and Islam are actually more fair and balanced than this article on Buddhism, which is quite surprising.</p>
<p>The article which I have linked "Friendly Feudalism: The Tibet Myth", is critical, but fair and factual, about Buddhism in Tibet. Indeed, the article actually quotes the Dalai Lama of Tibet!</p>
<p>This link is: #1 scholarly, #2 a unique perspective compared to the other links #3 informative #4 balanced.</p>
<p>Please see to it that this link, which is much needed to offer a balanced view, is not removed.</p>

<p>I took the "up to 708 million" reference from this page. It derives from the numbers at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_by_country.html" title="Buddhism by country">Buddhism_by_country</a>, which in turn were edited a year ago to reflect estimates of the Chinese Buddhist population which are dramatically at odds with other sources and which were clear violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The number at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_by_country.html" title="Buddhism by country">Buddhism_by_country</a> is now about 416 million, much closer to adherents.com, and I would guess that estimates for other countries on that page were also changed. I fixed only China and North Korea and don't have time to look at the rest.

The association promotes well being, equanimity, non-harmful behaviour and tolerance amongst people and respect for all sentient beings.

<dd>Greetings, and welcome to Wikipedia. Yes, if an article is "semiprotected," it can only be edited by established users (those with a login account and a certain amount of edits, I believe). Articles are usually not protected or semi-protected except to prevent vandalism by anonymous users, and then (usually) it is only a temporary measure. The optimum solution is to make a login account--if you are not able to do so or do not wish to do so, article protection is usually temporary. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 02:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Christian terms predominantly derive from <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and Western vernacular instead. My point is, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> Buddhism was <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinicized.html" title="Sinicized">Sinicized</a> by the Chinese during 1st century AD and nearly all surviving scriptures of Mahayana come directly from Chinese sources, which use the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a> to express Mahayana Buddhism, and rarely full transliterations of Sanskrit. It was the Sinicized version of Mahayana that then spread to the rest of East Asia, not the Sanskrit version. The Chinese, Japanese and Koreans all use the same set of Chinese terminology for Mahayana which often differs greatly from the original Sanskrit. Many new sutras and commentaries were written indigenously in Chinese. Yet this English Wikipedia article uses the Sanskrit terms exclusively (even putting cute but unnecessary little accents on the Sanskrit words). <strong>The reality is that Mahayana Buddhism is practically <u>extinct</u> outside of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinosphere.html" title="Sinosphere">Sinosphere</a> East Asia</strong>, but from reading this article, you would have the impression that it is still fluorishing in the subcontinent, and that there is somehow an Indian Mahayana and a Chinese Mahayana, and their only difference is one of translation. This is simply not the case. Even though Christianity might have started its humble roots in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, it doesn't mean that Aramaic should be the primary language used to introduce the concepts of Christianity, which for all purposes was compiled and developed by the West, and not in the Middle East. The same applies for Mahayana Buddhism vis-a-vis China. This article on Buddhism is entirely too Indian-centric. As an East Asian Buddhist, I feel that my reading this article on Buddhism and particularly parts of Mahayana Buddhism is the equivalent of a Christian reading an article on Christianity but finding that the article is mostly about the early Jewish origins and practices of Christianity. While it may be factual, the balance is clearly off. I have tried to slightly correct the balance a little bit, but much more work needs to be done on this article. --<a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENaus_0123.html" title="User:Naus">Naus</a> 06:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is kind of beating around the bush. The vast majority of Mahayana Buddhism (in the magnitude of 180 million) is taught and expressed in Sinitic (Sino-XXX) forms, not in Sanskrit. Thus Sanskrit is alien to 99%+ of the world's practictioners of Mahayana Buddhism, so it's really strange indeed that Wikipedia previously used only Sanskrit in sections about Mahayana and spent maybe about two sentences introducing East Asian Buddhism, which is essentially what Mahayana is all about today. Very disingenious IMO. The Chinese development and propagation of Mahayana Buddhism is incredibly significant. East Asian civilization would be greatly different had the Chinese not embraced Mahayana, and Mahayana would have just became an obscure apocryphal form of Buddhism, and not the dominant tradition it is today. --<a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamin27_65ea.html" title="User:Mamin27">Mamin27</a> 17:53, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Parenthesis can be used to insert Chinese characters. You have Pali/Sanskrit here, how many people read Sanskrit in its Indic script? I would wager a lot less than the number of people who can read Chinese characters (which would include most East Asians). Indic scripts like Sanskrit can't even be displayed on most Western PCs, while most PCs can display East Asian scripts. I am not saying every single Sanskrit term should be accompanied with Chinese characters, but the terms relevant to Mahayana Buddhism should be. The person who continues to delete my insertions is not being sincere with himself. Mahayana can claim 180 million followers only because of its Sinicized form. You take the Sinicized form away from Mahayana, you would be lucky to have 500,000 followers.</dd>

<dd>The Sanskrit/Pali terms in this article are also transcribed with accent marks. There is nothing "English" about them; English avoids accents like the plague. These accent marks should be removed from this article except when first introduced as pronunciation guides in parenthesis. This is why this article is disingenious. This article spends so much effort in making Buddhism appear Indic, which is quite ironic considering that Buddhism is overwhelmingly practiced outside of the Indian subcontinent and outside of Indic languages today. This article isn't just about the History or Origins of Buddhism. It's supposed to be a general article about Buddhism as a major religion in the world.

<p>The Indic characters exist because the names/terms are Indic in origin. If Buddha, dhamma, sangha etc are Indic words, they have to be written as they are, regardless of Mahayana Buddhism now being practised elsewhere. Tomorrow, China might become non-Buddhist and Portugal may become Buddhist, we can't change all these terms to portugese and give them representation in this general article on Buddhism. Probably you are looking at an article like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_in_China_d6cd.html" title="Buddhism in China">Buddhism in China</a> to place Chinese terms and characters in.

<dd>I would suggest using the same format as the Encyclopedia Britannica, where the article on Bill Clinton contains the following: "born August 19, 1946, Hope, Arkansas, U.S."; "byname of William Jefferson Clinton"; "original name William Jefferson Blythe III". To me, it is simply incorrect to say that someone is born with a name, unless they have in fact been named before birth (which of course is possible now that the sex of a baby can be determined before birth). It would not matter if there was no room for misunderstanding. But there is. For example, babies are not always named immediately after birth. The vagueness of an expression such as "born John Smith" becomes more apparent, I think, in cases where a child is not named until a week, a month, a year after birth. I have read of such cases. The Britannica usage remains clear under this circumstance, but the current Wikipedia usage does not. — <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipholbeck_45a7.html" title="User:Kipholbeck">Kipholbeck</a> 02:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some views:</p>
<p>1.) Gautama was not a Buddha. Gautama was the person before the enlightment. After enlightenment, he became, Buddha. He no longer referred to himself as Siddartha or Gautama. In the northern tradition he is referred to as Sakyamuni. (Muni - sage or wise one. Sakya - the clan from whence he came.) Therefore, Sakyamuni - The sage of the Sakya Clan. This is how he was traditionally referred to. It is important to note the distinction between the person he was - Gautama - suffering in this world and what he became, the Buddha - freed from suffering. This distinction is clarified by the name applied to him. One could say along broad similar lines a single woman drops her maiden name and adopts her married name to clarify the distinction between her previous status and her present.</p>
<pre>
This removes any ambiguity about who she was then and who she is now.
</pre>
<p>2.) This religion (Buddhism) was not founded by Amitabha Buddha, Tibetan Bodhisattvas, or any other divine beings. It was founded by Sakyamuni Buddha. From his enlightenment, his insights, his expounding the living Dharma, the Buddha Dharma, this great religion came into existence. He was the founder of this religion, and spent over 40 years of his life spreading the teaching, sharing what he had discovered, and helping others. Some of these teachings included revelations on other Buddhas existing in spiritual realms. These further teachings, make up parts of the Mahayana. Therefore it is important that all general or generic references to "The Buddha" refer to "Sakyamuni Buddha", the Buddha of this age, and not any other Buddha.

<p><br />
I intend to change most occurrences of "Gautama Buddha" to "the Buddha", because I think this will make the article easier to read and understand for people unfamiliar with Buddhism. At present, both the above terms are used where just the latter would do. The first occurrence of "the Buddha" will link to the article on Gautama Buddha. <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipholbeck_45a7.html" title="User:Kipholbeck">Kipholbeck</a> 00:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that's fine, although we should be mindful of the pitfalls, which are that a not-terribly-overlong treatment of Buddhism will mention some other buddhas, such as <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amitabha.html" title="Amitabha">Amitabha</a>, who eclipses <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakyamuni.html" title="Shakyamuni">Shakyamuni</a> in some strands of Buddhism.

<dd>I support the mention of the Buddha for Gautama Buddha. In common language, people also say the Buddha, referring to Gauatama Buddha, while they frequently have not heard of Gautama.

Oppose. Gautama Buddha isn't the only Buddha. If you want to make this article easier to read, first remove all those stupid macron accents on every one of these Sanskrit/Pali Buddhist terms. Others have said in their argument against my Chinese characters in parenthesis for the Mahayana section that "this is an English Wikipedia"; well newsflash for these people, full Sanskrit transcriptions with accents used in <b>in-body text</b> isn't English either. It's like writing Tokyo as Tōkyō throughout the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> article. Which would be ridiculous.

<dd>The texts of the Pali Canon are present (sometimes incompletely, and sometimes in modified forms) in the Canons of the Mahayana schools as well. As such, ATI is a commonly cited source of information about basic Buddhist teachings (the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Paticca Samipada, The Fire Sermon, etc.) that are common to several traditions. Besides this fact, if there were comperably comprehensive sites for other specific Buddhist traditions, I don't see any reason why they ought not be linked off of the Buddhism article. If we're going to give people an overview of Buddhism, linkage to comprehensive intros and translations for the major traditions would be nice to have. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 09:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oh, come off it. Of course this is an international website. But the linked site gives a lot of international news about Buddhism and information resources. If Wikipedia were purged of every link that was tainted by being "geared" to a less than perfectly international group then Wikipedia would be considerably impoverished. The fact that the links were deleted without explanation makes me wonder if the editors think that Americans are incapable of being good buddhists or have nothing to contribute to international buddhism. A site like Wikipedia becomes international not by limiting itself to perfectly international sites, but by including enough diversity to become international. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 02:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It could be a paraphrase or alternate translation of the end of the Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta (MN 63): <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html" class="external free" title="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html</a> --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 21:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The end of that Sutta goes like this: "And what is declared by me? 'This is stress,' is declared by me. 'This is the origination of stress,' is declared by me. 'This is the cessation of stress,' is declared by me. 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress,' is declared by me. And why are they declared by me? Because they are connected with the goal, are fundamental to the holy life. They lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, Unbinding. That's why they are declared by me. So, Malunkyaputta, remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared, and what is declared by me as declared."</dd>
<dd>The paragraph with the quotation in our article goes like this : "The aim of Buddhist practice is to put an end to the sorrow (dukkha, Sanskrit/Pali: दुक्ख) of existence. In the words of the Buddha: 'I teach one thing and one thing only: suffering and the end of suffering'. To achieve this state of the end of suffering (Nirvana or Nirodha), adherents train and purify the mind by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, eventually arriving at an understanding of the true nature of all things. In this way all ignorance and unhappiness ends, and liberation is attained."</dd>
<dd>First, I object to the use of quotation marks for such a paraphrasal quotation. Second, it seems that there is a misinterpretation : the paragraph in our article states that the Buddha teaches nothing else than the four noble truths, and especially that there is no other aim in Buddhist practice than the aim of the noble eightfold path to end dukkha, while in fact Buddha's teaching concerns many other things, and the main goal beyond the end of dukkha, he says, is the holy life, enlightenment, nirvana etc.</dd>
<dd>In other words, though suffering is an important concern in Buddhism, it is a secondary, subordinated, concern and it is misleading to represent it as if it was a very first, supreme or even exclusive concern (as it tends to be represented, especially in some Westerners' perception). Therefore, I propose to change the paragraph somewhat, yet I don't know how exactly. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Daoust_2eac.html" title="User:Robert Daoust">Robert Daoust</a> 18:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's say it so then! There is this paragraph (a bit modified by me) which was removed from older versions of the Article, and with which something could be done perhaps: "While Buddhism does not deny the existence of supernatural beings (see for instance <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html#Mahayana" title="Buddhism">here</a>), it does not ascribe to them power for creation, salvation or judgment. Like humans, they are regarded as able to affect worldly events, and so some Buddhist schools associate with them via rituals (see for instance <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>)." (but rituals are addressed to the Buddha also...). Strangely there is not a word on rituals in the whole Article!</p>
<p>And then, a short sentence would be necessary also about meditation...</p>
<p>Also, Buddhism is said to be a psychology, but the Article doesn't show it at all either. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Daoust_2eac.html" title="User:Robert Daoust">Robert Daoust</a> 17:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nibbāna, according to the definition, is 'freedom from desire' "Nibbāna constitutes the highest and ultimate goal of all Buddhist aspirations, i.e. absolute extinction of that life-affirming will manifested as greed, hate and delusion, and convulsively clinging to existence; and therewith also the ultimate and absolute deliverance from all future rebirth, old age, disease and death, from all suffering and misery." The deliverance that is mentioned in the definition is not absolute, as stated, with its inferential "therewith." Rather, it is relative and depends on a change of attitude or perspective, resulting from the extinction of attachment, grasping, craving, desiring, and willing.</p>

<p>" ' Master, tell us about Nirvana,' Mahatmi asked the Blessed One. The Buddha replied: ' The word "Nirvana" has many different meanings for different people —' " (<i>The Diamond Sutra</i>, "Nirvana", Concord Grove Press <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-88695-004-X</a>) It appears that the word <i>Nirvana</i> quickly became ambiguous after it was first spoken and began to stand for multiple concepts. After 2500 years of translation, by many writers in many countries, it is almost empty of meaning. This very fact is celebrated in Mahayana Buddhism and in Nagarjuna's psychology.</p>
<p>Siddhartha Gautama Sakyamuni, one of many "Buddhas" or enlightened people, did not write. His words were later recorded by different people and were further communicated and translated by many more throughout the millennia. This is like a sentence that is passed around a room through a dozen people and ends very differently from what it was at the start. The importance of preserving original written texts becomes evident. Religions and philosophies start with an individual's spoken or written words and from there the thoughts deteriorate when they are sifted through the minds of lesser persons. Thus endless textual criticisms and commentaries come into existence.</p>
<p>As a result, I despair of reaching an agreement as to the meaning of <i>Nirvana</i>. If Siddhartha had clearly and distinctly written his thoughts and if those writings had been preserved intact, then there could be no arguments about meaning. The <i>Dhammapada</i> is as close as we can come to a record of his words. But, even that does not have precise clarity in its definitions. Therefore, I withdraw my protest and I submit to the reality that Nirvana can mean extinction of desire, extinction of existence, immortality, deathlessness, joyous pleasure, liberation, emancipation, enlightenment, wisdom, purity, the uncreated, the opposite of Samsara, the untrodden realm, perfect contemplation, infinite being, selflessness, insight, truth, deliverance, salvation, oneness with reality, illumination, love for all creatures, a Seattle grunge band, etc., etc., <i>ad infinitum</i>. <i>Sal si puedes</i> and let the Devil take the hindmost. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 15:00, 4 December 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<p>Some comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this article, sometimes half a line is spent on Sanskrit AND Pali transcriptions for existing English terms such as <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Noble_Truths_6562.html" title="Four Noble Truths">Four Noble Truths</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutra.html" title="Sutra">sutras</a>. This to me is a serious problem of clutter.</li>
<li>Many of theravada's <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali.html" title="Pali">Pali</a> transcriptions are unnecessary. For example, Pali's transcription of <i>sutta</i> for "<a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutra.html" title="Sutra">sutra</a>" (Sanskrit: sūtra); and <i>nibbāna</i> for "<a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana.html" title="Nirvana">nirvana</a>" (Sanskrit: Nirvāṇa). If people feel that the Pali transcriptions are necessary to this article, then I demand Chinese transcriptions as well. Obviously people had a problem with having Chinese transcriptions for Sanskrit words, then why do they not have a problem with using Pali transcriptions for a Sanskrit word like Nirvana? It doesn't really matter that Classical Sanskrit is younger than Pali, the word English word Nirvana came from Sanskrit.</li>
<li>There is a lot of linkage redundancies in this article as well. Not every occurrence of the word "Sanskrit" needs to be linked. Links should be used for the first occurrence only.</li>
<li>Over-zealous Indic transcriptions and word linkage makes this article appear very messy and dense. Yes, it's a style issue. But style issues are important too.</li>

<dd>Personal attacks, eh? Did I say adding Chinese transcriptions would improve clutter? No. The argument is that Pali is unnecessary already, and if you feel that Pali transcriptions should be used for this article, then you have no argument against Chinese transcriptions. Do you deny that clutter is not a problem for this article? Instead of making personal attacks and beating around the bush, perhaps you could directly address some of the issues I presented above. That would be an indication of maturity. --<a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENaus_0123.html" title="User:Naus">Naus</a> 03:50, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that there is a good reason to have both Pali and Sanskrit transcriptions for the most common terms and limiting it to that. If you are reading an article written in English about Buddhism, you are likely going to be seeing the technical terms put in either Sanskrit or Pali unless it is a very technical piece of writing. The similarity of the two languages is often confusing for newcomers- is 'dhamma' really a different word from 'dharma', is it different language, a different transliteration, etc.? I wouldn't favor expanding the number of translations- we have some clutter issues already with this article, and terms in specific languages are more likely to be of interest primarily to people who are particularly interested in a specific tradition- thus better kept with the 'Buddhism in XX' articles, or maybe even a language-specific vocab list- 'Buddhist Terms in XX' or something. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 08:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the sensible thing to do is to say in the article itself what practice we are following and why. Specifically, if we are talking about general Buddhist technical terms that we feel need to be given in a foreign language, then that ought to be Sanskrit, purely and simply because that's the general practice of western scholars, even though actual Buddhists don't do that, except in nepal.

<dd>I agree with Naus that style issues are important. The article has various stylistic defects, amongst its various other shortcomings. Clutter is one problem, and redundant overlinking and redundant cross-translation of terms is another. I would suggest that we can't make a single one-size-fits all rule for which languages to include in the article, but we can establish overall <i>principles</i> for which to include, and then apply them on a case-by-case basis.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Clay that Sanskrit and Pāli terms of jargon are the ones our readers are most likely to be familiar with. Theravada writers tend to avoid using Sanskrit terms, because they think that the Buddha specifically prohibited teaching dhamma in Sanskrit. Other writers are quite likely to use Sanskrit (if not an English translation) in English, regardless of their regional backgrounds. If we were to include a third language, we might be better off with Tibetan, which might occur in English writings more commonly than any of one reading of the equivalent Chinese characters. On the other hand, Tibetan is problematic because non-specialists are likely to recognise some phonetic spelling instead of the Wylie romanisation, but there is no consensus system for Tibetan phonetic spelling.</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to say that we should include Pāli equivalents for some of the more important terms used here, particularly those that are not conventionally translated into English. For instance, it barely seems necessary to give the Sanskrit for "Four Noble Truths" and "Eightfold Path", let alone the Pāli, because this concept is almost always expressed in English; specialists will already know what "Four Noble Truths" is in Sanskrit and non-specialists won't care. On the other hand, we <i>do</i> need to mention that <i>sutra</i> is <i>sutta</i> in Pāli, because we are going to use the term <i>sutta</i> every time we mention the name of a sutra from the Pāli Canon—on the other hand, we're never going to refer to a Mahayana sutra as a <i>jīng</i> or a <i>gīng</i> or a <i>kyō</i>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think that's an excellent point- I'd be in favor of cutting down the number of foreign transliterations to a minimum in the main Buddhism article, and including them instead on the individual pages. The few terms that are typically referenced in Sanskrit and Pali (karma, dharma, sangha, bodhi, bodhisattva, arhat) can be put in Sanskrit with the Pali version (where it differs and is relevant) as a parenthetical. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 08:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of nagari in this article is very haphazard. In a number of cases it is used for the Pali but not the Sanskrit, which is ridiculous: scholars always use latin script for Pali, but often nagari for Sanskrit; Indians use nagari or other local script for Sanskrit (and Pali); Theravadins use local script for Pali (and Sanskrit). I've deleted these cases, and also those where the nagari is actually wrong. Peter jackson 18:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think the statement in the article is correct for Buddhism as a whole. The Yamaka mentions those who will not attain the path, though I suppose that might be interpreted as implying that they could but don't.

<dd>Thanks to Stephen for correcting my memory. If we remember that there are 3 grades of bodhi, its attainment is always combined with nirvana (&amp; vice versa), at least according to Theravada. On the actual text here, the wording is in fact a statement about what the Buddha said, and should therefore be deleted or reworded, like all such, since there are no "facts" of this sort in the wiki sense; that is, there are sceptical scholars who doubt all such statements (see Gombrich, <i>Theravada Buddhism</i>, 2nd edn, Routledge, London, 2006, pp20f), so they cannot represent a scholarly consensus.

<p>The section on this seems rather unclear on whether it is talking about all 3 senses or just the highest. Taken literally it seems to be all 3. In that case I'm not sure whether the statement about enlightened people being free from the round of rebirth is correct. The orthodox Mahayana view is that arahants remain in samsara; but perhaps they do that voluntarily, so could be said to be free. Perhaps someone with a knowledge of Mahayana can clarify this.

<dd>You are all, of course, right that it is asinine for editors to label the change from "recognise" to "recognize" as a correction of spelling. One notes that the editor in question here is a complete newbie who probably doesn't know much about how we do things here.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The rule on Wikipedia for most articles, including this one, is that spelling should be consistent throughout the page; i.e., it should either use all British spelling or all American spelling. If an editor introduces words which are written in the other spelling convention, then other editors should correct the style to make it consistent with the rest of the article. In practice, this means that the spelling used in the earliest fleshed-out form of the article is the official standard for that article permanently.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, which spelling should this article? At present, it seems to be split. Looking back at earlier versions, it appears to me that, on January 1, 2004, this article used mostly British spellings. A year earlier, on January 1, 2003, it was quite short and doesn't provide much of a sample to look at. I would be fine with switching the whole article to British spelling. We can do that, but we should discuss it first, and it should apply to the whole article.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 00:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the -ize / -ise forms, my Oxford Dictionary lists words like "recognize" under that spelling and just notes the -ise alternative. In other words, -ize is not flagged as US usage. Thus, some -ize forms are typical of US English, but not all. Personally, I always use -ize forms because I happen to like the letter zed. But I agree with Tony above: correct well-written English should be the desideratum, although I naturally prefer British English spellings when a choice arises.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The introduction to this section is true, indeed understated, but very misleading. In fact every school of Buddhism would accept most of these doctrines, but I don't think any form of Mahayana treats them as central, and some forms treat them as very peripheral indeed. If we want a genuinely shared (by most of Buddhism) core of teaching, I think it would be something like this: karma and rebirth in the five or six realms; faith and devotion; the five precepts; the monastic order; some form(s) of liberation and/or enlightenment reached usually by some form(s) of meditation.

<p>The article seems very confused about classification, using different schemes in different places. It seems from the sources I've consulted that most scholars classify present-day Buddhiosm into three main traditions: Southern, Eastern and Northern (terminology varies). If this is so then presumably, by the rules of the game, we should do likewise. As regards the overall organization of the article, I would suggest that most readers looking up Buddhism will be mainly interested in what Buddhism is now, rather than its history. Therefore i think the large Indian section that currently dominates the article should be drastically curtailed, while the very brief sections on the living traditions should be greatly expanded.

There are a lot of people who prefer to strip away the "supernatural" and religious elements from the Buddha's teaching and then say that "Buddhism" is not a religion at all but a rationalistic philsophy. The fact is that Buddhism contains both religion and philosophy. But to say that Buddhism as a whole (including the Mahayana expression of it) is not a religion is simply inaccurate and wrong. Hope that helps! Best wishes from Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 18:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>In general the word religion means something that tries to know what God wants and tries to do that. In this sense Buddhism is not a religion. It is only about the individual helping themselves to salvation / liberation, and there is no need to ask for any divine help. This does not mean that Buddha denied the existence of Gods and Angels (Brahmas and Devas) as he did not. But he did state that they too roll in samsara and so are also subject to suffering. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 09:46, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would really like to see something of general feeling the preceding text to my own included in the article, which it does not so much do at this point. Buddhism's status as a religion is contested even among forefront scholars (Patrick Bresnan comes to mind in this case. I'd be glad to provide quotes from his books on Eastern thought if necessary in this case, as he is an authority on the issue.) It should be definitely noted in this case that Buddhism is to religion as tofu is to meat. It exists in companionship in its nascent state and then gleans parts of the religions which it coexists as a philosophy with to create something different. 68.96.255.13 13:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although I'm certainly not a scholar on this, I think that if you drop Buddhism as a religion for some reasons, I would think that also Hinduism, Sikkhism and Jainism suddenly would not classify as a religion anymore. Interestingly, that leaves only the Judea/Christian/Muslim traditions a major world religions - and guess what the cultural background is of over 90% of what we call 'scholars' are. I am quite convinced that for practical reasons, it is quite safe to call Buddhism a religion, but of course, it depends on the scholarly definition of 'religion'that is used. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 21:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're correct- the real problem here is that there are a blue million ways of defining 'religion', and the definition that you chose often stems from the point that you are trying to make. Someone who wants to cast Buddhism as an entirely rational philosophy will choose a definition of religion that says something about gods or the initial cause of existence. Someone who is looking at religion as a social phenomena will likely not be interested in such metaphysics. There has been, in my own opinion, a great deal of ink spent on definitional questions about whether Buddhism is a this or a that without much in the way of results to show for it. In truth, there is no general solution to the question 'is Buddhism a religion' or 'is Buddhism a philosophy', or even for that matter 'is Buddhism a psychology'; all of those depend entirely on 1) what you consider to be Buddhism (is it just what's in the sutras? Is it popular religion? Is it the Sangha? Is it meditation? Is it all of the above?) and 2) how you define what you are attempting to categorize it with. The best we can hope for, I think, is to provide in the introduction a description of Buddhism that corresponds to the popular understanding of the concept of religion, and I would tend to say that if you took someone who had never seen or heard anything about Buddhism and dropped them into a temple or monastery, they would say that what was going on was clearly religion of some sort- though there could be plenty more going on as well. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 00:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that the section of the entry which deals with Mahayana, Vajrayana Buddhism, etc., has been headed "Eastern Buddhism". I feel a little uneasy about this - as Mahayana Buddhism in its early scriptures (and important ones, like the Prajna-paramita sutras and the Lotus Sutra and Mahaparinirvana Sutra) is no more "eastern" than Theravada Buddhism. Could we come up with a better heading, do you think? How about "Expanded Buddhism"? After all, the Mahayana often speaks of itself as being "vaipulya" (extensive, extended)? Or "Expansive Buddhism"? Or "Non-Theravada Buddhism"? Maybe none of these is particularly good. I'd be interested to hear what other people might be able to come up with. Best wishes.

<dd>Terminology is very confusing. Mahayana sometimes includes Vajrayana, sometimes not. What I'm trying to do with the article at the moment is rearrange it in accordance with the way most scholars seem to classify present-day Buddhism, for which the terminology also varies. I leave to later to deal with the problem that it at present largely concerns itself with extinct Indian Buddhism. Peter jackson 10:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I salute Peter jackson's efforts to make this article more relevant to modern Buddhism. However, I'm not sure that changing the terminology illuminates more than it confuses. Readers who are familiar with a few paragraphs worth of information before coming to Wikipedia will be expecting to see terms like "Mahayana". The basic problem is that we have three <i>phyla</i>, so to speak, looking at Buddhism historically (Vajrayana, non-tantric Mahayana, and Nikayan or <i>so-called</i> Hinayana Buddhism), and we have three clusters of types of on-the-ground Buddhism, looking at Buddhism as it is exists within society today (Tibetan Buddhism, East Asian Buddhism, and Theravada). These three phyla and three clusters correspond closely to each other at present, but they are not identical. I'm not sure what the best way of arranging information about them is. Perhaps we can arrange the paragraphs so that the modern types are subsections of the historical phyla? Like so (in no particular order):</dd>

<dd>There are two problems with this. First is that the term Mahayana is commonly used in a sense inclusive of Vajrayana. The other is Shingon. Does Tibetan Buddhism identify with Shingon? Does Shingon identify with Tibetan Buddhism? Even if we try to classify by self-identification, I'm not sure what would be the result. But in any case if I understand the rules correctly we're supposed to follow what scholars say. Peter jackson 10:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to suggest that we rename the headings of the primary tradition categories from “Southern” “Eastern” and “Northern”, to “Theravada”, “Mahayana”, and “Vajrayana”. As is pointed out in the article, those are the names the traditions give to themselves. They are also the most common names given to traditions by informed outsiders. Peter Jackson says that this is the classification used by scholars, that my be so but this well-read non-scholar has never heard of this classification scheme.</dd>

<dd>Also, the line “Eastern and Northern Buddhism both call themselves Mahayana” is a little misleading. As Peter Jackson says above, “Northern” Buddhists also call their tradition Vajrayana. I think it is most accurate to say that Vajrayana is a form of Mahayana. As to the problem of Shingon, according to the Vajrayana page Shingon is a form of Vajrayana. It then fits under the Vajrayana section if we do it that way or the Eastern section if we organize it that way.</dd>

<dd>As a Buddhist practitioner, I was surprised that classification on this page accorded so little with the commonly used “yana” classification. It’s a little like calling Protestants “Northern Christianity”, Catholics “Southern Christianity” and Eastern Orthodox “Eastern Christianity” rather then what they call themselves.

<dd>This could get quite complicated. The first point is that, as I understand wiki guidelines, we are supposed to follow what scholars say. I've cited in the article four scholarly authorities who follow this classification, though with varying terminology, which i've listed in the article, along with some others I remember. There are probably other scholars who use this classification. There are also others who use different ones, such as <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i> (Macmillan, New York). I think the one I've given is the one most scholars use, but anyone who can find an alternative one used by a number of scholars, not just an individual one, can cite their authorities here and we can try to sort it out.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Now to the question of self-identification. The first point to be made here is that this too would have to be mediated by scholars. That is, if it is a fact, in the wiki sense, that Buddhists identify themselves in certain ways, that means that reputable scholarly publications must say that. It's not enough to say that this, that and the other Buddhist factional propaganda source say so. All that can be taken as proving is the self-identification of that faction.</dd>

<dd>Next, how do Buddhists in fact identify themselves? It seems to me that the first division is Theravada and Mahayana. I think Tibetans would be quite happy to be called Mahayana and lumped in with Chinese etc. So, in so far as there is a usable category Vajrayana, it would have to be a subdivision of Mahayana. The question is, how would Mahayanists group themselves within that heading? Would the Tibetans group themselves with Shingon? And would Shingon group themselves with the Tibetans? Or would they group themselves with other Japanese Buddhists? And what do we do about the presence of apparently Vajrayana practices in Tendai, in Chinese Buddhism, and possibly even in Theravada?</dd>

<dd>The analogy of Christianity is interesting. The standard practice (I haven't checked to see whether it's followed here) is to lump together all non-Catholic eastern churches as "Orthodox". I don't think they would group themselves that way. Peter jackson 10:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hallo. I have a lot of sympathy for what Seth says - basically I share Seth's experience: as a long-standing practitioner and researcher/ writer on Buddhism myself, I am not familiar with the various labels that Peter has used. I don't doubt for one second that Peter is right in saying that some scholars do use this terminology these days - so from a technical point of view and as regards Wiki policy, Peter may well be correct. I suspect that you are better informed on this than I am, Peter. I may just be displaying my ignorance here. But I have to be honest and say that I very much baulk at this rather new (?) and, I think, Western-contrived labelling system (although in the 1950s it was common to refer to "Northern Buddhism" and "Southern Buddhism", but that was later largely dropped) - it seems pointless and confusing to me. I also think it is not terribly helpful and practical in the real world, since if someone who knows nothing (or little) about Buddhism reads this "Buddhism" article and starts talking to Buddhists whom they encounter about "Northern Buddhism" and "Eastern Buddhism", most Buddhists will probably not have heard of these designations and will not be sure what the person is talking about! It is much more sensible in my view to stick with long-since tried and tested terminology, which "everyone" will recognise. So, I totally agree with Seth that it is more practical to use terms such as Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, which (while perhaps not perfect in their scope) are widely known and respected and which are what the traditions themselves call themselves. After all, those traditions also contain scholars! So I have to conclude that my head is with Peter (re. the minutiae of Wiki guidelines) on this one - but my heart is with Seth! Let's see what other people think. Best wishes. From Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 11:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think there are problems of ambiguity here. Mahayana can mean inclusive or exclusive of Vajrayana. Vajrayana can mean inclusive or exclusive of Shingon. I think the normal use of Mahayana, even in Tibet, is the inclusive one, with Paramitayana in the exclusive sense. The Nyingmas have a ninefold scheme: Shravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Paramita and 6 grades of tantra. Shingon has a tenfold scheme (or 2 of them, as I've seen 2 different versions), though this includes non-Buddhists. The point is this (or a point anyway). Can we establish, by using reputable authorities as defined by WP, exactly how the different Buddhist traditions identify and group themselves? I suspect the true, but not necessarily provable, answer is that Buddhists divide themselves into Theravada and Mahayana, and that Mahayanists divide themselves into Tibetans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Zen, Pure Land, Nichiren, Tendai, Shingon etc. Peter jackson 12:02, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that there's a lot of complexity to this. If we're talking about how Buddhists identify themselves, do we mean the average man or woman who believes in some form of Buddhism, or do we some kind of religious authorities? I suspect the man-on-the-street answer to self-classification would be "I'm a Buddhist, and I'm from China", "I'm a Buddhist and I'm from Thailand", etc. Educated religious authorities presumably have some sense of context, i.e they would know whether their group is part of Theravada, Vajrayana, non-tantric Mahayana, what have you. On the other hand, they surely also know whether their group is tied to East Asia, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, or Tibet. And I don't know whether they would have had much sense of Mahayana, Theravada, etc. in the era before modern scholarship on Buddhism; perhaps they would just have called themselves "Orthodox Buddhist". However, "modern scholarship" is not something which is mutually exclusive to Buddhists or Buddhist sectarian leaders. And, furthermore, the idea of self-identification in a state of isolation from others is sort of contradictory (because, insofar as I am isolated from others, I have reason to identify myself at all).</dd>

<dd>As far as I can tell, the threeway Mahayana/Vajrayana/Theravada distinction is pretty much the default in general-readership non-fiction. How scholars typical classify things right now, I don't know. Mahayana/Vajrayana/Theravada is also a very meaningful and important way of looking at Buddhist doctrine and philosophy, and, for that purpose, it doesn't matter that the boundaries might be sometimes blurry. But, how we should describe things on Wikipedia is a more difficult question. A threeway Sri-Lankan-and-Southeast-Asian Buddhism/East Asian Buddhism/Tibetan Buddhism has a lot of explanatory power as well (assuming that we can count Vietnam as part of East Asia rather than Southeast), although it seems to ignore modern developments, such as the Buddhist revival in India and Buddhists outside of Asia.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 00:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My opinion on this issue at this point is that the best thing for this intro part of the article is to say something like: “Buddhist schools can be divided into two major traditions: Therivada and Mahayana.” And then describe how the two schools differ very briefly, what geographical they are associated with and give a short list of the major schools of Mahayana, including Tibetan Vajrayana, Zen, Pureland, etc. each with their own link (does Therivada divide into different schools also?). In that way we can use only the most accepted classification distinction (Therivada/Mahayana) in the beginning of this article and later on, or in other pages, we can go more into detail about the Vajrayana label and whether it applies outside Tibetan Buddhism.

<dd>If I may attempt to clarify my always questionable thinking with an example, might it be worthwhile to use an opening statement such as: "Buddhism's diverse manifestations can be viewed in terms of source texts, praxis, historical affiliations and regional cohesion. This article's analysis will primarily use [fill in the blank] to guide its discussion." So, if the "[fill in the blank]" is "source texts," then one might identify two schools: Theravada and Mahayana. If it's "praxis," then three: Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana. If "by region": Southern, Northern, Eastern. Maybe? <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 19:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i> gives a multi-dimensional classification in its article Buddhism, Schools of. The introductory section distinguishes three main classifications.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>movements (3 yanas)</li>
<li>monastic nikayas</li>
<li>doctrinal schools</li>
</ul>
<p>In later sections of the article we also come across teaching lineages and Tibetan monastic orders, which I don't think are the same thing as nikayas. If you want to classify by praxis, then 3 yanas sounds like a procrustean Tibetan imposition of their ideas on everybody else, rather like their 4 schools of philosophy. What sense does it make to say that Zen, Pure Land and Nichiren are all one thing in practice but Vajrayana is something different? In terms of source texts, you can't treat all Mahayana as one: some of what the Tibetans regard as the highest scriptures were never translated into Chinese, others were expurgated and most are often regarded with suspicion in East Asia.</p>
<p>On Theravada schools, there are of course different schools of thought and traditions of practice, of which those fashionable in the West are only a small proportion. There are also different monastic nikayas. However, I don't think the nikayas divide lay people, and I think Theravadins generally would regard themselves as a single "denomination" (not in the formal Western sense <a href="http://www.adherents.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> of having a central organization). In particular, most nikayas took part together in the Sixth Council.</p>
<p>Another parallel from Christianity might help clarify ideas (or confuse them even more). Eastern rite Catholics are part of the Catholic Church organizationally (their Patriarchs sit in the College of Cardinals) and doctrinally, but their traditions are Eastern: married priests etc. Peter jackson 16:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Dazzling</b> and <b>informative</b> as always Peter. And FWIW I do like the notion of a multi-dimensional classification, or at least explicit recognition of other classifications (if known) before proceeding along with just one. But, obviously, I don't share your all's knowledge or smarts on this issue. (I just happened along this thread while looking for discussion pertinent to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Template%7EBuddhism_5980.html" title="Template:Buddhism">Template:Buddhism</a>. [Hope I didn't fart up the pool too bad.]) Thanks again for the interesting education.

<p>Further to the multi-dimensional classification.</p>
<p>As has already been noted, the 3 yanas correspond very roughly to the scholars' classification, the main anomaly being Shingon.</p>
<p>The classification by monastic nikaya cooresponds exactly to the scholars' classification insofar as there is a monastic order at all: Theravada is itself, the Tibetans are Mulasarvastivada and China, Korea and Vietnam (and the very small Ritsu school in Japan) are Dharmaguptaka. Lay Buddhism in Japan, Nepal and the West is obviously excluded from this classification.</p>
<p>Doctrinal schools also fit the scholars' classification. Theravada is itself again. Tibetans all call themselves Madhyamika, though they have different interpretations. In the East Asian tradition there are two main doctrinal schools, Tien-tai and Hua-yen, which both distinguish themselves from Madhamika. In fact they use the same introductory textbook, which suggests they regard themselves as really subschools of a single school (Tathagatagarbha), which again is clearly regarded as distinct from Madhyamika. There is a small Yogacara school in Japan, which would not fit into this grouping.</p>
<p>Conclusion: the scholars' classification is a more or less good approximation to all three dimensional classifications listed above, and therefore probably a good overall classification of Buddhism; the scholars know what they're doing. Peter jackson 16:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That looks good. One correction: delete all mention of Sanskrit, as it's used even less in the Sino-Japanese tradition than in the Tibetan.

<dd>Done. Thanks! FWIW, main reason for my not including the minor traditions is my ignorance -- if you think it useful, just let me know where to stick what :-). (Out of boredom, during my lunch break, I did some worksmithing and wikifying, partly to condense the table for lower-pixelated display settings -- let me know if I broke anything.) If I may ask, if you have the time and inclination to respond, when the word "Theravada" is used for "monastic order" could this be replaced with something more specifically reflecting the Vinaya or Patimokkha? (I guess I am simply unsure to what exactly "monastic order" refers -- e.g., is it the rules governing the order?) Similarly, under "doctrinal school," could "Theravada" be replaced with something more specifically reflecting the Tipitaka?

<dd>Interesting table, Larry. Instead of "monastic order", perhaps you should make it "vinaya lineage", since "monastic order" seems to imply a <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikaya.html" title="Nikaya">nikaya</a>, of which Theravada has various. As far as I know, there is no better term to describe the Theravada patimokkha rather than simply "Theravada". You might want to change the "traditional movement" for Theravada to something like "<i>Nikayan</i> (so-called Hinayana)" to would give more context. The "doctrinal school" field is a bit of a sticky widget: Madhyamika is certainly influential in East Asia (certainly in Zen), and Tathagatagarbha is perhaps more influential in Tibetan Buddhism than in East Asian schools.</dd>

<dd>My remarks above were my immediate reaction. I now have some more considered thoughts. First let me repeat that it looks good: the tabular display is a lot clearer to the reader than saying the same thing in words longhand. However, I think certain changes are necessary. Most important, we need another line for mainland East Asian Buddhism, i.e. China, Korea &amp; Vietnam, which are not divided into schools. Then Dharmagupta must be deleted from all the 5 Japanese schools; we could leave a blank, or say "none" or "bodhisattva ordination" or something.</dd>

<p>The use of the word nikaya for monastic orders is common among scholars in referring to the early ones, including the 3 here. It works at various levels, so one can talk about the Mahasanghika &amp; Sthaviravada nikayas being subdivided into further nikayas; all 3 of ours are in the latter. Likewise, the different Theravada nikayas are subdivisions of the Theravada nikaya. Confusing, but there you are. (The same applies to schools of course.) To answer the above query, there are (minor) differences in vinaya rules between the 3 nikayas, and differences of interpretation between subnikayas.</p>
<p>Doctrinal schools. The standard term for Theravada here is Vibhajjavada, of which Theravada is the only surviving subschool. This level of generality fits with the use of Tathagatagarbha. certainly Madhyamika is influential in East Asia, but so is Sarvastivada ... The classification here is based on what the tradition generally seems to regard as the highest doctrine. In Tibet, there is a Tathagatagarbha school of thought, but it claims to be following the "true" interpretation of Madhyamika. On the other hand, both Hua-yen &amp; T'ien-t'ai clearly distinguish their form of tathagatagarbha from (their understanding of) Madhyamika. There may or may not be a real distinction, but they think (using the ethnographic present) there is.</p>
<p>Movements. I agree that Theravada is not the appropriate term here. One could use "HInayana" in quotes, with a note underneath the table to say it's derogatory. We could just say Early Buddhism or Conservative Buddhism. The problem with nikaya Buddhism is that nikaya has 2 meanings: in addition to the monastic branches we've been discussing, it is also the name of some literature. The name is commonly, though illogically, used to refer to the first 4 nikayas of the Pali Canon. As a result, some writers use the term to refer to pre-abhidhamma Buddhism, while others use it to refer to pre-Mahayana Buddhism, including abhidhamma.</p>
<p>Literature. The Pali Canon is not approximately equal to the agamas. They correspond to the 4 nikayas just mentioned, which are roughly 1/3 of the Canon. Shingon's attitude to the tantras is not the same as the Tibetan. It follows 2 tantras that are classified by the Tibetans as lower tantras. This raises again the question of whether Shingon is actually Vajrayana. Is there general agreement that it is? If not, we could base our table on the other position, which would make it a lot simpler, and add a note about Shingon. Snellgrove, in <i>Indo-Tibetan Buddhism</i>, says that the lower tantras have nothing much that was not already part of Mahayana. I don't know what scholarly opinion on this is.</p>
<p>If there's space, I suggest the region column be more specific: Southern (Ceylon &amp; SE Asia); Eastern (E Asia); Northern (Tibet &amp; Mongolia). Or something along those lines. Peter jackson 11:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Excellent</b> additions &amp; I <b>greatly appreciate</b> the additional clarifications &amp; edification. Comments/Questions:
<ol>
<li><u>Split "Chan / Zen"?</u> I removed Dharmaguptaka from Pure Land, Nichiren, Tendai &amp; Shingon. Should I leave it with Chan and remove it from Zen? If so, I'm inferring that it would be best that I then separate Chan and Zen onto two different rows -- please let me know if you envision a different solution.</li>
<li><u>End notes?</u> FWIW I'd be happy to add end notes (e.g., using &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt;) to this table so that the many interesting textual clarifications you all have discussed could be incorporated. (If you want to include this table in multiple articles, we can make it a template and then make the use of end notes conditional, for instance, with a "notes=1" parameter, depending on the style of the template-transcluding article.) Let me know if you'd like me to do such.</li>
<li><u>Ceylon / Sri Lanka?</u> If I may ask, Peter, I see you've used the word "Ceylon" (also in the article <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali_literature.html" title="Pali literature">Pali literature</a>) for what I'm used to referring to nowadays as "Sri Lanka." Would it be incorrect for me to use "Sri Lanka" here. Can you help me understand my confusion? (I'll add these phrases presently, perhaps over lunch time :-) )</li>
<li><u>Shrink font?</u> Tangentially, if we feel the table is getting too big, one quick and easy way to shrink it is to change the over all font size (for instance, to 90%) -- as it is, I'm already having to use a horizontal scrollbar ;-) I'll give this a try soon -- let me know if the font becomes too small for comfort or, alternately, if you'd like other solutions or simply would encourage me to keep using the horizontal scroll :-)</li>
<li><u>Consensus?</u> Regarding Tathagatagharba &amp; Madhyamika, Agamas, Nikaya, Hinayana -- I'd be <i>way</i> out of my league to pretend that I could contribute in a meaningful way regarding these terms. Whatever you all -- both of you whom I admire greatly -- decide is fine with me. (If I may make one suggestion: Nat, I was wondering if we could simplify "Pali Canon (≈ Agamas)" to just "Pali Canon," mostly for visual simplicity [in addition to Peter's strong reservations], but also since the Agamas are listed below this term in the table and I think anyone who clicks on or knows about the Agamas could understand the basic relationship. Just a thought.)</li>

<li>What we need is an extra line (school) for China, Korea &amp; Vietnam, which would come before Zen; I forgot to say earlier that Chan should be deleted from the Zen entry. Dharmaguptaka would apply only to the China etc. line.</li>
<li>I think a few notes are important enough to go with the table rather than at the foot of the page. In particular, it's important to point out that Mahayana is often used to include Vajrayana. Perhaps also here note the synonyms Mantrayana &amp; Tantrayana for Vajrayana. Probably some others, but those are the ones that occur to me right now. On the other hand, as you say, a lot of the technical stuff can be relegated.</li>
<li>I tend to use normal English names for other countries rather than take orders from foreign governments on how to speak my own language. We quite happily call Germany, Finland, Hungary, Greece, Egypt &amp; India by names that bear no resemblance whatever to their own names for themselves. However, I'm certainly not going to go to the bother of changing back anything someone else bothers to change. I don't know whether WP has a policy on this; in particular does such a change apply retroactively to times before it was made?</li>
<li>I personally find it extremely irritating having to scroll horizontally. The whole point of this table is to make it easier for the reader. They should be able to see it all at once. Would it help doing the table the other way round?</li>

If we're going to have a scriptures column, then it would make sense for it to mention when particular schools have clearly defined main scriptures: Lotus Sutra for Soto Zen, Tendai, Nichiren, China &amp; Vietnam; Pure Land Sutras for Pure Land; various particular tantras for Shingon &amp; various Tibetan schools. I'm not sure about Rinzai Zen &amp; Korea. This would involve splitting lines more. I don't think the different Tibetan schools are really separate "denominations", but I'm not sure.</dd>

<dd>Another possibility would be to ignore the Shingon problem in the table &amp; relegate it to a note. We could then simplify the table to have only 3 rows (or columns): 3 yanas, 3 nikayas, 3 doctrinal schools, 3 languages ... Then we could add a note to say that Shingon doesn't quite fit. Strictly speaking, nothing will ever quite fit anyway: we're talking generalizations here, &amp; they'll always turn out false under a sufficiently precise analysis (including this one?). further details can be given in the relevant sections of the article.

<dd><b>Nice ideas!</b> For now, given limited time I have (lunch time!), I'll just try to enhance the current table we've started but I'll try to find time soon to turn it on its side as you suggested Peter. The recent changes I've made include: deleted Ch'an; added China, Korea, Vietnam; added some cursory notes (including school-specific main scriptures); added country names to regions; and, drastically simplified the lefthand column's title. Questions/Comments:
<ol>
<li><u>left-column title?</u> I played with the font size (found a size of 89% worked on my current display) but was ultimately unhappy with its readability. (Maybe the simplier solution is I get glasses?) So, I changed the cellpadding from "10" (which I arbitrarily chose at the beginning) to "8" and then, taking a cue from one of Peter's ideas, changed the left-hand column's title from "major extant Buddhist traditions" to "SCHOOLS." Does this work (especially in regards to terminology!) ?</li>
<li><u>Ceylon/Sri Lanka?</u> Peter, I can appreciate what you write about. I think this type of issue has many facets: For example, I've been told that most of the world calls Myanmar "Myanmar" but the U.S. government still calls it "Burma" (see, e.g., <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html" rel="nofollow">CIA World Factbook entry</a>); so what should an English-language encyclopedia do? I bet there is WP policy but I don't know it. [Nat - you're usually <i>terrific</i> with this kind of stuff :-) ] Regardless, since the WP article is called "<a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>," the Sinhalese whose works I have read seem to refer to their country in English as "Sri Lanka," etc., and to me (with my admittedly ignorant mind) "Ceylon" still stings of British colonial times (seriously not meant to convey any personal resentment here), I'm strongly inclined to use "Sri Lanka" here. <b>Please revert</b> if you're so inclined. (One side note: "Ceylon" would fit in the table much better!)</li>
<li><u>Main scriptures in notes:</u> It might be interesting to place school-specific "main scriptures" into the table; for now, due to the limited time I have, I put some of the identified scriptures in a table note. Anyone, of course, should feel free to change this (or anything else about this table).</li>
<li><u>Shingon gone?</u> I'm still digesting this. I'm not opposed to anyone deleting it. I'm just not there yet.</li>

<dd>Peter is, of course, right that I was mistaken in saying that "Pali Canon≈Agamas"; however, I still maintain that the Pali Canon's Sutta Pitaka≈the Agamas, as a genre of literature. I was tacitly ignoring vinayas and abhidhamma/commentaries in that column (this goes back to the question which Peter posed on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinese_Buddhist_canon_e78d.html" title="Talk:Chinese Buddhist canon">Talk:Chinese Buddhist canon</a> about which writings are described as "canonical" and why). The reason I think it is important to point out the connection between the Nikayas and the Agamas is to give the viewer straightforward information on how the literatures of the different branches of Buddhism relate to each other. I'm not sure what the best way to phrase it is.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the term "Nikaya Buddhism", I could very well be wrong, but I am not aware of any writers using that term to mean pre-Abidhamma Buddhism, other than <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttasarana_61d2.html" title="User:Attasarana">User:Attasarana</a>/Ken Wheeler. The term appears to be something of a neologism popularised by Robert Thurman, so it wouldn't be surprising for it to maintain a general uniformity of meaning. In any event, if "Nikaya Buddhism" is unacceptably vague, then I don't think that "Early Buddhism" or "Conservative Buddhism" would be an improvement.</dd>

<dd>Although this is only a fairly minor point, concerning as it does a footnote, but I'm not sure how to best describe the main scriptures of the Zen sects. It's certainly true that they take the Lotus very seriously, but it sounds a bit odd to my ear that that is Soto's main scripture. I would be inclined at first blush to say instead that it is the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_Sutra_72d3.html" title="Heart Sutra">Heart Sutra</a> and/or other Prajñāpāramitā texts such as the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_Sutra_6ac3.html" title="Diamond Sutra">Diamond Sutra</a>. On the other hand, Bodhidharma is said to have recommended the Lankavatara most highly. On a related point, I wonder if we should list <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koan.html" title="Koan">koans</a> under canonical genres for Zen; the koan corpus represents an interesting and important body of literature developed within Zen. However, perhaps this would imply too fine a focus and necessitate our mentioning similar literature from other schools (if any—I know nothing of this).</dd>

<dd>PS - I quite agree with Peter's sentiment, "I tend to use normal English names for other countries rather than take orders from foreign governments on how to speak my own language." I prefer to say "Saigon" or "Burma" rather than "Ho Chi Minh City" or "Myanmar". Furthermore, it is ostensibly Wikipedia policy to use common English names, although this tends to get chipped away at by nationalists in a lot of individual cases. However, in the case of Sri Lanka, in my experience the newer name has become so common at present that the name change is a <i>fait accompli</i> and it seems artificial insist on "Ceylon". Perhaps there is some regional variation in the English-speaking world on this, so you might have a different experience.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 18:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great stuff this! We may finally be able to get this clear for everyone. A few notes if I may:</p>
<p>- Perhaps a suggestion for a minor note in the Tibetan/doctrinal school - cell; the Tibetan Jonang tradition is an exception to the rule as they follow the Tathagatagarbha school.</p>
<p>- Another comment is that I think to mention the specific sutras that some traditions emphasize is really a bit too detailed for this page, that should be mentioned in the tradition's own page perhaps?</p>
<p>- What do you mean with "If we are talking about extant traditions, then individual sects like Chan and Pure Land no longer exist."? These traditions are still very much alive as far as I know?</p>
<p>- My position on new terms like "Nikaya" and "Eastern Buddhism" is simple: why use terms that are NOT commonly used. In my view, language only functions when many people are familiar with terminology, especially in an encyclopedic description, I don't like to be confronted with terms that only a few scholars on this planet use, and, as you noted, who knows what these new terms exactly refer to? To me it just leads to more confusion?</p>
<p>- The entry "China, Korea, Vietnam" is not a school - this looks confusing to me... <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 23:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's quite true that Chan and Pure Land are still very much alive ... but, outside of Japan, they are no longer distinct schools. Basically, the Buddhist tradition of China (and, I believe, Korea and Vietnam in different iterations) is an amorphous mixture of primarily Zen and Pure Land, with lesser but quite significant influences from tantric Buddhism, <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiantai.html" title="Tiantai">Tiantai</a>, the Vinaya School, <a href="../../../h/u/a/Huayan.html" title="Huayan">Huayan</a>, etc. So, I think it's okay to have "China, Korea, Vietnam" listed, because it has no sub-branches, above the level of individual monastic orders (and I'm not sure those even exist in China).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "why use terms that are NOT commonly used?", I generally agree. However, in this instance, that implies that the term we should be using is "<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinayana.html" title="Hinayana">Hinayana</a>". I think we should make an exception for terms that are considered to be derisive or demeaning, which is the case with Hinayana. Our alternatives, then, are to use a term that is not very commonly used, or not to use any term at all. The latter is sometimes an advisable option, but it's not clear saying nothing will be more informative here than using a relatively obscure term would be.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 00:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beginning to need a score card :-) Some quick edits (feel to revert one &amp; all) &amp; 2 Q:
<ul>
<li><u>Pali~Agama take 3:</u> As an alternate configuration, I moved the "Pali Canon (≈Agamas)" matter to a table-note attached to the first instance of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamas.html" title="Agamas">Agamas</a> -- Nat, please revert if annoyed!</li>
<li><u>Lotus sutra cut back:</u> Given Nat's reservation and based on what's written at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_texts.html#Saddharma-pundarika" title="Buddhist texts">Buddhist_texts#Saddharma-pundarika</a>, I restricted the reference to the Lotus Sutra's seminality to just the Tendai and Nichiren schools</li>
<li><u>Mainland school?</u> I'm sympathetic to Rudy's concern re: "China, Korea, Vietnam" not being a "school" (my bad?); do they qualify as a "tradition" (simple word change), or is a more sophisticated accommodation available? [FWIW, wrote this before Nat's above edit!]</li>
<li><u>#-ordering?</u> I'd like to order the table's "Notes" using "#" instead of hand-numbering (1, 2, 3...) -- if nothing else, so the associated text would be appropriately formatted (where the first line is left-justified and subsequent lines are indented) but the #-defined numbers get reset due to the two "*" (asterisks) in one of the end notes; any suggestions on how to prevent post-* #'s from resetting?</li>

<dd>Hi Nat, regarding the Chan and Pure Land traditions, I may be wrong, but think that at least in Taiwan these traditions are very much alive still, and probably also in Hongkong. See for example the second paragraph in <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/pureland/foundationsofethicsandpracticeinchinesepurelandbuddhism.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/pureland/foundationsofethicsandpracticeinchinesepurelandbuddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/pureland/foundationsofethicsandpracticeinchinesepurelandbuddhism.htm</a>.</dd>

<dd>Re the problems of the word Hinanyana, you are right; we can usually come around that as the Theravada is the only remaining living school of the non-Mahayana schools. We only get into a theoretical problem when talking about history and the various philosophical schools within Buddhism; there used to be more "Hinayana" traditions before Buddhism became extinct in India. At least for this intro to Buddhism, we should be able to avoid Hinayana or Nikaya I would think? <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 11:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One last question: Is there a basis for the <u>current ordering of Japanese schools</u>? Frankly, I stuck Shingon at the end of the list to allow easy inclusion of it with Tibet in the Vajrayana category; otherwise, I think I just used Peter's earlier ordering. Is there a chronology to the current ordering (as is done overall with Theravada-Mahayana-Vajrayana?) or could we base it the number of existing practitioners?</dd>
<dd>Regarding "Hinayana" -- as a Theravada practitioner (who obviously needs to work more on <i>upekkha</i>), <b>ouch!</b> (which I think essentially concurs with Rudy's view). Though, of course, I defer to whatever a more considered acedemic perspective would dictate. (Feeling a little like Job before the whirlwind here ;-) )</dd>
<dd>Also, following up on prior ideas about changing the table's axes (making the rows "classifications" and the columns "traditions"), after seeing that this could become equally wide as the current table unless we list each of the school names vertically, I've decided to hold off on this indefinitely. However, if anyone wants to still see what such looks like, please let me know and I'll try to find the time to do so.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I just got around to inserting "Vibhajjavada" under the Theravada doctrinal school -- <i>thanks again</i> for the education Peter!</dd>
<dd>Thanks too to Nat &amp; Rudy for your on-going analysis &amp; discussion as well.</dd>

<dd>Rudy: I'm not saying that there is no Chinese Pure Land Buddhism, but only that there is no Chinese Pure Land Sect. The article you've linked to actually says as much in the conclusion: "... there never existed a Pure Land 'school' as such in China, at least not in the achievement of institutional independence that the various Pure Land Schools enjoy in Japan. Ven. Dr. Shengyan (聖嚴) points out that during the Song dynasty, most of the developments in Pure Land took place within the Tiantai school, and stressed a combination of meditation, Pure Land, and vinaya (chan 禪, jing 淨, lü 律). By the end of the Ming dynasty, he says, there was no one Pure Land "school" that had exclusive propriety over a set of practices identified as "Pure Land practice"; Pure Land became the common property of all schools ... What we call 'Pure Land thought and practice' in Chinese Buddhism could more accurately be called the 'Pure Land component' of the thought and practice of other schools, or of Chinese Buddhism as an organic whole."</dd>

<dd>As for whether to use "Nikaya Buddhism" on this table, I think that the main alternative is simply to say "Theravada" (the way it is now), which would be entirely redundant. "First do no harm" is a reasonable thought, but, in this context, I think we'd be better off giving a little information with a relatively obscure term along with a wikilink (especially since the astute reader will quickly note that <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a>'s current version of <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikaya_Buddhism_c495.html" title="Nikaya Buddhism">Nikaya Buddhism</a> veritably shouts that it is a euphemism for one sense of "Hinayana").</dd>

<dd>Larry, establishing a chronology for these different Mahayana sects would be difficult, except for the fact that we are discussing only the Japanese sects, the introduction of which was relatively late and, therefore, well-documented. That being the case, I suppose we would make it: Tendai, Shingon, Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren. However, it might still be desireable to have Shingon next to Tibetan Buddhism; I'm not sure.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 17:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lotus in Soto: Dogen (Dumoulin, <i>Zen Buddhism</i>, vol 2, p 98).</p>
<p>Remember the 1st col is movement. Theravada is not the correct name for this, being only part of it. Checking back, I see I remembered the wrong way round on nikaya Buddhism: Hirakawa uses it to refer to abhidhamma Buddhism as distinct from early Buddhism (there can't have been nikaya Buddhism before there were any nikayas). Hence this also can't be the correct name of the movement, since it can't be assumed that early Buddhism was not part of that. Another possibility would be to leave the cell blank on the grounds that the movement has no self-identification: it would say it's just Buddhism. Explain in note.</p>
<p>I suggest here we put a simplified table with only 3 rows (or cols), with surrounding text making clear it's only rough &amp; mentioning major exceptions. Move fuller table to article on Buddhist schools. Peter jackson 11:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kalmykia looks odd. I suppose we mihgt justify it on the grounds that the other Buddhist parts of Russia are contiguous with Mongolia &amp; could be considered a part of Greater Mongolia, while Kalmykia is detached. By that criterion Singapore should be added to the Eastern entry.</p>
<p>Does dzogchen really distinguish itself from Madhyamika? I don't think so. Frankly, I think this is all getting far too complicated. We can't possibly include all the exceptions in the table. Peter jackson 10:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

As for the other content-related items, way over my head so I'm gonna keep my mouth shut. (Unusual, no?) As for a new, simpler three-row table, if no one else does it, I'll try to get to it before the end of this forthcoming weekend. (Reality's been demanding more &amp; more of my attention lately :-( ) As a WP consumer, I think Peter's suggestion to include the above table in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schools_of_Buddhism_03f4.html" title="Schools of Buddhism">Schools of Buddhism</a> (and/or a similar) article has definite merit. Tangentially, I'll leave it to others in this thread to decide when it's time to cut-and-paste this (or the forthcoming) table into an actual article. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 12:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The column heading Asiatic region is inconsistent with the entry Kalmykia, which is in Europe.</p>
<p>The 3 yanas should not be used as the stub column. That is, the other entries in the table are not characterizations of the 3 yanas. Rather, the 3 yanas etc. are rough characterizations of the 3 traditions S, E, N identified by scholars.</p>
<p>I repeat my comment on Dzogchen, with some additions: its theory is tathagatagarbha (Harvey, <i>Intro to Buddhism</i>); the Jonangpas called their tathagatagarbha doctrine Great Madhyamika (Williams, <i>Mahayana Buddhism</i>, p 108). This suggests dzogchen would also call itself Madhyamika. Peter jackson 10:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't think I agree with your description of the 3 yanas as if they are descriptions of the S E N traditions. The doctrinal differences between the 3 yanas are quite clear, whereas the three regions are very rough indications indeed.</dd>
<dd>I will try to confirm from our Tibetan teacher here if both Dzogchen and Mahamudra can also be called Madhyamika. Again many thanks for trying to get to the bottom of all of this!<a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 23:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Canonical genres seems an odd sort of heading. I wouldn't call the Pali Canon a genre. The East Asian tradition would tend to regard as canonical, in addition to what's mentioned, vinaya &amp; some tantras. The Tibetan tradition, while it theoretically regards the agamas as canonical, never bothered to translate them, except for a few dozen sutras, so it seems very artificial to mention them. I would suggest the heading should be (principal) scriptures, with the 3 entries here being Pali Canon, Mahayana Sutras &amp; tantras. In the fuller table we can have Lotus etc. where appropriate.</p>
<p>This simplified table is particularly amenable to tipping over the other way, with only 3 rows to become 3 columns. This would allow more rows, e.g. date of establishment: 3rd century BCE, 1st century CE, 7th century CE. Peter jackson 10:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nice idea, Peter. If no one else gets to it before, I'll reverse the simplified table's axis (and add "date of establishment" and change "canonical genres" to "principal scriptures") sometime in the next couple of days.</dd>
<dd>Sounds like <u>open issues</u> include:
<ul>
<li><b>Kalmykia</b> - include or not? in table note with Russia? in table note with Mongolia? other "states" (e.g., Buriat)?</li>
<li><b>doctrinal schools</b> - do we include under Northern schools Dzogchen? Mahamudra? do we include Madhyamika with Eastern schools?</li>
<li>other - I feel like I'm forgetting something(s) ....</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If people's views don't converge soon then perhaps I'll try to also organize a scorecard to try to figure out who's where on what and what basis for consensus (e.g., external texts) could we identify.

<dd>"Date of establishment" gets into some very tricky historiography and can be quite contentious. Obviously, from a religious perspective, each group thinks that it was established when the Buddha lived (e.g., for Tibetan Buddhists, that would mean that 1000 BC or so). In terms of modern historical scholarship, the early history of these movements is poorly documented; we could talk about the dates when available historical evidence first attests them. It would still be unclear to me, though, what date to put for Theravada. It seems odd to speak of a Theravada in the modern sense before Buddhaghosa, but clearly it has roots that go back before the 5th century. Anyway, if we are interested in talking about existing groups only, what difference does it make when they were established?—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 17:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agree with Nat on the establishment date; one can only reliably give this to (some) specific smaller traditions/schools, but not to the general traditions.</dd>

<dd>If I can ask a really basic question that's been kind of nagging me: Is <b>Kalmykia</b> a "country" (like the United States) or a "state" (like Idaho) or (I'm guessing) something in-between? Like I'm guessing 99.98% of English speakers, I never heard of it until it was mentioned on this talk page and all my knowledge regarding it is based on a quick gloss of the WP <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalmykia.html" title="Kalmykia">Kalmykia</a> page. If it's <i>not</i> a "country," why are we considering it? Regardless, from an English speaker's (and I truly don't mean to be derisive -- after all, I assume most non-Americans don't know of the "state" in which I currently live -- nor do I think I represent the stereotypical "ugly American") perspective, for me, its relative obscurity would suggest that, at best, it be an end note (and I'm leaning towards Nat's solution of a note off "Mongolia") or perhaps left off the simplified table and included only on the original table (which might be used in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schools_of_Buddhism_03f4.html" title="Schools of Buddhism">Schools of Buddhism</a> article?).

<dd>Kalmykia's status is comparable to that of Tibet, except that it is much smaller and less historically significant. It is not an independent state, but it is an autonomous and historically distinct region of a larger state that describes itself as multinational; in this case, Russia (in practice, Kalmykia probably has considerably more autonomy than Tibet does). The Kalmyks speak their own language, which is closely related to Mongolian. That's why I think it should be a note under "Mongolia".—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 21:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 3 traditions here are being thought of here as geographical/cultural, with various dimensions. When I mentioned date of establishment, I meant it in that context: Buddhism was established in Ceylon in the 3rd century BCE, in China in the 1st century CE, in Tibet in the 7th century CE. Think of some simple way of making this clear.</p>
<p>I don't know why Nat seems to think Buddhaghosa invented Theravada. It's generally accepted (except by Schopen) that he was simply editing material centuries older. See e.g. Gombrich, <i>Theravada Buddhism</i>, 2nd edn, 2006, about pp 153-5 I think.</p>
<p>On the doctrinal schools point, I would remind people this is a simplified table. In fact even the previous version is, and this one more so. We can't mention everything, and we should make clear in the surrounding text that this is the case, as well as mentioning some specific exceptions in notes.

<dd>It's not that I think Buddhaghosa invented Theravada. It's just that Theravada has roots which I wouldn't normally describe as being Theravada all the way back, so it's hard to say at which point it develops into Theravada. However, I'm not an expert on Theravada history, so I will leave this to Peter's ministrations. Another point I'm not clear on is whether some sort of evidence, or simply tradition, supports a 3rd century BCE data for introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, this proposed addition seems better now that I understand what you mean by the date of establishment.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 17:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Above's a first stab of the 3-column table. (I held off on introducing the "Date of establishment" due to on-going discussion.) Lunch whistle's a-blowing!

<dd>With the (tentative?) addition of the "institutional establishment" row, I think we've crossed over from "classification" to something like "<b>attributes</b>." (In truth, when we added "canonical genres" I thought we made have begun this step.) Perhaps a word other than "classification" is warranted?</dd>
<dd>With such in mind, I've a wild hair (now there's a mid-West expression) to add something like "<b>pre-Buddhist culture</b>" where the first column's value might be "Hinduism," the second might be "Taoism, Confucianism," and the third would perhaps be "Bon." After you all tell me in ten ways how these factoids are wrong, what do you all think about adding such a row in general?

<dd>Just like to na=ote again that tis institutional establishment is so vague that it seems misleading to me; for example, Buddhism may have been first introduced in Tibet in the 7th century, it was really established (with the first monastery) later. It also reached Mongolia much later than that. Similar problem with eg. Japan, it came there <b>much</b> later then in China. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 00:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We haven't really discussed the ordering of what is now labeled "Classifications." For instance, I tend to like to move from concrete to abstract, thus, e.g., start with countries, dates, texts and languages, and then move to the more abstract labels like "traditional movements." On the other hand, I can see the value with starting with the two broadest classification schemes (traditional movements, and regions) and then filling out the details. Any recommendations. (Or should we just leave it as is?) Also, just another thought, we can introduce subheaders across the rows to better separate "attributes" (e.g., languages, scriptures) from "classifications" (movements, regions), eh? <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 03:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's not forget the starting point here. Most scholars seem to classify present-day Buddhism into these 3 branches. However, if you look e.g. at Bechert &amp; Gombrich, you find they classify the whole of Buddhism into 5, the others being Indian &amp; modern. So date of establishment refers to the branch as a whole, not to each country in it. The <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i> gives a 3D classification (yanas, nikayas &amp; doctrinal schools) to which this classification is a more or less good approximation. So the headings should be S, E, N. The 3 dimensions should be grouped together, with other data such as language separate.</p>
<p>The scriptures line is confused at present. If we have the heading simply as scriptures, then the entries should be something like this: Pali Canon (vinaya, sutta, abhidhamma); vinaya, agamas, Mahayana sutras, some tantras; Kanjur (vinaya, Mahayana sutras, tantras). Principal scriptures won't work as an overall heading, as I don't think you can identify them for the Theravada at least. That's why I suggested bracketing principal, so we could be inconsistent to avoid too much complication.</p>
<p>The complication point also applies to geography. We could give a quite detailed listing: Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, parts of Malaysia, Bangladesh, Vietnam; China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Singapore; Tibet, Mongolia, Bhutan, parts of India, China, Russia. This is supposed to be a simple table, so I suggest my original rough summary: Ceylon &amp; SEAsia; EAsia; Tibet &amp; Mongolia. Peter jackson 16:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS Remember again that things not in the table can go in notes. Peter jackson 16:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've made the following changes:
<ul>
<li>moved Kalmykia-related note to "Mongolia" and deleted "Russia": Per Nat and Peter and I'm guessing Rudy you won't mind too much. Klimov, is this okay with you? (If not, feel free to revert or modify with an explanation.)</li>
<li>moved Peter's "3D classifications" rows to the top and made "classification" a sub-heading row: Peter, I know you'd like to see the so-called "region" row to be the columnar headers, but I'm not there yet; I hope you see this transition as progress. Others' thoughts?</li>
<li>created "historical transmission" in-row subheader: Do you hate this title as much as me? I was just trying to find something to separate the "3D classifications" from the other rows. Too much? Any modifications welcome!</li>
<li>per Peter, changed Tibetan doctrinal sources to "<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangyur.html" title="Kangyur">Kangyur</a>": The current <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangyur.html" title="Kangyur">Kangyur</a> article was majorly re-written by Rudy (FYI). [Actually, upon closer inspection, Rudy, it looks like you did a bang up job here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kangyur&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=94515696" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kangyur&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=94515696" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> but then it was reverted. Should the reversion be reversed?] Beyond "Kangyur"'s pithiness, I made this change because I'm inferring that it's more accurate. (Let me know if wrong.)</li>
<li>changed "institutional establishment" to "movement established": warmer? Feel free to try something else.</li>

<p>The suggested previous culture/religion entries could get quite complicated. Ceylon: I don't know whether this was Hinduism; perhaps it was, since Sinhalese is an Aryan language. SEAsia: pre-Theravada religion was a Hindu/Vajrayana syncretism. China: Confucian/Taoist. Korea: I don't think Confucianism preceded Buddhism, so just shamanism. Vietnam: the whole of Chinese culture was imported together, including Buddhism. Japan: Shinto. Tibet: Snellgrove (<i>Indo-Tibetan Buddhism</i>) argues that Bon is a form of Buddhism. Mongolia: freedom of religion – shamanists, Buddhists, Taoists, Christians, Muslims, Manichaeans. Peter jackson 11:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's try to clarify scriptures. First, Theravada. Scriptures: Pali Canon, comprising vinaya, sutta &amp; abhidhamma. Principal scriptures: none in general, but some subtraditions have.</p>
<p>EAsia. No organized canon of scripture. Collected editions combine scriptures &amp; other literature, suggesting they don't consider the distinction too important. Nevertheless, there is a theoretical distinction between ching &amp; lun (sutra &amp; sastra). Scriptures: vinaya, agamas, Mahayana sutras, some tantras. However, I don't know whether they actually have a separate category for tantras or just count them as sutras. Is there a Chinese word for tantra? Stephen points out in his translation of one of the Shingon tantras that it doesn't actually call itself that. The Tibetans classify it under tantra, as they also do the Heart Sutra. Principal scriptures: various Mahayana scriptures for different schools.</p>
<p>Tibet. Scriptures: Kanjur (more than 6 times as many refs in Yahoo search as Kanjur, so the article should probably be titled Kanjur; Tibetan spelling is bKa'-'gyur), comprising vinaya, sutras (mainly Mahayana, plus a few dozen from the agamas) &amp; tantras. Principal scriptures: various tantras for different schools. Peter jackson 17:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks Larry for noticing that the Kangyur article was reverted to two miserable lines...; I reverted the revert. Not knowing any Tibetan, would not know how to spell it best... By the way, the 'Kanjur' search also gives a lot of links that are to totally diffent subjects? In Wikipedia only one text refers to the Tibetan 'Kanjur', and some 20 to 'Kangyur'.</li>
<li>I think that introducing preceding culture is not only complicated, but totally superfluous for a general article. You can only do it justice in an article on Tibet or China, not in this coarse scheme. Also, what is 'Hinduism'? Bon was quite different from Buddhism before Buddhism was introduced into Tibet, but these days, it is in 90% Buddhism... It's a too complicated subject to introduce here.</li>
<li>The Heart Sutra is certainly not regarded a tantra in Tibet: the distinction between 'the tantras' and 'the sutras' is pretty absolute! <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 21:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Lhasa Tibetan pronunciation of Kangyur is [kan.ɟur] or [kan.ɟuː] (something along those lines). Since [ɟ] is not a sound that exists in English (or most other European languages) there's no obvious way to spell it (it's written "gy" in Hungarian and "Ď" in Czech). However, it has historically been written "gy" (གྱ) in Tibetan script, so that's the more standard way to spell it phonetically. It does sound a bit like an English "j", so that's not unreasonable, either.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 22:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look in the table of contents of the Kanjur you'll find the Heart Sutra in the tantra section, not one of the sutra sections. Is China a Buddhist country? Even if we count everyone who's Buddhist &amp; ... I suspect not. South Korea, according to recent sources, is half Buddhist &amp; half Christian (including fringe groups like the Moonies). North Korea is probably not a Buddhist country either. In Japan most people give Buddhism as their main family religion, but only a minority as a personal religion. Is Mongolia a Buddhist country after a lifetime of Communism. Even in Tibet, a large proportion of the population are Chinese settlers. Vietnam has also had a long period of Communist government, and the figures some time ago gave not much over half Buddhist. Peter jackson 09:57, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I could continue this thread about the identified "Countries" for a tad, what are the criteria for a country being identified here? For instance, is it that the identified countries:
<ul>
<li>have <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_by_country.html#Top_20" title="Buddhism by country">more Buddhists</a> than other countries? (Though, if that is the criterion, shouldn't the U.S. be included before Mongolia is?)</li>
<li>have a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_by_country.html#Top_20" title="Buddhism by country">higher percentage of Buddhists</a> than other countries? (If so, should we include <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhutan.html" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunei.html" title="Brunei">Brunei</a> in notes?)</li>
<li>are/were populated by Buddhists as part of historical movements?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>If</i> the latter then I'm ready to move the country row down the list and insert something else as a header because it would then seem that listing the countries above the movements is putting the proverbial cart before the Dhammapadic ox. Any ideas? For instance, should I self-revert back to the header of "Traditions" and move "countries" and "regions" below the classification rows?

<dd>Hey Rudy! At the moment, for me, this seems relevant because in a sense I think I messed up the table and Peter's been ten steps ahead of me and I've been nothing but a decomposing albatross around his neck for the last two weeks.</dd>
<dd>To put it another way, is the basic unit of this table a "Buddhist country" (however we might define that) or a "Buddhist tradition" (or "Buddhist movement")? In retrospect, I realize now that it's the latter: when we were working on the initial table, I believe it was Peter who had identified the countries as <i>extant embodiments</i> of the <u>traditions</u>. However, when I decided to identify individual countries on top, I think I shifted the focus (at least for myself) and the notion of "traditions/movements" became secondary, as if convenient means for grouping "Buddhist countries." For me at least, if we think of this table as representing the organic evolution of Buddhist traditions/movements, then it has a different feel than if we were to simply identify existing "Buddhist countries" and then group them in different ways.</dd>
<dd>I'm gonna take a stab at addressing this wrong now: I'm gonna shift back to listing "traditions" on top and sticking the countries and regions rows below the "Classification" rows.</dd>
<dd>If anyone disagrees with this partial self-reversion, feel free to revert &amp; discuss, of course. Thanks! <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 03:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Larry, basically good idea, but the row under Traditions is now a mix of countries and traditions. I would suggest under 'Traditions' to have it read Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, then 'Traditions' could read 'Buddhist traditions' instead, and the 'traditional movement row' is superfluous. The note for Japan would go down.</dd>
<dd>Also, I completely overlooked that Tibetan Buddhism is also practiced in Bhutan, and in the Indian states Ladakh and Sikkhim, so the Indian states may be good to add to the note, but Bhutan can be added as Vajrayana country. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 16:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Rudy - your and my instincts overlap 100% on this — from the get-go, I've wanted to put Theravada/Mahayana/Vajrayana at the top of the columns (or, before, on the left-side of the rows), but I remember Peter had an objection to this (stated somewhere above). While I may quibble with some of Peter's word choices (and his preference for PTS editions of the nikayas ;-) ), I've learned again and again that he has 50 times my knowledge; so, unless I fully understand his point and have sources for a counterpoint, I'm relunctant to manipulate any of his material. Time's kind of limited for me now, so I'll try to dig out his argument from above presently (unless, Peter, you could recreate it for us here?).</dd>
<dd>And, Rudy, thanks for the additional material on Indian states and Bhutan! Excellent!

<dd>In all sincerity, my parenthetical winking-emoticon-ending comment was ill conceived. I regret that it has caused you to feel that you need to respond in any manner. It was a completely tangential thought based on when I last checked out the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali_Canon_9085.html" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> article and saw what I deduced was your refrain of "the PTS also issues a private edition of this for members only, which is its preferred translation." When I saw this statement, I incorrectly assumed that you referring to PTS English-language translation done by Rhys Davids and crowd (for instance, where the word <i>sangha</i> is translated as "the Church" -- though, don't get me wrong, I feel personal gratitude for the Rhys Davids et al. editions, some of which I know have yet to be fully retranslated [such as the Missus' Dhammasangani, etc.]) and thought you were stating that such was superior to the Bodhi-edited Wisdom Pubs editions. Upon closer scanning, I see that perhaps you're indicating that PTS has private editions of the Bodhi (et al.) editions? Regardless, while I appreciate your continued thoughtful and scholarly elaborations, I regret that my thoughtless remark caused you any negative sensations. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 20:02, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After reviewing the above discussion prior to and just after the introduction of the initial table, it appears that there was consensus (that is, two people for and no objections) using the two-fold designations of "Theravada" and "Mahayana" with a subsequent discussion of schools. Seeing the current three-fold framework in the current table, I'm reluctant (e.g., tired, lazy, confused) to make such a change at this time. Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, I've decided to do the cowardly thing and simply adopt the nomenclature of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">the article</a> itself — Southern, Eastern, Northern — and let the alternate naming conventions reside in subordinate rows (e.g., Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana) or table notes. (Aside: Should notes 3 and 5 be combined?)</dd>
<dd>Revert? Modify? Shrug? Whatever you decide to do is fine with me. I pretty much feel I'm just the HTML hack in this crowd :-) .

<dd>OK, recap. The Macmillan <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i> gives 3 senses of Buddhist "schools": yanas, nikayas &amp; vadas. The scheme (S, E, N) used by most scholars to classify present-day Buddhism seems to correspond more or less roughly to all 3 of these. Thus these 3 should be the headings of the table, with everything else being more or less rough descriptions of those. Peter jackson 09:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry for the delayed response. Frankly, as I've indicated above, I'm really out of my league when it comes to the content on this table. So, to try to better understand what the "scholars" are saying, I referenced one of the books mentioned in this article's end note regarding "scholars": Robinson &amp; Johnson (1982). (It's the only one of the listed books that I have in my home.) To my chagrin, Robinson &amp; Johnson seem to support the classification as: South Asia (that is, India), Southeast Asia, "Tibetan Culture Area," and East Asian Buddhism. Not South, North, East. So, it at least appears that there might be disunity even among the cited "scholars."</dd>
<dd>Regardless, honestly, I seem to have a brain freeze when trying to grabble with anything other than the widely understood Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana. Why change it? It's known. And it seems to make as much sense as any other scheme.</dd>
<dd>Given my ignorance, my failed attempt to understand better and the limited free time I have, at this point I'm going to withdraw from this dialog and unwatch this page. If someone needs help with HTML, etc., just leave me a note on <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">my talk page</a>.

<p>More generally on the distinction between sutra &amp; tantra, this is not at all absolute, again as Stephen points out in the foreword to his translation of the Mahavairocana. That is a tantra in Tibet, but Shingon calls it Dainichikyo where kyo=ching=sutra. Perhaps all tantras are sutras in EAsia. The large grey area is also mentioned by Sangharakshita in <i>The Eternal Legacy</i>. Peter jackson 09:38, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm talking about Tibetan Buddhism, and I'm far from convinced that the Prajnaparamita sutras are categorized as tantra, because they simply have nothing to do with tantra and they are called sutra; tantric texts are called tantras...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not to be denigrating to Shingon, but as far as I know, that tradition (as far as I know) is a mix of many different things, predominantly a Japanese shamanistic(?) tradition, Taoism, possibly Confucianism and (a bit of) tantric Buddhism. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 23:20, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Correction to what I said above. The Heart Sutra is listed twice in the Tohoku catalogue of the Derge edition of the Kanjur: no. 21, in the Perfection of Wisdom division; &amp; no. 531 in the tantra division. Similarly in the Lhasa edition (26 &amp; 499) &amp; the Narthang edition. The Peking (160) &amp; Cone (165) editions have it only in the tantra division. The reason can be given in 1 word: dharani. So even the Tibetan tradition doesn't make a rigid division between sutra &amp; tantra. Peter jackson 16:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's great seeing all the "rvv" lines in this article's history because it reflects the many generous, thoughtful and energetic WP editors dedicated to protecting this article's integrity. On the other hand, scanning the recent history page, I'm hard-pressed to find a single entry by an IP-address-designated user that isn't vandalism.

<p>I try to avoid WP frays but this one is causing a lot of churn on this article's opening sentence, so I thought I'd add some potentially pertinent thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buddhist "theory," in particular, the <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abhidhamma.html" title="Abhidhamma">Abhidhamma</a>, is often referred to as "Buddhist psychology." Thus, for instance, if you do a Google on "'Buddhist psychology' +abhidhamma" you get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=SUNA,SUNA:2005-51,SUNA:en&amp;q=%22Buddhist+psychology%22++%2babhidhamma" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=SUNA,SUNA:2005-51,SUNA:en&amp;q=%22Buddhist+psychology%22++%2babhidhamma" rel="nofollow">898 hits</a>, including <a href="http://pandc.ca/?cat=buddhist&amp;page=buddhist_psychology" class="external text" title="http://pandc.ca/?cat=buddhist&amp;page=buddhist_psychology" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and <a href="http://www.education.ex.ac.uk/dll/details.php?code=DLB02" class="external text" title="http://www.education.ex.ac.uk/dll/details.php?code=DLB02" rel="nofollow">a course at the University of Exeter</a>.</li>
<li>Buddhist methods have been used in modern psychological treatments, most notably <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_meditation.html" title="Buddhist meditation">mindfulness practices</a> have been used for instance in Linehan's <a href="../../../d/b/t/DBT_8ce9.html" title="DBT">DBT</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Kabat-Zinn_b040.html" title="Jon Kabat-Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a>'s MBSR. Additionally, there are a variety of Japanese pscyhotherapies using Buddhist concepts and methods as their basis. (A coworker once lent me a book on such. If you really need for me to track it down, let me know.) Further, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thich_Nhat_Hanh_6574.html" title="Thich Nhat Hanh">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> has an audio tape out talking about the use of mindfulness by psychologists and other mental-health practitioners.</li>
<li>The Buddha's foremost doctrine of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Dependent_Co-Arising_d1a4.html" title="Dependent Co-Arising">Dependent Co-Arising</a> is highly consistent with various schools of psychology such as <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy.html" title="Cognitive behavioral therapy">Cognitive Behaviorism</a>.</li>
<li>A last point: It has been claimed, "psychology is a science; it has ... to be proven" (Edit Summary: 08:56, 8 February 2007 Mandel). This is a mistaken notion. While it is true that contemporary American psychologists have more and more pushed for empircally tested forms of treatment (such as CBT, etc.), prior to the last couple of decades much of psychology was (and still is) untested and unproven. For instance, is Freud's notion of the Id or the Unconscious provable? Behaviorists (and many psychotherapists) would say otherwise. What about Freudian dream analysis and associated claims; for instance, has anyone tested to see if, as a client pursues psychotherapy, their dream content become less bizarre? That a psychology be testable is a very laudable goal; but, historically, is certainly not a requirement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, I would submit that Buddhist theory, methods and doctrine can be called "psychology," are used in current psychological treatment and parallel some Western notions of psychology. Hope this helps, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 14:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. Having said the above, I'd like to further suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given that even some traditional Buddhists might balk at claims that Buddhism is a "philosophy" or "psychology" in Western terms, I was wondering if the wording of the opening sentence could be changed to something like: "Buddhism is a dharmic, non-theistic religion, and has been conceptualized as a philosophy and a system of psychology." (Of course, there is the traditional metaphor of the Buddha being a doctor and the dharma providing a cure/treatment [for suffering]....)</li>
<li>If it is mentioned in the <i>introductory</i> paragraphs of this article that Buddhism is (or could be interpreted as) a philosophy and/or psychology, then there should be a subsection in the article supporting such. (Perhaps some material from my meandering ideas above could be of some use towards such?)</li>

<dl>
<dd>So what is the difference between philosophy and psychology? I'm not adversed to the psychology interpretation, but to put it in this way in a lead is potentially confusing/misleading. It makes Buddhists sound like <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychologist.html" title="Psychologist">shrinks</a>. What I actually wrote was 'it [psychology] has means to be proven'. Does Buddhism seek to employ scientific methologies to determine the veracity of its teachings? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 15:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi Mandel - I admire your thirst for truth and your obviously strong intellect. I will try to respond to your questions in a meaningful way, though I suspect you are ultimately your own best teacher.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>"What is the difference between philosophy and psychology?" I believe it depends on how you define each of these. For instance, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> would define "philosophy" differently than <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._J._Ayer_cddc.html" title="A. J. Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freud.html" title="Freud">Freud</a> would define "psychology" differently than <a href="../../../b/2E/f/B.F._Skinner_0b1a.html" title="B.F. Skinner">B.F. Skinner</a>. For me -- and maybe this is one of my innumerable flaws -- I often see concepts as tree-like things and it is best to go to their historical roots. Historically, I think many would agree, psychology was a branch of philosophy. (Perhaps it was <a href="../../../w/u/n/Wundt.html" title="Wundt">Wundt</a> who cut the umbilical cord?) Though even today of course there is still the field of "philosophy of mind" (just how do mental phenomena influence physical phenomena)? If we were to take a snapshot of "philosophy" today and "psychology" today, I think we could identify certain subjects unique to each, such as "ethics" and "metaphysics" for the former and "Jungian" and "group psychology" for the latter. But this is only a snapshot. I could live with the distinction such as "philosophy" seeks "ultimate truths" whereas "psychology" deals with "mental events," but I know <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_2cca.html" title="William James">William James</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Watson_8b65.html" title="John Watson">John Watson</a> would wag their fingers at me. Perhaps I missed your point though? (Gosh, if your question was rhetorical, I just wasted a mess of wiki-bytes.)</li>
<li>Mentioning Buddhism as a "psychology" in an article's lead "makes Buddhists sound like shrinks." I respect your impression though it's very different from my own. I'm not sure how to judge the reality of our diverse impressions in our seeking a rational assessment of a lead's worthiness. Perhaps something to revisit later?</li>
<li>"What I actually wrote was 'it [psychology] has means to be proven'." Sorry for misinterpreting what you wrote. I did not mean to intentionally misrepresent what you wrote and regret if my doing so caused any harm.</li>
<li>"Does Buddhism seek to employ scientific methologies to determine the veracity of its teachings?" I think the most honest answer is that different Buddhists do to different degrees. For instance, the Dalai Lama holds meetings between Buddhists and scientists regularly trying to maintain and nurture a mutually beneficial dialogue. (I believe that this has been written about in at least a couple of books such as <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Goleman_cf4c.html" title="Daniel Goleman">Daniel Goleman</a>'s "Destructive Emotions.") I recollect somewhere the Dalai Lama has stated that if science shows Buddhism to be wrong, then Buddhism must change.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, some Buddhists have overtly incorporated Buddhist practices in the treatment methods and have garnered widespread acclaim, such as Dr. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Kabat-Zinn_b040.html" title="Jon Kabat-Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a>'s use of mindfulness in his "Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction" (MBSR).</dd>
<dd>Of course, not all of Buddhism could be considered "psychology." Much of it is perhaps more akin to Platonic notions of philosophy (living the right life). But there are definite aspects -- such as the aforementioned <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abhidhamma.html" title="Abhidhamma">Abhidhamma</a> -- that have a significant psychological bend and that have been called "Buddhist Psychology" for over a century, positing theories about intrapsychic events. How does one go about testing such theories? For instance, when the Buddha stated that the first conscious event prior to the full perception of a stimulus is our discerning that the stimulus creates either a positive, negative or neither-positive-nor-negative feeling/sensation, how do we test this -- especially if his discrimination is preconscious (to use a psychoanalytic term)?</dd>
<dd>And, of course, Freud and the post-Freudians never subjected their theories to the scientific method either. Freud had Dora and Anna O. and Little Hans and the Rat Man. (I vaguely recall Adolf Grunbaum's "The Foundations of Psychoanalysis" including a trenchant critique of this aspect of psychoanalytical schools.) Thus there are things most people would agree are "psychology" but their adherents (and others) haven't (or couldn't) subjected them to 30 randomly selected people with a control group.</dd>
<dd>I suspect something that would really help this discussion is if someone would put forth what is meant by "Buddhist psychology" and then we could explore what is testable, what is not, and for those things that are not testable might they be deemed psychology on another basis. So, for instance, we might go through the <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abhidhamma.html" title="Abhidhamma">Abhidhamma</a> (or, something way easier I bet, the "Abhidhammattha Sangaha," such as <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhikkhu_Bodhi_104f.html" title="Bhikkhu Bodhi">Bhikkhu Bodhi</a>'s translation) and say, ask do these statements meet someone's (Wundt's? Rhys Davids'? Alfred Adler's? Aaron Beck's?) definition of "psychology"? Such would no doubt take a while, more time than I have now. (This is why I've only been making vague statements. Perhaps someone else could take us further here?)</dd>
<dd>As for why I write that some traditional Buddhist's might baulk at labeling Buddhism as a philosophy or psychology is because the Buddha himself at times would dismiss theoretical speculation as unhelpful -- he likened it to a man who has been shot by a poisoned arrow demanding to know the make of the arrow and its bow, who shot him, where was the shooter from, etc., etc., instead of just taking the antidote for the poison. The Buddha maintained that he provided the antidote (for instance, through the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Noble_Truths_6562.html" title="Four Noble Truths">Four Noble Truths</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/b/Noble_Eightfold_Path_12be.html" title="Noble Eightfold Path">Noble Eightfold Path</a>) and, in general, all else is not worth our time.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I did little more than elaborate on my answers above? Sorry for not being able to provide the authoritative, encyclopedic, highly intelligent answer you deserve ;-) As I wrote above, I hope sometime those who repeately re-insert "psychology" in the lead will provide a subsection or even an independent article that would support their position and satisfy your thoughtful and impressive intellect.

<p>I find this article to be rather too much a description of Buddhism itself, without enough critical/analytic content about Buddhism in the context of other faith systems. It provides a thorough overview of the Buddhist system, but does not provide the critical framework (including any deserved criticism) that would make it a great article. The issue noted below, with respect to the article at <a href="http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html" class="external free" title="http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html</a>, perhaps also addresses this matter.

<p>I would like to open a discussion on the addition of non-English languages to Buddhist terms. My point is that all Buddhist articles are becoming illegible because many people are currently adding non-English words even in non-Roman script in the texts: I can understand the reason for adding Pali and Sanskrit terminology (in translitteration, not in Devanagiri etc.), as these were the original languages of the scriptures, but people are now adding Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese, Sinhalese, Korean to name but a few. Should we not limit all this illegible and totally superfluous stuff; for example, the Japanese terms should be placed in the Japanese version of Wikipedia and not here, unless the terms are typically of Japanese origin such as Zendo etc. Otherwise we could go on and translate every Buddhist term here in Dutch, German and French as well....??? <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudyh01_ebcf.html" title="User:Rudyh01">rudy</a> 17:21, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>rudy, there seems to be a very good reason for people adding terminology in different languages. I did that myself many times with Tibetan terms. I also feel good when I am able to find and add Sanskrit original term that was translated into Tibetan.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I know some Tibetan terminology and from that knowledge: very very often regular translators who know Tibetan much much better than me, do not, I repeat, do not know the correct meaning of a particular term. Did I mention that it happens often? Also there seems to be a lot of meaning in <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a> of Tibetan terms.

<dd>I certainly acknowledge the reason for adding terms in the 'original' languages of the scriptures: Pali and Sanskrit, and to a lesser extent Chinese and Tibetan, but what's the use of any original script in an English text? Even most scholars of Sanskrit barely use Devanagiri, but use the transliteration, just like the Wylie transliteration makes a 'legible' Tibetan etc. For example on the <b>Dharma</b> page I read:

<dd>I'd like to suggest creating a sidebar template that allows people to put in the various translations along with standard links to something somewhere which will inform WP readers how to install the font needed to view the associated translation. It could be something relatively simple like the one to the right here. (Perhaps the links to the appropriate code pages should be on the referenced language-specific pages?)</dd>
<dd>Then, within the article text itself we could use the coding recommended by rudy perhaps. Would this meet both needs? <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 23:56, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may have come up before, but in case it has not, here is a LANG template that shows up often for Sanskrit: ([[Sanskrit]]:{{lang|sa|गणेश}}; {{IAST|gaņeśa}}). Regarding transliteration methods for Devanāgarī I hope we can agree on <a href="../../../i/a/s/IAST_856a.html" title="IAST">IAST</a> if this has not already been settled. Some on this talk page have questioned why this matters, but for those who work with the Sanskrit materials the issue is important. Also, it is good to differentiate Sanskrit (a language) from Devanāgarī (a writing system). Sanskrit can be written in various writing systems such as Bonji, Gujarati, IAST, etc., in addition to Devanāgarī. And Devanāgarī is used to write multiple modern Indic languages. Confusion often arises on other pages when Sanskrit terms are used due to differing transliteration methods. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 00:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for drawing my attention to the topic above. I am wondering if shifting some of the detail to footnotes may help with handling some of the terms. In a footnote one could show it in Klingon if you want to. For the terms that are key technical terms, others have already noted that those terms (e.g. <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a>) will often be articles in their own right, where sidebars can be used for language variations. Regarding Sanskrit and Pali, would it be true that most of the Sanskritists working with these materials would be likely to have a copy of Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary on their reference shelf? I just looked at how that is set up and he seems to have the Sanskrit and Pali variants pretty well covered. So the specialists do not need to see both versions, unless there perhaps is a key difference that is not obvious. From the average reader's perspective I am guessing that they are most likely to see simplified English transliterations of Sanskrit terms (using only the Latin-1 character set) in most of what they are reading, OR they may see IAST if they are reading an academic transliteration. I do not think you need both IAST and Devanāgarī <b>*if*</b> there is agreement to use IAST as a standard for transliteration, and the IAST LANG template is used. I do not know Chinese but I think it is kind of fun to see the characters because they remind me that these concepts may be subtle and hard to pin down. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 03:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a small tweak to the suggested sidebar box code to use the IAST template for Sanskrit. It makes clear which of the various transliteration systems are being used.

<dd>I understand your desire for the IAST template and, if I were to create this hypothesized template, I'd certainly keep in mind to include it (only for Sanskrit?). I'd like to discuss designing the new template in terms of two areas: the hypothesized template's name and its invocation within WP articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of its name, I'm torn between making a generic template (with perhaps gray, white, black colors) or a Buddhist-specific template (for instance, using the color scheme already demonstrated here). If the former, would a title such as "TranslationList" be good enough. If the latter, how about something like "BuddhistTranslations."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, in regards to invocation, I'm tempted to make something generic and infinitely expandable, so that it could be invoked like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>{{BuddhistTranslations| Pali="khandha" | Sanskrit="skandha" | Klingon="kro-lak" | English="aggregate,&lt;br&gt;heap" }}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, if I'm gonna code this, then I personally have a couple of problems/limitations with such including:
<ul>
<li>I don't know enough about the wiki-coding language to know if I could parse and process an infinitely long parameter list (i.e., does wiki-code have a DO-WHILE feature?)</li>
<li>I don't know enough about the wiki-Parser to be sure that it would provide the wiki-code both an infinite-varieties of parameters (such as, "Klingon") and their associated values ("kro-lak")</li>
<li>I don't konw if the wiki-Parser would allow the article to be associated with the identified language. For instance, if we had a translation into "English," we would want to pipe this to <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English_language</a>, not necessarily <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Soooo, a simpler template to code would be one where we knew ahead of time the allowable languages to be represented in the table, such as Pali, Sanskrit, Mandarin, Japanese, Tibetan, English, etc. (I'd be happy to pursue a sample of existing WP Buddhism articles to create the list and additional languages would be easily added to the template as needed.) This would also allow for a standard ordering of the translation (e.g., based on chronology, though I would need help from you all to tell me what that order should be!). If a parameter (such as, Pali="khandha") is not provided, then it would not be shown in the transcluded sidebar. I could probably code this in one lunch period.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, my questions are:
<ul>
<li>What title should we use for the template?</li>
<li>Should it be generic or Buddhism-specific?</li>
<li>Should it allow an infinite variety of languages or just a fixed (e.g., Buddhism-specific) set? (If the former, it might take me a while to figure out how to do it. [Anyone else of course should feel free to pick up this baton :-) ])</li>
<li>If Buddhism-specific, what order should the languages be presented in?</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<p>Thank you so much for your service on this, by the way. I am deeply ignorant of Wiki coding methods and am unable to help much on that. I am wondering if the guidance of some Wikicoding Bodhisattva can be invoked? Perhaps someone has already got a template that does this, or which can be sightly modified. I would keep the title simple, such as "Translations". I would make it generic. If you figure this out it probably could be used elsewhere. I would allow it to take any additional language through the addition of a LANG parm, the same way pages get LANG indexed in unexpected ways. At the same time, note that it probably should not be used to replace or re-invent the existing LANG indexing methods for page titles, which are invisible to the naked eye. In cases where the page is for a technical term, such as <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a> various Wikibots will do their own magic to provide unexpected translations such as those that are embedded now at the bottom of the <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">Dharma</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[[ko:법보]] [[id:Dharma]] [[it:Dharma]] [[he:דהרמה]] [[lt:Dharma]] [[nl:Dharma]] [[ja:法 (仏教)]] [[no:Dharma]] [[pl:Dharma]] [[pt:Dharma]] [[ru:Дхарма]] [[sa:धर्म]] [[simple:Dharma]] [[sk:Dharma]] [[fi:Dharma]] [[sv:Dharma]] [[th:พุทธธรรม]] [[vi:Pháp (Phật giáo)]]</p>

<p>I just noticed that those bot-provided LANG tags make the ususal identification of the <i>LANG</i> "sa" with the <i>writing system</i> "Devanāgarī". e.g., the bot wrote: <a href="../../../../sa/%E0%A4%A7/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A5%8D/%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE.html" class="extiw" title="sa:धर्म">sa:धर्म</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the quick feedback. And I appreciate your points. I'll definitely keep this in mind as a "next thing to work on" (after I'm done cobbling together in <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_sandbox1_c94c.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld/sandbox1">a sandbox</a> a half-baked <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_and_psychology.html" title="Buddhism and psychology">Buddhism and psychology</a> article). Good point too that the WP processor somehow takes [[AA:XXX]] and translates it into http://AA.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXX. (I wonder how it knows to parse the string in this manner -- perhaps the two-letters followed by a colon [":"] signals the processor?) I don't know if the code that does this parsing and concatenation function is exposed to general WP editors, but I'll try to find out. (Might you or anyone else be able to point me in the right direction?)

<dd>Well, for what it's worth, at <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_sandbox3_45c3.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld/sandbox3">User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld/sandbox3</a> I created a hideous little template that can take up to 12 parameters (that is, six language-text pairs) and displays a trivial "translation" sidebar. The transcluded sidebar to the right was invoked with:
<dl>
<dd>{{User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld/sandbox3 | Pali | ''dhamma'' | Sanskrit | ''dharma'' | English | action | Mandarin | 法 | Tibetan | ཆོས་}}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Obviously, if this was a template as we discussed it would be invoked as something like:
<dl>
<dd>{{Translations | Pali | ''dhamma'' | Sanskrit | ''dharma'' | English | '''law, teaching,&lt;br&gt;mental object''' | Mandarin | 法 | Tibetan | ཆོས་}}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is just spit on the wall. Is it really what we want? Any suggestions for improvement? Anyone know how to insert a "do while" or "goto" into the template to allow an infinite number of parameters? (Also, note that for simplicity the template code adds IAST to <i>everything</i> -- otherwise, the template code would have to compare the first parameter of a pair to "Sanskrit" -- six times. Let me know if this is unacceptable.)</dd>

<dd>It's Chinese, not Mandarin ! Mandarin is a (rather dated) term for a spoken form of Chinese (= putonghua, I think). When using Chinese characters for Buddhist terms, without indicating the pronunciation, it might be best to use the term "CJK" (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) if the traditional form of the character in question is used. If a simplified form is used, then that form tends to be specific to Chinese -- the Japanese simplified characters tend to be different from their Chinese counterparts. I'm not sure about Korean usage.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, as always, for the lesson! If I may, though, the current template is OBLIVIOUS to what the language name is being passed. For instance, it could be coded as:
<dl>
<dd>{{User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld/sandbox3 | Esperanto | Achtung | Chinese | 法 | Sinhala | සිංහල | Klingon | '''kro-LAK''' | PurposefulError | ''oops!''&lt;br&gt;(my bad) }}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As long as there's an existing [[{{Language}}_language]] article (e.g., <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese_language</a>). Though, this might pose a problem with <a href="../../../c/j/k/CJK_d1a4.html" title="CJK">CJK</a> as there's no CJK_language article or redirect — although "East Asian" <i>would</i> work as there is an <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asian_language_bfc3.html" title="East Asian language">East_Asian_language</a> redirect.

<p>Another thing I am ignorant about, but would like to less ignorant about, is Tibetan. I do not work with Tibetan and have noticed that on XP systems the procedures outlined by the standard {{IndicText}} tag do not result in correct display of Tibetan because the fonts are apparently not part of the same install. The procedures to install Tibetan Unicode fonts as given in <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_language.html" title="Tibetan language">Tibetan language</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_script.html" title="Tibetan script">Tibetan script</a> seem not to reference any pre-installed Microsoft fonts and point only to third-party fonts. Perhaps this is better in Vista, as it is with Indic fonts (in Vista it all is preinstalled). I mention this because I enjoy seeing the funny-looking Tibetan characters which look to me like Klingon. But the point for this thread is that if we are to include Tibetan script, perhaps we can include a good link on how to install Tibetan fonts that addresses the fact that the Indic script procedure does not do the job well. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 18:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is a test of the template using a Sanskrit word that requires <a href="../../../i/a/s/IAST_856a.html" title="IAST">IAST</a>. The word <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a> only requires characters in the Latin-1 charset so it is not the best demo. You may want to set a standard of putting the English term first. There will be disagreement on the English translation for some words. Also, I just looked at the code for the template, and while I do not know anything about Wiki coding language it looks to me that the IAST template is being inserted for languages in addition to Sanskrit, which is not correct. Since IAST is a transliteration method for Devanāgarī it is only applicable for languages that are written using that writing system. Here is the Tibetan line that shows an IAST template:</p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align=left style="border-bottom:1px solid Peru"&gt; [[Tibetan_language|Tibetan]]:&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align=center style="border-bottom:1px solid Peru"&gt; {{IAST|ཆོས་}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>

<dd>Yeah, this is why I wrote above:
<dl>
<dd>(Also, note that for simplicity the template code adds IAST to everything -- otherwise, the template code would have to compare the first parameter of a pair to "Sanskrit" -- six times. Let me know if this is unacceptable.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The IAST template -- which is very nice by the way, thanks for alerting me &amp; others to it -- doesn't seem to harm non-Devanagari text, but you're probably right that I should restrict it to Devanagari words. What's the best way to test for this? I guess I could simply test, based on the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanagari.html" title="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> article, to see if Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Sindhi, Bihari, Bhili, Konkani, Bhojpuri, Nepali, Nepal Bhasa, Kashmiri or Romani is the identified language -- though this might be more trouble than it's worth? (Perhaps I could create a macro to return TRUE if the identified language is one of these or FALSE otherwise?) Also, there's the problem if someone identifies the language as "Sanskrit" and then uses non-Devanagari (e.g., Roman) characters to represent the Sanskrit word. Any suggestions -- for instance, are the ASCII values of the Devanagari code set significantly incompatible with non-Devanagari words?</dd>
<dd>Secondly, regarding English words, I agree that there might be disagreement about what word is best -- or a multiplicity of possible translations; this is why, for instance, on both the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upadana.html" title="Upadana">Upadana</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skandha.html" title="Skandha">Skandha</a> pages I offer multiple English words in the sidebar. I'd encourage users doing this. As for making English the standard first translation, I intuitively can understand this desire but think it might be confusing if for instance there is no good English translation (like for Bodhisattva) or if the article title is non-English (like Nirvana), etc. So, at this point, personally, I'd like the template's users to make this decision.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your continued help, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 22:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry I missed your comment in the original post about the fact that all used IAST. I must read these things more closely. The <a href="../../../i/a/s/Template%7EIAST_1576.html" title="Template:IAST">Template:IAST</a> is only intended for use with Sanskrit, so using it with other languages may not break it but it may confuse some poor bot somewhere in the universe who is looking for Sanskrit. The IAST notation has implementations both in ASCII and in Unicode, but those implementations are not inter-operable for characters that are not in the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin-1.html" title="Latin-1">Latin-1</a> character set. Unicode is designed to be interoperable and transparent for most applications in the Latin-1 range. Unfortunately most of the good stuff in IAST is outside the Latin-1 range. Is that what you asked, or am I just rambling? <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 23:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, for example, if I understand you correctly, if I was to change all the Template:IAST invocations to Template:Unicode invocations, this would <i>not</i> solve the problem of displaying all Devanagari correctly?

<dd>IAST: {{IAST|स्कान्धास}}; Unicode: {{Unicode|स्कान्धास}}</dd>

<dd>results in:

<dd>We are communicating in real time and I am not caught up to your last post. Correct, it would not solve the problem to assert Unicode. (Yes, we have no bananas today.) There are multiple transliteration systems for Devanāgarī. When you use the IAST template you are asserting that you are using the IAST transliteration method. By using the unicode template you assert that you are using Unicode, but who knows what transliteration method? Wiki is a Unicode-compliant <i>loka</i>, which is good. So in Wikiloka when you use the IAST template by default you are asserting "this is IAST notation in the Unicode glyph set".</dd>

<dd>As we said, the ASCII and Unicode implementations of IAST are inter-operable for characters that are not in the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin-1.html" title="Latin-1">Latin-1</a> character set. Consider the word <i>dharma</i>. That word only uses characters in the Latin-1 range, so that word would be transparent across ASCII and Unicode. But the word <i>śraddhā</i> includes two IAST symbols that are not in the Latin-1 range (ś and ā) and those two symbols have different numerical representations in ASCII implementation and in Unicode implementations. So a person who has only ASCII fonts on their system may understand that it is IAST notation, but may lack the Unicode fonts to display it. What's worse, there are multiple ASCII implementations that are not inter-operable amongs themselves. Best to stick to Unicode (the Wiki default), and mention that you are using IAST. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 23:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 23:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am trying to think this through with you, so let me parse it for myself as follows. Let me just consider the Sanskrit parm first. Each language I am sure has similar problems (where are the Klingon speakers when you need them?) For Sanskrit, since Wikiloka is Unicode by default, you do not need to specify Unicode if you specify IAST. In the example just given above there is an incorrect use of the IAST template because it shows Devanāgarī.characters, not IAST characters:</p>
<p>IAST: <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST Unicode" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'GNU Unifont', 'Lucida Sans Unicode'; white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">स्कान्धास</span></p>
<p>Devanāgarī characters are not a valid parameter for the IAST template. Only IAST characters are valid parameters. So the correct version of the IAST template would be:</p>
<p>IAST: <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST Unicode" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'GNU Unifont', 'Lucida Sans Unicode'; white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">skāndhāsa</span></p>
<p>Let me get this point up and then I can consider the nested issue for a list. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 23:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My turn for an edit-conflict :-) :</dd>
<dd>Man, every time I try to do something good on this page I find myself getting in <i>way</i> over my head ;-)</dd>
<dd>Please let me try to better understand:
<ol>
<li>Are you saying that this has little or nothing to do with Devanagari but has to do with non-Latin-1 Roman characters (like ś and ā)?</li>
<li>Is it correct to infer that, although <a href="../../../i/a/s/Template%7EIAST_1576.html" title="Template:IAST">Template:IAST</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Template%7EUnicode_7c69.html" title="Template:Unicode">Template:Unicode</a> appear to have essentially the same <u>actual</u> function (that is, converting text to Unicode, right?), that this is just the way things are now and at some time Template:Unicode may not be compatible with Template:IAST?</li>
<li>You are recommending that, instead of changing the Template:DisplayTranslations code, I simply document that it makes use of Template:IAST?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Did I get any of these right? If not, am I banned from editing this Talk page?</dd>
<dd>Thanks for taking pity on the slow &amp; dumb, <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_6854.html" title="User:Larry Rosenfeld">Larry Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_Rosenfeld_94ba.html" title="User talk:Larry Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 23:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we will both be banned if we keep this up much longer. Your questions:</p>
<p>1. Right, it has nothing to do with Devanagari.</p>
<p>2a. <a href="../../../i/a/s/Template%7EIAST_1576.html" title="Template:IAST">Template:IAST</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Template%7EUnicode_7c69.html" title="Template:Unicode">Template:Unicode</a> do not have the same function.</p>
<p>2b. Actual practice on most of the Hinduism pages is that is you use <a href="../../../i/a/s/Template%7EIAST_1576.html" title="Template:IAST">Template:IAST</a> it is assumed that you are using Unicode. While it might be true that someone uploads ASCII IAST, it probably would not display well and the person would be chastised for doing it.</p>
<p>2c. I do not know what the practice is with other languages regarding use of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Template%7EUnicode_7c69.html" title="Template:Unicode">Template:Unicode</a>.</p>
<p>3. Perhaps the best idea is to take the easy path and do as you suggest, just document that it makes use of Template:IAST for words in Sanskrit. You may also want to document that we are throwing water on the idea of showing both IAST and Devanagari for the same term, because they are identical. IAST is a lossless method for representing Devanagari that looks less strange to the average person.</p>
<p>Regarding loops, if you were to try to generalize this (which may be overkill):</p>
<p>Is it true that to fully-specify the representation of each language a loop would need to include elements of this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO Language Code</li>
<li>ISO Language Name</li>
<li>the function to display the word may need to optionally invoke an encoding method: (encoding method|term being translated)</li>
</ul>
<p>A Sanskrit example which includes an encoding method using an existing template:</p>
<p>(LANG|sa) (Sanskrit) (IAST|skāndhāsa)</p>
<p>A Klingonese example:</p>
<p>(LANG|tlh) (Klingonese) (FSK|Qapla')</p>
<p>FSK = Federation Standard Klingon, a Latin-1 encoding system that works in both ASCII and Unicode, which I just made up.</p>
<p>Can someone who knows Chinese or Tibetan give an example of this structure for their languages?</p>

<dd>I created a new template (really a "macro"), <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELang2iso_2584.html" title="Template:Lang2iso">Template:Lang2iso</a> that takes the ISO Language Name and converts into an ISO Language Code (based on <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639-1_ea03.html" title="ISO 639-1">ISO 639-1</a>). This then enables <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisplayTranslations_dfa4.html" title="Template:DisplayTranslations">Template:DisplayTranslations</a> to use the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELang_085e.html" title="Template:Lang">Template:Lang</a> (instead of <a href="../../../i/a/s/Template%7EIAST_1576.html" title="Template:IAST">Template:IAST</a>)...

<dd>Okay. I got some sleep and I infer there's still a problem because Template:Lang does not display Sanskrit using Template:IAST (nor Devanagari using Unicode, which is something I could definitely use). I've tried to pass IAST-related functionality to Template:Lang (e.g., {{Lang|sa|{{IAST{{!}}samsara}}}}) but this seems to create errors with what is displayed. I'm certainly open to discussing this further ... perhaps using <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template_talk%7EDisplayTranslations_3488.html" title="Template talk:DisplayTranslations">Template_talk:DisplayTranslations</a> would be a better place to free up this talk page from this thread?

<p>Hi, I came to this article to remind myself about the Budhist belief inreincarnation - all I found was one reference that Budha was reincarnated.</p>
<p>It's probably in one of the doctrines, but I found the article on reincarnation much easier to read and soon found out what I wanted to know.</p>
<p>Is there any chance of having a section "reincarnation" so that people looking for information on this aspect can find it easily?</p>

<dd>Instead of <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, Buddhists may believe in <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29_ecf7.html" title="Rebirth (Buddhism)">rebirth</a>. This is because there is nothing that can be re-incarnated ("made flesh again") since there is no absolute "Self", just a bundle of ever-changing processes that carry on through to the next life by their own momentum (that's a personal view, not necessarily doctrinal AFAIK). In the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> article, you will find a link to <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29_ecf7.html" title="Rebirth (Buddhism)">rebirth</a> under the "<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_terms_and_concepts.html" title="Buddhist terms and concepts">Key Concepts</a>", and I believe that this is prominent enough. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndkaha_fda0.html" title="User:Andkaha">Andkaha</a><sup>(<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndkaha_20e8.html" title="User talk:Andkaha">talk</a>)</sup> 12:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A well-done response to the question. Another way of saying the same thing is that the concept of the atman differs in the traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism, which is why the term <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atman.html" title="Atman">Atman</a> goes to a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 21:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It starts out discussing Buddhism as a religion and branches to discussing history and doctrine, then jumps to doctrine, then jumps back to history, then jumps to current practices, jumps to literature, jumps back to current state, one line link on Buddhist art, leading to comparitive religions, then closes with links.</p>
<p>It needs clear distinct section that deal with specific issues.</p>
<p>I'll start by separating the synopsis from history and doctrine. It needs clear demarcation between the two, rather than a vague blending of the two parts.</p>

<p>More thoughts on this article...</p>
<p>If extensive data is another article, for example "doctrine", do we need to repeat it in depth, or just touch on it and create a link to the article on Buddhist Doctrine, and suggest the reader follow the link to get the rest on another page?</p>

<p>This entry is misleading and wrong. Samadhi as explained in the Sutras and by experienced meditation masters, is not control over one's mind.</p>
<p>Samadhi is the state of being At-One with the situation. Its when no thoughts arise to comment on the situation. Its when the feeling of self disappears and you are united with your environment (At-One). Sometimes referred to as being One-Pointed.</p>
<p>Even talking about it leads to confusion. It needs to be experienced first hand. Then it is known.</p>
<p>What marks Buddhism apart from all other major religions, is the emphasis on "No-I". This is one of the central tenets of all branches of Buddhism. It is one of the three signs of being (sometimes called the 3 seals). This "No-I", that the Buddha talked about, is central to the Buddha's teachings, is what is experienced in Samadhi. When the feeling of I and other (the separation) falls away.</p>
<p>This was the Buddha's great enlightenment. That this feeling (I-am) is an illusion. It is the cause of suffering. Remove I, remove the illusion, and bring an end to suffering. The whole of Buddhist training / practice is aimed at this end.</p>

<dd>Samādhi [fr. saŋ+ā+dhā]</dd>
<dd>1. concentration; a concentrated, self-collected, intent state of mind and meditation, which, concomitant with right living, is a necessary condition to the attainment of higher wisdom and emancipation. In the Subha-suttanta of the Dīgha (D i.209 sq.) samādhi-khandha ("section on concentration") is the title otherwise given to the cittasampadā, which, in the ascending order of merit accruing from the life of a samaṇa (see Sāmaññaphala-suttanta, and cp. Dial. i.57 sq.) stands between the sīla-sampadā and the paññā-sampadā. In the Ambaṭṭha-sutta the corresponding terms are sīla, caraṇa, vijjā (D. i.100). Thus samādhi would comprise:
<dl>
<dd>(a) the guarding of the senses (indriyesu gutta-dvāratā),</dd>
<dd>(b) self-possession (sati-sampajañña),</dd>
<dd>(c) contentment (santuṭṭhi),</dd>
<dd>(d) emancipation from the 5 hindrances (nīvaraṇāni),</dd>
<dd>(e) the 4 jhānas....</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. Description &amp; characterization of samādhi: Its four nimittas or signs are the four satipaṭṭhānas M i.301; six conditions and six hindrances A iii.427; other hindrances M iii.158. The second jhāna is born from samādhi D ii.186....</dd>
<dd>Two grades of samādhi distinguished, viz. upacāra-samādhi (preparatory concentration) and appanā-samādhi (attainment concentration) DA i.217; Vism 126; Cpd. 54, 56 sq.; only the latter results in jhāna; to these a 3rd (preliminary) grade is added as khaṇika˚ (momentary) at Vism 144.</dd>
<dd>Three kinds of samādhi are distinguished, suññata or empty, appaṇihita or aimless, and animitta or signless A i.299; S iv.360; cp. iv.296; Vin iii.93; Miln 337; cp. 333 sq.; DhsA 179 sq., 222 sq., 290 sq....<a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali" class="external autonumber" title="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
