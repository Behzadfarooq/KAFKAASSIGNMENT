<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism</span></h2>
<p>These pages seem to be attracting persistent vandalism recently. Has anybody taken the time to report the IDs of the vandals to the Wiki people&#160;? I believe they have an Ongoing Vandalism page. One can also ask to have the atrticle "locked", usually for a month and thus hide the additions of these idiotic people. In fact, the various sections in Wiki Help relating to vandalism make interesting reading.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 01:45, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I meant to reply to this when it was initially posted. I'm not too familiar with the details of Wiki Help counter-vandalism, but I can tell you about standard Wikipedia procedure. Normally, the page would only be locked in cases where it was undergoing unusually aggressive waves of vandalist attacks that show no signs of getting under control. This article doesn't really have that problem; instead, we have frequent random acts of petty vandalism. This is the kind of thing that we can and should correct manually. Fortunately, the more high-profile an article is, the more editors are keeping an eye on it, in addition to vandals. Usually, when someone vandalizes the article, it's fixed within a few minutes, so there is little danger of someone coming to Wikipedia and seeing the vandalized version.</dd>
<dd>The trade-off, of course, is that, if we lock the article, we lose the entire Wiki element by which anyone can edit it. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 05:42, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please lock the page, and hopefully the vandals will lose interest and move on. It can be re-opened later.</p>

<p>Buddhism means "Teaching of Buddha" that is the entire definition in 3 words the rest of the words just complicate the article as the entire article is full of other peoples thoughts and ideas, and the links have been taken over by certain so called Buddhist teachers and organisations. In fact Buddha himself taught that 500 years after his death there will be very little truth left in his teachings, so if they are Buddhist - a follower of Buddhas teachings, they should accept this.</p>
<p>Buddha did NOT teach the following - meditation - chanting - bowing to statues or Zen, so to label these as Buddhism is itself untrue, and inline with Buddhas own predictions that there will be no truth left in his teachings.But sadly as with all great teachers their teachings become hijacked changed and sold in the name of religion, I would request the wikipedia to remove any links which are commercial.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Women attaining Buddha-hood?</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have a quick question I was wondering if someone could shed some light on for me. In the article it states that "Anyone can free themselves from suffering as Gautama did, regardless of age, gender, or caste." Now, as far as women attaining enlightenment, from what I understand there is a small section in The Lotus Sutra that discusses this possibility, but I was wondering if there were other sources that talk about this as well?</p>
<p>Thanks! <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirosche_650b.html" title="User:Airosche">Airosche</a> 02:12, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali_Canon_9085.html" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>, the Buddha agrees to ordain women because—despite the serious problems that this document claims the Buddha said it would cause—he agrees that a woman's capacity for enlightenment is equal to a man's. Some other Buddhist traditions, I believe, especially in Confucian East Asia, had the idea that women can become Buddhas or can enter the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Land_3747.html" title="Pure Land">Pure Land</a> only if they are first reborn as men. It also appears to be generally assumed that all <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Buddha_700c.html" title="Supreme Buddha">Supreme Buddhas</a> are male at the time of their final enlightenment. Consider that some Buddhist texts list quite a number of (seemingly arbitrary) characteristics that all Buddhas supposedly have, e.g. they are tall, they are born in India, etc., etc. Apparently, one of these characteristics is that they are male. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 08:50, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We have to be very careful to differentiate between the cultural aspects of Buddhism as it has been practiced in the different countries all over the world, and the essence of Buddhism. It is quite clear that in some versions of Buddhism women have played a smaller role, but this is a cultural aspect more than a fundamental one. In some Buddhist traditions (like Tibetan Buddhism) women have played a major role. There are many great yogini's known in history, like Yeshe Tsogyal, Dagmema, Sukhasiddhi, or Machig Labdron. History has a tendency to trivialise women's accomplishments. There were probably many other great women Buddhist teachers and practitioners whose lifestories have not been recorded. I have even heard from one current Buddhist teacher that women are for sure superior practitioners because of their honesty and perseverance.</p>
<p>The fact that one of the characteristics of all historic Buddhas to be male doesn't mean that women cannot reach enlightenment. Here we have to distinguish between enlightened beings or Buddhas and historical Buddhas, that is Buddhas that have (or will) start a new tradition of Buddhism. I have heard of at least one Bodhisattva who vowed to always be reborn as a woman. 21 November 2005 (UTC) R.Sok</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Buddhism origins</span></h2>
<p>Guys, the Encyclopedia Britannica and most other textbooks on Buddhism agree that Buddhism originated in Nepal. Not only that, they have found a monument erected by Asoka stating "Here is the birthplace of the Buddha" in Nepal. kennethtennyson</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just checked Britannica Online and its Concise Encyclopedia Article on Buddhism says "Religion and philosophy founded in northeastern India [...]". According to Peter Harvey (An Introduction to Buddhism, 1990), the Buddha was born in a small republic which was located across the Naplese-Indian border. He was enlightened in India and he was teaching the Dharma in the region of the Ganges basin in north eastern India (probably also in Nepal). If Buddhism came into being as he got born, then yes, the origin of Buddhism might very well be Nepal. One could also argue that Buddhism originated at the moment of his enlightenment, at the moment when he decided to start teaching, or at the first cermon (all in current India). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndkaha_fda0.html" title="User:Andkaha">Andkaha</a> 11:50, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>May be we need to change it to China for Buddhism origins, because</p>
<ol>
<li>During the time of Buddha there was no India, Nepal, Afghanistan etc. but some small kingdoms.</li>
<li>People during the time of Buddha from Afghanistan in the west to Indonesia in the east and from Tibet in the north to the Lanka (now <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>) in the south did not thought Buddhism as a separate religion, neither do all of them now. I do have many friends in India who are Buddhist but also go to Hindu temples. <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> when he visit any new place, he also visit local Hindu temples that are important. Now same is true in Sri Lanka also, where people see less difference between Buddhism and Hinduism.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I do not know whether Kenneth has something else in his mind, as I have noticed from his changes and he also mentioned he had some bad arguments with some Indians. Also see him not LOGGED on.</p>

<p>Buddy, don't put odd IP addresses to my name. Secondly, I'm not the only person on this encyclopedia having issues with Indian nationals "rewriting" history and deciding that they invented one thing or another or that a certain history just doesn't suit their tastes. See the whole Taj Mahal debate that has been raging on whether or not it is a Vedic temple. I actually do research on Asian history and I along with my colleagues have run into so many supposed "scholars" from India in the last few years trying to rewrite history that it has had us fed up. We even had one "scholar" trying to convince us that the East India Company was actually from India and not Britain and another one who blamed Muslim fanatics for killing Gandhi. I'm not sure if it's due to the last decade of BJP / Hindutva rule rewriting the whole education system of India or just plain ignorance in a 3rd world country with a few hundred million English speaking people. I've never suggested that China was the birthplace of Buddhism, by the way. My contention is that the older version of Britannica that I have along with most recent editions of books write Nepal as the Birthplace of Buddhism because it is the place the Buddha grew up in and lived most of his life. You can split hairs and put India if you wish because he became enlightened there, but regardless the vast majority of Nepalese and Tibetans along with a lot of historians believe that Buddhism began in Nepal not India. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKennethtennyson_9c48.html" title="User:Kennethtennyson">Kennethtennyson</a> 07:17, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In Sixth century, if there was "NO INDIA", only smaller kingdoms, then you must also know that there was also no Greece, No Italy, no Rome, no China, no Nepal, no Iraq, no Israel, no America, no nothing but only "small kindoms" at that time! Nepal (Lumbini) was the birthplace of Buddha, but the Karmabhumi or land of action of Buddha was India. Also, in a cultural sense, India could be used. The birthplace of Gautam Buddha maybe specified as Lumbini (Kapilvastu) in Nepal, no problem! And as far as self proclaimed nouveau scholars of India are concerned, all passionate with Hindutva, they have no place in Wikipedia. It is a place of neutral point of view and no outpourings of a Hindu heart. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicalsaumy_fe7c.html" title="User:Magicalsaumy">Cygnus_hansa</a> 22:21, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been meaning to post a message here on this subject for quite some time—sorry for the delay. I had an exchange of e-mails a while back with a user who added two of the images which currently grace the article (specifically <a href="../../../t/e/m/Image%7ETemple_of_tooth.jpg_9233.html" title="Image:Temple of tooth.jpg">Image:Temple of tooth.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../s/r/i/Image%7ESri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg_e1ee.html" title="Image:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg">Image:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg</a>). I initially removed them for copyright issues, which were then settled; he wrote me to argue that they deserved to be in the article because there the other images are unfairly biased towards East Asian sources. I don't know if this is a good reason to exclude or include them, but I figured we should give more thought to what images to include or not include.</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../s/r/i/Image%7ESri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg_e1ee.html" class="image" title="Image:Sri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b6/Sri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg/140px-Sri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg" alt="Image:Sri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg" width="140" height="187" longdesc="../../../s/r/i/Image%7ESri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg_e1ee.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>Until quite recently, Wikipedia almost never had to make choices about which images to include in larger articles, because there were very few images available to use (the lead image for this article was chosen simply because it was the first picture added, although I've grown rather attached to it). Fortunately, the number of choices has increased dramatically over the last year. This necessitates that we make some decisions about what to include and what not to.</p>
<p>To assist in this, I've made some notes on what types of images we currently have (as of January 18, 2005):</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> currently contains 13 images:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Buddha statue, East Asian (lead image)</li>
<li>1 Buddha statue, from a Chinese-built temple in the United States</li>
<li>1 Buddha statue, Sri Lankan (Image:Sri_lanka_aukana_buddha_statue.jpg)</li>
<li>1 Buddha statue, Central Asian</li>
<li>1 carving of multiple Buddhas/bodhisattvas, East Asian</li>
<li>1 temple, Sri Lankan (Temple_of_tooth.jpg)</li>
<li>1 temple interior, from a Chinese-built temple in the United States</li>
<li>1 ancient Buddha foot sculpture, Central Asian</li>
<li>2 images of monks, Tibetan</li>
<li>1 image of monks, Burmese</li>
<li>1 painting of monks, including an East Asian and a Central Asian</li>
<li>1 Buddhist flag, designed in Sri Lanka</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, by type, that's:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Buddha statues (including one mentioned above)</li>
<li>1 carving of Buddhas/bodhisattvas</li>
<li>2 temple images (including one mentioned above)</li>
<li>4 images of monks (3 photographs and 1 painting)</li>
<li>1 ancient aniconic carving</li>
<li>1 symbol</li>
</ul>
<p>And by regional style:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 out of 13, East Asian (all Chinese, in fact; half of which are located in the U.S.)</li>
<li>3 out of 13 Central Asian</li>
<li>2 out of 13 Sri Lankan (both of which are the images mentioned above;), not including the flag</li>
<li>2 out of 13 Tibetan</li>
<li>1 out of 13 Southeast Asian</li>
<li>1 flag, designed in Sri Lanka, used internationally</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so what do we notice</p>
<p>For one thing, in terms of subject matter, the current images contain no bodhisattvas (except for possibly in the Chinese carving), such as Maitreya or Guan Yin. I'm not sure how many different Buddhas are shown (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakyamuni.html" title="Shakyamuni">Shakyamuni</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amitabha.html" title="Amitabha">Amitabha</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vairocana.html" title="Vairocana">Vairocana</a>, et al). There are few images of temples, and, if we removed the Temple of the Tooth image, there would be no temple exteriors. No stupas. No diagrams or maps (although I don't know of any that would useful off the top of my head). There are currently no photographs of Buddhists other than monks (we used to have one of Thai people praying; not sure what happened to it).</p>
<p>There is a certain amount of geographic imbalance. Without the two Sri Lankan images, we have 4 out of 11 Chinese images (including the two Chinese-American ones, which are from Hsi Lai Temple), which is a lot. We don't even have any images from Japan or Korea. Sans Sri Lankan pictures, we only have one image from any of the Theravada countries, and that of child monks. Still, I'm not sure the two Sri Lankan images are the best solution here: the Temple of the Tooth picture isn't very striking ... we could probably find a better one from a different Theravada country. And the Aukana Buddha image, unless I'm missing some kind of historical interest, doesn't show a lot of specifically Theravada flavor to distinguish it from the three other Buddha images we have.</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../w/h/e/Image%7EWheel_life_01.jpg_c0f3.html" class="image" title="Bhutanese Wheel of Life"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/f0/Wheel_life_01.jpg/140px-Wheel_life_01.jpg" alt="Bhutanese Wheel of Life" width="140" height="196" longdesc="../../../w/h/e/Image%7EWheel_life_01.jpg_c0f3.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>There is room for at least 1, possibly 2, maybe more images to be added without crowding (although I think the Aukana Buddha image is already crowded where it is, so I should say without further crowding). I think it would be a good idea, if possible, to leave an empty spot to encourage future editors to add one. I'm also interested in perhaps taking the advice someone gave on this talk page some time ago to use one or more images from the German version of this article—I have my eye on <a href="../../../w/h/e/Image%7EWheel_life_01.jpg_c0f3.html" title="Image:Wheel life 01.jpg">Image:Wheel life 01.jpg</a> (seen at right), or some other mandala, which would add some colour and variety. It would be nice to add at least temple exterior shot, preferably more than that, because temple architecture varies from place to place more than Buddha statues do.</p>
<p>What this means is that we don't have a lot of room left over to work with. We're going to have to think in terms of evaluating the quality of new images and the ones already in the article, and possibly dropping some current ones in favor of those that fit improve the article more (dropped images don't have to disappear from Wikipedia, they can often go to other articles; I made <a href="../../../t/e/m/Image%7ETemple_of_tooth.jpg_9233.html" title="Image:Temple of tooth.jpg">Image:Temple of tooth.jpg</a> the lead image on <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_the_Tooth_fa88.html" title="Temple of the Tooth">Temple of the Tooth</a> a while back). I would suggest that we should perhaps discuss new image additions on talk beforehand and/or get comfortable seeing our changes changed by other editors. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:04, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greeks and Buddhism?</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering, does anyone know if there's any evidence for any influence of Buddhism on Greek thought? I was reading up on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Greek_0380.html" title="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> empire, and their emperor Demetrius apparently converted to Buddhism and was a friend of the defeated <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauryan.html" title="Mauryan">Mauryan</a> empire. Was there much flow of people and ideas between the Indo-Greeks, the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactrian.html" title="Bactrian">Bactrian</a> Greeks, the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucids.html" title="Seleucids">Seleucids</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> Greeks, or were they fairly isolated against each other, bearing in mind the fairly large differences between the relatively close-together <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>?</p>
<p>Basically my line of inquiry was sparked by something <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajahn_Brahm_1d88.html" title="Ajahn Brahm">Ajahn Brahm</a> said in a dharma talk about <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, one of the early Christians and an apparent teacher of <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, having been taught by <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonius_Saccas_8b2a.html" title="Ammonius Saccas">Ammonius Saccas</a>, and how eastern peoples and (according to him) ancient Greeks put their surnames first, and that Saccas Ammonius was in fact Sakyamuni, i.e. the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. Interesting conjecture, or is there any evidence other than the coincidence in names?</p>

<dd>The Kālakārāma sutra "gains a high degree of historical importance owing to the tradition handed down by the commentaries and chonicles* that it was preached by the venerable Mahārakkhita Thera to convert the country of the Yonakas during the great missionary movement which took place in the reign of the Emperor Asoka. If the identification of the Yonakas with Greeks is correct, the choice of this deeply philosophical discourse for such a significant occasion, could not have been a mere coincidence...Tradition has it that the impact of the discourse on the Yonakas was considerable, for thirty-seven thousand people attained to the Fruits of the Path on hearing it...", from <i>The Magic of the Mind</i> (subtitle) <i>An Exposition of the Kālakārāma Sutta</i>, Bhikku Ñānananda, BPS, Sri Lanka, 1974, p1, * cited is Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, I, 573 f. I think <a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ka/kaalaka_s.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ka/kaalaka_s.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is copied from that, and it has some links to give you a <a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/y/yonaa.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/y/yonaa.htm" rel="nofollow">reason to believe or not</a>; anyway, claim is they were Hellenic, not exactly Athenians, but I suppose there could have been traffic between Athens and Ságala. So I would characterize this version as speculation, but not necessarily wild. "Evidence"? Not much. Claim (easily verified?) is Asoka left some inscriptions that included names of Hellenic rulers. Another claim relating to somewhat later period was that Milinda's culture could have been go-between. Still, "tried to influence" does not equal "did influence". Some cites, I don't know how reliable, on <a href="http://www.tipitaka.net/pali/b-cube/pageload.php?page=030701a" class="external text" title="http://www.tipitaka.net/pali/b-cube/pageload.php?page=030701a" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. And Google "Ramanand Vidya Bhawan" with the word "Greek", though I can't vouch for that one either. Finally, yet another claim worth chasing down is that Greek community in or around India contained Buddhist converts who were the origin of Buddhist iconography; sorry, no cite (someone I trust told me this); but if Hellenic culture indeed influenced Buddhism, the reverse could be true. --<a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunge_7800.html" title="User:Munge">Munge</a> 06:52, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Killing</span></h2>
<p>"To refrain from harming living creatures (killing)."</p>
<p>Killing isn't harming creatures, not in the slightest so I removed the definition. It depends how and why you kill, ie:</p>
<p>Motives for killing creatures: Kill to eat, cull to protect native wildlife, or kill for sport. Methods of killing creatures: Slow and painfull, or bullet to the head.</p>

<dd>I think "(killing)" should definitely be left in there. One often sees the first precept expressed as "To refrain from killing", "To refrain from taking life", or as "To refrain from causing pain <i>or fear of pain</i>" (or positively as "To practice loving-kindness towards all living/sentient beings").</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To remove "(killing)" would suddenly make it seem perfectly alright for e.g. a Buddhist lay person to make a living as a butcher, something that the Buddha spoke out against.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If someone culls to protects native wildlife, or kills a being even in a fast and "humane" way, can you definitely say that you cause no pain or fear of pain in the being?</dd>

<dd>I find the claim that killing creatures isn't harmful to them to be ridiculous, but I still agree with removing the parenthetical (killing). The fact that harming includes killing is so obvious that it is redundant for us to say it. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 16:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>In terms of the Buddha's injunctions in the various agamas and Mahayana sutras, killing is certainly not allowed, whether it be for food (most definitely not - and in the Mahayana sutras, vegetarianism is enjoined upon the Buddhist follower!), for medicine, for punishment, or even for some seemingly altruistic motive. Killing represents the ultimate physical harm that can be perpetrated against another living being. Each being is valued within Buddha-Dharma as an individual person, as someone possessed of the Buddhic Principle ("Buddha-dhatu"), so that even arguments of "sacrificing" one being (say, an animal) for the sake of another being (say, a human) is totally and utterly counter to the Buddha's ethic of "ahimsa" (non-harming) and universal kindliness. I share Nat's view that it doesn't really make sense (either common sense or Buddhist sense!) to say that killing someone does not harm that person (although I know what the writer means). However, I would personally prefer to see something added, such as "(especially killing)", just to emphasise the horror with which Buddhism looks upon the taking of sentient life. In fact, it has always been my understanding that the first precept actually specifies that one will undertake to refrain from "the taking of life/ the destruction of life". - Tony <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 17:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thich_Nhat_Hanh_6574.html" title="Thich Nhat Hanh">Thich Nhat Hanh</a>'s [<a href="http://www.plumvillage.org" class="external text" title="http://www.plumvillage.org" rel="nofollow">Plum Village</a>] Tradition, the Five Precepts have been reworded to be more relevant to the 21st Century and the First Mindfulness Training (as the Precepts are called) is stated as:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to cultivating compassion and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals, plants and minerals. Iam determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to support any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life."</p>
<p>Here Thây has even extended the precept to plants and minerals! How does one live if one can't even kill a plant?! How do you walk down the street without by chance stepping on an ant or other small insect? How do you even wash you hands without killing hundreds of millions of microbes? And what does it mean to protect the life of a mineral?</p>
<p>The answer is you can't, <i>but</i>, here intention is the key. When we walk down the dirt mountain paths at <a href="http://www.deerparkmonastery.org" class="external text" title="http://www.deerparkmonastery.org" rel="nofollow">Deer Park Monastery</a> we know that it is not possible to do so without stepping on some of our multi-legged friends. Therefore, we walk in mindfulness so as to minimize the damage that we do. we are mindful not to step on ant hills or on the larger, easy to see creatures who may cross my path. In the morning we say a gatta wherein we express the hope that we do not accidentally kill any insects that day and if we should we pray that they do not suffer too much and will have a better rebirth. Intention is the key. When we wash our hands and thus kill masses of bacteria, we are intentionally killing, but doing so in order to prevent the worse offense of spreading disease to other creatures. In first of the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings of Thây's <a href="http://www.iamhome.org" class="external text" title="http://www.iamhome.org" rel="nofollow">Order of Interbeing</a>, we are reminded that we must not be fanatical about our beliefs, even Buddhist ones.</p>
<p>We, as modern humans, can refrain from killing animals for our food and clothing, therefore we should.</p>
<p>Protecting the lives of plants and minerals in this training refers to refraining from their wanton destruction. Yes, we eat vegetables and use minerals, but we do so mindfully, without waste or wanton destruction. <a href="../../../m/s/c/User%7EMscode3_f5c4.html" title="User:Mscode3">Ms Code 3</a></p>

<dd>I agree that "(killing)" seems a bit redundant, as killing <i>usually</i> involves harming that which is killed. It's the usually that bothers me. Are not the specific injunctions against killing referring to killing as the ultimate in harming? If that is the case, then what is/are the Buddhist position(s) on compassionate killing? There are circumstances when it may be a kindness to kill a living thing. If so, then not-killing, in some cases, may be an instance of harming. In other words, it seems that "To refrain from taking life", and "To refrain from causing pain" are potentially contradictory. This contradiction can be resolved by expressing the precept as simply "to refrain from harming." <a href="../../../p/s/o/User%7EPsora_24e9.html" title="User:Psora">Psora</a> 17:50, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The traditional injunction is to refrain from killing. Vinaya goes into the types of being and the relative damage done due to killing - so e.g. killing an arhat is about as bad as it gets, with killing parasites way down the list. Harming is a different issue and is used as a more general principle, rather than a rule. The root Bodhisattva vows warn against not killing when one would do better to kill - there are Jataka tales of the Buddha-to-be killing a terrorist so as to save a ship filled with people. Buddhism does not have a set of absolute commandments - vows are understood to be relative to context - and are stated as rules-of-thumb for avoiding negative karmic consequences that would lead to low rebirth. As I recall, the five vows of a lay Buddhist are to prevent low rebirth, and to ensure that future rebirths may happen as a Buddhist once more.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anatta</span></h2>
<p>I must say I completely disagree with the section on anatta. I was surprised to see that this wasn't a hot topic of discussion. First it should have the tetra lemma stated. Second and much more important, the Buddha teached in three "levels" or the three turns of the wheel of Dharma: the four noble truths, emptiness and Buddha nature. Just as emptiness cannot be directly experienced without a very good experience of the four noble truths, teachings on Buddha nature (Vajrayana and sutras on Buddha nature) cannot be correctly understood and experienced without direct knowledge of emptiness (not necessarily COMPLETE direct knowledge of emptiness because then it woudn't be necessary any teachings on Buddha nature). Teachings on Buddha nature without the background of emptiness praticaly becomes hinduism. The main teaching that distinguishes Buddhism from other religions is emptiness. The idea of atman is precisely the idea of Buddha nature when seen without the background of emptiness. This said, things like "there does truly exist an eternal, unchanging, blissful Buddha-essence in all sentient beings, which is the uncreated and deathless Buddha-nature ("Buddha-dhatu") or "True Self"" lead to false view when a person doesn't have direct knowledge of emptiness. Buddha nature trancends existence/non existence, permanence/impermanence, etc., hence the tetra lemma: "neither existent nor non existent nor both nor neither". Conceptual mind is not fit for understanding Buddha nature and therefore the mencioned paradox: "The paradox is that as soon as the Buddhist practitioner tries to grasp at this inner Buddha potency and cling to it as though it were his or her ego writ large, it proves elusive". Therefore the text on anatta should be changed either by completely eliminating the statements on Buddha nature or by giving the correct context in which these teachings appear which is the three turns of the wheel of Dharma and the tetralemma.

<dl>
<dd>The difficulty with what you suggest is that your views as stated are limited by the school you are familiar with - your approach to understanding Buddhism appears to be chinese mahayana. The development of Annata as a concept in Buddhism includes the development of the concept of <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atman_%28Buddhism%29_153e.html" title="Atman (Buddhism)">Atman</a> from a Buddhist standpoint also. I encourage you to speak - but try to find a position that meets the requirements of NPOV (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 11:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<p>Curiously, the tradition I'm less familiar with is the chinese&#160;:). But I think that what I say is accepted by all schools. Why? I saw the timeline of buddhism and in 1966 there was a Council attended by leading monks, from many countries and sects, Mahayana as well as Theravada. One of the teachings that was accepted <b>unanimously</b> was that "All conditioned things (sa.mskaara) are impermanent (anitya) and dukkha, and that all conditioned and unconditioned things (dharma) are without self (anaatma)". The important part here is "unconditioned things (dharma) are without self (anaatma)". This includes Buddha nature. This means that the teachings that state that there truly exists a Buddha nature, permanent, etc., are either contradictory with anatma or can only be correctly understood by a person with some direct knowledge of emptiness (and thus should be carefuly presented, if at all, to someone who doesn't have direct knowledge of emptiness). Since I believe the teachings are not contradictory, only the second can be true. (ModusPonens, sign your work with ~~~~)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is all very interesting - but as you know, what you believe does not make it so. Not all Buddhists agree with the 1966 declarations; moreover, schools of Buddhism have been around for well over 2,000 years, and many original and creative interpretations have been present. What you are asking us to agree is that there is some single <i>true</i> way of seeing the teachings of Buddha, and any other interpretation must be false. By declaring your belief that the teachings are not contradictory, you have taken upon yourself the responsibility of explaining how the sutras that assert the self, those that deny it, and those who tell us not to even think about these things are not contradictory. Atisha came up with an elegant, powerful and very Buddhist solution - that indeed the teachings are contradictory, because they are written with different audiences in mind: The Dharma is plural, because the needs and requirements of individuals are also plural. If you cannot accept the fact that for many Buddhists, there was a third turning of the wheel (the Yogacarya teachings of the Tathatgathagharba), then it sounds like you are clinging onto some form of foundationalism - some essentialist platform of what is and what is not Dharma, which is objectively (therefore essentially) true. You and I agree that all phenomena are without "self" - but, if we accept Candrakirti's view of "self" to be synonymous with "essence", or "intrinsic being" (the second turning of the wheel), then we come to the conclusion that nothing stands outside the context in which it is presented - including Dharma. Therefore, under the aegis of Atisha's exposition, we can understand and acknowledge the development of the doctrines of Tathatgathagharba as being necessary for those individuals who are unable to understand the first or second turning of the wheel of Dharma. Of course, any attempt to place different doctrines (Buddhist or not) onto some scale of truthfulness admits to the objective existence of an objective scale, and so we cannot state that one turning of the wheel is 'better' or 'more truthful' than another; we can only state whether or not we find some particular approach useful to ourselves. For me, I find the works of Tsongkhapa, Candrakirti and Nagarjuna to be elegant, balanced, timeless, and complete - but who am I to state that this is the 'one true path' of Buddhism? And certainly no convocation of monks or practitioners can do any better. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 14:15, 30 October 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<ul>
<li>I think it is very important - as suggested above, very wisely, by "2004" - always to be open to the fact that Buddha-Dharma is a vast complex of interconnected teachings and expositions of Reality from different perspectives, and that one should not automatically assume that such-and-such "is" Buddhism and that a variant emphasis provided by the sutras is not Buddhism or is in some way inferior to "real" Buddhism. Of course this is looking at the matter from a Mahayanist standpoint. One person's Buddhism may be another person's nihilism, and that person's Buddhism may be the former person's Hinduism! And we must never forget that only a fully Awakend Buddha truly knows what Reality (including Emptiness) is anyway! On a factual point, however, it is not correct to state (not that you have!) that the tathagatagarbha teachings are presented by the Buddha in the major tathagatagarbha sutras as a sop or concession to those who are spiritually backward and cannot quite understand or get their heads around non-Self and Emptiness. Quite the reverse. Leaving aside the quesiton of whether Emptiness can be conceptually "undestood" at all (the <i>prajnaparamita</i> sutras indicate that it is fundamentally beyond conceptualisation in any case), the doctrine of the tathagatagarbha/ Buddha-dhatu is given by the Buddha as a culminational revelation or ultimate teaching (an "uttarottara" pronouncement) of Dharma for those who have understood the implicit meaning of the earlier communications on non-Self and Emptiness correctly and are now ready for further progress into Great Nirvana. Whether one believes this to be objective fact or not is another matter, of course. But the tendency (marked amongst those who are not strongly familiar with the primary tathagatagarbha sutras themselves - notably the <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_Sutra_e3d8.html" title="Nirvana Sutra">Nirvana Sutra</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa_df96.html" title="Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa">Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa</a>, the <a href="../../../s/r/i/Srimala_Sutra_f83f.html" title="Srimala Sutra">Srimala Sutra</a>, the <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tathagatagarbha_Sutra_cc2e.html" title="Tathagatagarbha Sutra">Tathagatagarbha Sutra</a>) to relegate those Buddhists who follow TG doctrine to the status of people who have somehow failed to "understand" Emptiness is an unjust stance and not borne out or supported by the major TG sutras themselves. I must stress that I am not saying that any of the interlocutors in this section of "Talk-Buddhism" are guilty of definitely accusing other Buddhists of not being adequate Buddhists! Not at all! I hope we can all agree that tolerance of others' "Buddhism" (as long as such Buddhism has a sutric base supporting it) - rather than apodeictically declaring what IS Buddhism and what is NOT - is highly desirable. I think the exchanges above are good and valuable, in that the participants are trying to respect each other's vision of Dharma, while keeping open minds to the fact that none of us un-Awakened people (well, myself at least!) can fully KNOW Dharma until we attain total Bodhi.

<dd>Well, I think you understand my position - I do not consider the 'tathagatagarbha' doctrine to be a 'sop', indeed I see it as a valid method for liberation. However, I am especially not promoting it as a better or more complete or more advancing technique than others, for the reasons given above. However, within the arena of the Madhyamaka-Prasangikas, as I have understood it, there is no space for philosophy - it is an anti-philosophical stance; this does not mean that MP do not have tenets, or arguments - just that they use the language of their opponents (including their own self-grasping!) to demonstrate the lack of inherent existence. As the lack of inherent existence is the absence of something, there are many different ways of pointing that out, but none of those ways can assert something which is essentially there. Obviously I am aware that such views belong to a small group of Buddhists, but these views are necessarily plural - they do not allow for any degree of supremacism regarding truth or fact.

<dd>Addendum to tony: when you say "only a fully Awakend Buddha truly knows what Reality (including Emptiness)" - generally there are many who assert that actually, Aryas are able to directly unmistakenly perceive Emptiness because it is a <i>hidden</i> truth, though only a Buddha is able to perceive <i>deeply hidden</i> truths, such as the subtle complexities of causality. It is because emptiness is not <i>deeply hidden</i> that there is a fourth noble truth at all. Otherwise, Buddhism would require faith in doctrine or tradition: An appeal to greater authority as found in other religions. Buddha tells us that we can find out the Dharma for ourselves, via the merely 'hidden' truth of emptiness, by exercising ourselves in the three higher trainings of Sila/Samatha/Vipassana (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 13:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<li>Hallo 2004! Thanks for your interesting reply. It is good to see that you are so open-minded and tolerant of other avenues to Truth. Not everyone displays such liberality of attitude! Although you and I probably come from diametrically opposed approaches to Dharma (yourself from Madhyamaka-Prasangika, myself from Buddha-dhatu/Tathagatagarbha), we shall hopefully arrive at the same goal!</li>
</ul>
<p>On the question of faith in doctrine and the authority of the Buddha: there is in certain areas of Mahayana Buddha-Dharma actually this element of recognition of the Buddha's supreme authority, coupled with devotion to, and faith in, the Buddha's pronouncements. In fact, certain major sutras (such as the <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_Sutra_c6c1.html" title="Lotus Sutra">Lotus Sutra</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahaparinirvana_Sutra_97e8.html" title="Mahaparinirvana Sutra">Mahaparinirvana Sutra</a>) insist that reverence of those texts themselves, actual veneration and worship of them - and of the Buddha from whom they issue - are important elements on the Path towards full Awakening. We must also remember the "Happy Land" (<i>sukhavati</i>) sutras and the influential traditions which grew from them. But of course there are whole swathes of Buddhist teaching and practice which take a different line. Again, there are so many different directions from which one can head towards Bodhi that I think the key thing (as you suggested earlier - and with which I TOTALLY agree) is to follow the Way(s) of Buddha which speaks most appealingly to oneself and follow that Path, as long as it proves efficacious: after all, all authentically Dharmic roads lead to ..... Nirvana! Best wishes to you. From - Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 16:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you- of course there are sutras that indicate worship and devotion, as you mention; and of course, I have no problem with that. What I find to be a common problematic is when someone restricts their readership to a specific set of sutras, and then asserts some unqualified remarks about what Buddhism says; you and I know that not only are there many thousands of sutras, but also there are even more traditions that interpret those sutras in distinct ways. Buddhism has always been a highly literate tradition - (as I recall, Korean Buddhists invented the printing press). Regardless, it is as great an honour to meet someone who appreciates open-ended pluralism. Best wishes to you also! Take care (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 20:51, 31 October 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<li>Thanks, 20040302, for your kind words! Much appreciated. I sure do agree with you that one should try to read as many sutras as possible, so that one is not familiar solely with one Dharmic branch alone, as it were. That is my own way: to read the big famous sutras (e.g. Lotus, Lankavatara, Avatamsaka, Nirvana), many of the lengthy and shorter "prajnaparamita" sutras, the Pure Land sutras, the All-Creating King Sutra - not to mention all the marvellous foundational suttas - I try to immerse myself in all of them (even though I am a devotee of TG Buddhism)! Keep up your openness, 2004! That's so valuable in any kind of religion or philosophy, I believe.

<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisvegas</a> and I have been creating portals for various significant religions, with your religion being one of the portals.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Does a dog have buddha nature?</span></h2>
<p>I believe that according to <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gampopa.html" title="Gampopa">Gampopa</a>'s <i>The Jewel Ornament of Liberation</i> (I'm not quoting, because it isn't in front of me), beings in the 3 Lower ("Evil") <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_lower_realms.html" title="Six lower realms">Realms</a> have an incredibly difficult time hearing the Dharma, let alone practacing it or understanding it. I believe that I have read somewhere that teaching Dharma to animals is consider a aberation since teachings are wasted on them. On the other hand, just hearing the Dharma can purify an animal's Karma and can result in more fortuitous rebirth. <a href="../../../c/s/b/User%7ECsbodine_f89c.html" title="User:Csbodine">Csbodine</a> 22:51, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hallo my Friend, Csbodine, again! This is very much one of my favourite topics. Yes, animals can most definitely respond to Dharma - and (despite the famous Zen koan) DO possess the Buddha-dhatu (Buddha-Principle/ Buddha-Element - I don't like the slightly misleading translation, "Buddha-nature"). I wrote a book last century (!) - the first full-length one of its kind - called "Buddhism and Animals", and in that book I go into the scriptural evidence for asserting that animals can most definitely aspire to Awakening and become Buddhas. But you are right: it's much more difficult for them than for us (the opportunities are so much more limited in the animal realm). But you may be interested to know that (according to the massive "Bhadrakalpa Sutra") there is right now a little owl named "Matimant" who is waiting to become a Buddha - since that owl made an offering of some wood shavings to a previous Buddha a long time back. His Buddhahood has already been predicted by the Buddha. So there's hope for all of us yet! Warm wishes. From Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 23:20, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Woof. Seriously, this is a difference in thinking between the two major branches of Buddhism - Theravada says that animals don't have it and therefore can't become enlightened, and Mahayana says that they do, and therefore can. A blanket statement in the original article that "All sentient beings (beings with a mind, like humans and animals) can free themselves from suffering as Gautama did" is mistaken and shows a subtle, but misleading, bias towards Mahayana buddhism.</li>
</ul>
<p>(see the <i>Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen</i>) Gbwiki 16:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes! Gbwiki, you are essentially right (that we shouldn't make blanket statements that don't take into account the Theravadin view) - although I think that the reason that Csbodine (who, to be fair, starts off with a reference to the Mahayanist, Gampopa) and myself perhaps automatically inclined to the Mahayana sphere was because the whole notion of "Buddha-nature" (a translation of "Buddha-dhatu", by the way, which I really dislike!) is a Mahayana one. It is simply not found in the Pali suttas or their major commentaries (e.g. Buddhaghosa). So in a sense, by asking the question of whether animals, hell-beings, etc., have the "Buddha Nature" within them, one is immediately placing oneself onto Mahayana terrain. The question simply does not arise within the Pali suttas and their traditional commentaries, as the aim there is not to become a Buddha but to become an arhat. But I think you are so right to point out that we should not bias our overall presentations in either the Mahayana or the Theravada direction. We should aim at balance and fairness towards both sides.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also occurs to me that even from the Pali-sutta point of view an animal could, theoretically, eventually become a Buddha - after all, the animal incarnation is only a temporary one for that particular "satta" or being; it won't eternally remain as an animal - but it would need to be re-born as a human before being able to achieve Buddhahood. Best wishes. From Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 16:55, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, I'm very pleasantly suprised that this led to an informed discussion with people who were knowledgable in this subject - I wasn't expecting that. Thanks to both of you for responding and informing rather than just reverting the article. I understand the viewpoints on this issue a bit better now and have made another edit which hopefully presents the facts clearly. Gbwiki 20:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Hallo Gbwiki. Thank you for your very nice message. I appreciate what you have written. Do you mind if we add a couple more sentences to your own addition in the main article? Could we say: "In both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, however, the Buddha is viewed as one who, in past lives, had in fact been born as an animal at various times during his progress through Samsara. But only as a human being was he able to achieve full Awakening (<i>bodhi</i>)." Warm wishes to you.

<li>Very good all around- the distinction between the Mahayana and Theravada view here is important. One thing that I wanted to point out was the use of the term 'sentient beings' in the article. While Mahayana and Theravada may differ in their interpretations of the potential for non-humans to attain enlightenment in the present life, they agree on the definition of sentient beings, and in both cases that definition includes animals. They basically inherit the definition of sentient beings that was developed in Hindu thought- pretty much any animate creature is a sentient being, though there are obviously differences in the complexity of animals and people. So there's a distinction in which sentient beings can immediately attain enlightenment, but both define sentience the same way. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 01:21, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hallo All????????? Buddhism DOES promote vegetarianism and it is on the account of Buddhism that this concept was introduced to hinduism. You people are inventing your own logical conclusions about this matter....Early Buddhism enjoined upon its followers on vegetarianism. Later tantra and mantra and santra might have sprung up, but the truth is that its because Buddhism had gone to such countries where vegetarianism would be difficult—so the people modified the theory. And there is absoluteley no need to write a Mahabharata on "buddhism and vegetarianism" here. Yes, vegetarianism is not regarded as a "merit" or divine injunction, but rather a good way of life. Please remove all your original researches and write objectively.<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicalsaumy_fe7c.html" title="User:Magicalsaumy">Cygnus_hansa</a> 21:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC) (put it under right topic of discussion)</dd>
