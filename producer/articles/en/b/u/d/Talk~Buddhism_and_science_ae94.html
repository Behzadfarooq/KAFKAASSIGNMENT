<p>1) <i>Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.</i> and 2) <i>Buddhism is the only religion able to cope with modern scientific needs</i> – Einstein</p>
<p>As a Buddhist and physicist myself, I'd be delighted if this very widely-cited quote really could be attributed to Einstein, but regrettably there is no evidence that it can. It sometimes appears with a reference to <i>Albert Einstein: The Human Side</i> (Princeton University Press, 1954), but there is never a page reference - for the simple reason that the quote does not appear anywhere in that book.</p>
<p>I have personally discussed the reliability of this quote with Einstein scholars (including John Stachel at Boston U, and founding editor of T<i>he Collected Papers of Albert Einstein</i>), and with the authors of compilations of Einstein quotations (Thomas J. McFarlane, author of <i>Buddha and Einstein: The Parallel Sayings</i> and Alice Calaprice, author of <i>The New Quotable Einstein</i>) - none of whom cite it. In short, neither they nor I know of any evidence that Einstein delivered a speech containing this quote.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone who had unearthed a reliable citation shouldn't hesitate to reinstate the quote - and to inform these scholars, all of whom would be delighted to know about it (as would I)!. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobma_22b0.html" title="User:Robma">Robma</a> 09:53, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I presume the putative quotes above (that I posted from your deletion) are what you are referring to. Does anyone know where one or both came from? Einstein's spirituality was most influenced by <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinoza.html" title="Spinoza">Spinoza</a>, according to Max Jammer's book <i>Einstein and Religion</i> (1999, Princeton, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0691006997</a>) I find no references by Einstein to Buddhism in that volume, which I believe is the most comprehensive examination to date of Einstein's spiritual writings. Of course, Spinoza's and Einstein's "God" was impersonal (non-theistic rather than atheistic), so there are some points of congruence with Buddhism. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 08:47, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Buddhism "contains a much stronger element of [the cosmic religious feeling, by which] the religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished</i> – Einstein</p>
<p>The quote listed in the article is stitched together from three different sentences. What he actually wrote was, "The beginnings of <i>cosmic religious feelings</i> already appear at an early stage of development, e.g. in the early <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms.html" title="Psalms">Psalms</a> of David and in some of the Prophets. <i>Buddhism</i>, as we have learned from <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schopenhauer.html" title="Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>, <i>contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished</i> by this kind of religious feeling." - so he evidently came by his knowledge of Buddhism through Schopenhauer. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 09:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks v much for digging this out. I'd argue that the quote as used in the main piece contains such a clunky parenthetical insert that it at best it should be replaced by something closer to what you've given here. I'd actually go further and say that as we seem to be quoting E's view of what Schopenhauer thought of Buddhism, and Schopenhauer's views of Buddhism are notoriously unreliable, the link with science, Buddhism and this Einstein quote is getting pretty thin (effectively a Chinese whisper) and might be better being put elsewhere in this entry. What do you think&#160;? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobma_22b0.html" title="User:Robma">Robma</a> 14:28, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put the paraphrase in the article myself, to indicate that although the actual quote cited on many Buddhist websites (and previously in this article) is incorrect, Einstein did hold that sort of opinion about Buddhism, although he obviously wasn't <i>very</i> interested or he would have looked beyond Schopenhauer. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 14:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I know that scientists have said that Buddhism allows for fresh insights, I have yet to see a claim where Buddhism has actually <i>affected</i> these fields. It also seems to be a hodge-podge assemblage of fields that may be of interest to the Buddhist, but most scientists do not look to Buddhism to provide the "insights" in their work though other parts of their lives may be better complemented by Buddhism's hands-off approach to objectification. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 15:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The original statement did not claim to identify areas which have been <i>affected</i> by Buddhist input, but simply stated specific areas of science where <i>some</i> scientists have said Buddhism can offer insight. Certainly they may seem like a "hodge-podge" assemblage of fields, but those specified are the subject of the various refereed papers and books cited at the end of the entry. As such, I'd argue they constitute NPOV information of value to disinterested users. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobma_22b0.html" title="User:Robma">Robma</a> 21:36, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>A good starting point for finding out which scientists believe Buddhism offers insights into quantum theory and various other fields is <i>Buddhism and Science: Breaking new ground</i>(Columbia Univ Press 2003)". By the way, isn't an NPOV dispute a bit heavy-handed for an entry which (as far as I can see) makes the rather weak claim that _some_ scientists suggest Buddhism may be useful in offering "insights"&#160;? But perhaps there are other statements that have prompted it&#160;? I certainly feel increasingly unhappy with the direction the entry is taking....<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobma_22b0.html" title="User:Robma">Robma</a> 09:24, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Sure, but at the risk of being repetitive, no-one contributing to this entry has claimed anything more than that _some_ scientists have said Buddhism may be useful. Again, I don't really see what is non-NPOV about all this. For example, I'm an atheist, but I wouldn't find a claim on (say) a Christianity-related page that "Some Christians claim to get benefit from their belief" consistutes a non-NPOV <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobma_22b0.html" title="User:Robma">Robma</a> 17:30, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If this is the case, then please provide a citation to a scientist who says as much. Some scientists are Buddhists.

<p>yes, it is quite apparent that science seems to be a religion for you that blinds you to the fact that most of these scientists were influenced with the eastern thought of the time.</p>

<p>you were simply confrontational. I was simply providing sources and you kept on repeating the claim similar to "well there is no evidence that there was any deep influence of eastern philosophy on said scientists". Had you deleated that section, I wouldn't have bothered constantly putting in all the references. I simply provided enough references to prove otherwise. No hard feelings.</p>
<p>Frankly, you failed as you put in your personal opinions without research into the histories and biographies of these scientists.</p>

While it's true that certain scientific luminaries commented from time-to-time on Buddhism/Eastern philosophy, we need to be very careful to prevent people from getting the impression that quantum mechanics is either based on Buddhism or that they share more than superficial similarities. In particular, claims of various authors (<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deepak_Chopra_eb70.html" title="Deepak Chopra">Deepak Chopra</a> comes to mind) that science is only properly understood through the lens of Eastern thought is definitely not a perspective shared by most physicists. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 21:20, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>we are talking about the realm of ideas and the influence of many ideas and the CLARIFICATION of concepts which Heisenberg and Bohr clearly pointed out. I hardly find your writing to be "unbiased" since you are denying verifiable quotes in favor of your unverifiable opinions.</dd>

<dd>I don't think it is helpful to include quotes from one famous scientist or another, except to corroborate the fake Einstein quote which floats around. As an analogy, we could include a quote from Werner Von Braun supporting Creationism on the Creationism page, but it wouldn't enlighten anyone about the relationship between science and Creationism. I think it is better to discuss specific examples of science working with Buddhism in this article, and move all the quotes to Wikiquote. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 23:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
