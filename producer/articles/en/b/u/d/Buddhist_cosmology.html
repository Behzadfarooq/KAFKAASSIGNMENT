<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Introduction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The self-consistent Buddhist cosmology which is presented in commentaries and works of <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abhidharma.html" title="Abhidharma">Abhidharma</a> in both <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravāda</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahāyāna</a> traditions, is the end-product of an analysis and reconciliation of cosmological comments found in the Buddhist <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutra.html" title="Sutra">sūtra</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinaya.html" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a> traditions. No single sūtra sets out the entire structure of the universe. However, in several sūtras the Buddha describes other worlds and states of being, and other sūtras describe the origin and destruction of the universe. The synthesis of these data into a single comprehensive system must have taken place early in the history of Buddhism, as the system described in the <a href="../../../p/%C4%81/l/P%C4%81li.html" title="Pāli">Pāli</a> <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhajjavada.html" title="Vibhajjavada">Vibhajyavāda</a> tradition (represented by today's Theravādins) agrees, despite some trivial inconsistencies of nomenclature, with the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarvastivada.html" title="Sarvastivada">Sarvāstivāda</a> tradition which is preserved by Mahāyāna Buddhists.</p>
<p>The picture of the world presented in Buddhist cosmological descriptions cannot be taken as a literal description of the shape of the universe. It is inconsistent, and cannot be made consistent, with astronomical data that were already known in ancient India. However, it is not intended to be a description of how humans perceive their world; rather, it is the universe as seen through the <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">divyacakṣus</span> (Pāli: dibbacakkhu), the "divine eye" by which a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> or an <a href="../../../a/r/h/Arhat.html" title="Arhat">arhat</a> who has cultivated this faculty can perceive all of the other worlds and the beings arising (being born) and passing away (dying) within them, and can tell from what state they have been <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29_ecf7.html" title="Rebirth (Buddhism)">reborn</a> and into what state they will be reborn. The cosmology has also been interpreted in a symbolical or allegorical sense (see <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_spiritual_realms.html" title="Ten spiritual realms">Ten spiritual realms</a>).</p>
<p>Buddhist cosmology can be divided into two related kinds: spatial cosmology, which describes the arrangement of the various worlds within the universe, and temporal cosmology, which describes how those worlds come into existence, and how they pass away.</p>
<p><a name="Spatial_cosmology" id="Spatial_cosmology"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Spatial cosmology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spatial cosmology</span></h2>
<p>Spatial cosmology can also be divided into two branches. The <i>vertical cosmology</i> describes the arrangement of worlds in a vertical pattern, some being higher and some lower. The <i>sahasra cosmology</i> describes the grouping of these vertical worlds into sets of thousands, millions or billions.</p>
<p><a name="Vertical_cosmology" id="Vertical_cosmology"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Vertical cosmology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vertical cosmology</span></h3>
<p>In the vertical cosmology, the universe exists of many worlds (<span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">lokāḥ</span>) – one might say "planes" – stacked one upon the next in layers. Each world corresponds to a mental state or a state of being. A world is not, however, a location so much as it is the beings which compose it; it is sustained by their <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma_in_Buddhism_524d.html" title="Karma in Buddhism">karma</a> and if the beings in a world all die or disappear, the world disappears too. Likewise, a world comes into existence when the first being is born into it. The physical separation is not so important as the difference in mental state; humans and animals, though they partially share the same physical environments, still belong to different worlds because their minds perceive and react to those environments differently.</p>
<p>The vertical cosmology is divided into three realms, or <b>dhātu</b>s, each corresponding to a different type of mentality. These three (Tridhātu) are the Ārūpyadhātu, the Rūpadhātu, and the Kāmadhātu. This technical division does not correspond to the more informal categorization of the "<a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_realms.html" title="Six realms">six realms</a>". In the latter scheme, all of the beings born in the Ārūpyadhātu and the Rūpadhātu may be classified as "gods" or "deities" (<b><a href="../../../d/e/v/Deva_%28Buddhism%29_ed5a.html" title="Deva (Buddhism)"><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">devāḥ</span></a></b>), as can a considerable fraction of the beings born in the Kāmadhātu, even though the deities of the Kāmadhātu differ more from those of the Ārūpyadhātu than they do from humans. It is to be understood that <b>deva</b> is an imprecise term referring to any being living in a longer-lived and generally more blissful state than humans. Most of them are not "gods" in the common sense of the term, having little or no concern with the human world and rarely if ever interacting with it; only the lowest deities of the Kāmadhātu correspond to the gods described in many <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheism.html" title="Polytheism">polytheistic</a> religions.</p>
<p>The term "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_%28Buddhism%29_040d.html" title="Brahma (Buddhism)">brahmā</a>" is used both as a name and as a generic term for one of the higher devas. In its broadest sense, it can refer to any of the inhabitants of the Ārūpyadhātu and the Rūpadhātu. In more restricted senses, it can refer to an inhabitant of one of the nine lower worlds of the Rūpadhātu, or in its narrowest sense, to the three lowest worlds of the Rūpadhātu. A large number of devas use the name "Brahmā", e.g. Brahmā Sahampati, Brahmā Sanatkumāra, Baka Brahmā, etc. It is not always clear which world they belong to, although it must always be one of the worlds of the Rūpadhātu below the Śuddhāvāsa worlds.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Rūpadhātu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rūpadhātu</span></h4>
<p>The Rūpadhātu (Pāli: Rūpaloka; Tib: <i>gzugs.kyi khams</i>) or "Form realm" is, as the name implies, the first of the physical realms; its inhabitants all have a location and bodies of a sort, though those bodies are composed of a subtle substance which is of itself invisible to the inhabitants of the Kāmadhātu. According to the Janavasabha Sutta, when a brahma (a being from the Brahma-world of the Rūpadhātu) wishes to visit a deva of the Trāyastriṃśa heaven (in the Kāmadhātu), he has to assume a "grosser form" in order to be visible to them.</p>
<p>The beings of the Form realm are not subject to the extremes of pleasure and pain, or governed by desires for things pleasing to the senses, as the beings of the Kāmadhātu are. The bodies of Form realm beings do not have sexual distinctions.</p>
<p>Like the beings of the Ārūpyadhātu, the dwellers in the Rūpadhātu have minds corresponding to the <a href="../../../d/h/y/Dhyana.html" title="Dhyana">dhyānas</a> (Pāli: jhānas). In their case it is the four lower dhyānas or <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupajhana.html" title="Rupajhana">rūpadhyānas</a>. However, although the beings of the Rūpadhātu can be divided into four broad grades corresponding to these four dhyānas, each of them is subdivided into further grades, three for each of the four dhyānas and five for the Śuddhāvāsa devas, for a total of seventeen grades (the Theravāda tradition counts one less grade in the highest dhyāna for a total of sixteen).</p>
<p>Physically, the Rūpadhātu consists of a series of planes stacked on top of each other, each one in a series of steps half the size of the previous one as one descends. In part, this reflects the fact that the devas are also thought of as physically larger on the higher planes. The highest planes are also broader in extent than the ones lower down, as discussed in the section on <i><a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html#Sahasra_cosmology" title="Buddhist cosmology">Sahasra cosmology</a></i>. The height of these planes is expressed in <i>yojanas</i>, a measurement of very uncertain length, but sometimes taken to be about 4,000 times the height of a man, and so approximately 4.54 miles or 7.32 kilometers.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Śuddhāvāsa worlds">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Śuddhāvāsa worlds</span></h5>
<p>The Śuddhāvāsa (Pāli: Suddhāvāsa; Tib: <i>gnas gtsang.ma</i>) worlds, or "Pure Abodes", are distinct from the other worlds of the Rūpadhātu in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments, but only those <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_stages_of_enlightenment.html#Non-returner" title="Four stages of enlightenment">Anāgāmins</a> ("Non-returners") who are already on the path to <a href="../../../a/r/h/Arhat.html" title="Arhat">Arhat</a>-hood and who will attain enlightenment directly from the Śuddhāvāsa worlds without being reborn in a lower plane (Anāgāmins can also be born on lower planes). Every Śuddhāvāsa deva is therefore a protector of Buddhism. Because a Śuddhāvāsa deva will never be reborn outside the Śuddhāvāsa worlds, no <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhisattva.html" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> is ever born in these worlds, as a Bodhisattva must ultimately be reborn as a human being.</p>
<p>Since these devas rise from lower planes only due to the teaching of a Buddha, they can remain empty for very long periods if no Buddha arises. However, unlike the lower worlds, the Śuddhāvāsa worlds are never destroyed by natural catastrophe. The Śuddhāvāsa devas predict the coming of a Buddha and, taking the guise of brahmins, reveal to human beings the signs by which a Buddha can be recognized. They also ensure that a Bodhisattva in his last life will see the four signs that will lead to his renunciation.</p>
<p>The five Śuddhāvāsa worlds are:</p>

<li><b>Mahābrahmā</b> (Tib: <i>tshangs.pa chen.po</i>) – the world of "Great Brahmā", believed by many to be the creator of the world, and having as his titles "Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be." According to the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN.1), a Mahābrahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause. Note that even such a high-ranking deity has no intrinsic knowledge of the worlds above his own. Mahābrahmā is 1 <sup>1</sup><span class="Unicode">⁄</span><sub>2</sub> yojanas tall.

<p>The following four worlds are bounded planes. each 80,000 yojanas square, which float in the air above the top of Mount <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumeru.html" title="Sumeru">Sumeru</a>. Although all of the worlds inhabited by devas (that is, all the worlds down to the Cāturmahārājikakāyika world and sometimes including the Asuras) are sometimes called "heavens", in the western sense of the word the term best applies to the four worlds listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Parinirmita-vaśavartin</b> or <b>Paranimmita-vasavatti</b> (Tib: <i>gzhan.'phrul dbang.byed</i>) – The heaven of devas "with power over (others') creations". These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire for themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor. The ruler of this world is called Vaśavartin (Pāli: Vasavatti), who has longer life, greater beauty, more power and happiness and more delightful sense-objects than the other devas of his world. This world is also the home of the devaputra (being of divine race) called Māra, who endeavors to keep all beings of the Kāmadhātu in the grip of sensual pleasures. Māra is also sometimes called Vaśavartin, but in general these two dwellers in this world are kept distinct. The beings of this world are 4,500 feet tall and live for 9,216,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 1,280 yojanas above the Earth.</li>

<li><b><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Nirmāṇarati</span></b> or Nimmānaratī (Tib: <i>'phrul.dga'</i> )– The world of devas "delighting in their creations". The devas of this world are capable of making any appearance to please themselves. The lord of this world is called Sunirmita (Pāli Sunimmita); his wife is the rebirth of Visākhā, formerly the chief of the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upasaka.html" title="Upasaka">upāsikās</a> (female lay devotees) of the Buddha. The beings of this world are 3,750 feet tall and live for 2,304,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 640 yojanas above the Earth.</li>

This world is best known for being the world in which a Bodhisattva lives before being reborn in the world of humans. Until a few thousand years ago, the Bodhisattva of this world was Śvetaketu (Pāli: Setaketu), who was reborn as Siddhārtha, who would become the Buddha <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Śākyamuni</a>; since then the Bodhisattva has been Nātha (or Nāthadeva) who will be reborn as Ajita and will become the Buddha <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maitreya.html" title="Maitreya">Maitreya</a> (Pāli Metteyya). While this Bodhisattva is the foremost of the dwellers in <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Tuṣita</span>, the ruler of this world is another deva called <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Santuṣita</span> (Pāli: Santusita).

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Yāma</b> (Tib: <i>'thab.bral</i>) – Sometimes called the "heaven without fighting", because it is the lowest of the heavens to be physically separated from the tumults of the earthly world. Its ruler is the deva Suyāma; according to some, his wife is the rebirth of Sirimā, a courtesan of <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Rājagṛha</span> in the Buddha's time who was generous to the monks.

<p>The world-mountain of Sumeru is an immense, strangely shaped peak which arises in the center of the world, and around which the Sun and Moon revolve. Its base rests in a vast ocean, and it is surrounded by several rings of lesser mountain ranges and oceans. The three worlds listed below are all located on or around Sumeru: the Trāyastriṃśa devas live on its peak, the Cāturmahārājikakāyika devas live on its slopes, and the Asuras live in the ocean at its base. Sumeru and its surrounding oceans and mountains are the home not just of these deities, but also vast assemblies of beings of popular mythology who only rarely intrude on the human world.</p>

<p><b>Naraka</b> or <b>Niraya</b> (Tib: <i>dmyal.ba</i>) is the name given to one of the worlds of greatest suffering, usually translated into English as "hell" or "purgatory". As with the other realms, a being is born into one of these worlds as a result of his <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma_in_Buddhism_524d.html" title="Karma in Buddhism">karma</a>, and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result, after which he will be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened. The mentality of a being in the hells corresponds to states of extreme fear and helpless anguish in humans.</p>
<p>Physically, Naraka is thought of as a series of layers extending below Jambudvīpa into the earth. There are several schemes for counting these Narakas and enumerating their torments. One of the more common is that of the Eight Cold Narakas and Eight Hot Narakas.</p>

<p>All of the structures of the earth, Sumeru and the rest, extend downward to a depth of 80,000 yojanas below sea level – the same as the height of Sumeru above sea level. Below this is a layer of "golden earth", a substance compact and firm enough to support the weight of Sumeru. It is 320,000 yojanas in depth and so extends to 400,000 yojanas below sea level. The layer of golden earth in turn rests upon a layer of water, which is 8,000,000 yojanas in depth, going down to 8,400,000 yojanas below sea level. Below the layer of water is a "circle of wind", which is 16,000,000 yojanas in depth and also much broader in extent, supporting 1,000 different worlds upon it.</p>

<p>While the vertical cosmology describes the arrangement of the worlds vertically, the sahasra (Sanskrit: "thousand") cosmology describes how they are grouped horizontally. The four heavens of the Kāmadhātu, as mentioned, occupy a limited space no bigger than the top of Mount Sumeru. The three Brahmā-worlds, however, stretch out as far as the mountain-wall of <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Cakravāḍa</span>, filling the entire sky. This whole group of worlds, from Mahābrahmā down to the foundations of water, constitutes a single world-system. It corresponds to the extent of the universe that is destroyed by fire at the end of one mahākalpa.</p>
<p>Above Mahābrahmā are the Ābhāsvara worlds.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Temporal cosmology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Temporal cosmology</span></h2>
<p>Buddhist temporal cosmology describes how the universe comes into being and is dissolved. Like other Indian cosmologies, it assumes an infinite span of time and is cyclical. This does not mean that the same events occur in identical form with each cycle, but merely that, as with the cycles of day and night or summer and winter, certain natural events occur over and over to give some structure to time.</p>
<p>The basic unit of time measurement is the <b>mahākalpa</b> or "Great Eon". The exact length of this time in human years is never defined exactly, but it is meant to be very long, to be measured in billions of years if not longer.</p>
<p>A <b>mahākalpa</b> is divided into four kalpas or "eons", each distinguished from the others by the stage of evolution of the universe during that kalpa. The four kalpas are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vivartakalpa</b> "Eon of evolution" – during this kalpa the universe comes into existence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Vivartasthāyikalpa</b> "Eon of evolution-duration" – during this kalpa the universe remains in existence in a steady state.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Saṃvartakalpa</span></b> "Eon of dissolution" – during this kalpa the universe dissolves.</li>

<p>Each one of these kalpas is divided into twenty <b>antarakalpas</b> (Pāli <b>antarakappa</b>, "inside eons") each of about the same length.

<p>The Vivartakalpa begins with the arising of the primordial wind, which begins the process of building up the structures of the universe that had been destroyed at the end of the last mahākalpa. As the extent of the destruction can vary, the nature of this evolution can vary as well, but it always takes the form of beings from a higher world being born into a lower world. The example of a Mahābrahmā being the rebirth of a deceased Ābhāsvara deva is just one instance of this, which continues throughout the Vivartakalpa until all the worlds are filled from the Brahmaloka down to Naraka. During the Vivartakalpa the first humans appear; they are not like present-day humans, but are beings shining in their own light, capable of moving through the air without mechanical aid, living for a very long time, and not requiring sustenance; they are more like a type of lower deity than present-day humans are.</p>
<p>Over time, they acquire a taste for physical nutriment, and as they consume it, their bodies become heavier and more like human bodies; they lose their ability to shine, and begin to acquire differences in their appearance, and their length of life decreases. They differentiate into two sexes and begin to become sexually active. Then greed, theft and violence arise among them, and they establish social distinctions and government and elect a king to rule them, called Mahāsammata, "the great appointed one". Some of them begin to hunt and eat the flesh of animals, which have by now come into existence. These developments are described in the <a href="../../../a/g/g/Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a_Sutta_603f.html" title="Aggañña Sutta">Aggañña Sutta</a> (DN.27).</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: First antarakalpa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First antarakalpa</span></h4>
<p>The Vivartasthāyikalpa begins when the first being is born into Naraka, thus filling the entire universe with beings. During the first antarakalpa of this eon, human lives are declining from a vast but unspecified number of years (but at least several tens of thousands of years) toward the modern lifespan of less than 100 years. At the beginning of the antarakalpa, people are still generally happy. They live under the rule of a universal monarch or "wheel-turning king" (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chakravartin.html" title="Chakravartin">cakravartin</a>), who conquer. The Mahāsudassana-sutta (DN.17) tells of the life of a cakravartin king, Mahāsudassana (Sanskrit: Mahāsudarśana) who lived for 336,000 years. The Cakkavatti-sīhanāda-sutta (DN.26) tells of a later dynasty of cakravartins, <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Daḷhanemi</span> (Sanskrit: <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Dṛḍhanemi</span>) and five of his descendants, who had a lifespan of over 80,000 years. The seventh of this line of cakravartins broke with the traditions of his forefathers, refusing to abdicate his position at a certain age , pass the throne on to his son, and enter the life of a <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shramana.html" title="Shramana"><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">śramaṇa</span></a>. As a result of his subsequent misrule, poverty increased; as a result of poverty, theft began; as a result of theft, capital punishment was instituted; and as a result of this contempt for life, murders and other crimes became rampant.</p>
<p>The human lifespan now quickly decreased from 80,000 to 100 years, apparently decreasing by about half with each generation (this is perhaps not to be taken literally), while with each generation other crimes and evils increased: lying, adultery, evil speech, greed and hatred, wrong views, incest and other sorts of sexual abnormalities, disrespect for parents and elders. During this period, according to the Mahāpadāna-sutta (DN.14) three of the four Buddhas of this antarakalpa lived: Krakucchanda Buddha (Pāli: Kakusandha), at the time when the lifespan was 40,000 years; Kanakamuni Buddha (Pāli: Konāgamana) when the lifespan was 30,000 years; and Kāśyapa Buddha (Pāli: Kassapa) when the lifespan was 20,000 years.</p>
<p>Our present time is taken to be toward the end of the first antarakalpa of this Vivartasthāyikalpa, when the lifespan is less than 100 years, after the life of Śākyamuni Buddha (Pāli: Sakyamuni), who lived to the age of 80.</p>
<p>The remainder of the antarakalpa is prophesied to be miserable: lifespans will continue to decrease, and all the evil tendencies of the past will reach their ultimate in destructiveness. People will live no longer than ten years, and will marry at five; foods will be poor and tasteless; no form of morality will be acknowledged. The most contemptuous and hateful people will become the rulers. Incest will be rampant. Hatred between people, even members of the same family, will grow until people think of each other as hunters do of their prey.</p>
<p>Eventually a great war will ensue, in which the most hostile and aggressive will arm themselves and go out to kill each other. The less aggressive will hide in forests and other secret places while the war rages. This war marks the end of the first antarakalpa.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_cosmology.html" title="Edit section: Second antarakalpa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second antarakalpa</span></h4>
<p>At the end of the war, the survivors will emerge from their hiding places and repent their evil habits. As they begin to do good, their lifespan increases, and the health and welfare of the human race will also increase with it. After a long time, the descendants of those with a 10-year lifespan will live for 80,000 years, and at that time there will be a cakravartin king named <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Saṅkha</span>. During his reign, the current bodhisattva in the <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tushita.html" title="Tushita"><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Tuṣita</span></a> heaven will descend and be reborn under the name of Ajita. He will enter the life of a <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shramana.html" title="Shramana"><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">śramaṇa</span></a> and will gain perfect <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhi.html" title="Bodhi">enlightenment</a> as a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>; and he will then be known by the name of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maitreya.html" title="Maitreya">Maitreya</a> (Pāli: Metteyya).</p>
<p>After Maitreya's time, the world will again worsen, and the lifespan will gradually decrease from 80,000 years to 10 years again, each antarakalpa being separated from the next by devastating war, with peaks of high civilization and morality in the middle. After the 19th antarakalpa, the lifespan will increase to 80,000 and then not decrease, because the Vivartasthāyikalpa will have come to an end.</p>

<p>The <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Saṃvartakalpa</span> begins when beings cease to be born in Naraka. This cessation of birth then proceeds in reverse order up the vertical cosmology, i.e. pretas then cease to be born, then animals, then humans, and so on up to the realms of the deities.</p>
<p>When these worlds as far as the Brahmaloka are devoid of inhabitants, a great fire consumes the entire physical structure of the world. It burns all the worlds below the Ābhāsvara worlds. When they are destroyed, the <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Saṃvartasthāyikalpa</span> begins.</p>

<p>There is nothing to say about the <span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">Saṃvartasthāyikalpa</span>, since nothing happens in it below the Ābhāsvara worlds.

<p>The destruction by fire is the normal type of destruction that occurs at the end of the Saṃvartakalpa. But every eighth mahākalpa, after seven destructions by fire, there is a destruction by water. This is more devastating, as it eliminates not just the Brahma worlds but also the Ābhāsvara worlds.</p>
<p>Every sixty-fourth mahākalpa, after 56 destructions by fire and 7 destructions by water, there is a destruction by wind. This is the most devastating of all, as it also destroys the Śubhakṛtsna worlds. The higher worlds are never destroyed.</p>
