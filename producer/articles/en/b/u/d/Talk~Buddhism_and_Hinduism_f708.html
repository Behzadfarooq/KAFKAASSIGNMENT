<p>1) <b>This article does not take into account dating</b> of various texts. Pre and post Buddhist. Most of the dating of Hindu texts is questionable and by most scholars of any repute considered to be no earlier than 1500 bce.</p>
<p>Many Upanishads are post Buddhistic.</p>
<p>The POV in this article is obvious. Yoga Sutras are post Buddhistic, but Buddha is supposed to have copied from them...pathetic! Even the Dating of the Gita is questionable.</p>
<p>Karma, Dharma etc., has different meanings and usages in Hinduism and Buddhism, which is why there are separate articles.</p>
<p>Sorry but this article does not take into account the HUGE influence on Indian culture of Buddhism and the fact that Hinduism has no 4 Noble Truths or Eightfold Path and a whole host of other beliefs which were integrated into Hinduism to make what constitutes modern Hinduism.--Green23 14:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not quite, Karma ,Dharma have different meanings within Buddhism and Hinduism themselves, within a religion things can (and have) been percieved diffrently and often in a conflicting manner. Your attempts to form two uniform religions and contrast them are absurd and based on original reseach. Buddhism was another school of Hinduism itself, it has come up with nothing new, until it spread to such an extent that the followers of this philosophy became distinguished like those of Chinese folk religion. In no text has Buddha said leave your religion and convert to my path (which I'll call a religion), this was something which began happening later and now people aim to detach Buddha from his Hindu roots and life completely. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreedom_skies_2507.html" title="User:Freedom skies">Freedom skies</a> 02:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Buddha also regards his teachings as open to everyone and not as "<b>Rahasya</b>" of the Upanishads <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> or secret doctrine in comparison to brahmanism and openly calls the any secret doctrines as false:</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there are three things that shine before all the world, and not in secret. Which are they? The disc of the moon, O disciples, shines before all the world, and not in secret; the disc of the sun shines before all the world, and not in secret; the doctrines and rules proclaimed by the perfect Buddha since before all the world, not in secret.

<p>In Hinduism, <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishi.html" title="Rishi">Rishis</a> were mere "hearers" of "<a href="../../../s/h/r/Shruti.html" title="Shruti">shruti</a>" texts or <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a>, considered to be the holiest texts of Hinduism. Shruti literally means "that which was heard" in sanskrit. In Buddhism, the equivalent of Rishis are known as "Shravaks" which also means "hearer". So the equivalent of the Rishis who "heard the Vedas" would be the "Shravaks" in Buddhism.</p>

<p>Buddhist influence on Hinduism is notable. L. M. Joshi, notes that according to <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_Vivekananda_82f0.html" title="Swami Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>, Hinduism is largely Puranic and post-Buddhistic, he also notes that Vaishnavism owes a great deal to Buddhism<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In his speeches and writings Swami Vivekananda has often noted the diverse Buddhist influences on Hinduism. He had observed that "Modern Hinduism is largely Pauranika, that is, post-Buddhistic in origin." He pointed out that Buddhism was mainly responsible for stopping or lessening the customs of drinking wine and killing living animals for sacrifice or for food in India. He rightly traced the origin of Hindu images and temples to Buddhist models. About the relation of Vaishnavism to Buddhism, he was declared that "Buddhism and Vaishnavism are not two different things. During the decline of Buddhism in India, Hinduism took from her a few cardinal tenets of conduct and made them her own, and these have now come to be known as Vaishnavism." It should be noted here that Vaishnavism does not consist mainly of a few cardinal tenets of conduct. The Swami is briefly referring to moral principles and practices, such as ahimsa, karuna, maitri, respect for the guru, control of the mind and the senses of yoga, etc. which Buddhism transmitted to Vaishnavism. The Bodhisattva ideal and the idea of Buddhavatar also became integral parts of Vaishnava theology." [Joshi:1977:348]</dd>
</dl>
<p>L.M.Joshi further observes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Speaking of Buddhist ascetic ideals and institutions, Swami Vivekananda has said that the monastic vow and renunciation began to be preached all over India since the time of the Buddha, and Hinduism has absorbed into itself this Buddhist spirit of renunciation. The ochre robe found a lasting home in Hinduism also. The Hindu teacher not only accepted the Buddhist institution of monks. They occupied the Buddhist monasteries also. The many monasteries that you now see in India occupied by monks were once in the possession of Buddhism. The Hindus have only made them their own now by modifying them in their own fashion. Really speaking, the institution of Samnyasa originated with the Buddha. In conclusion the Swami has stated that Hinduism has become so great only by absorbing all the ideal of the Buddha. Swami Vivekananda has been a pivotal figure in modern Hinduism and his opinions are representative of the educated Hindus." [Ibid:348]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Social conditions were influenced</p>
<dl>
<dd>About the impact of Buddhism on the social conditions in this country and how it influenced the conditions of women and shudras, L.M.Joshi again, observes:</dd>
<dd>"Buddhism made profound impact in Indian social life in several ways. Its leaders and teachers continuously criticized the theory of castes and ridiculed the false claims to superiority based on birth (jati) and colour (varna). On the other hand, Buddhism opened the doors to higher religious life and the highest goal for all those who sought them, including the members of the lower strata of society. Although Buddhism was not directly concerned with the abolition of castes, it strongly opposed the caste system and repeatedly taught the evils of casteism. Another aspect of Buddhist social inhibition. Buddhism along with Jainism but unlike Brahmanism gave the equality of opportunity in religious culture to women. Some of the female members of the earliest ascetic order known to history were the Buddhist Theris or nuns whose religious poetry has come down to us in the Theriagatha. The eminent position attained by large number of women in Buddhist history, viz. Khema, Patacara, Dhammadinna, Subha, Kisa, Sujata, Visakha, Samavati, Ambapali, Upplamanna, and Soma, etc. shows that Buddhism had done much for the emancipation of women in Indian society. The same is true with regard to the Buddhist contribution towards the upliftment of shudras." [Ibid:368]</dd>

<p>Ashoka's edicts mentions no Hindus, but mentions "Dhamma" but does mention Brahmans and Shramans and Buddhist sutras.</p>
<p>Hinduism is a Puranic religion and incorporates Vedas and Buddhism. It might be religious syncretism, I have sources from other scholars as well, Hinduism is merely religious syncretism of all the religions on the Indian subcontinent.

<p>1) Hinduism is syncretism of all Indian beliefs, and is not a word used before Gupta period.</p>
<p>2) Comparison of Vedic tradition Hinduism to Buddhism is more in order.</p>
<p>3) post Buddhistic works == many Upanishads and the Yoga Sutras are definately post Buddhistic.</p>
<p>4) pre-post Buddhist influence on India is not noted.</p>
<p>5) majority of Indians were Buddhist during Ashoka's reign.</p>

<p>Buddhism is completely against Dogma.The Aim of the buddha was to propagate dhamma or Dharma NOT to 'convert' in the proslysteic sense but to get rid of dukkha. Being a buddhist by birth or even by choice may not lead to the fufilment of this aim. Hinduism too is NOT a religion which needs to be abided by without thought. Most modern Hindus like Buddhists are very clear in the role religion must play in their lives.The Buddha did not concern Himself with the presence of 'God/Brahman'but did not deny it.Hinduism has spent some time and effort to explore this avenue. Therefore Buddhisma nd Hinduism are complementary.They have a lot to learn from each other and have done so.They are undoubtedly 2 Obvioulsy different streams moving in the same direction and the as they have done in India these streams have merged to a great extent.Buddhism therefore NEVER DIED in India for its soul was preserved by Hindus. I therefore feel that the article MUST NOT BE DELETED BUT be written out in a more useful manner.</p>
