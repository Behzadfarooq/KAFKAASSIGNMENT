<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Pancha Sila">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pancha Sila</span></h2>
<p>Buddhism's ethical foundation for laypeople is the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancasila.html" title="Pancasila">Pancasila</a>: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. (Some <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> followers add further items such as gambling.) That is, in becoming a Buddhist--or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism--a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions, in order to avoid accumulating negative <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a>. Buddhist monks and nuns take many hundreds more such vows (see <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinaya.html" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Why_be_good.3F" id="Why_be_good.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Why be good?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why be good?</span></h2>
<p>An interesting feature of Buddhist ethics is that it seems to consist of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothetical_imperative.html" title="Hypothetical imperative">hypothetical imperatives</a> rather than <a href="../../../c/a/t/Categorical_imperative.html" title="Categorical imperative">categorical imperatives</a>. That is, a Buddhist does not abstain from killing and stealing simply for the sake of doing what is right, but in order to attain a certain end, namely <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28concept%29.html" title="Enlightenment (concept)">enlightenment</a>. If we imagine a parallel universe where karma rewards those who kill and steal, one wonders what the Buddhist response would be. (Most Buddhist thinkers would deny that such a universe would be possible, since an effect must resemble its cause.)</p>
<p>We may also note that Buddhism simply assumes "enlightenment"--variously understood as the cessation of suffering and its causes, the removal of obscurations to one's innate luminous nature, etc.--to be a worthy goal. A Christian, for example, might wonder whether suffering might be intentionally chosen, for the sake of others (a perspective which Buddhism would not necessarily reject).</p>
<p>Mahayana Buddhists stress the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhicitta.html" title="Bodhicitta">bodhicitta</a> principle--that one should seek enlightenment not only for one's own sake, but for the sake of "all sentient beings." (Cf. the Theravadin practice of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metta.html" title="Metta">mettabhavana</a> meditation, in which one wishes all beings well.) This orientation however is not so much altruistic as reflective of the Mahayana belief that bodhicitta is instrumentally necessary in order to develop omniscience--that is, in order to become "fully enlightened."</p>
<p>The nature of enlightenment is typically held to transcend dualistic or conceptual categories such as good and evil. Might an enlightened being commit murder, or adultery? On one hand many such stories can be found in Buddhist lore (and not all of them ancient); on the other hand, strong social constraints against this philosophy obviously exist. By the same token, some may conclude from the teaching of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunyata.html" title="Sunyata">sunyata</a> (emptiness) that such things as human life do not ultimately matter--a conclusion which Buddhism roundly rejects.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Selflessness and moral agency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Selflessness and moral agency</span></h2>
<p>Buddhist denials of the "self" (<a href="../../../a/t/m/Atman.html" title="Atman">atman</a>) lead to many involved philosophical conundrums, many of them apparently posed by the Buddha himself. If "I" do not exist, then who is the "moral agent" (as ethicists would say)? What connects the identity of the person who committed the negative action in the past, with his "future incarnation" who will suffer the corresponding negative karma? Where Western ethicists have agonized over divine justice, arguing for example whether God is ethical or not, such discussions tend not to arise in connection with karma, which is perceived as an impersonal amoral law, like gravity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Middle Way">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Way</span></h2>
<p>One of the teachings of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, the historical founder of Buddhism, was the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Way_e300.html" title="Middle Way">Middle Way</a>. This interests ethicists for its resemblance to Aristotle's <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Mean_6c87.html" title="Golden Mean">Golden Mean</a>. However, Buddha does not seem to have been a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtue_ethics.html" title="Virtue ethics">virtue ethicist</a>, as Aristotle was.</p>
<p><a name="Detachment" id="Detachment"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Detachment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Detachment</span></h2>
<p>Another interesting feature of Buddhism is that it emphasizes "detachment" in contrast to other systems of ethics that emphasize attachment to others is a virtue. Not a few dharma students have raised the clever question of whether it is wrong to become "attached" to Buddhism or enlightenment, or for that matter to one's spouse (as opposed to all the other possible partners of the world). However, Buddhists understand "attachment" to mean "selfish attachment." Selfless "attachment"--including love for others (to the extent that this is truly "selfless") --is positive.</p>

<p>One sometimes reads that there has never been a Buddhist holy war. However, a glance at the contemporary politics of <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> will find some Buddhist monks regularly urging military action against that island's Tamil terrorists. Other historical examples could be cited, e.g. from Tibet and its relation to the <a href="../../../b/%C3%B6/n/B%C3%B6n.html" title="Bön">Bön</a> faith. On the whole however, there has been significantly fewer holy wars in the name of Buddhism than in the name of other <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_religious_groups.html" title="Major religious groups">major religions</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Sex_Roles" id="Sex_Roles"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_ethics.html" title="Edit section: Sex Roles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sex Roles</span></h2>
<p>All traditions of Buddhism describe or assume different roles for men and women (including monks and nuns). The resulting inequalities have led to predictable responses from feminists, especially Western nuns. An example would be the campaign to restore the bikhuni (fully-fledged nun's) ordination in Theravadin countries, where the move has met with intense social resistance.</p>

Reasons for the performance of these rites can include parental grief, desire to comfort the soul of the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>, or even fear of retribution from vengeful or wayward spirits. Originally, <i>mizuko kuyo</i> was used to make <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offering.html" title="Offering">offerings</a> to <a href="../../../k/s/i/Ksitigarbha.html" title="Ksitigarbha">Jizo</a>, a <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhisattva.html" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> who is believed to protect children.

<p>As a religion Buddhism places great emphasis on the sanctity of life. However there is disagreement among Buddhists as to whether or not Buddhism forbids the death penalty. The first of the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Precepts_1b2b.html" title="Five Precepts">Five Precepts</a> (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhammapada.html" title="Dhammapada">Dhammapada</a> states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states "Him I call a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">brahmin</a> who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill". These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this matter. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, where <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is the official religion, practices the death penalty, as do many other countries where the majority of the population are Buddhist, such as <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. Moreover, almost throughout history, countries where Buddhism has been the official religion (which have included most of the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_982f.html" title="Far East">Far East</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indochina.html" title="Indochina">Indochina</a>) have practiced the death penalty. One exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Saga_8d4c.html" title="Emperor Saga">Emperor Saga</a> of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> abolished in <a href="../../../8/1/8/818.html" title="818">818</a>. This lasted until <a href="../../../1/1/6/1165.html" title="1165">1165</a>, although in private manors executions conducted as a form of retaliation continued to be conducted.</p>
<p>The first precept of Buddhism focuses mainly on direct participation in the destruction of life. This is one reason that the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> made a distinction between killing animals and eating meat, and refused to introduce vegetarianism into monastic practice (see Vegetarian section of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>). In <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jataka.html" title="Jataka">Jataka</a>, which tell stories of the past lives of the Buddha, Boddisatva (a previous incarnation of the Buddha) actually kills someone to save another person's life, though because of this action, he was no longer able to achieve enlightenment in that particular life. Therefore, few (if any) Buddhist groups issue blanket decrees against Buddhists being soldiers, police officers or farmers (which in Buddhism is classified as a profession involved in destruction of life), and some argue that the death penalty is permissible in certain circumstances. In general, Buddhist groups in secular countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan tend to take anti-death penalty stance while those in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Bhutan where Buddhism has strong political influence, the opposite is true. Almost all Buddhist groups, however, oppose the use of the death penalty as a means of <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retributive_justice.html" title="Retributive justice">retribution</a>.</p>

<p>In Theravada Buddhism, for a monk to praise the advantages of death including simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death is explictedly stated as a breach of one of highest vinaya code regarding prohibition of harming life, hence it will result in automatic expulsion from <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangha.html" title="Sangha">Sangha</a>. In caring for the terminally ill, no one should subject a patient to treatment designed to bring on death faster than it would if the disease were simply allowed to run its course.[2]</p>

Among the many interpretations of what constitutes "sexual misconduct" are: sex outside of marriage (a relatively modern idea), sex with another person without the consent of your life partner, or the historically prevalent view that it was limited to describe <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a>.</p>
<p>No Buddhist school prior to the European Imperialism that began largely around the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_Century_a660.html" title="17th Century">17th Century</a> had ever described homosexuality as "sexual misconduct". Traditionally, however, monks of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a> and most <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> schools are expected to be celibate and restrain themselves from all sexual activity. However, Buddhist functionaries, or "priests", of the <a href="../../../v/a/j/Vajrayana.html" title="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a> and many Korean and Japanese schools are allowed to marry.</p>
<p>Buddhist schools condemning homosexuality for laypersons is a recent development with no scriptural basis. The closest would be a few Buddhists who equated homosexuality to a disability, or to being a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestite</a>, but there was no condemnation in any real sense (see also <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Buddhist leaders throughout <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> accepted or even sanctified homosexuality.</p>
<p>During the 1990's, the Dalai Lama debated American gay activists over certain Buddhist scriptural admonitions against homosexuality (or more specifically, the use of the "wrong orifice"). The Dalai Lama seemed confused over the demands of the activists, that he somehow abrogate what he saw simply as statements of karmic law from the Buddhist scriptures. Whether to follow the advice or not was up to the individual practitioner.</p>

<p>(The part on Vegetarianism of this article is disputed. Please see the discussion)</p>
<p>Many Buddhists, especially in East Asia, believe that Buddhism teaches <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>. While Buddhist theory tends to lump killing animals together with killing people (and avoids the conclusion that killing can sometimes be ethical, e.g. defense of others), as a practical matter most Buddhists do eat meat. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a> countries, monks must accept whatever food is offered them. (Buddha himself seems to have died from eating rancid pork.) Vegetarian Tibetans are rare indeed (and not only for lack of vegetables in Tibet, since Tibetan exile monks in India actually consume <i>more</i> meat). The <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenzin_Gyatso_eb73.html" title="Tenzin Gyatso">Dalai Lama</a> (who himself tried to become a vegetarian but caught <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatitis_B_56eb.html" title="Hepatitis B">Hepatitis B</a> and was advised by doctors to switch to a high animal-protein diet) once engaged in an amusing ethical discussion with Theravadan Buddhists, who believed that as long as one was determined to eat meat, seafood was preferable to red meat. The Dalai Lama responded that one bowl of shrimp would kill multitudes of sentient beings, but one sheep or cow would feed many people. The Dalai Lama eats vegetarian every second day, so is effectively vegetarian for 6 months of the year.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancasila.html" title="Pancasila">first lay precept</a> in Buddhism is usually translated as "I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures." Many see this as implying that Buddhists should not eat the meat of animals. However, this is not necessarily the case. There is a divergence of views within Buddhism on the need for vegetarianism, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a claimed need and with most Buddhists in fact eating meat. A minority of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> Buddhists, however, strongly oppose meat-eating on certain scriptural grounds.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../p/%C4%81/l/P%C4%81li.html" title="Pāli">Pali</a> version of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripitaka.html" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka,</a> there are number of occasions in which the Buddha ate meat as well as recommending certain types of meat as a cure for medical conditions. On one occasion, a general sent a servant to purchase meat specifically to feed the Buddha. The Buddha declared that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); these, Jivaka, are the three circumstances in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which meat can be eaten.</p>
<div align="right">-- Jivaka Sutta</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha, on one particular occasion, specifically refused suggestions by a monk to institute vegetarianism in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangha.html" title="Sangha">Sangha</a>. According to Kassapa Buddha (a previous Buddha of legend not Shakyamuni Buddha) "[t]aking life, beating, wounding, binding, stealing, lying, deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery; this is stench. Not the eating of meat." (Amagandha Sutta). There were, however, rules prohibiting consumption of 10 types of meat. Those are humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears and hyenas because these animals can be provoked by the smell of the flesh of their own kind.</p>
<p>Theravada commentaries explain the Buddha was making distinction between direct destruction of life and eating of already dead meat. Moreover, they point out that any act of consumption would involve proxy killing, including the farming of crops, so the idea that meat eating amounted to proxy killing while eating vegetables does not is ignorance. For this reason, they discourage gluttony or any other act of craving which lead to over consumption. However, some Therevadan monks suggest that it is possible to make some case for vegetarianism starting from <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmavihara.html" title="Brahmavihara">brahmavihara</a>. Interestingly, that is how Mahayana Buddhism makes the case for vegetarianism.</p>
<p>There is no mention of Buddha endorsing or repudiating vegetarianism in surviving portions of Sanskrit Tripitaka. Moreover, no major Mahayana sutras explicitly declare that meat eating violates the first precept. However, certain <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana_sutras.html" title="Mahayana sutras">Mahayana sutras</a> vigorously and unreservedly denounce the eating of meat, mainly on the ground that such an act violates the bodhisattva's compassion. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the <i>Nirvana Sutra,</i> the <i>Shurangama Sutra,</i> the <i>Brahmajala Sutra,</i> the <i>Angulimaliya Sutra,</i> the <i>Mahamegha Sutra,</i> and the <i>Lankavatara Sutra,</i> as well as the Buddha's comments on the negative karmic effects of meat consumption in the <i>Karma Sutra</i>. In the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana_Mahaparinirvana_Sutra_6767.html" title="Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra">Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra</a>, which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that "the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: ". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating." The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will "hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma" and will concoct their own sutras and lyingly claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact he says he does not. A long passage in the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lankavatara_Sutra_65af.html" title="Lankavatara Sutra">Lankavatara Sutra</a> shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatakas.html" title="Jatakas">jatakas</a>), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.</p>
