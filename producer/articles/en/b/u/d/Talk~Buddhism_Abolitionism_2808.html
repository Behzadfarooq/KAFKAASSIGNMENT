	    <p>In order to avert a revert war between myself and <a href="../../../a/b/o/User_talk%7EAbolitionist_1438.html" title="User talk:Abolitionist">User:Abolitionist</a>, let's discuss. What does every one else think about his recent additions (see also Abolitionist society)? To me, they don't quite seem relevant. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 12:29, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks to me like a marginal vanity project. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User_talk%7EAbolitionist_1438.html" title="User talk:Abolitionist">User:Abolitionist</a> has been, IMO, spamming links across a wide range of articles that have any sort of tenuous connection to this. At best, this might merit a inclusion in the See also section, but a full paragraph in this article seems little more than PR. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 12:49, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Ironic that a project to eliminate suffering should be considered irrelevant. A marginal, vanity project? This is a serious project of the utmost urgency. People have a right to know that there are real alternatives to religious dogma. - Abolitionist</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with the Abolitionist project on Wikipedia (outside of information), is that Wikipedia is NOT a forum for political agendas. Most people are aware that there are alternatives to religious dogma and that would include Buddhists. Buddhism is based upon principles of finding things out for yourself, and not depending upon personal or scriptural authorities. This stance is one of the main distinctions between Buddhism and Hinduism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, unless there is a directly meaningful link with Buddhism on the informational level (IE that the Abolitionist society is Buddhist, there should not be mention of it. If the Abolitionist society is Buddhist, then I suggest a link in the Buddhist Schools article, not the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> article. I notice on the Abolitionist society article nothing that suggests it is part of any Buddhist project. Therefore, I concur with Nat Krause.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to it being a 'related system', well, one may argue a link to Mahayana buddhism on the grounds that both seek to eliminate sentient suffering. However, a society is not really a system, and it may be useful to indicate on the Abolitionist society article just how it differs from the Mahayana project in it's scope and purpose. The ethics of benefitting all, as can be found in a wealth of Tibetan literature over the last thousand years, is a deeply profound subject - and the Abolitionist society article does nothing to talk about it. I recommend that interested parties make more of the Abolitionist society article so that it is easier for mahayana buddhists to understand why there is a salient, and relavant agenda.

<dd>It seems that you all don't think that Buddhism is really just about eliminating suffering - that's interesting. Be afraid of doctrine that proclaims to have the solution to suffering when it has not been able to do so for thousands of years. Let's find a Buddhist who claims to be beyond suffering and verify if this is true. I know that sysops are only concerned with cleaning house... please understand, in my thinking the end justifies the means. It's a grave waste to let people be duped (it's very easy to brainwash) into following Buddhist doctrine with hopes of eliminating suffering - especially when they could be involved in real efforts to accomplish this.

<dd>On the contrary--text is a representation of sound, and there are many ways of translating volume into text--bold being one of several standard methods for this purpose. Responses are usually indicated on Wikipedia through indentation (done by inserting colons at the beginning of the line), not bolding; I encourage you to adopt this standard, as (a) it is more flexible, and can indicate more levels of response, and (b) it's the Wikipedia standard. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<p>Now to briefly respond to your comment. (1) Generally, Buddhism does not agree with you concerning ideas of objective reality, so according to many Buddhists, Buddhism does not 'really' hold an ontological status beyond any given context.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>So Buddhism excuses itself from accountability? The spread of Buddhism would not happen without objective means.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>(2) Do you really think that a massive system of beliefs that has affected a large portion of humanity can be "just" about anything?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>In this case, yes. Buddhism proclaims to have the solution to suffering - it is the foundation of the doctrine.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course, any statement as such would be reductive to the extreme. You show some understanding of the basis of the four noble truths</p>
<p>, and you appear to concur:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>How do I concur?</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>you also agree with Buddhists that there is a way out of suffering.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Yes, I do agree that suffering can be eliminated. It is a chemical process.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>But has it occured to you to begin to look at the vast literature available as to what is meant by <i>suffering</i> in the Buddhist context, let alone freedom from it?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Yes, they say suffering is an overlay of the ego-mind onto experience - to keep it short.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Out of curiosity, who are "they", and what do you (or "they"?) mean by "overlay"? I.e., Buddhism contains a spectacular diversity of ideas, and I'm wondering which you are familiar with. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<dd>Yes, but Buddhism contains many different opinions on suffering, not all of which may agree on all points, and which in any case emphasize different aspects of Buddhist theory and practice.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah. Interesting. Your argument, whether or not it is correct, demonstrates precisely why your views as so far set forth do not belong in Wikipedia--Wikipedia is not concerned with righting wrongs or providing a new and interesting critique of standing traditions; it is concerned precisely with providing traditional-type definitional information such as you would find in any other encyclopedia, and differing from normal dictionary definitions primarily by scope.

<p>Let me try to summarize the situation. The question is, should material on this "abolitionism" thingie be included on Buddhism pages, right? The contributor has argued that it should because it presents a valid critique of Buddhism. However, the validity of the critique is unimportant to an encyclopedia, which is not a venue for original research and writing, but rather for reporting factual information of some minimum degree of importance. Therefore, the real question is, do these abolitionists appear to have <i>historical</i> importance? I googled "David Pearce hedonistic", for example, and only turned up a few hundred sites, about half of the top three pages of which was Wikipedia mirrors and dead sites. This is not promising. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionist_Society_feb9.html" title="Abolitionist Society">Abolitionist Society</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonistic_Imperative_b69c.html" title="Hedonistic Imperative">Hedonistic Imperative</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pearce_4f87.html" title="David Pearce">David Pearce</a>, etc...But in any case I believe it's completely obvious it has no place anywhere near <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>... <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 18:10, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Historical significance is of course open to debate, both regarding what constitutes it and regarding what the minimum threshold is. But I would say, offhand, that something is historically insignificant in the current context (religion articles) if (a) it doesn't have a community of practice at least in the thousands, and (b) it doesn't have a history extending over more than a century, and (c) it doesn't have a respected body of scholarship associated with it.</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to intimidate, and while I don't google all WP articiles, the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">google test</a> is one of the accepted community standards for inclusion-worthiness of articles, and is a frequently used method for ascertaining whether an article should be vfd'd or not. I'm an inclusionist by nature, but I'm also somewhat touchy about what I regard as exploitations of Wikipedia. No offense meant. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>
