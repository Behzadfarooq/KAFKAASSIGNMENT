<p>Much of this article is non-NPOV. There are few citations and references; it also contains many inaccuracies. It needs to be thoroughly reviewed and re-written. Since it also has little to do with Hinduism, the Hindu Project banner should also be removed, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 02:38, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I agree that the article is non-NPOV, and lack citations and references. It's also has an unencyclopedic style, reading like an attempt to "take back" Buddha from the Buddhists. I think it's fine to keep it as part of WikiProject Hinduism, as the article explicitly descibes the conception of Buddha in Hindu religion/mythology. There's definitely a need for such an article to exist, if only to expand on the terse, rather clinical, description at <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html#Hinduism" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama_Buddha#Hinduism</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 03:25, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My main problem with this article is that it does not do what it purports to do: there is only minimal content dealing with the Buddha as an avatara of Vishnu. 95% of the article is irelevent and already covered in the various pages related to Buddhism. The irrevelent material should be cut. If warranted, perhaps an article covering the wider topic of "the Buddha from the Hindu perspective" could include some of this material, provided it is sourced and referenced properly. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
As a first step, how about deleting the following four sections, as they all seem to be pretty irrelevant to Buddha (the avatar of Vishnu):</p>
<ul>
<li>"Was Buddha an Atheist?"</li>
<li>"Brahman in Earliest Buddhism"</li>
<li>"Deva worship in Buddhism"</li>
<li>"Vegetarian Practices in Buddhism"</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't an article about the relationship between Buddhist practice and Hinduism (or for that matter, about why Hindus know Buddha better than Buddhists do -- which seems to be the article's current thesis) --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 00:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Anirvan. Yes, I agree. If user Maleabroad wants to keep this material, it should be transferred to a new article on the Buddha from the Hindu perspective, where we can then examine the accuracy and NPOV of the contents of those bits. The current article should only cover what it says it covers: the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu and nothing more.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A postscript to the above.

<dd>Just to be clear, I can see three distinct areas covered in this article: (1) Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu in the Hindu mythology (9th among Vishnu's ten avatars), (2) Gautama Buddha as a historical Hindu figure and the impact of his teachings on an evolving Hinduism, and (3) the relationship between and cross-influences among Hinduism and Buddhism. It might make sense to include both #1 and #2 in the same article (e.g. "Buddha in Hinduism"), and push the third out into a different article (e.g. Buddhadharma and other Indian Dharmas#Hinduism or <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism_and_other_religions.html#Subsequent_Dharma_faiths:_Buddhism.2C_and_Jainism" title="Hinduism and other religions">Hinduism and other religions#Subsequent Dharma faiths: Buddhism, and Jainism</a>). I'm not a fan of the POV, but the areas covered in the article seem entirely valid. (P.S. Steven, can you please add edit summaries when you make changes to the article? Thanks.) --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 01:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree this article has really rambled and drifted off-topic until you are confused what it is about and why some sections are there. If they belong they are not well integrated, and just reading it seems to be a bit of a mess. I have seen this happen to a few other article that I have run into from Maleabroad, not sure what is going on. I wanted to put up a cleanup tag but since its pretty much for revision anyhow just gonna give it a miss. I also agree that it belongs in Hinduism because it is dealing with a Hindu diety, and I beleive either it needs to address the historical significance of this identification or lead into a seperate artcile that does. I do beleive this identification played a major role in the late 1st millenium in the decline of Buddhism in the South of India, and I can see how it may get POV with the conflict in Sri Lanka.</dd>

<p>I am glad to see that some preliminary editing has occured. But still not enough in my opinion. I was hoping that the original author of this article would put in an appearance and discuss the remaining problems -- which I list here:</p>
<p><b>1) Buddha the Solar Deity</b>: Largely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>2) Buddha's Hindu Mission</b>: Almost completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic, except for the unsourced <i>a Hindu scripture claims Buddha's mission was to "mislead" the "demons</i>."</p>
<p><b>3) Arya Dharma</b>: Completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>4) Was Buddha an Atheist?</b>: Completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>5) Brahman in earliest Buddhism</b>: Completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>6) Brahmaviharā</b>: Completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>7) Buddha as God Almighty</b>: Completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p><b>8) Quotes</b>: Both are completely irrelevent to "Buddha as Vishnu avatara" topic</p>
<p>I am not saying that the material under these headings is valueless -- some of it has already been covered elsewhere -- but it should not be included in this article. It would be better to include this stuff under something like "The Buddha from a Hindu Perspective" -- with references and citations. What I would like to see in the current article is more information about the Buddha as an avatara of Vishnu. When did this idea start&#160;? What texts deal with the idea&#160;? What was the purpose of avatarizing the Buddha&#160;? What is the Buddhist perspective on this&#160;?--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I suggest renaming the article "Buddha in Hinduism" to broaden the scope of the article, so it can incorporate both the role of Buddha as an avatar in the Hindu mythos, as well as his role as a co-participant in the project of the development of Hindu philosophy. In my limited knowledge of Hinduism, Buddha is the only historically authentic figure I know of who plays both roles, which makes him rather interesting. I'll go ahead and rename the article if I get an OK from someone. Thanks! --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirvan_a096.html" title="User:Anirvan">Anirvan</a> 20:05, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Anirvan, bfore you do that, have a look at this Wiki article which seems to cover the same topic in a short form: Buddhadharma and other Indian Dharmas--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 21:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, Stephen. That's a good starting point for an article. You'll notice that it links to Gautama Buddha in Hinduism as the main article, and that Gautama Buddha in Hinduism is itself a redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html#Hinduism" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama_Buddha#Hinduism</a>. Here's what I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>stop making Gautama Buddha in Hinduism a redirect, and make it the primary article on Buddha in Hinduism</li>
<li>populate Gautama Buddha in Hinduism with content from <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_as_an_Avatar_of_Vishnu_0207.html" title="Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu">Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu</a>, Buddhadharma and other Indian Dharmas#Hinduism, and <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html#Hinduism" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama_Buddha#Hinduism</a></li>
<li>for both of the sections at Buddhadharma and other Indian Dharmas#Hinduism and <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html#Hinduism" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama_Buddha#Hinduism</a>, indicate that the Gautama Buddha in Hinduism is the main article</li>

<p>Dear Viewers of this article. I created this article because there were many article for Buddhists or Nastik Buddhists as a Hindu would say, but none for "The Buddha from a Hindu Perspective," and as a reult I created this. Many times my material in the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama.html" title="Gautama">Gautama</a> page was being deleted by neo-Buddhists perhaps. Gautama is understood by many religions as a savior. The Baha'i think of him as an incarnation of God as do the Hindus. I added the article such as <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism_in_Buddhism_e2e0.html" title="Vegetarianism in Buddhism">Vegetarianism in Buddhism</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_in_Buddhism_ecd1.html" title="God in Buddhism">God in Buddhism</a> because those are aspects which connect with Hinduism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMaleabroad_5d43.html" title="User talk:Maleabroad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maleabroad_53e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maleabroad">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but these amateurish references are not worth much. I repeat, <i>buddhau</i>, locative of <i>buddhi</i>, does not refer to <b>the</b> Buddha at all. This is obvious from the occurences of <i>buddhi</i> in the following verses 50-53 of the BhG. If that does not satisfy you, this is how some of the greatest commentators have glossed <i>buddhau</i> in 2.49.</dd>

<p>If your Sanskrit is a bit rusty, these glosses are, in brief 1. refuge in knowledge or reliance upon God; 2. refuge in buddhi of the supreme self; 3. refuge in knowledge of the self; 4. refuge in discriminatory buddhi. No sign of <b>the</b> Buddha here. So, let's have an end to this nonsense -- Krsna is not urging Arjuna to take refuge in <b>the</b> Buddha at all.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 02:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me remind you, that this is an article about VISHNU and Buddha as a VISHNU AVATAR. Does that ring a bell in your head?</p>
<p>In Buddhism, "Buddham sharanam gacchami" means the same thing. Buddham is the supreme spirit, "who sees the Dharma, he sees me" is the common saying.</p>
<p>Buddha is Dharma or the body of what theists like to call "God". So I am right. You are wrong.</p>
<pre>
Buddha is THE same God.  So you should remove that, or I will.

<ul>
<li><b>Buddhi</b> (Sanskrit, "intellect") in Sanskrit literature is the higher mental faculty, the instrument of knowledge, discerment, and decision. <i>Buddhi</i> is comprehended slightly different in different philosophical systems. On the whole, it contrasts with <i>manas</i>, mind, whose province is ordinary consciousness and the connection of <i>atman</i> with the senses. <i>Buddhi</i>, however, is a higher faculty that acts in sense percepts organized by <i>manas</i> and furnishes intellectual discrimination, determination, reason, and will. As such buddhi is at the very core of one's being, as sentient creatures, and the closest mental faculty to the <i>atman</i>, real Self or spirit. In Samkhya-yoga philosophy, <i>buddhi</i> (or <i>mahat</i>, "the great one") plays a key role. <i>Buddhi</i> is the first principle derived from unmanifest <i>prakrti</i> (and predominant in <i>sattva guna</i>, "intellectual stuff"), virtually transparent reflector for pure consciousness (<i>purusa</i>), with which <i>buddhi</i> mistakenly identifies. With this mistaken identification with the conscious principle, a fall into ignorance, <i>buddhi</i> produces the next principle, <i>ahamkara</i>, which in turn produces manas. The three together make up the "internal instrument," or <i>antahkarana</i>. For salvation, <i>buddhi</i> must attain the discriminative discernment between itself as unconscious matter, <i>prakrti</i>, and the independent and transcendent principle of pure consciousness, <i>purusa</i>.</li>

<p>The definition of Buddha is defined perfectly in Buddhism -- Buddha is one who has obtained to perfect Buddhi and removed Abuddhi, the scriptural citation is provided in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, a or the Buddha is defined properly in Buddhism, but not in the terms you claim. You cite the Khuddaka-patha as a source of your <i>buddhi</i>/<i>abuddhi</i>. I have five Pali editions to hand and none of them even uses the words <i>buddhi</i> or <i>abuddhi</i>. What passage in this text do you think states this&#160;? Please provide a page reference or quote from a recognized edition.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, in the Gita "Buddhi" is given by "ME", this is Krishna referring to himself as the Mahapurusha. Similarly Buddha who is the "dhamma" gives or bestows Buddhi. Buddhi is considered the highest attainment, citation provided in article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your equation of the Buddha and dhamma in the sense you suggest is dubious. To say that the Buddha bestows buddhi is unsubstantiated: buddhi is a very rare term in Buddhist texts -- it occurs less than dozen times in the Nikayas and never in the sense you ascribe to the word. Buddhi might be the highest attainment in the BhG but it is never described as such in Buddhist sources.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, you fail to seem to understand that this article is about <b>Buddha being seen as the Mahapurusha or Vishnu avatar</b>. Not your personal views on Buddha.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not about my personal views on the Buddha: I follow and quote recognized scholarly sources -- which seem be in short supply here. Yes, I agree that this article is about the Buddha as a Vishnu Avatar, so why is it that so much unrelated material has been smuggled in. Anything, and there is a lot of that as I have indicated, needs to be placed in some other more appropriate article. The attempt to link the Buddha with the Mahā-puruṣa from Buddhist sources is mistaken: <i>mahā-puruṣa</i> has a quite different meaning in Buddhist sources.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 00:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dispute2: you have a dispute with the Krishna section, which is major as it is a description of krishna as the mahapurusha speaking about Buddhi yoga and that the mahapurusha GIVES this yoga to the faithful. Not only that, but it says Buddhi Yoga is the supreme thing that God gives. buddhists say "Buddhahood" is the highest.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But it is a non sequitur to link the two. Buddhahood involves <i>bodhi</i> not <i>buddhi</i>. If you don't understand Sanskrit technical terms as used in different darshanas, you end up making this kind of spurious identification.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 17:16, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It ties in Hindu ideas to Buddhist ones. You can try to improve it if you wish and make it more understandable, but you have to demonstrate that you understand these ideas. Gita talks about Buddhi yoga but does not delineate what exactly Buddhi yoga is. Buddhism is the entire development of "Buddhi" or acquisition of Buddhi, which is Buddhahood or arahanthood in Buddhism and the perfection of pragya, or wisdom. Which, if you have read the Gita, is considered the ultimate goal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hindu ideas are tied here to Buddhist ones in a very unsatisfactory way. Once again, Buddhism is not about <i>buddhi</i> but <i>bodhi</i> -- don't you even understand the difference. And what on earth is <i>pragya</i>&#160;? You don't mean <i>prajñā</i> by any chance -- another indication of your level of scholarship.

<p>Dispute 3: Meaning of "Buddha" is clearly outlined in "<b>Khuddhaka Patha</b>" right in the first chapter, a definition given in a BUDDHIST scripture is a VALID citation as it relates directly to how Buddha himself defined this. Monier Williams? that is only a valid citation absent actual scriptural references.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if the Khuddaka-patha mentions <i>buddhi</i> and <i>abuddhi</i> as you claim, give the line number, a quote or a reference or something. But you won't because you can't. It's not there and thus your argument collapses. As for Monier-Williams: look again carefully and you will see that he gives the source references for his definitions.

<p>oooh, hodge is angry... too much anger clouds little minds:</p>
<p><i>as best expressed in many of his suttas</i>, now what part of "many of his suttas don't you understand?" This verse is not unique but repeated in a similar fashion in a number of suttas. The correct one is given, the Khuddaka Patha 1:38 is one of the descriptions of what Buddha means, this is further elucidated in the passage which is repeated throughout the suttas of the pali canon.</p>

<dd>For heavens sake, grow up&#160;! Yes, I see I misread the attributed quote as though it were supposed to come from the KhP. If you are interested, your quote is found once with that precise wording, in Majjhima-nikaya 2 (<i>Sabbāsava-sutta</i>), but it's not a verse.

<p>The "expertise" of Hodge is wonderous:</p>
<p>1)hodge: in Buddhism the Purusha idea is not the same as the Vedic one: <b>Anupada Sutta</b></p>
<p>If one could ever say rightly of one that he is the Blessed One’s true son, <b>born of His speech</b>, born of the Dhamma, formed of the&#160;:Dhamma, heir to the Dhamma (not heir to worldly benefit), it is of Sariputta that one could thus rightly declare.</p>
<p>This is the same myth presented in the "Purusha Sukta", brahmins born from the mouth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are jumping to conclusions as usual. The Buddhist term is <i>mukhato jāta</i> and the brahmanical one is <i>mukha-ja</i>. You are, of course, correct as far as the <i>Purusa-sūkta</i> bit and Sariputta may have been a brahmin, but in Buddhism <i>mukhato jāta</i> is used of <b>all</b> outstanding bhikkhus. But you have thrown this in a a red herring: you careful duck the issue -- I was talking about the supposed identification you were making between the Vedic/Vaishnava Mahā-purusa and Buddhist usage of mahā-purusa.</dd>

<p>Buddha as Vishnu:</p>
<p>26. Then he sought for him from a family of unblemished moral excellence a bride possessed of beauty, modesty, and gentle bearing, of wide-spread glory, Yasodharà by name, having a name well worthy of her, a very goddess of good fortune. || 2.26</p>
<p>The Buddha-Carita, or The Life of Buddha by Asvaghosa edited and translated by Edward B. Cowell</p>
<p>Yashodhara, Buddha's wife is "sri" the goddess of good fortune, which is another name for Laxmi, which is Vishnu's wife. I think it's pretty tight now--216.254.121.169 01:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Still jumping to conclusions. Just because Ashvaghosha expresses his praise of Yashodhara in such terms does not prove a formal equation. There's a lot of women around now called Lakshmi, but that doesn't make them goddesses. This is typical of your methodology: you pluck useful-seeming quotes from texts willy-nilly with no regard to context, usage nor -- more importantly -- chronological stratum.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 03:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hope you slept well and are in a better frame of mind. Here are some further thoughts. The puranic idea that the Buddha is one of the avatars of Vishnu which is well attested should be reported in this article together with factual pieces of information which are helpful to the reader. But just because there are parallels betwen some aspects of Buddhism at certain stages of its development and some aspects of Vaishnava (or whatever) concepts does not allow you to link them directly as though they are same thing as you would have it. There is no proof that such is the case -- that is just speculation, no matter how obvious it might seem to you personally. Unless you can quote accepted authorities who come to that conclusion, what you write is classed as "original research" (See: Wikipedia No Original Research guidelines), which is banned in Wikipedia. One must write things which can, in theory at least, be verified by any reader. You are quite prolific in your contributions to this page, but you really should slow down and look carefully through Wiki Guidelines and Policies. Most conflict arises when people do not follow them and try to insert their POVs.

<p>There were several Hindus claiming there is no such thing as heresy in Hinduism. That is false.</p>
<p>The term and classification of Nastik and Astik is quite well known and Buddhism falls under the category of Nastik because it doesn't accept the Vedas as primal or the highest.</p>
<p>Another form of heresy is "outcasteing", or untouchability. This was used as a punishment for those who did not follow Vedic rites.</p>
<p>Similar is the term Melecha.--Green23 17:35, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree on several counts. Firstly, the very ides of systematic heresy is inherently Abrahamic and does not have any equivalent in any Dharmic religion, be it Hinduism, Buddhism, jainism or Sikhism. Secondly, Nastik/Astik are both Hindus. Not accepting the vedas is not "heresy" or anything. many Hindus don;t hold the Vedas in highest esteem. Lastly,Untouchability was inherited, heresy had nothing to do with that. While manuSmriti says that a person can be rendered untouchable that person is not regarded as an apostate or a heretic. He is still regarded as a Hindu, though some Dalits dispute this claim. The claim of heresy implies the claim of canon, and there is no canon in Hinduism. Mlechchas are not heretics, they are gentiles. There is a difference. There have been people labelled as good mlechchas also (like Menander/Milinda, for instance).<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 20:15, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's no connection between the terms Nastik and Astik and heresy. Buddhism was one of the many schools of thought that were not based on the Vedas. Also, the text says "It is unheard of to question the guru or teacher in pre-Buddhist India." Well, all education in India, atleast since the time of the oldest of <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>, was in the form of dialogue or debate. This tradition was continued in Buddhism. Many Upanishads are written in the form of dialogues where the student doubts and the teacher explains. The <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagavadgita.html" title="Bhagavadgita">Bhagavadgita</a> too has that format. "later Hinduism discouraged questioning the nature of Brahma." This one needs sources too.</p>
<p>"In that sense, Buddhism is not a part of Hinduism, but a rligion seceded from Hinduism as it rejects many Hindu beliefs." Most schools of Hinduism too reject tons of what would be called "Hindu beliefs." There's nothing like a universal Hindu belief. gautama Buddha never claimed to start a new religion, nor did he claim to have said anything new. Buddhists believe there had been countless Buddhas before him, and there will be countless after him. Pick up any Buddhist text, and note how many of his teachings end with <i>"esa dhammo sanatano"</i> ("this is the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanatana_dharma.html" title="Sanatana dharma">Sanatana dharma</a>".) <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Watts_8106.html" title="Alan Watts">Alan Watts</a> has time and again, and forcefully asserted that "Buddhism is Hinduism stripped for export." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 21:42, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Surely it makes sense for this article to show a number of clear and logical viewpoints and descriptions (with references where appropriate) regarding Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu (or Buddha as not an avatar of Vishnu in critical response). Does anyone disagree?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my humble opinion what this article should not be, is a <i>comparison between Buddhism &amp; Hinduism</i>, or a comparison between <i>Vishnu and Buddha</i> unless doing so has some relevance on the overall topic? For example according to Puranic scripture Vishnu has a large number of avatars, each different in appearance and role. So we don't have to match components of Buddha's appearance with that of another avatar to 'prove' anything. A lot of the statements I have removed seemed to be based on the conclusion that in order to proove the 'truth' of Buddha (which itself is beyond Wikipedia's scope) some fault has to be proven with the many traditions of Hinduism (again beyond Wikipedia's scope). Surely it is better to avoid such subjective arguments either way. Does anyone disagree?</dd>

<p>Could we have correct transliterations of Sanskrit&#160;? I have corrected a few passages but cannot find all of them. Eg: <i>mohanartham danavanam balarupi pathisthitah</i> | <i>putram tam kalpayamasa mudhabudhir jinah svay</i>am || <i>tatah sammohayamasa jinadyana suramsakan</i> | <i>bhagavan vagbhir ugrabhir ahimsa vacibhir harih</i> || is not in my e-version of the BA Purana. I also think the translation given is wrong but I cannot determine this because of the useless transcription given. A verse reference would also help.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 22:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Stephen, in regards to the recent change of translation. If we go with the current translation, I'm wondering what is the context in terms of Buddha's mission:</p>
<p>"Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga [he] will become the Buddha by name, the son of Anjana, in Bihar, for the purpose of confusing those who hate the devas."</p>
<p>Buddha's purpose was to confuse people who hate the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Deva_%28Hinduism%29_7f78.html" title="Deva (Hinduism)">devas</a>? How does that fit in exactly?</p>
<p>The words where there are disagreements are 'dvisham' - and 'sura'. To translate dvisham as 'hate' seems to me to be too strong - to be envious, or against something or someone does not neccessarily mean you 'hate' them, although obviously the words are similar. See <a href="http://www.vedabase.net/d/dvisam" class="external text" title="http://www.vedabase.net/d/dvisam" rel="nofollow">dvisham</a>. Then, with 'sura' (<a href="http://www.vedabase.net/s/sura" class="external text" title="http://www.vedabase.net/s/sura" rel="nofollow">sura</a>)- you are correct that sura means the devas or 'demigods', but more specifically the devas are split into suras and asuras (demons). The difference between the two groups in the context of the Bhagavata Purana itself is that the sura's worship Vishnu, whereas the asuras flought the authority of Vishnu. So in this verse it is not incorrect to translate this as "in order to confuse those who against the devas", but as the suras are theists (they follow Vishnu, described in the Bhagavatam as the supreme God), in order to understand the greater context of the verse, neither is it incorrect to translate as "for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist". Which, for me, sounds less alien to a reader than the other version, which could be taken as meaning "to confuse those who are against demigod worship". Buddha is described basically as coming with the purpose of confusing the atheists, who are against the worship of God, or Vishnu. That's how I understand it anyway. Apologies for the long message.

<dd>Dear Gouranga, thank you for your message. The problem here is that the translation you have quoted in good faith is very inaccurate and misleading. Either the person who did that translation does not have a good knowledge of Sanskrit or has deliberately mistranslated with some hidden agenda. If you think my translation is wrong, show both translations to a reputable Sanskritist and see what they say. There are also Sanskrit dictionaries available on line of which you might like to avail yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, you should bear in mind that the implied message of this has nothing to do with a Buddhist view of the Buddha. Here Vishnu said to emanate as the Buddha not in order to save the ignorant, but to help damn them. Perhaps the view here is that the typical follower of the Buddha denies primacy to the gods and the existence of God and hence is an "enemy of the gods". What the Vishnu-Buddha is portrayed as doing is like sorting the chaff from the wheat. That is the significance of <i>saṃmoha</i>. It is true that <i>saṃmoha</i> can mean "infatuate" in certain circumstances (viz. one of the five arrows of Kāma), but the normal sense is "bewilderment", "stupefaction" or "confusion". Since "infatuate" is misleading here, it is better to stick with the common, basic meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <i>sura-dviṣām</i>, this should be explained as follows. The <i>asuras</i> are the demons or, as some people prefer, the demigods. The opposite to them are the <i>suras</i> -- indeed, the <i>asuras</i> are actually the enemies of the <i>suras</i> (= devas = gods) and constantly made war on them. It is well-attested since the Vedas that the term <i>sura</i> is just an alternative for <i>deva</i>. There is no way that one can legitimately translated <i>sura</i> as "theist", let alone "faithful theist". However, we then have <i>dviṣām</i> which is genitive plural of <i>dviṣ</i>. As an adjective, this only means "hostile / hating / inimical" and the like; or as a noun it only means "enemy" or similar. There is no way that it can mean "envious" -- <i>dviṣ</i> is derived from the verbal root <i>DVIṢ</i>, which <b>only</b> has the meanings of "to hate, dislike, be hostile towards". So putting the two words together, we get "one hostile to the devas" or, better still, "enemy of the devas". Now this compound is quite old in Sanskrit as it is found in the Ṛg-veda, where it is actually a synonym of <i>asura</i>. So we had really come in a full circle here. Those to whom Vishnu in his Buddha guise brings confusion are none other than the <i>asuras</i> -- the demons. To call them atheists is anachronistic and whether the author thought of Buddhists as demons is open to debate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you say that "for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist" [snip] for me, sounds less alien to a reader than the other version, which could be taken as meaning "to confuse those who are against demigod worship", it might sound less alien to you, but that is not the criterion here. It is a question of supplying the Wiki user with an accurate translation. The translation I offer is quite clear: Vishnu appeared as the Buddha to mislead or confuse the enemies of the gods (ie = the demons or other hostile to the gods).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are some other problems with the translation you quote. For example, <i>kīkateṣu</i> is locative <b>plural</b> of <i>kīkata</i>. I have left it as "Bihar" with some misgivings. The Kīkata are known from Vedic sources onwards as non-Aryan people. Ther is nothing specific here about Bihar or even Gaya, though Bihar was once the home of many non-Aryan people and the Buddha was awakened in Bihar. The Bihar rendering is suspicious because the Buddha was not born in Bihar -- this must have been known even to the author of the SB. And that it does not mean Bihar is also suggested by the use of the plural -- in other words, the Vishnu-Buddha was born among non-Aryans in an unspecified region.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to see a proper Sanskrit transcription of the other long quote, because I think this is also mistranslated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PS: You might like to note that in the Iranian religious tradition, it is the asuras who are the gods and the devas who are the demons -- some ancient tribal rivalry here&#160;!</dd>

<dd>Hello Stephen - I was not saying that the translation you have given is incorrect - infact I agree that as a direct word-for-word translation it is the most accurate. I also don't disagree with including it in the article. However I was trying to explain how the other translation is not incorrect - it is simply given in a larger context. You determine that "Here Vishnu said to emanate as the Buddha not in order to save the ignorant, but to help damn them" whereas the author disagrees, and so do I. Why would Vishnu want to damn people? It is against all the teachings of the Bhagavata Purana. Vishnu is "deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist" by tricking the aetheistic people into worshipping him (Vishnu), as Lord Buddha. It is not given as an act of damnation, but as an act of salvation. In regards to Bihar, the author sees both places as identical: "kikateshu -- in the province of Gaya (Bihar)" .

<dd>Dear Gouranga, thanks for your reply. I am glad to read that you do not consider my translation wrong. I see that you are trying to explain that the other translation might be plausible in a wider context, but unfortunately the wider context actually confirms my position. You seem surprised that Vishnu might want to damn people, so I'll try and explain. First, it should be noted that the Puranas are generally hostile to Buddhism and have created a distorted alternative Buddha. This might be unpalatable to some, but that is the truth of the matter.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now for the background story of this Vishnu-Buddha: as recounted in the Vishnu Purana, from which the later Puranas derive their ideas about the Vishnu-Buddha, the devas and the asuras were again engaged in a long war. Led by Hrāda, the asuras defeated the devas. The devas retreated to the northern shore of the ocean of milk and performed austerities etc to please Vishnu. Vishnu then appeared to the devas who asked him to protect them from the asuras. They also said, "The asuras under the command of Hrāda have stolen away our portion of the sacrifices, but they have not violated the command of Brahmā. [snip] They take pleasure in the duties of their own class, they follow the path of the Vedas and are full of ascetic powers. Therefore we cannot kill them, although they are our enemies, and so you should devise some means by which we will be able to kill the asuras."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Vishnu then acceded to their request and manifested himself as the Buddha, saying "This magic deluder will bewitch all the asuras and they will be excluded from the path of the Vedas, and thus they will be susceptible to slaughter." This Vishnu-Buddha then led the asuras from the path of the Vedas by his teachings. [snip] Thus the Vishnu-Buddha corrupted the asuras so that they abandoned the entire teaching of the Vedas. When he had done this, the asuras were set on the wrong path, and when the battle between the devas and the asuras was resumed, the gods slew the asuras. The armour of their dharma had formerly protected them, but when it was destroyed, they too were destroyed. [See Vishnu-purana 3.17.9-10 and 35-45, 3.18.1-33]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you can see clearly that this is no act of salvation, but a deliberate trick to destroy the formerly virtuous asuras. The verse from the Bhagavata Purana merely summarizes this and in no way contradicts the Vishnu Purana account. The fact that humans also happened to become followers of the Buddha and thereby damn themselves is merely unfortunate collateral damage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When you say, "in regards to Bihar, the author sees both places as identical: "kikateshu -- in the province of Gaya (Bihar)", the author you refer to is not the author of the Purana itself (Shrila Vyasadeva), but the modern commentator -- Swami Prabhupada, I think. This is just his opinion, not corroborated by any lexical works.</dd>

<dd>Hello Stephen, I understand your argument now but cannot agree to it myself. The version of the Vishnu Purana you give above sounds too 'anti-Buddhist' for me (i.e, a sectarian viewpoint from 'Hindu-ists' trying to tear down Buddhism). However, as it is largely irrelevant to the article as it stands at the moment I'll agree to disagree with you on this one.

<dd>Hi Gouranga. When you refer to my "version of the Vishnu Purana", that is what it says actually says, albeit in summary form. And you are, perhaps unintentionally, right: the Puranas are sectarian and hostile with respect to Buddhism. They take away the Buddha from the Buddhists and damn them. Look at all the cited pauranic passages and you will see what I mean. The later upa-puranas change tack and are a little more favourable. I can point you in the direction of modern scholarship on this matter if you want.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 03:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How is my adding Brahman in earliest Buddhism section irrelevant to this article? The point of this article is to describe why Hindus see the Buddha as a Hindu who followed Hindu Dharma. Brahman is God in Hindu Dharma and in the earliest Buddhist texts, writers discuss Brahman. This page is certainly not for <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nastik.html" title="Nastik">Nastik</a> Buddhists, especially if they try to erase Hindu views on Gautama Buddha.-Maleabroad</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Maleabroad, thank you for replying. If the section you are referring to is relevant anywhere, then surely the article <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_and_Hinduism_70b4.html" title="Buddhism and Hinduism">Buddhism and Hinduism</a> would be the best place for it, as it could discuss the different points of view regarding the concept of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>. There would be no point in duplicating it in two articles. If other editors feel that it should not be included in that page because of issues with quality and referencing then surely that is not a valid reason for it to be included here. Maybe it could be re-worked or referenced more clearly?</dd>
<dd>In regards to the second point- I would disagree that this article is about "why Hindus see the Buddha as a Hindu who followed Hindu Dharma", rather I would say it should be about "<b>how</b> the different traditions within Hinduism view the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu", which is a different thing altogether.

<p>But having "Brahman in Earliest Buddhism" gives more of a reason as to why Hindus see the Buddha to be a Hindu observing Hinduism and that the Buddha was indeed a divine avatar.

<dd>Hello Maleabroad, giving reasons <b>why</b> sounds, to me, like primary research - which would against the Wikipedia model (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>) of what an article should be.

<p>Of course this has been researched! Because of these reasons Hindus believe that Buddha is an avatar of Vishnu.

I am newly following this article so probably am not up on prior discussions about this, so I apologize in advance for asking. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 21:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>FYI, we have recently been cleaning up the <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatar</a> page to make it less sectarian and note that there are other deities who have avatars. Some of the edits which I made to this page along those lines were reverted, which is OK, but I notice that there has been another editor who has just objected to the same reversion. I reverted his reversion of the reversion of my edits. (Did I say that right?) I will wait for these reversion to die down before trying to raise the issue again via edits to the article. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 21:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Buddhipriya, there has been an ongoing edit war with this article. Looking back your additions in regards to Ganesha had been added to the <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> version being pushed by <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">User:Maleabroad</a>, who has been indefinitely blocked from Wikipedia. In terms of your original question - Buddha is clearly described as an avatar of Vishnu in the Puranas which is what has given rise to this page. I would not not vote to widen the scope of the article any further unless direct scriptural passages of a similar strength could be found for other dieties.

<p>Under "Views of Buddha in Hinduism" it is said some believe Buddha battled animal sacrifice of corrupt Brahmins. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Early Buddhist literature has little or no interest in the religion of the Brahmanas and was certainly not formed as retaliation against any existing religion. Please refer to any of the several books on Buddhism such as the Rise and Fall of Buddhism. Such misinformation does not deserve a place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>It should also be clearly mentioned that the Buddha is not mentioned as an avatar in several avatar lists of Vishnu. For example, there are two avatar lists in the Mahabharata and only one of them lists the Buddha as an avatar. Some Puranas do not list the Buddha as avatar too and scholars like Hazra et al., have concluded that the Buddha was named as an avatar only after the 5th century AD. The information on the Buddha found in the Bhagavatam is incorrect and was either ignorant writing or just careless writing - a common problem found in Puranas.</p>
<p>Without providing this alternate side, this article is incomplete and gives a false picture that Hinduism in general accepts the Buddha as an avatar unequivocally. Shvushvu 18:44, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
