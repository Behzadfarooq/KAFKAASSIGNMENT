<p>Bud Moore Engineering debuted in 1961, at a qualifying race for the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>. The team won its debut with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Weatherly_0889.html" title="Joe Weatherly">Joe Weatherly</a> driving the #8 <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac.html" title="Pontiac">Pontiac</a>. Weatherly drove for the team for most of the season, and won eight races. Bud Moore Engineering became on the first multi-car teams in NASCAR history, fielding the#18 for five races. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Welborn_5e20.html" title="Bob Welborn">Bob Welborn</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireball_Roberts_0fc3.html" title="Fireball Roberts">Fireball Roberts</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_Owens_924a.html" title="Cotton Owens">Cotton Owens</a>, and Tommy Irwin drove that car.</p>
<p>In 1962, Weatherly returned and had a phenomenal year, winning five races and that year's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_National_28a5.html" title="Grand National">Grand National</a> championship. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pearson_90a8.html" title="David Pearson">David Pearson</a> drove the second car(#08) at <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Motor_Speedway_959a.html" title="Atlanta Motor Speedway">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>, finishing 11th.</p>
<p>1963 saw Weatherly and Moore repeating as champions, despite winning only three races and running just over half of the schedule. Welborn returned to the second car(#06) at <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowe%27s_Motor_Speedway_3581.html" title="Lowe's Motor Speedway">Lowe's Motor Speedway</a>, finishing 29th,</p>
<p>Weatherly was considering retirement going into 1964, and he drove only a couple of races for Moore, until tragedy struck. While racing Moore's #8 <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28automobile%29.html" title="Mercury (automobile)">Mercury</a> at <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverside_International_Raceway_b9b1.html" title="Riverside International Raceway">Riverside International Raceway</a>, Weatherly began setting up for Turn 6 when he lost control and struck the concrete barrier, then slid across the racetrack where his car came to a stop. Weatherly was dead when workers got to his car. He died when his car hit the barrier, as his head slid out the window and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. Moore retired #8 and switched to #1, and hired <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Wade_%28NASCAR%29_edd7.html" title="Billy Wade (NASCAR)">Billy Wade</a>, the 1963 <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_Rookie_of_the_Year_6697.html" title="NASCAR Rookie of the Year">NASCAR Rookie of the Year</a>, to drive. Wade had a strong year, winning four consecutive races and finishing fourth in points. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Johns_63dc.html" title="Bobby Johns">Bobby Johns</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rutherford_924d.html" title="Johnny Rutherford">Johnny Rutherford</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darel_Dieringer_a2ec.html" title="Darel Dieringer">Darel Dieringer</a> also saw time in the car, with Dieringer winning at Augusta Speedway.</p>
<p>Sadly, Wade himself died in a tire test at <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_International_Speedway_1097.html" title="Daytona International Speedway">Daytona International Speedway</a>. Moore retired #1 and fielded the #15 and#16 for Earl Balmer and Dieringer, respectively. Dieringer had another win and a third-place points finish, while Balmer had three top-fives. After that season, Moore cut down to Dieringer's car and ran a limited schedule, with Dieringer nailing down two more victories.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, Dieringer moved on and Moore had a rotation of drivers in his #16, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Allison_43e0.html" title="Bobby Allison">Bobby Allison</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Johncock_9f2c.html" title="Gordon Johncock">Gordon Johncock</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_McQuagg_b54f.html" title="Sam McQuagg">Sam McQuagg</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cale_Yarborough_0927.html" title="Cale Yarborough">Cale Yarborough</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/e/LeeRoy_Yarbrough_6216.html" title="LeeRoy Yarbrough">LeeRoy Yarbrough</a> all drove, most of whom finished in the top-ten one. In 1968, Cale returned for one race, and <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Lund_f05f.html" title="Tiny Lund">Tiny Lund</a> drove for thirteen races, finishing in the top ten seven times. BME only ran one race in 1969, with Don Schissler finishing 36th at the inaugural <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talladega_500.html" title="Talladega 500">Talladega 500</a>.</p>

<p>Bud Moore Engineering took a three-year hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the #15 <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> to a 26th place finish at Riverside. <a href="../../../l/e/e/LeeRoy_Yarbrough_6216.html" title="LeeRoy Yarbrough">LeeRoy Yarbrough</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Brooks_bfa9.html" title="Dick Brooks">Dick Brooks</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Allison_89b9.html" title="Donnie Allison">Donnie Allison</a> also drove that year. In 1973, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Isaac_b56d.html" title="Bobby Isaac">Bobby Isaac</a> climbed on board with Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten finishes until the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talladega_500.html" title="Talladega 500">Talladega 500</a>, when he radioed in to Moore and told him he was quitting. When he got out of the car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrell_Waltrip_f1f8.html" title="Darrell Waltrip">Darrell Waltrip</a>, who had a top-ten at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington_Raceway_66c1.html" title="Darlington Raceway">Darlington Raceway</a>.</p>
<p>In 1974, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Follmer_0944.html" title="George Follmer">George Follmer</a> drove the car with <a href="../../../r/2E/c/R.C._Cola_d40c.html" title="R.C. Cola">R.C. Cola</a> as sponsor, but was released after Riverside, and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Baker_a5f4.html" title="Buddy Baker">Buddy Baker</a> drove for the rest of the year, and won two poles. Baker stayed on for 1975, and won four races and finished 15th in the championship standings. Baker won one race in 1976 and finished seventh in the points, but did not visit victory lane in 1977. He left at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Baker's replacement was <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Allison_43e0.html" title="Bobby Allison">Bobby Allison</a>. Allison won five races each over the next two seasons, including the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>, and finished second and third in the points, respectively.

<p>After Allison won four races in 1980 and finished sixth in points, Allison left for other opportunities. He was replaced by <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Parsons_9457.html" title="Benny Parsons">Benny Parsons</a>, who won three races and finished tenth in points. He too, decided to move on after that season. Moore hit paydirt in 1982 by hiring a hotshoe young superstar named <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt_2015.html" title="Dale Earnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> and signed <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wrangler_Jeans_435c.html" title="Wrangler Jeans">Wrangler Jeans</a> as primary sponsor. Earnhardt had one win in his first year, and finished 12th in points. After only improving slightly the next year, Earnhardt departed for <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Childress_Racing_54fa.html" title="Richard Childress Racing">Richard Childress Racing</a>, and was replaced by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Rudd_4dff.html" title="Ricky Rudd">Ricky Rudd</a>. After a demoralizing start that resulted in Rudd flipping over several times in a crash in the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Shootout_ce66.html" title="Bud Shootout">Bud Shootout</a>, Rudd won at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_International_Raceway_29e1.html" title="Richmond International Raceway">Richmond</a> and finished seventh in points. Armed with new sponsor <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcraft.html" title="Motorcraft">Motorcraft</a>, Rudd won five more races from 1985-1987, and had a best finish of fifth.</p>
<p>After 1987, Rudd departed for <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Racing_3c50.html" title="King Racing">King Racing</a>, and a new young driver named <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Bodine_cf72.html" title="Brett Bodine">Brett Bodine</a> to drive the car. Compared to the teams' previous success, Bodine's performance was disappointing, and he left, ironically enough, to replace Rudd at King.</p>

<p>In 1990, Moore chose <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_Shepherd_7f43.html" title="Morgan Shepherd">Morgan Shepherd</a> to be his new driver, Shepherd had a strong year, winning the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Journal_500_97df.html" title="Atlanta Journal 500">Atlanta Journal 500</a> and finishing a career-best fifth in points. When Shepherd dropped seven points in the standings in 1991, he left for <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Brothers_Racing_e57a.html" title="Wood Brothers Racing">Wood Brothers Racing</a>, and Moore selected <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Bodine_c003.html" title="Geoff Bodine">Geoff Bodine</a>, older brother of Moore's former driver Brett, to be his new pilot. Despite two wins and eleven top-ten finishes, Bodine finished just 16th in points. Bodine had another win with Moore in 1993, but he left in the final part of the season to start his own team after purchasing the assets of the late <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Kulwicki_6b17.html" title="Alan Kulwicki">Alan Kulwicki</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Speed_3196.html" title="Lake Speed">Lake Speed</a> took over for him, and his best finish was an 11th at the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mello_Yello_500_a238.html" title="Mello Yello 500">Mello Yello 500</a>.</p>
<p>Speed returned in 1994, this time with <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> as the sponsor. He had four top five finishes and an eleventh place finish in points. At the end of the year, Speed departed for <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melling_Racing_c3b5.html" title="Melling Racing">Melling Racing</a>, and popular veteran <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Trickle_8458.html" title="Dick Trickle">Dick Trickle</a> took over.

<p>After the disappointment of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_NASCAR_ae3d.html" title="1996 in NASCAR">1996</a>, Bud Moore Engineering did not make a race in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_NASCAR_83c1.html" title="1997 in NASCAR">1997</a>, when an attempt to make the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a> with <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Pearson_4bf9.html" title="Larry Pearson">Larry Pearson</a> failed. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_NASCAR_12ae.html" title="1998 in NASCAR">1998</a>, Moore began developing three-time <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Racing_Club_of_America_85c1.html" title="Auto Racing Club of America">ARCA</a> champion <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Steele_083e.html" title="Tim Steele">Tim Steele</a> for a run at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Cup_02df.html" title="Winston Cup">Winston Cup</a>. Steele had been recovering from injuries, and with the help of his father and sponsor Rescue Engine Formula, Steele would seek Rookie of the Year honors in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_NASCAR_5d8b.html" title="1999 in NASCAR">1999</a>. Soon though, the deal fell apart. <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loy_Allen_Jr._d46c.html" title="Loy Allen Jr.">Loy Allen Jr.</a> attempted the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brickyard_400.html" title="Brickyard 400">Brickyard 400</a>, but failed to qualify. The team did start two races with <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Musgrave_d8ca.html" title="Ted Musgrave">Ted Musgrave</a>, both races resulting in DNF's.</p>
<p>After a failed attempt with <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Green_%28NASCAR%29_c87c.html" title="Jeff Green (NASCAR)">Jeff Green</a> to qualify for the 1999 <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>, Moore was approached by a California family, Robert, Sue, and Randy Fenley, who were operating a successful NASCAR West Coast team and wanted to expand into Cup. Moore sold the operation to them but remained onboard as a consultant. They attempted their first race at that year's <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brickyard_400.html" title="Brickyard 400">Brickyard 400</a> as the #62 with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Daddy%27s_BBQ_Sauce_74b4.html" title="Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce">Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce</a> as sponsor. Jeff Davis and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Hooper_e534.html" title="Lance Hooper">Lance Hooper</a> shared the driving duties, but they did not qualify for the race. Nevertheless, the team began preparing for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_NASCAR_e59d.html" title="2000 in NASCAR">2000</a>. Late in the year, the team announced they would hire <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derrike_Cope_b4c7.html" title="Derrike Cope">Derrike Cope</a> would drive the #15 until the end of 2001. Although no sponsor was named, the team assured Cope that there was enough financial stability for him to run for the entirety of his contract. Cope qualified at <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowe%27s_Motor_Speedway_3581.html" title="Lowe's Motor Speedway">Lowe's Motor Speedway</a> for the team in 1999, finishing 35th. Things looked promising for 2000, as Cope had a strong Speedweeks. However, the team soon started to skip races because of financial difficulties. Things went from bad to worse as Moore left the team. Soon afterwards, Cope quit the team in disgust because he felt that he was lied to when he was told the organization was financially secure. Ted Musgrave at Talladega and finished 35th. After that the team, dissapered as it moved to North Carolina. It changed its number to 16 and was hoping to run the ARCA series until they could afford NASCAR again. That never came to be, and the team soon shut down and sold its equipment.</p>
