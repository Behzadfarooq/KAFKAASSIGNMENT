<p>but how did u find out the national composition for each city and rayion? i couldnt find it on that census page.</p>
<p>Look more carefully. Just scroll down, and you'll find the nationala composition for each city and rayon. --Danutz 17:47, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are right. My bad. But if you calculate the percentile of the Romanian population in Reni, you see that 19.900/39.900=49.9% = 50% not 49% like the census claims.</p>
<p>sorry again my bad its 19.900/40700 not 39900. I was looking at another raion.</p>

<dd>In Russian/Ukrainian it's "район", which has more than one transliteration.

<p>This page needs renaming to <b>"Budjak"</b>, the English form of Bugeac. This English form is frequently used in historical and scholarly literature whereas the Romanian form rarely appears. Furthermore, since this territory is now Ukrainian, it is questionable whether the Romanian form is the most appropriate if a foreign language version is used.</p>

<li>I don't think "Budjak" is in particularly common use. FWIW, there is also "Budzhak". This is one of those cases where several spellings seem to me to be equally common. All should be mentioned, but I don't see a strong case for moving the article to one of them more than another. You say "used in historical and scholarly literature". Can you give some examples? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:23, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm not wedded to either <b>"Budjak"</b> or <b>"Budzhak"</b> but <b>"Bugeac"</b> is the "least good."</p>
<p>Budjak is a rarely-mentioned place in English, so it is hard to obtain a very large sample but below is a list of citations taken from Lexis Nexis, JSTOR, and a personal library visit among others. After culling irrelevant citations (Budjak, Budzhak, and Bujak are all surnames and there is an archeologial site called Keui Budjak) the following remain. As you can see, "Budjak" predominates but some of "Budzhak"'s cites carry more "weight" (e.g., historical atlas, gazetteer). Arguments could be made for either of the above but "Bugeac" only appears once (and once as "Bugeacul").</p>

<p>This seems to leave us pretty much where we were. None of these are clearly predominant. It's pretty artbitrary where we put the article. All should be mentioned, all should be at least redirects.

<p>Checking the same <a href="http://books.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/" rel="nofollow">google books</a> link and typing in the three main spellings, I got results of:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 pages on <b>bugeac</b></li>
<li>41 pages on <b>budjak</b></li>
<li>25 pages on <b>budzhak</b></li>
</ul>
<p>An important qualifier of these results is that the "Bugeac" form returned Romanian-language books which should not have bearing on the English Wikipedia form. Of course all forms should be mentioned and redirected to the same page just as "<a href="../../../m/%C3%BC/n/M%C3%BCnchen.html" title="München">München</a>" redirects to "<a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>" or "<a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucure%C5%9Fti.html" title="Bucureşti">Bucureşti</a>" to "<a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucharest.html" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>" but the above numbers do little to recommend the Romanian "Bugeac" over the Slavic/exonymic "Budzhak" or exonymic "Budjak" forms for the entry name.</p>
<p>The case for the <b>"Budjak"</b> form is as follows. The region is a multiethnic one with a recent history of political control by several countries and the significant presence of other minorities as well (e.g. Bulgarians, Gagauzes). Use of an <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exonym.html" title="Exonym">exonym</a> that is different from all of the local forms helps maintain a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> (see <a href="../../../l/i/a/Talk%7ELiancourt_Rocks_5c23.html#Place_page_name_under_Liancourt_Rocks" title="Talk:Liancourt Rocks">Talk:Liancourt Rocks</a>). This form is the also the most intuitive to pronounce for an English speaker. Neighboring regions such as <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobruja.html" title="Dobruja">Dobruja</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallachia.html" title="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" title="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a> use exonyms and the German and Dutch entries for this region use their own exonyms (<a href="../../../../de/b/u/d/Budschak.html" class="extiw" title="de:Budschak">Budschak</a> and <a href="../../../../nl/b/o/e/Boedzjak.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Boedzjak">Boedjak</a>, respectively). (The French also use "Budjak" but there is no Wikipedia entry for it.)</p>
<p>The case for <b>"Budzhak"</b> is that a majority of the regions inhabitants use this Cyrillic version of this form (Ukrainians, Bulgarians, and Russians) and that it is the form of the current official language (Ukrainian). It is also reasonably intuitive to pronounce.</p>
<p>The <b>"Bugeac"</b> form is not that of a majority of inhabitants or of the official language and is not as intuitive to pronounce for someone unfamiliar with Romanian orthography (and might come out as "Boogie-ack"). It also differs from the other two forms more than the others do from each other.</p>
<p>In addition to the above cases, "Budjak" seems to have a clear plurality of citations followed by "Budzhak" and "Bugeac." Taken together, the case for the exonymic form "Budjak" seems stronger than that for either the Slavic/exonymic or Romanian forms.</p>

Anonimu după cum ţi-am mai scris şi pe pagina ta, the map is good for the purpose of having some kind of an idea of what we are working with here and I think you go down in history to be the first person to upload a detailed map of the ethnic composition of the region.</p>
<p>However, according to the Ukrainian census of 2001 and the Soviet census of 1989 the map is not correct all over the place. For example it shows a Moldovan/Romanian pocket in the south of Cetatea Alba. But there are almost no Romanians there. It also shows another Moldovan pocket in Cetatea Alba/Bilhorod Dnistrovsky raion, suggesting a Romanian village there but according to the census there are none. There is supposed to be a village right to the left of Sarata that is exclusively Romanian but on the map it is shown as Ukrainian. In between Ismail and Kilia, right on the southern shore of that lake that looks like an electric quitar( or the first lake out of the two lakes in between ismail and kilia), well over there there is a village Chishlitza, which is supposed to be exclusively Romanian. Also in Reni raion, all the rural areas in the south are supposed to appear as Romanian(not Ukrainian) except the area around the city itself which the map correctly points out that it is of mixed ethnic composition. This map is what I have come up with according to the latest census:</p>

<p>Given that <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Bessarabia_c010.html" title="Ottoman Bessarabia">Ottoman Bessarabia</a> redirects here, I would think that we need something in the article to the effect of "This area is sometimes referred to in historical contexts as as <b>Ottoman Bessarabia</b>, and the use of the name <i>Bessarabia</i> to refer to this territory predates the more modern use of that name." Am I correct in this understanding of that?</p>
<p>Also, the following sentence is confusing: "Although the area remains separated from the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Republic of Moldova</a> that occupies the remainder of Bessarabia, the term is rarely used, replaced normally with <b>Southern Bessarabia</b>." In its current context, it is very hard to tell what this means by "the term". Does it mean <i>Budjak</i> itself? It seems to me that (in its various forms) that name is reasonably common; does someone have evidence that <i>Southern Bessarabia</i> is more common? And if it is more common, then why is the article at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budjak.html" title="Budjak">Budjak</a> rather than <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Bessarabia_2955.html" title="Southern Bessarabia">Southern Bessarabia</a>? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When researching the various spellings of Budjak for <a href="../../../b/u/d/Talk%7EBudjak_d6f6.html#Rename_this_page" title="Talk:Budjak">Talk:Budjak#Rename_this_page</a>, I found that in English-language sources, especially those dealing with wider subject areas (e.g., Romania, Ukraine), the term Southern Bessarabia was used when the area was mentioned in passing, particularly when referring to WWII territorial changes. However, the nature of these mentions was descriptive and does not reflect on studies more focused on the subject. (A crude comaprison would be the encyclodedic "<a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>" vs. the more common "<a href="../../../f/a/r/Fart.html" title="Fart">fart</a>.") The article should retain the title of Budjak because that name properly situates the topic in both time and space (cf. <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>/<a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>/<a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>). <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSmack_7ea4.html" title="User:AjaxSmack">AjaxSmack</a> 02:26, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in the 9th century Budjak was under magyar domination (it was the westernmost part of <a href="../../../e/t/e/Etelkoz.html" title="Etelkoz">etelkoz</a>). afterwards it was under kievan rule at least in the second part of the 10th century (<a href="../../../s/v/y/Svyatoslav.html" title="Svyatoslav">svyatoslav</a> moved his capital on the danube, and budjak is the linking territory between the centre of kievan rus' and the danube region), and probably in the first part of the 11th century too. Then it was a kind of no mans land, with pecheneg and later cumans roaming this land . From the 13th century to ca. 1369 it was under tatar rule. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 23:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are all of the census numbers 2001? Because the paragraph that begins "According to the the Ukrainian census, Budjak has a population of 617,200 people," goes through two more sentences before it says "The official data of the According to the the shows…" If the data in the first two sentences comes from that same census, then the paragraph should begin, "According to the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Census_%282001%29_8d3a.html" title="Ukrainian Census (2001)">2001 Ukrainian Census</a>…" If not, it should be clear what census it is referring to.</p>
<p>Also, why do we have approximate numbers for several ethnicities followed by a precise number for Romanians/Moldavians?</p>

<p>Spelling of different geographic names varied substancially through time, even in sourses such as British Encyclopedia. For example the term <i>Moldova</i> was never used in English before 1991, and has acquired preference in 1993 when BBC announced it would use it to distinguish from <i>Moldavia</i>, historical region of Romania. Again, this is just one of thousand of examples. Recent trends that are relevant to this article:</p>
<p><i>Romania</i> in lieu of <i>Rumania</i></p>
<p><i>Bassarabia</i> in lieu of <i>Bessarabia</i></p>
<p><i>Dnister</i> in lieu of <i>Dniestr</i></p>
<p><i>Bender</i> in lieu of <i>Bendery</i>, which is an obsolete name, since officially it is now <i>Tighina</i></p>
<p>This does not mean that the old terms are incorrect. It simply means that within 10-20 years they would no longer be in use. (<i>Rumania</i> in no longer used, except in old books, but it is not a formally incorrect form. It is incorrect in Romanian, not in English. It is <i>old</i> in English.)</p>
<p>The reasons usually given for a particular choice are, but not limmited to, 1) closeness to the name in the local official language (respecting the existing borders, even when the origin of the name is completely different), and 2) read in English it is minimally distorted. Therefore in the example above one prefers <i>Bassarabia</i> instead of <i>Bessarabia</i> (Russian, not Romanian) and instead of <i>Basarabia</i> (one <i>s</i> would become <i>z</i>, and the term is sufficiently often used to produce confusion). For <i>Dnister</i> 1) does not apply, since its an international river (passes through more than one country), so 2) is preferred, since <i>Dniestr</i> is Russian, and conflicts both with 1) and 2). <i>Dniester</i> conflicts with 1) (is neither Ukrainian, nor Romanian, nor Russian), and 2) (that's not the way it's pronounced in English). <i>Tighina</i> / <i>Bender</i> much less often used in English than the other 3 terms, so an English-speaker would not "know the way the name sounds in English". Therefore <i>Tighina</i> could not generate <i>Taigaina</i> when pronounced .</p>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly, you are spreading the issue. I suggest simply to mention both of them, not to forget completely about one of them. It is the minimum to ask.-Dc76</dd>
<dd>There is no prefered theory about ethnicity. All academia around the world agree that Romanians and Moldavians are the same ethnic group. This is not a subject for discussion, it is a known fact, like the fact that Russians and Ukrainians are Slavs. Its relevance to the article at hand is to mension both the number of declared M and R simultaneously. If you are not ethn0logist, a sociolog, etc, or a non-specialist but a member of the community in question, you should refrain from talking about things you don't know. I don't mean to critisize, consider it a cold request. Everyone should mind his/her own business.-Dc76
<dl>
<dd>Two things, what matters is people's self-perception. If people thought of themselves as Romanians that would have said so in the census. They self-identified as Moldovans. Second, census data has to be presented as it is presented by census. Not processed through adding categories as we like. This is not the issue for the ethnologists to decide whether the Ukrainian Moldovans are Romanians. They were asked who they are. They gave their answers freely with no coersion.

<p>4a) Table again creates an etnicity named "Moldovans (Romanians)" while in Ukrainian census on which the table is bases such etnicity is called Moldovans.

<dd>The table does not create any ethnicity. A table can only reflect some data. The table clearly states that it is the sum of M + R. The difference is insignificant, about 1%.

<dd>Being official, one should apply in order to change it. Consequently, people who were forcibly registered during the Soviet era (sometimes as much as 60 years ago!) are "Moldovans" officially, although they consider themselves "Romanians" and consider the language they speak "Romanian". They consider themselves "Moldovans", too, since to them that means a regional, not ethnical designation. In the census, people were asked to declare their "official ethnicity", hence only very few were registered R. -Dc76</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See above about "official etnicity". No such thing exists in Ukraine. Moreover, the "etnicity" question in the census is a write-in one. Respondents do not pick from pre-offered choices (such as Moldovans, Romanians, Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, etc.) but answer as they like. I've seen the census questionary somewhere online.

<p>-either restore the table as it was, or add immediately after it the observation about Romanians and Moldavians.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree to add the info about 724 people but no speculations about who <i>thinks</i> what. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a>
<dl>
<dd>Even the article above shows that these two groops form a single community.</dd>
<dd>It is a newspaper report about a meeting between the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, and his Ukrainian counterpart Boris Tarasiuk in Odessa, at which were present representatives of the Romanian (! this is the word used by the two foreign ministers) community in the Odessa oblast. The main concerns are about education in the Romanian language (again the term is used). They point out that there are only 9 elementary+secondary schools in romanian, 9 elementary+secondary mixed (two or more languages), and only one high school. They talk about opening teaching in romanian at Odessa and Ismail universities, about issues of church subordination (mitropolitanate of Bessarabia vs Patriarchy of Moscow), also aboutsome romanian (by language, they are locals as people) priests have been agressed by criminals and the authorities did not take proper action.</dd>
<dd>As you can see the foreign minister of Ukraine does not have any issues about Romanians/Moldavians, he considers it appropriate to regard them as one community, not as two, and use the term Romanian language. He addresses the issues concerned frankly and openly, and does not have adversity based on national identity. Whether most of these promisses ever materialize in practice, that's a different issue, that depends on many more local bosses, who are driven by national intolerance.</dd>
<dd>The origin of the issue is that people consider themselves simultaneously Moldavian and Romanian. They speak Romanian language, and therefore consider it's proper to say "I'm Romanian". They belong to the historical region Moldavia (refering to the Principality of Moldavia), so they consider equally correct "I'm Moldavian". Moldavians (Romanians) do not see a contradiction in this. It is when the word ethnicity is used by other people, that there can be a misunderstanding. Romanian means the language, Moldavian means the region. What does ethnic means? We might be better off if we point out as in other countries the mother tongue rather than the "ethnicity". The concept of "ethnicity" as is understood in Ukraine is from old Soviet time, and had a purpose: <i>erase all nationalities, ethnicities, languages, build the Soviet man</i>. Fortunately there are many sane people in Ukraine, and the number of those who are stubborn in this Soviet-induced belief is slowly but surely decreasing. Moldavians(Romanians) from Ukraine would like to be able to declare themselves as both M and R, they don't see a contradiction. Ask proper question: language, citizenship, and you will receive strict answer. Ask vague question, and you result in...</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, you did not make anything I would object to, except the issue with the table, and the usage "Moldavians (Romanians)" instead of just "Moldavains"</dd>
<dd>Ok, I'll make the modifications tonight or tomorrow night. I'll do my best to be neutral(Sorry i am more busy in real life). If you do modifications, please, also try to be neutral when talking about issues you don't know very much but have a predetermined point of view. I don't mean to blame you, it's just a recommendation. It's better to let people who know to do it, and point out to each sentance that does not sound ok. For example, it is widely believed among Romanians that Hutsul are Slavicized Romanians. But educated people regard this as an oppinion only, since there are only two things that can convince: 1) an explanation by a Hutsul, who studdied his/her group (I want to avoid the word ethnicity) 2) genetic studies, which are very hard to make and are pointless, because it counts what Hutsul people believe themselves.</dd>
