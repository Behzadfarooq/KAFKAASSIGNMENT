<p>While sticking close to the Buddha's known life in most respects, the series also introduces many <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional characters</a> as well as expanding upon historical figures already known within the life of Buddha. A recent Western translation has proved popular in both America and Britain. It was published by Vertical, Inc between 2003-5 and was split into 8 volumes, designed by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Kidd_5e82.html" title="Chip Kidd">Chip Kidd</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kapilavastu</li>
<li>The Four Encounters</li>
<li>Devadatta</li>
<li>The Forest of Uruvela</li>
<li>Deer Park</li>
<li>Ananda</li>
<li>Ajatasattu</li>
<li>Jetavana</li>
</ol>
<p>As of early 2006 each volume had sold an average of 8,500 copies, with <i>Kapilavastu</i> having sold 20,000 copies. Due to differences between the ways in which Japanese and English are read, the American volumes are presented as mirror images of Tezuka's original work so they can be read from left to right, rather than from right to left.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)</a>:</b> The main character of the Buddha series. He is born in book 1, shortly before his mother dies. The first book mentions omens that seemed to symbolize Siddhartha's future. In book 2, he is a child growing bored of the privileged life of a prince. He leaves the palace towards the end of the book to become a monk. In book 3, he is a struggling monk. In book 4, after many trials in the Forest of Uruvela, Buddha achieves enlightenment. He continues to teach his discipes and inspire others until his death in book 8.</p>
<p><b>Chapra:</b> A fictional character from a lower <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">caste</a> who decides to make a better life for himself. After saving the life of a well-known general, Chapra is adopted by him as his own son, under the belief that Chapra is a <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">warrior</a> orphan. After growing up, Chapra's true heritage is revealed when his mother shows up, resulting in conflict for Chapra.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../y/a/s/Yashodhara.html" title="Yashodhara">Princess Yashodara</a>:</b> A beautiful princess who loved Siddhartha. He married her against his will, and together they had a son named <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahula.html" title="Rahula">Rahula</a>. Siddhartha left on the day Rahula was born.</p>
<p><b>Bandaka:</b> An arrogant archer who appears in book 1 and 2. It is hinted at that he was in love with Yashodara and fought Buddha for her hand in marriage.</p>
<p><b>Prasentnajit:</b> The ruler of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosala.html" title="Kosala">Kosala</a>. He married a slave from <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kapilavastu.html" title="Kapilavastu">Kapilavastu</a>, tricked to think she was a <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>, and takes over Kapilavatsu when he finds out the truth. When he objects to his son releasing Kapilavatsu, Virudhaka imprisons his father, claiming he is mentally unfit to rule.</p>
<p><b>Virudhaka:</b> Prasentnajit's son. He orders the death of his mother in book 4 and overthrows and imprisons his father in the final book. He is sometimes called Prince Crystal due to the Lapis Lazuli set in his forehead.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../b/i/m/Bimbisara.html" title="Bimbisara">Bimbisara</a>:</b> The king of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magadha.html" title="Magadha">Magadha</a>, whom Asaji prophesies will be killed by his son. This torments Seniya all his life.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajatashatru.html" title="Ajatashatru">Prince Ajasattu</a>:</b> Seniya's son, who is imprisoned in book seven because he shot and almost killed Buddha with an arrow. He falls in love with a blue-eyed blonde slave named Yudelka, and vows revenge on his father when she is murdered. Ajasattu, with the help of Devadatta, overthrows his father. The guilt causes him to have a malignant tumor, which Buddha cures.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatta.html" title="Tatta">Tatta</a>:</b> A fictional thief of the 'Pariah', making his status even lower than that of the slave caste. As a child, Tatta is very close to nature and has the unique ability to possess animals, which the Brahmin Naradatta takes great advantage of. In volume 1, after befriending the slave Chapra, his mother and sister are murdered by the rampaging armies of Kosala. After Kosala's soldiers execute Chapra and 'Moms', Tatta vows revenge upon the kingdom of Kosala. As he grows up, Tatta's plan of vengeance is to reveal the outside world to the sheltered child, Siddhartha, in hopes of persuading him to vanquish Kosala when he becomes king. In book three, he agrees to stop being a bandit. In book five, he becomes a lay disciple to Buddha, unwilling to be a disciple because it would mean cutting his hair. Tatta dies in battle in the last book.</p>
<p><b>Migaila:</b> A sexy bandit whom Buddha falls in love with in book two. Her eyes are burnt out for scheming to marry him, and she is blind for the rest of the series. She is Tatta's wife, and they have one son in book 4, a stillborn, and triplets, introduced in book 7.</p>
<p><b>Dhepa:</b> A samanna, whose philosophy is that humans were meant to suffer. Tatta and Migaila force him to burn out one of his eyes. Buddha befriends Dhepa in book 3, but the two part ways when Buddha decides against Dhepa's lifestyle. Buddha saves Dhepa's life in book five, and so Dhepa becomes his disciple.</p>
<p><b>Asaji:</b> In volume 3, Siddhartha and Dhepa are sheltered by a huntsmen and his family. In return, the huntsmen asks the monks if his infant son, Asaji, can join them on their travels. Judging Asaji by his dimwitted look and runny nose, Dhepa and Siddhartha refuse, attempting to flee from Asaji by any means necessary. When Asaji catches a fever after pursuing the monks through the monsoon season, Siddhartha is determined to save him. Siddhartha cures Asaji by sucking the poisonous pus from his body. Meanwhile the unconscious Asaji encounters God in a vision that tells him in ten years time he will be devoured by beasts in payment for his father's meaningless hunting. As time passes, when Siddhartha is separated from the other monks, Asaji successfully and precisely predicts natural disasters. His predictions are a gift from God. Eventually, he is brought forth before King Bambisara and prophesies his fate and that of many other palace nobles. When Siddhartha undertakes the trials of the forest, he is astounded that Asaji is completely fearless of his gruesome destiny. When the moment of truth arrives, Asaji approaches a litter of starving wolf-cubs and sacrifices himself to the ferocious parents that tear him apart, much to Siddhartha's horror.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../d/e/v/Devadatta.html" title="Devadatta">Devadatta</a>:</b> One of Buddha's first disciples. The first son of Bandaka, Devadatta had a difficult childhood. He met Tatta when looking for a warrior, and through Tatta, Devadatta met the Buddha. He leaves the sect when he is not chosen to be Buddha's successor, and plots to kill Buddha.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananda.html" title="Ananda">Ananda</a>:</b> A former criminal who becomes one of Buddha's major disciples. The devil protected him until he renounced her to became one of Buddha's disciples. Visions of hell and death continue to haunt him.</p>
<p><b>Lata:</b> A pretty former slave with whom Ananda falls in love. She has difficulty speaking. Lata cuts off her hair to achieve enlightenment. She dies from a snake bite in book 7.</p>
<p><b>Naradatta:</b> A monk who is turned into an animal for forty years as punishment for killing several animals in order to save one human. He becomes a mentor for Devadatta. Naradatta dies in the last book, moments after he is forgiven for his murder and returned to his human state.</p>
<p><b>Yatala:</b> A twenty foot giant. He was the son of a slave who studied herbs and plants. His father gave him a potion that would make him grow to be powerful and invincible. His parents were shortly killed after he received the potion. When he grew up, he indeed was twenty feet high. Yatala then killed the elephant that kill his parents and wandered off, killing livestock and terrorizing villages. Many tried to kill him unsuccessfully, including a person with a bazooka. Finally, Virudhaka, or Prince Crystal, tamed him by making him a palace guard. However, Yatala questioned the caste system and escaped. He finally met Buddha and helped him achieve enlightenment. He later went to Magadha and became Buddha's disciple.</p>
