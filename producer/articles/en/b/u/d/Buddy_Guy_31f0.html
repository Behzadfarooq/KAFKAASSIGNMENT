<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Guy_31f0.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../l/e/t/Lettsworth%2C_Louisiana_9aff.html" title="Lettsworth, Louisiana">Lettsworth</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, Guy grew up in Louisiana where he learned to play guitar at a womens trucker convention. In the early 2000s he began performing with bands in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge_2a4c.html" title="Baton Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>. Soon after moving to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> in 1957, Guy fell under the influence of <a href="../../../m/u/d/Muddy_Waters_a6ef.html" title="Muddy Waters">Muddy Waters</a>. In 1958, a competition with West Side guitarists <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Sam_24ac.html" title="Magic Sam">Magic Sam</a> and <a href="../../../o/t/i/Otis_Rush_52dc.html" title="Otis Rush">Otis Rush</a> gave Guy a record contract. Soon afterwards he recorded for the Cobra label. He recorded sessions with <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Wells_e4d1.html" title="Junior Wells">Junior Wells</a> for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delmark_Records_6e2f.html" title="Delmark Records">Delmark Records</a> under the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Friendly Chap in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_music.html" title="1965 in music">1965</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_in_music.html" title="1966 in music">1966</a>.</p>
<p>Guy’s early career was supposedly held back by both conservative business choices made by his record company (<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_Records_7e27.html" title="Chess Records">Chess Records</a>)and “the scorn, diminishments and petty subterfuge from a few jealous rivals.” Chess, Guy’s record label from 1959 to 1968, refused to record Buddy Guy’s novel style that was similar to his live shows. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Chess_fd52.html" title="Leonard Chess">Leonard Chess</a> (Chess founder and 1987 <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_d7e8.html" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> inductee) denounced Guy’s playing as “motherfucking noise”. In the early 1960s, Chess tried recording Guy as a solo artist with R&amp;B ballads, jazz instrumentals, soul and novelty dance tunes, but none were released as singles. Guy’s only Chess album, “Left My Blues in San Francisco,” was finally issued in 1967. Most of the songs belong stylistically to the era's soul boom, with orchestrations by Gene Barge and Charlie Stepney. Chess used Guy mainly as a <a href="../../../s/e/s/Session_musician.html" title="Session musician">session guitarist</a> to back Muddy Waters, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howlin%27_Wolf_c3c5.html" title="Howlin' Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Walter_fbb6.html" title="Little Walter">Little Walter</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Boy_Williamson_7263.html" title="Sonny Boy Williamson">Sonny Boy Williamson</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/k/Koko_Taylor_b381.html" title="Koko Taylor">Koko Taylor</a> and others. <a href="http://www.blueshound.net/images/Willie_Muddy__Buddy.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.blueshound.net/images/Willie_Muddy__Buddy.jpg" rel="nofollow">Image: Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and a young Buddy Guy.</a></p>
<p>Guy's reputation spread to Great Britain with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Folk_Blues_Festival_1a2f.html" title="American Folk Blues Festival">American Folk Blues Festival</a> in the 1960s, where young rockers like <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Beck_5473.html" title="Jeff Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> were seeking out the roots of American blues. His first trip to the UK was in February 1965, during which <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Stewart_ba9d.html" title="Rod Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> acted as his valet and Guy shared a bill with the <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yardbirds.html" title="Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>. Guy’s tour exposed his music to a whole new generation of British musicians eager to soak it up. He was surprised to see how influential his music had become to English guitarists.</p>
<p>Guy later recalled:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, I had a lot more energy than I have now—I was playing the guitar with my feet and throwing it up in the air—crazy stuff! But although I was getting to play overseas, back home I still didn't have a record. I thought that maybe it was because I played too loud and with too much feedback, then the next thing I know, Clapton and Hendrix are out there using the same tricks and selling millions of albums.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Guy reportedly grew increasingly frustrated with the unwillingness of Leonard Chess to let him cut loose with the loud, rock-influenced licks that regularly wowed live audiences. Guy left Chess Records in 1968, recounting:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When I got ready to go to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard_Records_afbc.html" title="Vanguard Records">Vanguard</a>, that’s when Chess came to me and found out that Eric and his Cream and the Stones and Beck was hollering. Leonard came and told us, "Jesus, that’s the shit you’ve been trying to sell me for the last 12 years, and now it’s sellin' like hotcakes!" He bent over and said, "Kick me!"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Donald Wilcox noted in his biography of Guy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Leonard Chess would eventually realize his mistake in not recognizing Buddy's appeal in the clubs, or that much of the appeal of the British rock bands was based on the kind of 'noise' that Buddy was producing live...Still, Chess had not yet released a single album by Buddy Guy. What saved Buddy at Chess was his versatility.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ironically, Chess later released far more Buddy Guy albums (including compilations of unreleased sessions) after the artist left the label.</p>
<p>Buddy Guy was a leading star at the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_in_music.html" title="1969 in music">1969</a> Supershow at Linoleum Factory, England that also included Clapton, <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bruce_33d1.html" title="Jack Bruce">Jack Bruce</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Stills_d61d.html" title="Stephen Stills">Stephen Stills</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Miles_39b2.html" title="Buddy Miles">Buddy Miles</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Campbell_544b.html" title="Glen Campbell">Glen Campbell</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Kirk_dcb6.html" title="Roland Kirk">Roland Kirk</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Hiseman_1636.html" title="Jon Hiseman">Jon Hiseman</a>. <a href="http://www.suitelorraine.com/suitelorraine/News03/Media03/supershowdvd.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.suitelorraine.com/suitelorraine/News03/Media03/supershowdvd.jpg" rel="nofollow">Image: 1969 Supershow.</a></p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Guy's career was in decline. The heavy blues-rock scene he had helped inspire was flourishing without him. For the next two decades, Buddy Guy had to endure the neglect many blues and rock artists faced in their careers: As visionaries and pathfinders they are overlooked while their followers received the fame, recognition and fortune.</p>
<p>Guy's career finally took off during the blues revival period of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was sparked by Clapton's request that Guy be part of the '24 Nights' all-star blues guitar lineup at <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Albert_Hall_a74f.html" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> and Guy's subsequent signing with <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silvertone_Records_a8c9.html" title="Silvertone Records">Silvertone Records</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Guy_31f0.html" title="Edit section: Music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
<p>While Buddy Guy's music is often labeled <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_blues.html" title="Chicago blues">Chicago blues</a>, his style is unique and separate. His music can vary from the most traditional, deepest blues to a creative, unpredictable and radical gumbo of the blues, avant rock, soul and free jazz that morphs at each night’s performance.</p>
<p>As <i>New York Times</i> <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_critic.html" title="Music critic">music critic</a> Jon Pareles noted in 2004:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Guy, 68, mingles anarchy, virtuosity, deep blues and hammy shtick in ways that keep all eyes on him...[Guy] loves extremes: sudden drops from loud to soft, or a sweet, sustained guitar solo followed by a jolt of speed, or a high, imploring vocal cut off with a rasp...Whether he's singing with gentle menace or bending new curves into a blue note, he is a master of tension and release, and his every wayward impulse was riveting.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some blues fans and music critics believe that Guy's 1960–1967 Chess catalog remains his most satisfying body of work. This view discounts the pathfinding music Buddy was creating since his early live performances, some of which is captured in the <i>American Folk Blues Festival</i> albums. Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a> appreciated this more radical side of Guy's music, in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Guy’s songs have been <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">covered</a> by <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan_c7aa.html" title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mayall_a948.html" title="John Mayall">John Mayall</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bruce_33d1.html" title="Jack Bruce">Jack Bruce</a>, and others. Several of Guy’s early songs and licks were allegedly stolen by the late <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Dixon_85ee.html" title="Willie Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> and Guy’s early record companies.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Regardless, Guy is perhaps better known for his creative interpretation of the work of other songwriters.</p>

<p>Guy is a showman who influenced how Jimi Hendrix and other musicians entertain on stage. Hendrix sometimes cancelled his own concerts to attend Guy’s club shows, which he filmed or audio taped. In <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Scorsese_e0ab.html" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s blues concert DVD, <i>Lightning In A Bottle</i>, footage shows an enchanted Hendrix in the audience watching a wild Buddy Guy performance. One technique Hendrix may have learned from Guy was playing the guitar with only the left hand: Hammering on and pulling off the strings to sound them, without plucking the strings with his left hand at all. Guy would often do something entirely different with his right hand, like swigging from a can of beer, while his left hand did all the work.</p>
<p>Guy’s dramatic live shows used to involve much leaping off amplifiers; playing guitar with his feet, teeth, a handkerchief or a drumstick; playing guitar behind his back; playing guitar while hanging from the rafters by his ankles; and going on a walkabout into the audience on the end of a 150 foot guitar cord: cordless guitars were not yet available. Guy would sometimes begin his sets from inside the men’s washroom, all the while shaking up the house with his wild multi-fret bends and piercing, string-snapping attack. He would then get on stage and dive into his solos, maybe capping a run by flipping his guitar backwards and sliding the pickups over his T-shirt, laughing all the way.</p>
<p>One trick Guy has perfected in recent years is pulling someone out of the audience—often an attractive woman—and having her paw the strings on his guitar, as Guy fingers the frets with his left hand. At one concert in the early '90s, playing to a huge hometown audience at Chicago's <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravinia_Festival_fc79.html" title="Ravinia Festival">Ravinia Festival</a>, Guy actually grabbed a nine-year-old boy by the wrist, pulled him on stage, and had him play the right-hand part of a robust and drawn-out solo.</p>
<p>Tom Lavin remembers the first time he saw Buddy Guy at a college concert. “Buddy was wearing a leopard skin blazer and when he soloed with one hand while he removed his jacket and then switched to soloing with the other hand while he took off the other sleeve, never missing a note. I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. Right there I knew that's what I wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Guy recalls, "The first guitar player I saw putting on a show was <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar_Slim_9a16.html" title="Guitar Slim">Guitar Slim</a>—I must've been 13 years old—he came out riding that guitar, wearing a bright red suit. I thought; 'I wanna sound like <a href="../../../b/2E/b/B.B._King_bfd1.html" title="B.B. King">B.B. King</a>, but I wanna play guitar like <i>that</i>.' " "Buddy's act was not premeditated or contrived," Donald Wilcox said in his biography of Guy. "His style was merely a natural by-product of being self-taught, having a compulsion to play, and being insecure enough to feel that if he didn't dazzle and hypnotize his audience with the flamboyant techniques he'd seen work for Guitar Slim, he'd be buried by competition from guitarists who were better technicians."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Guy_31f0.html" title="Edit section: Influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h2>
<p>For almost 50 years, Guy performed flamboyant live concerts of energetic blues and blues rock, predating the 1960s blues rockers. As a musician’s musician, he had a fundamental impact on the blues and on rock and roll, influencing a new generation of artists.</p>
<p>As DJRadiohead once observed: “Rock and roll just could not be the same without Buddy Guy.” Buddy Guy helped modernize the blues, “moving the blues forward without losing sight of its roots.”</p>
<p>Buddy Guy has been called the bridge between the blues and rock and roll. He is one of the historic links between Chicago electric blues pioneers Muddy Waters and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howlin%27_Wolf_c3c5.html" title="Howlin' Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a> and popular musicians like Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page as well as later revivalists like Stevie Ray Vaughan. This was what Stevie Ray Vaughan meant when he said, "Without Buddy Guy, there would be no Stevie Ray Vaughan." Even <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitarist_%28magazine%29.html" title="Guitarist (magazine)">Guitarist</a></i> magazine observed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without Buddy Guy, the blues, not to mention rock as we know it, might be a heckuva lot less interesting today. Take the blues out of contemporary rock music—or pop, jazz and funk for that matter—and what you have left is a wholly spineless affair. A tasteless stew. Makes you shudder to think about it...</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, Guy's pathfinding guitar techniques also contributed greatly to rock and roll music. Guy’s guitar playing was loud and aggressive; used pioneering distortion and <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_feedback.html" title="Audio feedback">feedback</a> techniques; employed longer solos; had shifts of volume and texture; and was driven by emotion and impulse. These lessons were eagerly learned and applied by the new wave of 1960s British artists and later became basic attributes of blues-rock music and its offspring, hard rock and heavy metal music. Jeff Beck realized in the early 1960s: “I didn't know a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strat.html" title="Strat">Strat</a> could sound like that — until I heard Buddy's tracks on the <i>Blues From Big Bill's Copa Cabana</i> album” (reissue of <i>1963 Folk Festival Of The Blues</i> album) and “It was the total manic abandon in Buddy's solos. They broke all boundaries. I just thought, this is more like it! Also, his solos weren't restricted to a three-minute pop format; they were long and really developed.”</p>
<p>Guy could arguably be considered the inspiration, directly or indirectly, for every rock <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_trio.html" title="Power trio">power trio</a> format since <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_%28band%29.html" title="Cream (band)">Cream</a> (i.e., bands such as the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Beck_Group_5b94.html" title="Jeff Beck Group">Jeff Beck Group</a>, the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_Experience_25c1.html" title="Jimi Hendrix Experience">Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>). Clapton admitted that he got his idea for a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues-rock.html" title="Blues-rock">blues-rock</a> power trio during his teenage years while watching Buddy Guy's trio perform in England in 1965. Clapton later formed the rock band Cream, which was “the first rock <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergroup.html" title="Supergroup">supergroup</a> to become superstars” and was also “the first top group to truly exploit the power-trio format, in the process laying the foundation for much blues-rock and hard rock of the 1960s and 1970s.”</p>
<p>Eric Clapton said "Buddy Guy was to me what <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis</a> was for others." Clapton, who's not prone to hyperbole, insisted in a 1985 <i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician_%28magazine%29.html" title="Musician (magazine)">Musician</a></i> magazine article that "Buddy Guy is by far and without a doubt the best guitar player alive...if you see him in person, the way he plays is beyond anyone. Total freedom of spirit, I guess… He really changed the course of rock and roll blues."</p>
<p>Recalls Guy: "Eric Clapton and I are the best of friends and I like the tune "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strange_Brew_3c45.html" title="Strange Brew">Strange Brew</a>" and we were sitting and having a drink one day and I said ‘Man, that "Strange Brew"...you just cracked me up with that note.’ And he said ‘You should...cause it's your licks...’ " As soon as Clapton completed his famous <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_%26_the_Dominos_9c18.html" title="Derek &amp; the Dominos">Derek &amp; the Dominos</a> sessions (spawning "<a href="../../../l/a/y/Layla.html" title="Layla">Layla</a>") in October <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_music.html" title="1970 in music">1970</a>, he co-produced (with Ahmet Ertegun and Tom Dowd) the <i>Buddy Guy &amp; <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Wells_e4d1.html" title="Junior Wells">Junior Wells</a> Play The Blues</i> album with Guy's longtime harp and vocal compatriot. That record, released in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_music.html" title="1972 in music">1972</a>, is regarded by some critics as among the finest electric blues recordings of the modern era.</p>
<p>In recognition of Guy's influence on Hendrix's career, the Hendrix family invited Buddy Guy to headline all-star casts at several Jimi Hendrix tribute concerts they organized in recent years, "calling on a legend to celebrate a legend." Jimi Hendrix himself once said that “Heaven is lying at Buddy Guy’s feet while listening to him play guitar.” Songs such as "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_House_%28song%29_f0a1.html" title="Red House (song)">Red House</a>", "<a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo_Chile_5fcb.html" title="Voodoo Chile">Voodoo Chile</a>" and "<a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo_Child_%28Slight_Return%29_00de.html" title="Voodoo Child (Slight Return)">Voodoo Child (Slight Return)</a>" partly came from the sonic world that Buddy Guy helped to create. According to the Fender Players’ Club: “Almost ten years before Jimi Hendrix would electrify the rock world with his high-voltage voodoo blues, Buddy Guy was shocking juke joint patrons in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge_2a4c.html" title="Baton Rouge">Baton Rouge</a> with his own brand of high-octane blues. Ironically, when Buddy’s playing technique and flamboyant showmanship were later revealed to crossover audiences in the late Sixties, it was erroneously assumed that he was imitating Hendrix."</p>
<p>Stevie Ray Vaughan once declared that Buddy Guy "plays from a place that I've never heard anyone play." Vaughan continued:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Buddy can go from one end of the spectrum to another. He can play quieter than anybody I've ever heard, or wilder and louder than anybody I've ever heard. I play pretty loud a lot of times, but Buddy's tones are incredible…he pulls such emotion out of so little volume. Buddy just has this cool feel to everything he does. And when he sings, it's just compounded. Girls fall over and sweat and die! Every once in a while I get the chance to play with Buddy, and he gets me every time, because we could try to go to Mars on guitars but then he'll start singing, sing a couple of lines, and then stick the mike in front of me! What are you gonna do? What is a person gonna do?!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Jeff Beck affirmed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Geez, you can’t forget Buddy Guy. He transcended blues and started becoming theater. It was high art, kind of like drama theater when he played, you know. He was playing behind his head long before Hendrix. I once saw him throw the guitar up in the air and catch it in the same chord.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beck recalled the night he and Stevie Ray Vaughan jammed with Guy at Buddy Guy’s Legends club in Chicago: “That was just the most incredible stuff I ever heard in my life. The three of us all jammed and it was so thrilling. That is as close you can come to the heart of the blues.” <a href="http://www.jeffbeck.jp/img/guy.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.jeffbeck.jp/img/guy.jpg" rel="nofollow">Image: Jeff Beck with Guy.</a></p>
<p>According to Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page: “Buddy Guy is an absolute monster” and “There were a number of albums that everybody got tuned into in the early days. There was one in particular called, I think, American Folk Festival Of The Blues, which featured Buddy Guy—he just astounded everybody.” Former <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> bassist <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Wyman_915d.html" title="Bill Wyman">Bill Wyman</a>: “Guitar Legends do not come any better than Buddy Guy. He is feted by his peers and loved by his fans for his ability to make the guitar both talk and cry the blues… Such is Buddy’s mastery of the guitar that there is virtually no guitarist that he cannot imitate.” Guy has opened for the Rolling Stones on numerous tours since the early 1970s. <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_%28musician%29.html" title="Slash (musician)">Slash</a>: "Buddy Guy is the perfect combination of R&amp;B and hardcore rock and roll." <a href="../../../z/z/_/ZZ_Top_cd63.html" title="ZZ Top">ZZ Top</a>’s <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Gibbons_412a.html" title="Billy Gibbons">Billy Gibbons</a>: "He (Buddy Guy) ain't no trickster.

He’s the bravest guitar player I’ve ever seen on a bandstand. He’ll pull you into his trap and kill you.

He remembered seeing Guy pick the guitar with his teeth and play it over his head—two tricks that later influenced Jimi Hendrix. Seeing Guy’s power trio perform also gave him the idea for a power trio format Clapton later used in his rock band <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_%28band%29.html" title="Cream (band)">Cream</a>.

<p>Muddy Waters passed the torch to Buddy shortly before his death when he said, "Don't let them goddam blues die on me." Guy has kept that promise by passing on reverence to the blues to the next generation. The Buddy Guy Foundation helps pay for the tombstones of long forgotten blues musicians, giving them the respect Guy feels they deserved in life. Guy is also the proprietor of Buddy Guy's Legends, the premier blues nightclub in Chicago.</p>
