<p>This is an attempt to be helpful. I'm not a Buddhist and have no axe to grid.</p>
<p>I agree that this article is confusing and badly written. It's full of arcane and, to the non-involved, pointless hair splitting.</p>
<p>It strikes me that what's needed is five separate but linked articles:</p>
<p>1. The main features of modern Buddhism 2. Life story of the Buddha 3. What the Buddha actually taught / said 4. How Buddhism has evolved since his death 5. Discussion of whether Buddhism is a religion or a philosophy; the arguments between different forms of and viewpoints on Buddhism; and whether modern Buddhism is true to the Buddha (this can get as nit-picking as anyone wants).</p>
<p>Attempting to make the article more focused on the meaning of Buddha. Added a disambiguation on the top, and also folded in the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_types_of_Buddha_f313.html" title="Three types of Buddha">Three types of Buddha</a> article.

<dd>Perhaps it would also be useful toction on the roots of Siddhartha's journey in the "forest-renouncer" tradition that gave rise to the Upanisads, which are basically Buddhist ideas with a concept of individual souls and adherence to the authority of the Vedas?

<p>When I get home (I am currently in Hanoi) I intend researching and writing a proper article about the iconography of the Buddha, especially his hand positions (see above), and also the different national traditions of depicting the Buddha. If the article <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddharupa.html" title="Buddharupa">Buddharupa</a> is relevant to that I will incorporate it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a></p>

<ul>
<li>(from the Nikaya view) postpone their own Nirvana in order to assist others on the path, or</li>
<li>(from the Mahayana view) secure Awakening/Nirvana for themselves first and thereafter continue to liberate all other beings from suffering for all time.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunborn_6931.html" title="User:Sunborn">User:Sunborn</a> reverted this. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The Nikaya doctrine of nirvana-without-remainder means that there is no difference (after death) between a sravaka-buddha and a samyaksam-buddha, and most significantly, there is no ability for any type of buddha to benefit others after death. Therefore, as we are currently in the world of Shakyamuni, the only option for students of Shakyamuni is to achieve sravaka-buddhahood, or if one is to be a Bodhisattva, (like Maitreya), to postpone nirvana until one has manifested as a samyaksam-buddha.</p>
<p>Mahayana buddhism has a distinct doctrine (see eg. Lotus sutra) of nirvana-without-remainder, and so therefore there is a distinction between the sravaka-buddhas who are at peace, therefore not <i>initially</i> engaged in benefitting others (after death), and the samyaksam-buddhas who are actively engaged in benefitting others for all time. For the Mahayana it makes no sense to talk about postponing Nirvana, because they do not assert the same doctrine of nirvana-without-remainder as the Nikaya schools.

<dl>
<dd>I must state I know not as much about the bodhisttava of the Mahayana tradition. However, the word in <i>bodhisattva</i> in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a>, last of the Nikaya schools, means only one thing, "Buddha-to-be". It is used only to reference the Shakyamuni Buddha before he became a Buddha. It is important to know that Buddha also has a limited context. "Buddha" means self-enlightened. This means that there can be no Buddha as long as there is a Buddhism. Sometime in the future, Buddhism will not exist. All things are impermanent, after all. When another self-enlightened being will come and share the Dhamma once again. This is the Buddha-to-be, bodhisttava Maitreya. Therefore there can be no other Buddhas or Bodhisttavas anywhere else unless discussing the far future or distant past. --<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunborn_6931.html" title="User:Sunborn"><font color="black">metta</font></a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunborn_ee16.html" title="User talk:Sunborn"><font color="red">The Sunborn</font></a> 19:14, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sunborn, thanks for replying. It appears clear that you are somewhat familiar with the term bodhisattva from within the Theravada - though, your etymology is not very good. My point above concerns the ability of a Buddha after parinirvana - which is identified by the Nikaya as being nirvana-without-remainder. Most importantly, within the Nikaya, a Buddha is not able to directly point the way to nirvana after death. This is a major distinction between Nikaya and the Mahayana, who conversely, state that once a (Samyaksam)Buddha arises, s/he continues to directly, actively point the way to nirvana <b>for all time</b>. I do not disagree with you concerning the status or nature of a SamyaksamBuddha. My position was concerned with what happens after that Buddha 'dies' and enters into Parinirvana. The Nikaya/Mahayana views differ, and this is exactly why the Mahayana do not talk about a bodhisattva postponing nirvana, and exactly why the Nikaya do. I am therefore reinserting the distinction into the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To make myself redundantly clear: Within Nikaya, Maitreya has chosen to postpone his Nirvana in order to introduce the Dharma when it no longer exists. While, within Mahayana schools, Maitreya will also be the next Buddha manifest in this world and introduce the Dharma when it no longer exists, however, he is not postponing his Nirvana to do so. Moreover, Mahayana argues that although it is true that for this world-system, Maitreya is the next Buddha to manifest, there are an infinite number of world-systems, many of which have currently active Buddhas, or Buddhas-to-be manifesting. This latter point is not relavant to the central point of the change in the article, which is primarily that, based on the Nikaya/Mahayana doctrinal distinction of the meaning of nirvana-without-remainder, we see too distinct views concerning the path of the bodhisattva, with the Nikaya stating that Bodhisattvas postpone their own Nirvana, whereas the Mahayana schools (maybe not the FWBO, but they should speak for themselves on this) stating that Bodhisattvas attempt to reach Nirvana as soon as possible, (just like Nikaya Sravakas do), but with the motive to continue to effortlessly benefit all beings for all time (due to the distinction of ability of a Buddha after death).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you are still not clear about what I am talking about, please explain to me your understanding (from the Theravada view) of what abilities an arhat has after death, specifically the ability to benefit others through teaching and showing examples. As I understand it, (and I could be wrong), the Theravada view is that an arhat (including Buddha) <b>after death</b> has no ability to directly benefit sentient beings. This one point is in direct contrast to Mahayana doctrine, which states that a SamyaksamBuddha (such as Lord Sakyamuni Buddha) is able to continue to benefit sentient beings through teaching and showing examples for all time. A consequence of the Mahayana school's views is that they assert that Lord Sakyamuni continues to teach right now. If I am mistaken regarding the Theravada view, please forgive me and explain carefully and with detail the view that is held regarding the abilities of such great beings after death.

Giving quotations in an encyclopaedic article can be very useful and valid, and I think that the inserter of these quotes was potentially doing good work here; but these quotes are way-too numerous and not at all unified or integrated into the main article, and many of the quotes also constitute dubious translations; furthermore, many are not even from or about the Buddha (which is, after all, the subject of this particular entry). There are even alleged quotes "from the Buddha" which I am personally suspicious of (although it may well be that I have simply not yet come across these statements in my own study of the suttas/sutras): for example, "You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection". This sounds pretty un-Buddhist to me. It smacks more of "New Age" syncretism and self-love! But I am open to correction, if I am wrong. It is interesting to note in passing, perhaps, that the common practice of beginning the "Brahma-viharas" (of friendliness, compassion, shared joy, and equanimity) by directing friendliness etc. first of all towards oneself seems not to have its basis in any words from the Buddha (as far as I have been able to ascertain through study of the main suttas/ sutras). But again, I may simply be speaking from a position of ignorance here. Anyway, I do think the quotes should either be reduced to the really relevant ones on the Buddha (or the state of Buddhahood), or else re-directed to other more appropriate areas of "Buddhism" on Wiki, as you suggest.

<p>There is no citation of his mothers name or virgin birth status, yet this person is cited in the virgin birth listing of Wikipedia.

<p>I am not sure where I should write this info so I am putting it here and if you like it, you can cut and paste it to the main article: Before the birth of the Buddha, his mother, Queen Maya, had a dream that an elephant descended from the heavens and melted into her body. Shortly thereafter she became pregnant. Based on this, there was a short-lived legend that the Buddha was born of immaculate conception, from a virgin. The Buddha insisted that he was just a man, not a god or son of god. It is interesting that many religious leaders have this legend attributed to them to help elevate their status.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On top of that, there is another legend that he was born from his mother Maya Devi's right armpit. Which makes Maya a super-virgin, since her genetallia is now virtually untouched. Beat that, Mary.&#160;:P</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most Buddhist do not hold that Buddha was immaculately conceived. Buddha himself would be quite irritated by this notion given that he went to great length to dispell relgious superstition and assert his humanity. There are several stories of him berating students for saying that there was a soul that survived death, etc. (He referred to the student who had given the false teaching on soul as "Oh Stupid One". It would be inappropriate to refer to him as a god as well. This is not really debatable in the Buddhist world - at least among the well educated. DMK</p>

<p>Yes it is about the historical Buddha. This article is not about the definition of a buddha or enlightened one, but is quite clear that it is about Sidhartha Gotama, the historical Buddha. Read the article first before making suggestions.</p>
<p>[I agree that the part on the 32 marks would be best removed. They come from an out-of-the-way attempt in the Digha Nikaya to give the traditional Indian idea of the '32 marks of a superior being' some ethical content, but they really are a bit of an oddity and little referenced either by Buddhists or non-Buddhists. Their appearance so far up the page gives the impression that they are a prominent part of the idea of Buddhahood. In the meantime, I've added a small explananation at the start.</p>

<p>On what basis these people branded Buddha as Hindu? As per the available Buddhist texts Buddha born in Sakya Tribe in Lumbini, Nepal he gat enlightment at Bodhgaya, India. 2500 years back Going back to the sixth century B.C., Northern India did not form a single Sovereign State. There were different Tribes ruling separate small Kingdoms. There was no country as such India. Like today we have hundreds of tribes in Africa Continent. Same thing with Siddhartha Gautama. He born in some tribe known Sakya tribe or Sakya Kula that is the only available information about him Who told you that he was Hindu? If everybody is Hindu then do you call Jesus as Hindu? Paigamber as Hindu? Please remove all refernce that Buddha was Hindu! He was not a Hindu Price these Bhangi-Brahmins so-called Hindus keep branding anybody as Hindu.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Sakya tribe is generally accepted as being of the warrior caste (ksatriya) otherwise, there would have been no reason for Siddhartha to be given the Brahmin clan name Gautama. While Northern India at the time was indeed composed of many distinct kingdoms, the area itself was under Aryan suzerainty, lending greater credence to the view that the Buddha was born into the Hindu religion. I think it wise to remove the dispute. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillbrand_2ff5.html" title="User:Hillbrand">S.N. Hillbrand</a> 15:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>After Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment, hasn't he already renounced his caste and prince-hood, and in fact DENOUNCED the caste system?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a useless discussion. The word Hindu literally means Indian, and that was the only meaning until the first census was done in India in the 18th/19th century, when a need was felt to coin a term for Indic religions. There were hundreds of different schools of thought clubbed together as Hinduism. Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were not included within this term simply because of large number of adherents of these schools of thought. There is no point in discussing whether Buddha was a Hindu, even after his enlightenment. There was no such concept at that time. He never launched a "new religion" either. Of course he spoke against many Vedic practices, but so have hundreds of other "Hindu" sages. Even the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagvad_Gita_1a73.html" title="Bhagvad Gita">Bhagvad Gita</a> speaks at many places of rejecting Vedic rituals. Many Hindu sages have condemned the caste system and even the existence of God. IMHO, all these concepts of defining one relgion as opposed to another comes from a different bunch of religions, and should not be imposed on Eastern religions. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 16:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Originalist distinctions that you make are confusing for the reason that readers unfamiliar with how you define the term Hindu in opposition to its current definition would be unable to correctly parse your usage. I believe the question put by the original poster was whether Shakyamuni was born to a Hindu family and thus raised in the Brahmic orthopraxy. This would indeed be an important question given the Buddha's antinomian proclamations. As to the grouping of religions, this is done primarily on a shared belief and is equally useful in eastern versus western religions. You will always have so</dd>
</dl>
<p>I concur that it is a useless discussion. Anyhow, I disagree that Buddha (Siddhartha) did not launch a new religion. In the same way Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are not bunched up into one name despite their close origins, it is vital to recognize the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism. While it is true that the term "Hindu" literally means "Indian", this is only a regional distinction. Muslims living to the east of the Hindu Kush (Indus Valleys) are referred to as "Hindu" by their Muslim bretheren in the Middle-east. What the person who began this discussion meant "Hindu" as the religion "Hinduism", I believe. I hope this clarifies some of the confusion.</p>

<p>I'm writing a comment about the comment below:</p>
<p>"Eternal Buddha - last paragraph" According to the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, worldly beings fail to see this eternality of the Buddha and his Truth (Dharma). The Buddha comments there: "I say that those who do not know that the Tathagata [Buddha] is eternal are the foremost of the congenitally blind." This view, it should be noted, is foreign to mainstream Theravada Buddhism.</p>
<p>It is not correct to state that the Theravada Buddhism is foreign to the concept of an eternal Buddha. Theravada recognizes that while the Buddha was alive, he was consider a living Buddha whose turn it is to turn the wheel of dharma. When the Buddha achieve pari-nipparn (death), he becomes eternal in Nirvana. All things (in Samsara) are annica (impermanence). Since Nirvana is not in Samsara, Nirvana therefore is eternal.</p>

<p>i have been trying to find information on the fat buddha statue that i commonly see in cultural shops. i've heard it refered to as buddha, but does not at all resemble siddhartha so i assume it is a different person. i hope im not being too vague in my description, and what i have in mind is recognised. i advise that this person's article has a link when "buddha" is searched, if it doesnt already; or correct me if im mistaken. considering my ignorance - edit this at will</p>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that the fat guy is a Chinese god named <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotei.html" title="Hotei">Hotei</a>. The wikipedia article on him provides some speculation as to how his image became associated with Buddhism. Its interesting to note that the misconception that Hotei is the Buddha seems to only exist in Western countries (specifically the United States).<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodhitha_38b7.html" title="User:Bodhitha">Bodhitha</a> 19:22, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does it? My experience is that Chinese people in general are not very clear on the distinction between Hotei and the Buddha. Or rather, they think that Hotei is Maitreya (most Chinese temples have a statue of Maitreya in the guise of Hotei) and they think that Maitreya is a Buddha. They probably are aware that Hotei is not Shakyamuni, though. Incidentally, this article used to mention Hotei.

<dd>This is certainly possible. My anecdotal evidence is that the preception that Gautama Buddha looks like Hotei largely exists in societies without substantial Buddhist populations (especially in western countries). The assignment of the image of Hotei to Maitreya may be the root of this.

Karma, whether positive or negative, is part of the law of cause and effect, and is therefore nothing to do with enlightenment. <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 27 March 2006, 22:11 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>A point of contention raised by many non-Buddhists is the seemingly irresponsible life led by the historic Buddha. The Buddha's teaching that one live free from attachment can be taken to imply that one should neglect all earthly responsibility, including the responsibility to look after the welfare of others. Nowhere is this more dramatically portrayed than in Buddha's relationship to his own family. Buddha's reckless abandonment of his wife and child in order to "seek enlightenment" apart from earthly attachments can be seen as a tacit endorsement of giving up one's responsibilities towards one's family. However, it should not be forgotten that Buddha actually left his family before he was Buddha. In addition, numerous <a href="../../../s/u/t/Suttas.html" title="Suttas">suttas</a> expound, in great detail, the importance of one's duties to family and community.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is written that both Yasodhara(wife) and Rahula(son) became arahats. After expounding dhamma to the first five disciples and some other ascetics in the area, Buddha immediately went towards his former home so he could teach his whole family the Dhamma.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As another point I would like to add that the perception that Prince Siddarthat was irresponsible for abandoning his family is false. Retreating to the woods for a life of piety was a form of retirement in the culture of India approximately 2500 years ago. He did engage this retirement sooner in life than most but as prince he probably knew that his family would be taken care of and his son would be heir. Of course, becoming a diciple of The Buddha meant being able to abandon earthly titles as well as possessions, just as Siddhartha did, to pursue enlightenment.(Antisamsara 05:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>I have to agree that the article is convoluted and difficult to read, especially for folks who are new to Buddhism. So I have made some effort to clean up some of sections I felt were especially confusing. Particularly the "More than one Buddha" section, where I re-wrote the definition of Buddha based on a more neutral and simplistic definition. This definition may be inadequate, so I encourage to review what I wrote and make adjustments.</p>
<p>I cleaned up some of the "Three Types of Buddhas" text to give it a more neutral tone. It definitely leaned a bit much toward a Theravada viewpoint, and also was a bit awkward.</p>
<p>I also cleaned up the section "Eternal Buddha", which awkwardly explained Theravada as opposed to Mahayana. I de-emphasized the differences somewhat, and tried to clarify what Theravada Buddhism is (as opposed to the run-on sentence that was there). Again, this is probably not a great improvement, and I welcome comments or constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Lastly, I suggest that some of the sections be removed outright, or moved to their own pages, as they are overly technical and will likely confuse someone who's curious about Buddhism. In particular, I think these sections should be removed:</p>
<p>1. Teacher of Gods and Men 2. Names of the Buddhas</p>

<dd>Thanks for your work. I agree about removing the "Teacher of Gods and Men" section .. it seems to ramble on toward an unclear purpose.

<dd>Thank you Nat. I assume you added the Buddha image at the beginning too. I like it. &#160;;) Also, I like how the different types of Buddhas were collapsed into the opening paragraphs. I think it's more succinct and to the point that way. Nicely done. (If someone else made these changes, kudos to them). As it stands now, I think the list is fine where it is since the article overall isn't so long anymore. I see your point of keeping it as a reference. The only point of contention I still see in the article might be the Eternal Buddha section. It seems like although I cleaned it up a bit, it still detracts a little from the purpose of the article. If there's a way to trim it down somewhat, I think it will all flow better. Also, perhaps we should make a seperate section to explain the 'Fat Buddha' thing? It seems that part isn't emphasized enough. Thanks! --<a href="../../../p/h/0/User%7EPh0kin_f7bc.html" title="User:Ph0kin">Ph0kin</a> 00:41, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Lastly, I removed some of the recently added text to "Buddha statue" section. I did like the re-arranging of some sections, and have kept that in place.

<p>Now, please correct me if I am wrong - but was the Buddha originally of a Jainist religion. That makes more sense, an ascetic life - and many of the principles and symbolism is the same, ahimsa, swastica. They both originated in Bihar, and yes Jainism was around first. It makes sense, no?!!</p>

<dd>No one really knows for sure. It's reasonable to think that the Buddha might have been a Jain at some point, but there's no specific evidence that points to this. It seems that there were various śramana sects active in northern India at about the same time, among them Jainism and Buddhism; certainly, the Buddha had joined one or more of these during the course of his life. Whether or not this included Jainism is speculative.</dd>

<dd>Also, if you talk about the original or first religion of the Buddha, that was presumably ancient Hinduism rather than a śramana group.

<p>Buddha acually never even met Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, although Mahavira did send a number of his disciples to the Buddha to try to beat him in an argument or discussion. There are significant differences in the fundamental tenets of Jainism when compared to Buddhism. The Jains also always went about naked, while the bhikkhus wore clothing for the sake of decency and a minimum level of protection or comfort. Although Buddha was a samana before (a general term for a wandering monk or ascetic), he wasn't a Jain. His teachers were called Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara, and he doesn't mention any other teachers.--<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 12:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is my belief that a great inconsistency may have been perpetrated concerning the terms Enlightenment and Nirvana. I noticed a few complaints related to this. The definitions of terms such as "Buddha" depend on the correct definitions of these and all terms. The translations of these terms vary. In some cases enlightenment and Nirvana mean the same thing. In some cases though they mean slightly different things. While most buddhist practices accpet that enlightenment is the state of a Buddha, they also believe that a Buddha does not reincarnate for they have escaped Samsara. This would imply Nirvana. In the first paragraph the implication is that they are of the same meaning. I think that the most clarification is needed in the use of these terms. Whereas a great <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llama.html" title="Llama">Llama</a> or Venerable Master may die, their reincarnated form is sought after and sometimes discovered as is the case, as we all know, with the Dalai Llama of Tibet. I am not sure if I must cite any of this, much of it has accumulated in the steel trap that is my head, but I will leave this<a href="http://www.budaedu.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.budaedu.org" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and I am also currently looking at "The Seeker's Glossary of Buddhism"</p>
<p>This definition was taken from said glossary.</p>
<p>Enlightenment: (i)The spiritual condition of a Buddha or Bodhisattva (ii) any being can attain enlightenment and all will one day (iii) The wisdom of The Buddha's enlightenment acquired as the result of cutting off the two hindrances: passions and the illusory conceptions</p>
<p>This could mean, assuming that Nirvana is a state held by only the Buddhas, that a Buddha is in a state of enlightenment "and then some", while a Boddhissatva, who is by definition a being that vows to remain within the snares of Samsara until all beings are enlightened, is also enlightened but only so that they experience spiritual impartiality, as is the case with those who have reached beyond sorrow or joy, but are reincarnated numerous more times. This would imply that enlightenment is a "lesser state" that does not result in release from samsara.</p>
<p>Nirvana: (i) full enlightenment (ii) passing from one mode of existence to another (iii) escape from Samsara with the hope to help all beings through this actless act</p>
<p>This is something that can be copied if anyone wishes, or edited by all. Most of the Buddhist books I have read came to me free of charge from those who wish to push the wheel of Dharma along. The ones that I bought came from similar people though too.</p>

There is already an article about <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> (aka Siddhartha Gautama, aka Shakyamuni, aka "the Buddha"), so it would be redundant to make this article about the qualities of the most recent Buddha. Removing the "more than one Buddha" section would obscure the fact that there are, according to all forms of Buddhism that I'm aware of, more than one Buddha. As for the list of 28 Buddhas, I agree that it's inclusion isn't really crucial here. However, this article is not overlong, so I don't see any real reason to move it to a separate article.

<dd>As for the list, I agree that it's a judgment call whether or not it should be included, and that it doesn't really matter very much either way (I tend to err on the side of consolidating into fewer articles). Regarding the acceptance of the list, it's important to realise that none of the names on the list (other than Siddhartha Gautama) are historical persons from a secular perspective; that is, they are mentioned only in Buddhist scriptures. Consequently, they are not very controversial. I believe this is the sort of thing that is accepted by all the schools of Buddhism. Certainly, the last seven names on the list (the ones that I was able to find Sanskrit equivalents for) are common to Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.</dd>

<dd>The list does suffer a bit from a lack of information which is specific to non-Theravadins. That is, the average Mahayanist is probably more interested in certain Mahayana-specific Buddhas, such as <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amitabha.html" title="Amitabha">Amitabha</a> or <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakushi.html" title="Yakushi">Yakushi</a>, than in the 27 Buddhas immediately prior to Siddhartha.

<p>I contributed the following two paragraphs: The important thing is that the Buddha was perfectly enlightened. His mind was completely at peace - completely free of any form of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair; any form of selfishness or greed or craving or attachment; any form of ill-will, resentment, aversion, hurt feelings, righteous indignation; any form of delusion or ignorance which could lead to doubt and confusion; any form of conceit or any conceiving of a self. His mind was perfectly at peace, abiding in complete knowledge of reality. (Ajahn Jagaro)</p>
<p>If one studies the Buddhist scriptures one will see the Buddha's compassion. He taught the Dhamma to those who wanted to listen, he taught for the sake of their benefit and wellbeing. He wanted to help the listeners and did not want any misfortune to occur to them, no matter who they were. Even shortly before his final passing away he still taught the Dhamma to Subhadda who became the last disciple in the presence of the Buddha himself. This clearly shows his great compassion.

<p>I think the article should present what all Buddhists have in common, removing sectarian concepts and views and instead using the space to present the Qualities of the Buddha. The Eternal Buddha section is sectarian and should be moved to a separate article of its own. If you disagree please speak up.

<li>I think that presenting only what "Buddhists have in common" in their notion of "Buddha" is too limiting for such an encyclopaedia entry. Better to be frank about differences of vision where they exist and report them accurately. Actually, there is nothing "sectarian" about speaking of the important notion of an eternal Buddha in the context of a Mahayana understanding of what "Buddha" denotes and connotes. The eternality of the Buddha is an important idea found in numerous Mahayana sutras and indeed the Tantras. It is one of the ways in which Mahayana differs from Theravada - in its vision of the Buddha. It is a teaching solidly based on Mahayana sutras - not on the interpreted opinion of some sect or other. Sutras come first - sects come afterwards. It is necessary to recognise that what the sutras teach (whether the Pali suttas or the Mahayana sutras) can sensibly receive primacy in any presentation of the doctrines of the Buddha - especially on the nature of the Buddha himself. This has nothing to do with some sectarian bias. It is plain Mahayana fact - pure and simple. It is what is widely taught by Mahayana sutras. Moreover, the article balances this view against its rejection by the Theravada (which could itself be called a highly important, though interpretative "sect" or branch of Buddhism - it is NOT total "Buddhism", from a scholarly point of view). Therefore - this section on a Mahayana understanding of what constitutes "Buddha" should be kept. There is no compelling reason, as far as I can see, for removing it.

<dd>IMHO posting lengthy speculative views about the Buddha being eternal in some invisible realm doesn’t help readers to understand the role of a Buddha as a human teacher and is a waste of valuable space in this encyclopedia article. For a start let’s remove the following quote: “The Buddha comments there: "I say that those who do not know that the Tathagata [Buddha] is eternal are the foremost of the congenitally blind." This view, it should be noted, is typically not found in mainstream <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada_Buddhism_d153.html" title="Theravada Buddhism">Theravada Buddhism</a>.” This is implying that Theravadin Buddhists are congenitally blind which is disrespectful.

<p>Sorry, on actually reading the article, I realize that the above lecture on Wikipedia policies was probably unnecessary. I think the "Eternal Buddha" section is fine with its short but pithy treatment of Mahayana and Theraveda perspectives on the concept of an "Eternal Buddha". I'd leave it as is and move on to more constructive work on other parts of Wikipedia.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not surprisingly, I fully agree with Nat Krause and Richard. We should remember that an encylopaedia is not intended to present only one viewpoint on a particular topic - "our" viewpoint! - , but an array of significant and occasionally clashing viewpoints. But as Nat rightly says, the information and quote regarding the "eternal Buddha" come directly from the alleged words of the Buddha in major Mahayana sutras/Tantras, including the final and influential Mahayana sutra, the <i>Nirvana Sutra</i>. It is odd to say that the purported Buddha is being disrespectful about his own Buddhism!! To dismiss such teaching from the Mahayana Buddha as "speculative" and a "waste of space" is, by contrast, extremely disrespectful to many Mahayana Buddhists and utterly and totally opposed to the ideals of non-partisanship which Wikipedia seeks to uphold. On a personal level, I can fully understand how Dhammapal (as presumably a Theravadin) feels about certain Mahayana teachings, which may seem unacceptable and even "heretical" to Theravada followers. I can understand that 100%. I feel an analogous unease with much Theravada interpretation of the Buddha's teachings. But as editors I really do think that those of us who are Buddhists and those who are simply interested in Buddhism on Wikipedia need to learn, once and for all, that major teachings of the Buddha in the Pali suttas and the Mahayana sutras should not be dismissed by editors as "mere speculation" or "opinion" about Buddhism: they are, instead, foundational, and most later schools and sects of Buddhism spring from them or are heavily influenced by them. Also, the sentence in the article saying that the idea of an eternal Buddha is not accepted by mainstream Theravada Buddhism strikes me not as insulting but, if anything, REJECTING the notion of an "eternal Buddha" and its votaries, and saying that such a teaching is wrong. I think the piece makes clear that there are certain teachings within Mahayana which are totally rejected as false by the Theravada. That is not to say, of course, that the Theravadin view is right and the Mahayana view is wrong, or the reverse. It is simply to present the facts. That is fair and balanced, I would say.

<li>Hallo Dhammapal. Thanks for your comment above. Yes, I do agree with you that from the Theravada stand-point, it can be seen as confusing, misleading and baffling to say that the Buddha is still alive. From the Mahayana point of view, however, it would be seen as a misunderstanding of deeper layers of Dharma to say that the Buddha (as Dharmakaya) can ever truly die! So I think we have to accept that there are different explanations (by the Nikayan Buddha and the Mahayana Buddha) of what a perfect Buddha actually is. I myself (as a Mahayana Buddhist) side with the teaching of an eternal Buddha; yourself (as perhaps a Theravada Buddhist) will find that unacceptable. We just have to agree to differ in a forum like Wikipedia. We have to acknowledge that there truly are some massive differences of doctrine between Theravada and a number of major Mahayana sutras. The fairest and most scholarly thing to do, it seems to me, is to reflect those different teachings in the various Wiki articles on Buddhism. If we only present consensus, we distort the reality of a plurality of differently nuanced "Buddhisms". In sum: I do feel (along with Richard and Nat, if I am not misrepresenting them) that the "Eternal Buddha" section is informative and does present both sides of the argument and is not unjust to either side in this debate. Perhaps it's best now to throw this open to other people apart from yourself and me and see what they think? Best wishes to you.

<p>Sorry I posted this in the 28 Buddhas section by mistake: I’m back calmer (and less argumentative) from a weekend break from Wikipedia as suggested by Richard. Good points Nat. In future when I quote the Buddha on a mainstream Wikipedia page I will refer them to the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> page. I am very grateful for Taiwanese Buddhists who have printed millions of free Theravada books so I respect their belief in <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amitabha.html" title="Amitabha">Amitabha</a> Buddha. What I’d like to see in this article is a description of the beautiful qualities that all Buddhas (in all traditions) have in common. Let’s work together to create a new section: <b>Qualities of a Buddha</b> (Rather than Qualities of the Buddha) Here’s a idea to start: “The important thing about Buddhas is that they are perfectly enlightened. Their minds are completely at peace - completely free of any form of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair; any form of selfishness or greed or craving or attachment; any form of ill-will, resentment, aversion, hurt feelings, righteous indignation; any form of delusion or ignorance which could lead to doubt and confusion. Their minds are perfectly at peace, abiding in complete knowledge of reality.” <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/1" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/1" rel="nofollow">Source</a> More on my suggestions for the more than one Buddha section later.

<dd>I am bit sceptical of this, as I guess I should have read close to the whole Sutta-pitaka by now, and don't remember anything like it. I looked on the internet a bit and found this quotaton of Ven. Rahula (for whole text see: <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha126.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha126.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, where he goes into it:</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This Mahayana view is quite in keeping with the Theravada Pali Tripitaka. In the Samyutta-Nikaya the Buddha says that the Tathagata (i.e. Buddha) and a bhikkhu (i.e. sravaka, disciple) liberated through wisdom are equal with regard to their Vimutta (liberation), but the Tathagatha is different and distinguished from the liberated bhikkhus in that he (Tathagata) discovers and shows the Path (Magga) that was not known before.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>These three states of the Sravaka, the Pratyekabuddha and the Buddha are mentioned in the Nidhikanda Sutta of the Khuddakapatha, the first book of the Khuddaka-nikaya, one of the five Collections of the Theravada Tripitaka. It says that by practising virtues such as charity, morality, self-restraint, etc., one may attain, among other things, "the Perfection of the Disciple" (Savaka-Parami), "Enlightenment of the Pratyekabuddha" (Paccekabodhi) and "the Buddha-domain" (Buddhabhumi). They are not called Yanas (vehicles).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the Theravada tradition these are known as Bodhis, but not Yanas. The Upasaka-janalankara, a Pali treatise dealing with the ethics for the lay Buddhist written in the 12th century by a Thera called Ananda in the Theravada tradition of the Mahavihara at Anuradhpura, Sri Lanka, says that there are three Bodhis: Savakabodhi (Skt: Sravakabodhi), Paccekabodhi (Skt: Fratyekabodhi) and Sammasambodhi (Skt: Samyaksambodhi). A whole chapter of this book is devoted to the discussion of these three Bodhis in great detail. It says further that when a disciple attains the Bodhi (Enlightenment), he is called Savaka-Buddha (Skt: Sravaka-Buddha)</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This teaching is thus a very late commentary (12th century AD), and aimed at ethics for laypeople. This makes it for me not a serious treatise on the subject of Buddhahood. Just one reference in a very late commentary on ethics for laypeople just doesn't do it for me, and should not for anyone who takes the Pali Canon seriously. Better look at what is in the Pali Canon itself (it wasn't 'closed' for nothing in the 3rd century BC!). A search on Accesstoinsight (the main pali canon resource on the internet) gives no results for Savakabuddha. Also pay attention to how Ven. Rahula himself uses the word. He doesn't use the word Savakabuddha himself, just Savaka, which refers to an Arahant and possibly to the anagamis, sotapannas and sakadagamis too. Savakabodhi also isn't equal to Savakabuddha. Bodhi means the awakening, Buddha is the title. One who experiences the Savakabodhi (which just mean he experiences bodhi as a student), is just a savaka, not a savakabuddha. He doesn't receive the title of Buddha, but he does receive the title of Arahant, which is also a title for the Buddha.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Last but not least, a search in an electronic version of the PTS Pali dictionary (the most authorative) gets no results for sāvakabuddha, but 42 for sāvaka. In the PTS dictionary a distinction is further made between the 'normal' savaka (hearer) who is never an Arahant, and the Ariyasavaka, who is an Arahant. For me the discussion is here conluded. Late Theravadin tradition has a mention of Savakabuddha in an obscure commentary (you would have to be a pali scholar to know it) from the 12th century. Original or early Theravadin tradition doesn't know the concept of the Savakabuddha, as does the Mainstream Theravada tradition nowadays. greetings <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 04:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hallo Sacca. I totally share your view that speaking of a "savaka/sravakabuddha" is extremely strange. I have certainly never come across that term in the Mahayana, or, as you rightly point out, in the Pali suttas. I agree that this designation of "savakabuddha" should be dropped, as it seems to be based on almost no hard-core evidence at all. As far as I am aware, the Buddha himself never uses the term, so it seems ill-advised to give it such strong prominence in an article on the Buddha. However, on another point, I do think we should keep the section on the "Eternal Buddha" in the main article - rather than sidelining it to an independent article. It's a major issue in the Mahayana and therefore deserves prominence. Best wishes to you.

<li>Hallo 20040302. Nice to hear from you again. I'd be interested for some actual quotes from Mahayana sutras where the Buddha speaks of "sravakabuddhas": usually he speaks of "sravakas and pratyekabuddhas". If you can supply some quotes, I'd be very interested - as I've not yet come across "sravakabuddha" in the Mahayana sutras. All the best to you.

<dl>
<dd>I understand your positions - and I agree that the specific term - savakabuddha may not be found in the Pali - however there IS evidence in the canon for a distinction between the bodhi of an enlightened savaka and a samyaksam buddha - just as there is plenty of discussion regarding the Pacceka in the canon. It appears that certainly - even if it is more recent (ie for the last 700 years) that the modern Theravada tradition accepts three types of Bodhi - and by extension one can plausibly use the suffix -buddha. I am happy to change the content to indicate 'three types of enlightenment' if you prefer - though in my humble opinion, I would guess that many people would see any referential distinction between three types of bodhi and three types of buddha as being... rather academic.

<dd>Hello, I think this would definately be an improvement. I would say that Theravada recognizes 3 kinds of fully enlightened people: Sammasambuddhas, Paccekabuddhas and Arahants (or Ariyasavakas - noble disciples). It's just that the third catagegory is never referred to as 'Buddha'. I think the essence of the enlightenment of those 3 kinds of people is the same (seeing the 4 noble truths, removal of mental defilements, etc), but the Buddhas have a much greater (or more complete) 'allround-knowing' concerning the world, with many additional spiritual powers, and an additional perfection of character. For an Arahant these are all optional, and even at best less developed than a Buddha's. Anyway, this is just to indicate what I think is the relation in Theravada between the bodhi of a Buddha (be it a Paccekabuddha or a Sammasambuddha), and an Arahant. As I said I agree with you both as far as I can see. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 15:43, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, I am happy with this - however, I am totally opposed to using the term 'Arahant' to refer soly to the Sravakabuddha (whatever we want to call them ) - as the term is synonymous with enlightened one, and is a recognised epiphet of all three types of Buddha. There is plenty of Pali canon evidence to show that the term Arahant is used when referring to Gautama Buddha - famous for being a Sammasambuddha. Also, I vigorously oppose the term Ariyasavakas - which refers to any Sravaka who has achieved the status of Stream-enterer or above. I am amused that the term Savakabuddha is considered mistaken - even though it's usage can be found within the Theravada tradition. So - in conclusion, I agree with the principle that the three types of buddha can be expressed as the three types of bodhi - but I am yet to see a good alternative term to replace Savakabuddha that is specific to Sravakas who have achieved Nirvana and has at least have a provenance more ancient than the 12th Century CE.

<dd>Also something on Arahant: isn't the term Arahant not commonly used in both Theravada and Mahayana to refer to the 'Arahattamagga' and 'Arahattaphala' ('path leading to Arahat(ship)' and the 'fruits of Arahant(ship)')? Maybe we can use these words to make clear how Arahant is meant here. Also, isn't the term Arahant also commonly used in the criticisms of Mahayana ('only' an Arahant?). I doubt that they mean Arahant to refer to Buddha here. The word Arahant is also used for Paccekabuddhas and sammasambuddhas, but the specific meaning is usually as a consequence of the Arahattamagga. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 04:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am against the rewriting of a huge number of articles that talk quite legitimately of the three types of Buddha / three types of Bodhi - merely on the basis that you cannot find a reference to Sravakabuddha (those Sravakas who have achieved Nirvana) that predates the 12thC in Theravada literature. The fact that the term IS used in 12thC literature, - albeit 'marginal' literature - indicates that actually, all traditions <i>do</i> understand three types of Buddha. What I stated above is that if you wish to change these articles, then change them to three types of Bodhi - do NOT change them to 'two types of buddha' - which is misleading, ill-informed, and only accurate in the sense that the term 'Sravakabuddha' is not found before 12thC in Theravada. I am mentioning this before any more editorial is done regarding this issue. (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a>)</dd>

<p>Actually this is no problem. We will just have to make clear what are the original teachings of Buddha as in the Pali Canon and Agamas, and make clear that there are only 2 types recognized by him. We can mention that this 12th century Theravadin commentary uses the term savakabuddha for Arahant, as does Mahayana. I am sure something can be arranged. I think that as this article is about Buddha (not Bodhi), this informatiion is relevant. Whether you acccept or reject it, it is verifyable and in itself appropriate content for this article.Greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User_talk%7ESacca_af54.html" title="User talk:Sacca">Sacca</a> 01:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hallo Sacca. I like your new version of the section on the "two types" of Buddha, plus the 12th-century Theravada commentarial reference to "savakabuddha". <b>But</b> I am still unsure as to which Mahayana sutras speak of a "sravakabuddha": User 2004 has not supplied us with that information yet. I am not saying that this term is definitely not used in the Mahayana sutras - but that I have never come across it myself (and I read lots of Mahayana sutras as a matter of course). So I would say: delete the phrase that says the term "savakabuddha" is "found in the Mahayana", until we get sutric evidence that it is. Do you agree? Best wishes to you.

<p>I have made some big and many small edits in the article. I moved the section on Eternal Buddhas and made it an aticles on its own since it was very detailed. I added the section on Characteristics of Buddhas, and there is a link and mention there of the teaching on <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_Buddha_5b6b.html" title="Eternal Buddha">Eternal Buddhas</a>. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 00:39, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hallo Sacca. Sorry: I missed your message above when I checked Wiki earlier today. I do think we need to keep the "Eternal Buddha" section in its main position within the "Buddha" article as this concept is so very important within Mahayana Buddhism. Indeed, Professor Masahiro Shimoda of Japan (a specialist in Mahayana Buddhism) recently said that it is part of the very basis of the Mahayana. We could prune it a bit, of course: as you rightly say, it is a bit prolix. But I don't think we should shunt it out of the main article altogether: it's too central a notion within Mahayana Buddhism (not least in connection with the highly influential "Lotus Sutra") for it to be sidelined, as it were. Hope you can accept this. In situations like this, I think it best to see what the majority "vote" on the matter is from other editors. Shall we see? Best wishes to you. Yours - Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 13:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you, best wishes to you too. OK, I would be ok with a some more detail on the characteristic of eternality of Buddhas in (some) Mahayana schools, it's just that this one characteristic was dominating the whole article on Buddhas. greetings, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 15:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I just saw the article again and I do think that the characteristic of Eternality can be mentioned together with the other characteristics of the Buddha, and also that sufficient information can be given in 3 lines. The article is pretty to-the-point, except in the Eternal Buddhas-section which is too drawn out.</dd>
<dd>Also, and more importantly, <i>please do not revert all edits if you don't agree with just one</i>. I think this is quite thoughtless behaviour, I don't suppose you disagree with each and every change I made? If you do, I can understand why you reverted them. But you mention only one objection to only one edit, and then remove everything. This is not the proper bahaviour, and I'm going to move it back.</dd>
<dd>Also I invite Tony to try to put in the gist of the eternal buddhas in 3 lines. No big drawn-out philosophical discussions of Mahayana &lt;--&gt; Theravada beliefs are needed here, but the core facts can be mentioned. If there's much details on a specific subject it is normal policy to put it in a seperate article, while keeping the core facts in the main article. This happens all over Wikipedia. Not to say that the subject doesn't belong in the main article because it does, but it should be a short, concise and to-the-point version of the whole story. greetings <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 16:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi Sacca. Thanks for your comments. Yes, sorry that I reverted the whole of the article and thus removed some of your other alterations - which was not my intention (that was just my technical clumsiness). I still think that there should be a substantial section on "Eternal Buddha" in the main article (not just 3 lines), as this is a very, very important element within Mahayana Buddhism - it is not just an optional add-on: it is crucial to much Mahayana Buddhism. But I'd be interested to see what other editors feel on this one. So for now, I have left your edit as it stands, and just added a few more words about "Eternal Buddha". All the best.

<dd>Thanks again for your best wishes&#160;:-) I understand it is very important, but to me all aspects of a Buddha are very important, In Theravada (and as I understand in some schools of Mahayana and Vajrayana too), Buddha as a man is also very, very important (OK, on my screen this has currently 4 lines). The point is that after a section develops a lot, it grows beyond what's appropiate detail for the article that it was a section of, and it needs to be put somewhere else - on its own. It also means it's grown up, and it's a big part of how the Wikipedia grows. It also allows the subject to grow even more in detail, since now it's on its own and not under another subject. Don't take the 3 lines to strictly, but it is I feel a good goal to help establish what's the essence of the info on the characteristic of eternality of buddhas - and to be able to put it into one paragraph. greetings, and with appreciation for your kind wishes, <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacca_2ddd.html" title="User:Sacca">Sacca</a> 17:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, based on the fact that the intro paragraphs were too long, I removed an unnecessary paragraph explaining what Nirvana and Dharma were (there are relevant articles elsewhere, and they are off-topic). I also moved the "god" paragraph further down to the Spiritual Realization section since the related topic of the Universal Buddha was covered.

<p>It's been suggested that I add two cents here so, if I may, I'd like to throw out a couple of ways to make the opening <i>possibly</i> both more cogent and also more meaningful to the general WP reader. Overall, I think the current four paragraphs are worthwhile and their general content deserves representation. Most of these suggestions are "nits." All are "for what it's worth."</p>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph 1:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pipe "enlightened" to <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhi.html" title="Bodhi">bodhi</a>.</li>
<li>Pipe "suffering" to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukkha.html" title="Dukkha">dukkha</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the elaborative parenthetical expression, "has permanently overcome greed, hate, and ignorance," because: (a) it likely appears cumbersome to a general WP reader and would dilute the essential aspect of a buddha being awakened/enlightened and liberated; and, (b) while this statement of the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilesa.html" title="Kilesa">kilesas</a> is common to Theravada Buddhism, some Mahayana/Vajrayana teachings identify more than three (for instance, see Tibetan Buddhism's "six poisons").</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph 2:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Delete the elaborative parenthesized expression, "(i.e., awakened to the truth, or Dharma)," because, again I think this elaboration is cumbersome without providing much more information to the general reader</li>
<li>Delete "or the Eightfold Path" as the 8-fold Path is included in the 4 Noble Truths (i.e., the 4th Truth).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph 3:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Delete the sentence, "A common Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya)" since I don't see this as central to a notion of "a buddha" at all.</li>
<li>A quick review of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Buddha_ec10.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Buddha">the links to this page</a> indicates that a number of WP editors thought they were linking to an article on <b>the Buddha</b>, not <b>a</b> buddha. And, relatedly, I see until recently that the intro to this article did contain more information on "the Buddha." To meet the expectations of linked articles (and without going through all the linked articles and piping them to <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>), I'd like to suggest minimally referencing the Buddha in the opening with the following change to this paragraph:</li>

<dd>I did originally write some of the opening paragraph, but people seemed to have grafted on alot more. Larry, or someone else, please implement the suggestios you've outlined. I think they are a good concise definition of a Buddha. <a href="../../../p/h/0/User%7EPh0kin_f7bc.html" title="User:Ph0kin">Ph0kin</a> 23:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ph0kin -</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your kind vote of confidence. Sorry for not responding sooner but I do not keep this article on my watchlist. Also, I would like to thank you for your general participation on Wikipedia (WP) Buddhism articles: your practice wisdom and sincere efforts are wonderful gifts to our community.</dd>

<dd>Regarding this specific article, at this time, I personally think it would take way too much effort on my part to attempt to address <i>long term</i> all the concerns I have; thus, I try to ignore this article's frequent changes and current status. For this reason, I will not implement the changes that I suggested above. If you or anyone else is inclined to implement any of them, please do so of course.</dd>

<dd>I hope you can understand and respect my desire to drastically limit my current involvement in this article. (I believe that restricting my focus to maybe 20 or so WP articles makes me more productive and effective.) I wish you the best and look forward to collaborating with you elsewhere in WP. With metta,</dd>

<p>While the introduction to the article makes it clear that this article is about the general concept of "Buddha" of which <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> is the most prominent example, later section seem to talk exclusively about Gautama Buddha (e.g. "the Nature of the Buddha"). This should be fixed.<a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 23:27, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
