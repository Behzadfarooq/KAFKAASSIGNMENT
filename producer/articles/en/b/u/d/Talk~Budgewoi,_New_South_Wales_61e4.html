<p>You have listed incorrect suburbs.</p>
<p>You have also deleted a description that is mostly accurate. Feel free to make edits but is it necesary to change something so radically?</p>
<p>Budgewoi Lake and Pacific Ocean are not suburbs</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, no I didn't list the wrong suburbs...have a look at a street directory and you will find they are, indeed, correct. Secondly, the description, while accurate, was (a) not referenced, (b) potentially not <i>Neutral Point of View</i> and (c) copied entirely from another website which is found on the first page of google. It is no big deal that the lakes and suburbs are not suburbs</dd>
<dd>Secondly, my edits are now complete on this page for the time being, but because of the pretty good article you have compiled, I have nominated it for the <a href="../../../d/y/k/DYK_a1c7.html" title="DYK">Did you Know</a> section of Wikipedia, which may see it featured on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, a very big achievement.</dd>
<dd>Finally, welcome to Wikipedia. Dont forget to sign your edits on talk pages by putting 4 of these ~ at the end of it and it will show your name. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodd661_2494.html" title="User:Todd661">Todd661</a> 08:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Some of the facts are just incorrect. The distance to the CBDis definitely not 70kms. The town was also not established in 1991. While I understand why you have usedthe references you did, theydo not reflect the truth of the matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And currently, there is no Suburb called Budgewoi Penisula and never has been. It is an area of coastline that pretty much consists of parkland. It may well be slated to become a suburb in the future but is definitely not at this point in time.</p>
<p>Using the lake name/ ocean nthe suburbs box is not a big thing but consider someone reading it from outside the area. They will be mislead.</p>

<dd>I can tell you, while you may not agree with the dates, believe me they are less than ideal, that is the official date from a government agency. Budgewoi Peninsula is a suburb, and has been since 2001...see <a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/extract?id=KWqwZxKmMn" class="external text" title="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/extract?id=KWqwZxKmMn" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I have also added the date again, as it is official, although I will accept a different one, if you provide a reference for it<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodd661_2494.html" title="User:Todd661">Todd661</a> 09:15, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, I can understand why you include both Budgewoi Penisula and 1991. Though I definitely don't agree with the inclusion of Budgewoi Penisula I can understand why it must be included. <a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 09:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BUT 1991 is just incorrect and needs to be deleted. It was probably just a redrawing of boundaries and we shouldn't be so inflexible to include something that is obviously incorrect. It feel should be deleted completely until a verifiable reference can be found.</p>
<p>Osaka</p>
<p>I definately don't think it should be deleted. It is a verifiable reference, but if you can find something that you think is more realistic, from a respectable source, go ahead and use it! As for Budgewoi Peninsula, I really do not understand your objection at all. It is a suburb. It is found both at the GNB and in the Central Coast UBD Street Directory. Just because it has a population of 0, does not mean it is not a suburb. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodd661_2494.html" title="User:Todd661">Todd661</a> 13:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Todd, you use <a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" class="external free" title="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search</a> as a reference BUT Toukley, Gorokan, Buff Point, Kanwal, Long Jetty, Ourimbah, Doyalson and even Wyong are all listed as having the same Assignment date of 17 May 1991. This is either a glitch in their programme or possibly a change in designation from town to village or some such thing. I stand by my assertion that the establishment dates should be deleted.</p>
<p>And if you search The Entrance, it shows a contradictory date of around 1910 a the bottom of the page. <a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 11:44, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This town was not established in 1991. Enough evidence has been provided to show that your source is incorrect.</p>
<p>You list the Pacific Ocean as being a suburb. This is just incorrect and should be deleted.</p>

<p>Removed from the page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some sources give the original name as Pudgeway (Aboriginal for young grass) but this is open to conjecture with local historian (Bruce Russell, "From Pudgeway to Budgewoi", 1984) stating the aboriginal name for the area as Budjeri, which meant "good conditions" and described the abundance of wallabies, birds, fish, prawns, trees, shrubs and plants they could use to sustain a healthy tribe. The early colonists named the area Pudgewoy but over the years it has been know by many other names: Budgeway, Possum's Fence, Sandy Point, Halekulani and the present name of Budgewoi which was made official in July 1978.</li>
</ul>
<p>Historian, but evidently not a linguist, which is the kind of person you want to go to for these issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Aboriginal" for young grass? There are many Aboriginal languages. Which one is this from?</li>
<li>"Budjeri" is an Eora word. But the Eora lived further south; I believe Budgewoi was inhabited by Awabakal, and their equivalent word seems to have been "murrorong".</li>
<li>How do you get from "budjeri" to "Budgewoi", anyway? Are -ri and -woi suffixes? If so, what do they mean?</li>
<li>"Pudgeway" was not the original name: it's basically just another way of representing exactly the same thing as "Budgewoi". The name is the same, it's just heard differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, I don't think this is a reliable source. --<a href="../../../p/t/c/User%7EPtcamn_50b7.html" title="User:Ptcamn">Ptcamn</a> 07:27, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, the origin of the name is conjecture but with a source also. No where is it stated that it is an absolute. But without a definitive source it is enough of a reference to confirm conversations that have taken place amongst locals for decades.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 15:41, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
