<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary</span></h2>
<hr />
<p>I feel we should have a Buddhist vocabulary of some sort. All the Sanskrit/Pali/Tibetan/Japanese is disturbing to some people, but many terms lack good translations. There is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Islamic_terms_in_Arabic_1940.html" title="List of Islamic terms in Arabic">List of Islamic terms in Arabic</a> so I'll start "List of Buddhist terms". Initially it will be short so feel free to discuss the format before the list gets too long. I suggest we make a rough school-language division:</p>
<p>--What are the following words meant to mean? Are they supposed to be equivalences? --</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanskrit - Mahayana (biksu)</li>
<li>Japanese - Zen (no good term seems to exist, sensei?)
<ul>
<li>Roshi? <a href="../../../u/y/a/User%7EUyanga_3816.html" title="User:Uyanga">Uyanga</a> 00:23 23 May 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>--Roshi and Sensei are wrong. A zen monk has a different name to a zen master.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tibetan - Tantric (lama)</li>
</ul>
<p>--This is very mistaken. A Tibetan bhikkhu is called a gelong if he is fully ordained, or getsul if he is a novice monk (of 36 vows). Tantra is a sanskrit word (The word "gyu" is the normative tibetan word for the sanskrit word Tantra), and is not equivalent to Theravada - Tantra is not a school. There are four well-known schools in Tibet, and numerous sub-schools and small schools, with different canon, different vinaya, and different lineages.Secondly, there are also four separate schools of philosophy in Tibet. What is Theravada? A school or a philosophy? The meaning of "lama" is a (canonical/normative) tibetan word for the Sanskrit word Guru. Also, almost all Tibetan Buddhists are Mahayana (tib. tegchen), but the monastic tradition holds a savarstivadin(sp.?) -Hinayana Vinaya tradition in the 'Sarpa' schools. Most modern tibetan practitioners will practice according to the entire Hinayana, Mahayana and Tantrayana texts. Far from being degreded, the Tibetan canon has the most complete and accurate set of sutras and commentaries as was found in Nalanda university during the 8th - 11th centuries. The sutras of the Pali canon (the Dhammapada is not a sutra, and is not found there) are all found in the tibetan canon and are also regarded as normative- therefore the Tibetan tradition is -inclusive- it is an EXTENSION of the hinayana tradition. So we cannot make big ideas about 'Lama==Bhikku'.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pali - Theravada (bhikku)</li>
<li>English - common to all schools (monk)</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Vietnamese</li>
<li>Burmese</li>
</ul>
<p>Should these be as separate articles or one file? Or maybe both?</p>
<dl>
<dd>A 'Buddhist glossary' in one file would be a great idea. It should be basic; covering all 5 categories you've mentioned because there are many well done glossaries on the www.

<p>Q: There have been some questions about how much lip service should be given to meditation on the Buddhism front page. I've attempted to at least allude to it since it is a central practice to most traditions. Any other thoughts?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Buddha vs Many Buddhas</span></h2>
<p>I do have a problem with the wording in the page because it puts much too much emphasis on "the Buddha". In many traditions of Buddhism, there is the premise that there are many Buddhas, and that everyone can become a Buddha.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed a few instances of "the Buddha" from the article. I think the ones that are left shouldn't be a problem. Your observation on "many Buddhas" and "everyone can become a Buddha" is of course a good one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. But, you should know that the premise of many 'Buddhas' is recognized in Theravada AND Mahayana (Vajrayana included). The only difference is that Mahayana emphasizes these 'other Buddhas' more in practice, whereas in Theravada, Buddhists worry about this eon and its Buddha and Dharma. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 21:58 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>In all of the traditions I've read about where there are multiple Buddhas, they are held to be aspects of the same entity. All parts of the universal consciousness. It's all really just a minor matter of semantics.</p>
<p>-Are you refering to the Mahayana schools such as those of Tibetan origin? I think the idea of a universal consciousness is rejected by Gautama Buddha in the suttas where he describes the 25 false views of the self. I assume that in this analysis he'd also be refering to himself. - RSA</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is a violation of Anatta. Even Mahayana scholars adamantly professed that the 'Universal Consciousness' is NOT a self! This seems to never make it into modern Western Buddhist books for obvious reasons: to propagate the god-like bodhisattva who can evade impermance for eternity to save every single being in samsara out of compassion. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 21:58 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rebirth</span></h2>
<p>I am surprised to find that the main article on Buddhism makes no mention of reincarnation and only has a link to nirvana. is this just my ignorance of buddhism (which is vast) or could these have been missed? I know that the average reader at least would expect treatment of these two issues as well as a snapshot of daily life for the average buddhist: visit to shrines, ancestor worship (which is also not mentioned), etc...<br />
also, from the historical perspective, would it be appropriate to detail ways in which buddhism shows its hindu roots (if it has such roots, again, i think the average reader might expect clarification on this?) --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasticlax_73b9.html" title="User:Plasticlax">Plasticlax</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Gautama Buddha never taught <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a>. He taught his version of Rebirth. Vajrayana, what is practiced in Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia, etc., does subscribe to reincarnation but this was transmitted from Hinduism into its all schools. 'OM' for example, which is used in Vajrayana is from Hinduism and is a derivative of Hinduism's 'AUM'.<br />
The <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> section is still in it's infancy so we thank you for your input. We will work hard to provide concrete content. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 21:58 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed "The precepts to seek Nirvana" and "The virtues". It seems <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is literally prone to lists.

<hr />
<p>For most people the distinction between reincarnation and rebirth is one of name only. So I think reincarnation can be mentioned, though it should obviously be done in such a way as to make it palatable to Buddhists.</p>

<dd>Pre-Hindu would be the correct term. He did not forbid tradition, but I understand and am with you on the points. How should we work this into the article? <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 19:43 16 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I do think that "Hinduism" is as good a term as any to describe the contemporary religion of the Buddha's day. He was more or less a contemporary of the writers of the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (yes, I am 68.5.87.191)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Its quite rare for "Hinduism" to be used in this context in history books but I do notice it. We never label Jesus Christ as a Christian. He was a Jew. In the same respects, Brahminism during Siddhartha Gautamas time isn't remotely close to what we now know as Hinduism. It is even quite the opposite in some ways (cows are no longer sacrificed by Brahmin priests but presently worshipedby Hindu preists). In regards to the Upanishads, like most pre-Hindu and later Indian texts, they're not canonical and have authors making deletions and entries spanning many centuries.<br />
Your paragraph touches on a noteworthy subject. In every society that Buddhism propagated into, they native indigenous cultures and religions were not disturbed. Although Gautama openly expressed his 'Right View', he did not supress other cultures. If a rite wasn't detrimental to the wellbeing of the people, it simply was ok. In Thailand, you will notice miniture houses infront of homes (of an ancient tradition) that are shrines used to respect the spirits. This unBuddhist ritual is considered usless, yet no coercion was issued. Often people mistaken the culture practiced in Buddhist societies as Buddhist. There are professed Buddhists who are speculative mystics practicing ritual within the complex of a Buddhist temple, and there are also professed Islamists by the thousands willing to commit kamikaze (an act they consider the duty and 6th pillar of Islam), but this doesn't mean its in the Qur'an and "in the religion".<br />
I do apprieciate your work and agree that Buddhism is under a veil of culture; mistakenly an aspect of it but really just tolerated custom. Gautama was against many rituals that <i>some</i> Buddhists now adhere to. These I myself am against but the practitioners must, with their free will in mind, be able to see for themselves. The religion he established in doctrine and discipline is available for them under all that frivolous mumbo-jumbo.

<dd>How does 'proto-Hinduism' sound?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'proto-Hinduism' is more acceptable than Hinduism, but the whole sentence (as would be revised) "Buddhism originated as a proto-Hindu equivalent of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, but it departed more significantly from its parent tradition." remains set in POV. The teachings of Buddha were unconcerned with cosmology - this distinction means that Buddhism had little in common with either denying or supporting proto-scientific doctrines on the nature of the universe. Buddha basically told us that we would be less miserable if we stopped being self-centred. This idea was revolutionary, and remains revolutionary.</dd>

<p>I think it would be important to add some explanation of the origin of the terms 'Mahayana' and 'Hinayana.' I tried to do this, but then I realized that there were some problems with the structure of the article. The current structure of the section on the two schools places Theravada first and Mahayana second, which is logical because the paragraph on Mahayana needs to be followed by a discussion of the various subdivisions of that school. However, in the interests of the name explanation, it would be best to place Mahayana first, since it is the one that first named itself after the raft metaphor. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> 06:03 20 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea, Smack. Historically, of course, Theravada should remain first but with the name explanation, what ever makes the Maha-Hina conflict understandable is good for the reader. We should note that Theravada and Hinayana are not the same, which badly needs to be noted. Be well. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 07:10 20 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is best to tread this ground very lightly and try our best to make this topic as opinion free as possible.

<ul>
<li>Well I'm newish here but I'm looking at this page and wondering what the hell is going on. I started tidying up bits but realised that there are major structural difficulties with the way Buddhism is handled. The whole subject area of Buddhism needs restructuring to make it more conherent and navigable. I've mucked around with the entries a bit before discovering this page so forgive me if I've stepped on anyone's toes. I'm looking around at how general books have structured their chapters to see if they provide a good model. But otherwise I'll try to make some thing up - I'm a librarian so this is what I'm good at. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">Michael</a> 8 Aug 2003.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Buddhism Wikipedia is filled with errors</span></h2>
<p>I am a specialist in Buddhist studies and have looked at a lot of the material contained here in the area of Buddhism. Most of it is terribly inaccurate and misleading. People should not be writing entries for a reference work if they are lacking in expertise on a topic. It will give people the wrong information, and give the project a bad reputation. Please don't write on a topic if you don't know what you are talking about. Charles Muller (www.acmuller.net/ddb)</p>

<dd>On the internet you could be a dog posing as a Buddhist scholar, who knows? Just because you're a self confessed 'specialist', doesn't mean you have the patent on what Buddhism is. 'Specialist' opinions on Buddhism have changed radically since 'specialists' started taking an interest, and continue to change. All any of us can do is give the 'truth' as we see it. Part of the fun of doing wiki is writing what you think, and then watching someone correct it with something better, so lets not get all anal retentive about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW when you do add your 'specialist' opinion, do take the time to link it into other entries, and do check to see what links to the information you have moved, and either change those links or provide forwarding (and backwarding). Otherwise, and this is <i>my</i> 'information specialist' opinion; otherwise however special your opinion is, it doesn't contribute to a harmonious whole. Also you can sign your posts here by doing ~~~~. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">Mahaabaala</a> 09:08, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seems our specialist in Buddhist studies spat the dummy and went home with his toys. He's left a range of evils amongst the Buddhist pages which will take a while to track down and correct. Mainly a very academic approach which will bewilder most general users, but also a whole lot of links to his personal Buddhist directory which don't work because a login is required! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">Mahaabaala</a> 16:27, 15 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Audience</span></h2>
<p>We need to think about who the audience for this page, and it's subsidiaries, is. Is this, for instance, supposed to be for the general public, or it is an academic reference work. The level is very mixed at present with most of it aiming at a general audience, but eg the schools section now looking like a university text book <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahaabaala_a94a.html" title="User:Mahaabaala">Mahaabaala</a> 09:28, 15 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Buddhism - Please Read Before Editing Buddhism</span></h2>
<p>The purpose of this comment is to prevent an otherwise inevitable edit war.</p>
<p>"Buddhism" is a term that is not traditionally used by "Buddhists". Instead, we ("Buddhists") have a whole set of other terms for "Buddhism" - such as Dharma, the law, etc. Also we 'Buddhists' traditionally tend to call ourselves "insiders".</p>
<p>I would suggest that the 'Buddhism' page be split into several subsidiarys that would allow for the plural nature of the 'Buddhist' culture to be more easily divulged.</p>
<p>We could have: Western Academic views of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Theravadin views of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Chinese (pure land) views of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Chinese (zen) views of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Japanese (zen) views of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Tibetan views of Buddhism. etc..</p>
<p>This would help us get over the philosophical and editorial problem of a "ONE TRUE VIEW" that contradicts directly the message of Anatta (Skt. anatman), and moreover would demonstrate that the idea of syncretising (US: syncretizing) a set of cultures, beliefs and ethics that have been diversifying for over 2,500 years is really an activity that will not reflect those cultures and beliefs without reducing them to something that loses their plural, exciting diversity. We should embrace diversity, not try to choke it with some reductive approach to unification, just to make it "fit in" with outsider's ideas of categorising everything into nice boxes such as 'religion'.</p>
<p>Regarding the current Buddhism article, to me it appears to be based upon (outsider) western academic ideas; to quote: "The Mahayana arose in the first few centuries". Well, according to whom? Certainly not according to Mahayana insiders! (Mahayana insiders assert that e.g. the events described in the "heart of the perfection of wisdom sutra" happened during Siddhartha Gautama Buddha's lifetime.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, given that Wikipedia is intended as a quasi-neutral reference source, shouldn't the position of secular scholarship predominate? I would assume, similarly, that the Wikipedia entry on the Bible discusses its composition and redaction by human authors and editors.<a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">कुक्कुरोवाच</a> 15:12, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moreover, the very class of assertion about the Mahayana implies a reified, acontextual (objective) Weltanschauung (English: worldview) - something that many insiders would find it difficult to accept, as it contradicts with the basic message of Anatman (Pali: anatta).</p>
<p>Also, there is a seeming crisis in the Pali/Sanskrit issue; do we always need to write this with a predominance of one over the other e.g: Anatta (Skt. anatman)&#160;? Do we need to do this at all? (Note the mild parodies above). Moreover, choosing Pali over Sanskrit appears to indicate a continuing subscription to an unfortunate split in traditional opinion; (what appears to be a Theravadin intolerance towards the Mahayana), which may not even be there. Hence, the idea of allowing for diverse views to be covered, high up in the tree of the Buddhism article, can avoid these challenges.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, since we write in a linear format, something has to come first, if we're going to include both. Certainly we have to include at least one (since there aren't, generally, adequate English translations that are general enough to ensure that people know they're talking about the same thing). Seems to me both should be included for terms that are important both within the Pāli-language tradition and within the "Sanskrit" of the Mahāyāna. (Actually, almost no Buddhist writers (Nāgārjuna being the obvious exception) used Sanskrit; the Mahāyāna sutras are more typically composed in what is called "Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit" (BHS), which is really just a prakrit dressed up to look like Sanskrit...but there's really no convenient way to indicate that in a short form that the average reader will understand, and most of the lexical items look the same as their Sanskrit equivalents, anyway.) The rule should be that when the term originated in Pāli (or, rather, when our first evidence of it is in the Pāli canon) and was grandfathered into later the BHS writings, then the Pāli term should come first. When the term is specific to the Pāli writings, it should be listed in Sanskrit only. (Unless it also wound up in Theravāda literature, though I don't know if that ever happened). I don't see how differentiating the origin languages for terms indicates any sort of bias; it's just good scholarship.<a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">कुक्कुरोवाच</a> 15:12, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
