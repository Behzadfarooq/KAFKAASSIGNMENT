<p>The statement wasn't actually issued by the Pakistani Ministry for Religious affairs but by the Taleban ministry for religious affairs. I have put in link to the AFP news that describes the statement. 7/3/2006 Hadi1121</p>

<dl>
<dd>Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei conceived a film, "The Giant Buddhas" (2005), that precisely talks about the destruction of the statues, the international reactions to it and all events surrounding this barbary. The feature is provoking, yet universal in its message against fanaticism, ignorance and intolerance, and thus implicitly recognising respect and protection of cultural sites as valid and necessary.</dd>

<p>No, shirk is the sin of polytheism, the failure to recognize the unicity, the irreducible oneness of God. It is a sin from which even (trinitarian) Christians suffer, in the eyes of many Moslems. The Islamic prohibition against images, human and divine, is of a different magnititude, with origins in the hadith (collected sayings of Mohammed), not in the Qu'ran (the putative recitations of God bestowed by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet). <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlondlieut_44b1.html" title="User:Blondlieut">Blondlieut</a> 03:48, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that "tank barrages and were demolished after almost a month of intensive bombardment." Tank shells are very expensive. They could have bought food for the children with that same money instead. Since this alleged behaviour would be cruel and inhuman beyond comprehension, perhaps we need a citation to support the tank statement above? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielDemaret_b14d.html" title="User:DanielDemaret">DanielDemaret</a> 18:16, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a casual passing I noted over five instances of deplorable grammar. Among many other offenses: Never cite a source within quotations, never italicize quotes unless they are famously recounted (ie, <i>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind</i> is okay, but italicizing some airbag disseration is not, no matter how holy the speaker may be considered), and my god use spaces after commas.</p>
<p>Additionally, the article seems strange in that there are two seperate paragraphs devoted to the Taliban's defense of the destruction. These should probably either be condsensed into one, or the global outcry be given more space of its own, to avoid <i>seeming</i> biased.</p>
<p>Given these issues, I marked the article for cleanup, hopefully by some kind and able Wikipedian. I personally can only tolerate so much Islam before my inner Troll of the Western Imperialists starts coming to life, so I can't do much more myself. --Nugneant 22:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All those insults, you found one wrong apostrophe, one minor misuse of quotemarks. And unislamic in this context was quite correct, thank you. If you were to read the Taliban paras carefully, you would note that although they say what the Taliban defence was, they are not at all complimentary to the Taliban, so to characterise them as biased, if anything thye are anti-taliban. Which is quite different from anti (or pro) muslim...<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 23:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC) And your record speaks for itself.

<p>Not only insults but pots and kettles as well. It's 'separate' not 'seperate', it's 'condensed' not 'condsensed',and who knows what is meant by 'dissertion'(dissertation?'). There should be commas before and after 'my god' and the use of 'I personally' is tautologous. 'Hopefully' is wrongly used as it applies to a Wikepedian - what was meant was 'I hope' - Jim</p>

<p>I think this should have been discussion before the big rename. The mostly commonly used name and spelling in the English speaking world should be used. Also, it was done in a sloppy manner since all the interwiki links are now broken (unless you planned to rename it in every encyclopedia). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsRover_23ea.html" title="User:MarsRover">MarsRover</a> 17:00, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, Bamiyan is the normal spelling for an English-language encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 20:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Generally, place names are romanized according to the official romanization system of the country the place is a part of" That was the reason the name was changed as Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior appears to have decided that Bamiyan is now Bamyan, and refers to it as such in recent documents. As with many countries, Romanisation of Afghan names is a nightmare, with up to five versions current for some towns or provinces. Surely some consistency is needed here, and the rename was in accordance with the policy adopted for names in China, Japan, Korea and other countries that do not use the Roman alphabet. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinsmoke_7bfe.html" title="User:Skinsmoke">Skinsmoke</a> 01:41, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hazaras built the Buddah of Bamyan when they were buddist during their Kushan empire. Kushan period was one of the greatest era in the history of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Hazara people never throwed an stone to it at whatever relegion they converted overtime. But evil people over the last 200 years periodically broked its leg, shaved its face and evil Taliban completly destroyed it.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I've heard sources say a few times recently that Unesco has declared it <i>will not</i> rebuild the statues, and will let them stand as a testament to Afghanistan's history... can anyone verify this and should we update the article to reflect that? <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacahuate_77a8.html" title="User:Cacahuate">Cacahuate</a> 06:04, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
