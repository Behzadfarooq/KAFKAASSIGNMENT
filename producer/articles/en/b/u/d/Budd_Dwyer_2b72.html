<p>During the early 1980s, state employees overpaid millions of dollars in <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax_9b60.html" title="Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax">Federal Insurance Contributions Act</a> (FICA) taxes. As a result, the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">commonwealth</a> began accepting bids from companies to calculate the amount of the refund each employee was due.</p>
<p>One firm, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>-based Computer Technology Associates, was owned by a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania_b19b.html" title="Harrisburg, Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a> native named John Torquato, Jr., who used his area connections and a series of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bribery.html" title="Bribery">bribes</a> to obtain the contract, worth a reputed $4.6 million. An anonymous memo reached the office of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Pennsylvania_61f8.html" title="Governor of Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania Governor</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Thornburgh_e701.html" title="Dick Thornburgh">Dick Thornburgh</a> informing him of what had happened.</p>
<p>In late 1986, Budd Dwyer was charged with receiving a <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kickback.html" title="Kickback">kickback</a> of $300,000. A <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> was made for Torquato and <a href="../../../d/a/u/Dauphin_County_9cbc.html" title="Dauphin County">Dauphin County</a> Republican Party Chairman William Smith (who was also Torquato's attorney), as well as Smith's wife, which required them to testify against Dwyer. This, coupled with the government's refusal to name unindicted co-conspirators in the case, made it difficult for Dwyer to defend himself, though the unindicted co-conspirators are believed to have been staff members of the Dauphin County Republican Party. During this time, the district's <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Attorney_82a9.html" title="United States Attorney">United States Attorney</a> offered Dwyer a plea bargain that carried a maximum of five-years in prison in exchange for a guilty plea on one count of accepting a bribe, resignation, and cooperation in the investigation.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Dwyer refused the offer, and was later convicted but continued to vehemently profess his innocence, as did others who were close to him.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Under state law, Dwyer could continue to serve as state treasurer until his sentencing. The maximum sentence Dwyer was facing was 55 years <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">imprisonment</a> and a $300,000 fine.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Budd_Dwyer_2b72.html" title="Edit section: Public suicide">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Public suicide</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the day before his sentencing, Dwyer called a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_conference.html" title="Press conference">press conference</a> to "provide an update on the situation." Many expected Dwyer to announce his resignation from office.</p>
<p>At the conference, an agitated and nervous Dwyer once again professed his innocence, and declared that he would not resign as state treasurer. Those attending would hear his final words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions, and, most of all, the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Now my life has changed, for no apparent reason. People who call and write are exasperated and feel helpless. They know I'm innocent and want to help. But in this nation, the world's greatest democracy, there is nothing they can do to prevent me from being punished for a crime they know I did not commit. Some who have called have said that I am a modern day <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_%28Biblical_figure%29_65cb.html" title="Job (Biblical figure)">Job</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Judge (Malcolm) Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $300,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he, quote, "felt invigorated" when we were found guilty, and that he plans to imprison me as a deterrent to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrent because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent; it wouldn't be a legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulag.html" title="Gulag">gulag</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>We were confident that right and truth would prevail, and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system, people have said, "why bother," "no one cares," "you'll look foolish,"</i> <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a><i>,</i> <a href="../../../2/0/2F/20_20_9c54.html" title="20/20">20/20</a><i>, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Anderson_7797.html" title="Jack Anderson">Jack Anderson</a> and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years, and it doesn't bother anyone..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point Dwyer stopped with his prepared text and called to three of his staffers, giving each an envelope. It was later discovered that one contained a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_note.html" title="Suicide note">suicide note</a> to his wife. The second was an <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_donation.html" title="Organ donation">organ donor</a> card and other related materials. The third was a letter to newly-inaugurated Gov. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_P._Casey_3aa9.html" title="Robert P. Casey">Robert P. Casey</a>.</p>
<p>After handing out the envelopes, Dwyer opened a fourth large manila envelope and withdrew a <a href="../../../2E/3/5/.357_Magnum_21c5.html" title=".357 Magnum">.357 Magnum</a> <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a>, advising those in the crowd to: "Please leave the room if this will offend you." Those in attendance cried out to Dwyer, pleading with him to put the gun down ("Budd -- Don't!" was heard on television). Some tried to approach him. "Stay away, this thing will hurt someone," he warned.<sup id="_ref-AP1-23_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP1-23" title="">[3]</a></sup> Those were his <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_words.html" title="Last words">last words</a>. Amid the cry of "Budd, Budd, Budd!" Dwyer put the gun barrel into his mouth and pulled the trigger. He collapsed on the floor, in front of five television news cameras. Dwyer was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:31 am.<sup id="_ref-AP1-23_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP1-23" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Budd_Dwyer_2b72.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>A number of television stations throughout <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> aired taped footage of Dwyer's suicide before a mid-day audience. Due to a major snowstorm throughout Pennsylvania that day, many schools were closed and many school-aged children were witness to the suicide. Over the next several hours, however, news editors had to decide whether to air the graphic images or to edit the footage for evening news telecasts. Dwyer's case has become a favorite of a small number of <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a> professors to demonstrate that news editors (especially in the medium of television) must be prepared to make instant decisions, weighing the psychological impact on viewers against their business sense of beating other media outlets to the story.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the end, many stations, including <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAU-TV_1966.html" title="WCAU-TV">WCAU</a>, aired the footage up to a point just prior to the shooting. Others, including Pennsylvania's <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_W_583c.html" title="Group W">Group W</a> stations <a href="../../../k/y/w/KYW-TV_1e2b.html" title="KYW-TV">KYW</a> and <a href="../../../k/d/k/KDKA-TV_a104.html" title="KDKA-TV">KDKA</a>, aired no footage at all; this despite the fact that Group W's news cameraman William L. "Bill" Martin—based out of the Harrisburg state capitol's Correspondents Room—had a camera set up at the news conference. Only a handful aired the entire press conference unedited. <a href="../../../w/p/v/WPVI-TV_8e05.html" title="WPVI-TV">WPVI</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> was one station that chose to re-broadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_News_f92c.html" title="Action News">Action News</a> broadcasts without warning to viewers. That station's broadcast is a source for copies circulating on the Internet. <a href="../../../w/p/x/WPXI-TV_ebe4.html" title="WPXI-TV">WPXI</a> in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> is reported by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast and did in fact broadcast the footage. In explaining the decision to air, WPXI news operations manager By Williams said, "It's an important event" about an "important man." Williams opted not to air the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, "Everyone knows by then that he did it. There are children out of school."</p>
<p>The broadcast of the shooting became a topic for educators in Pennsylvania classrooms and led to questioning the wisdom of airing live news broadcasts in public school settings. This issue was also faced during the explosion of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_6f2c.html" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">Space Shuttle Challenger</a>, which was shown live in many classrooms since <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christa_McAuliffe_43ce.html" title="Christa McAuliffe">Christa McAuliffe</a> was to be the first teacher in outer space.</p>
<p>The suicide also changed <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> photo practices. At the time, the AP had its photographers shoot most photos in black and white, since the film was cheaper and the photos took less time to transmit. Also, most newspapers still had black-and-white front pages at the time. Color film would be issued only to photographers expected to be getting the top photos for national news that day. Since this news conference was expected to be of little interest outside Pennsylvania, black-and-white film was used. Once it turned into a major worldwide story, the AP got requests for color photos. After that, the AP promptly switched to taking all photos in color. Most of the photos were still transmitted in black and white until the transmission technology improved to a point when color photos didn't cause delays.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Since Dwyer died in office before being removed upon sentencing, his widow, Joanne, was able to collect full survivor benefits totaling over $1.28 million. A spokesman for Dwyer, immediately after the suicide, suggested Dwyer may have killed himself to retain the state-provided pension for his household, which had been ruined by legal defense costs.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dwyer's legal struggles may have ended with his death, yet a fascination with his suicide goes on to this day. Copies of the footage continue to circulate via the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and have appeared in various films, including the <i><a href="../../../f/a/c/Faces_of_Death_d7a4.html" title="Faces of Death">Faces of Death</a></i> series and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>'s <i><a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_for_Columbine_e132.html" title="Bowling for Columbine">Bowling for Columbine</a>.</i></p>
<p>In late 2003, documentary filmmaker Jim Dirschberger started work on "Honest Man," a feature length documentary about Budd and the CTA scandal. Slated for a 2007 release the film includes interviews with William Smith, the Dwyer family (Robert Dwyer, Jeanne Murphy-Dwyer and Dian Dwyer) as well as former colleagues and friends. Also authors Lorraine Yuhasz and William Keisling have contributed their expert knowledge of the CTA scandal to the project.<a href="http://www.dwyermovie.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dwyermovie.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
