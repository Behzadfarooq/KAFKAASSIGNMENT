<p>Huh. Well. This kind of blows chunks. Specifically: (1) The new style, monobook, while aesthetically pleasing in the extreme, specifies Verdana, such that if you use it, the majority of Sanskrit diacritics will be not so much of the available. Also, Verdana's a pretty lame font as such.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, update on this. It's pretty easy to customzie the css; just create yourself a subpage called monobook.css and include something like
<pre>
 * {font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"} 
</pre>
I'm sure there's a less brutal way of doing it, but I wasn't in a patient mood. Also, does anyone know of (a) a good serif face with a full suite of unicode glyphs, and/or (b) a good free font of any kind with a full suite of unicode glyphs? <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<dd>With respect to UTF-8, the reason that mediawiki doesn't encode it by default is probably that the DB Engine of choice (mysql) did not properly support UTF-8, so I guess the bods at mediawiki decided not to implement UTF-8 encoding until it was supported properly by mysql.

<p>(2) My beloved msg: system of transliteration seems to break somewhat in 1.3. Which is unfortunate. It also doesn't seem to break in a coherent or predictable manner. As I don't thin anyone else was using this extensively, this probably isn't a huge concern, but I will say that changing from msg: to template: helps exactly some of the time, and that part of the problem comes from having two msg: tags in the same word. The simplest thing would be to change over to subst: and have these things go back to their numbered entities, but unfortunately this doesn't always work. I'm pondering solutions currently.</p>

<p>1: I started a section called "Buddhism After the Buddha" and wanted to know if I should keep it that way or if I shouldn't. I'm not sure if there's an article about the history of Buddhism, specifically; I think there should be one, but even if there is one, there should at least be a brief summary on this page, like the one I started, only a bit longer.</p>
<p>2: Shouldn't we move the "Origins" material to the page on Gautama Buddha, especially since it seems to be pretty detailed and the Buddhism page is considered too long? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrutannica_6161.html" title="User:Brutannica">Brutannica</a> 00:40, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any objection to the post-Buddha division. There are articles on history (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Buddhism_0dc3.html" title="Timeline of Buddhism">Timeline of Buddhism</a>, for example, and I think there's one on history of Buddhist polemics, or history of the schools, or somesuch. As for the "Origins" material, it's useful to have to put the religion in context for readers. It maybe could use some trimming, though. My concern is with "This was partially due to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a> invasions, and partially due to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> absorbing Buddhist principles." On what are we basing the claim that Buddhism's decline in India was owing to Hindu appropriation? That sounds like a difficult thing to state as a fact (though certainly it also sounds like a defensible hypothesis), and could potentially draw some flack. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 06:30, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not really a strong enough source for my taste. And it's arguable, for example, whether various Hindu branches absorbed Buddhist principles, the opposite happened, or they simply emerge from the same cultual movement critiquing older forms of the orthodox religion. Perhaps we should remove it until we can find a better source. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 07:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know. Does anyone actually dispute Brut's version of events? At the very least, we could say that Hinduism absorbed most of Buddhism's base of support. I would reference this from Skilton's book, if my copy were not in another country, but I have read the same basic story in different places. The main differences I've seen are just in how much one or the other (Muslim invasion or Hindu absorption) is emphasized (<a href="../../../u/d/i/Udit_Raj_2166.html" title="Udit Raj">Udit Raj</a> believes that it was entirely the work of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_invasion_of_India_88d2.html" title="Islamic invasion of India">Muslims</a> had nothing to do with it, but I don't take him as a very credible source for history). We might could also consult with our friend Lord Surya. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 09:30, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the version I first learned was that around that time Hinduism started emphasizing sex, which simultaneously attracted former Buddhists and the wrath of invading Afghan Muslims, who wiped out many temples (possibly not distinguishing between Hindu and Buddhist?). I didn't include that for space and controversy reasons. Opinions?<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrutannica_6161.html" title="User:Brutannica">Brutannica</a> 21:04, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I've never heard that before, but I don't suppose that makes it wrong. I know that people love to flap their gums about tantric sex (in Hinduism and Buddhism), but did Hinduism in general ever <i>emphasize</i> sex? That sounds far-fetched. Plus, I don't know about you, but, to me, "invading Afghans" doesn't sound like something that would need a lot of provocation in order to draw their wrath. Clearly, in the long run, north Indian Buddhism got the worst of it (a history of India I read -- don't remember the name -- suggested that this was because the Muslim and Hindu establishments reached a compromise where the latter would be treated as <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmis</a> while the Buddhists would not, although I would want to include that unless we can find something more authoritative). - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 06:54, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would agree with NatKrause. Hinduism did in fact compete with Buddhism, so it seems logical that yoga with its esoteric concepts attracted many some late indian Buddhists (or prevented some who would otherwise choose Buddhism to join), but sex had nothing to do with that (sex goes under niyama, it's not permitted for serious practitioners). Esoteric practices are somewhat different from classic Patanjali's yoga, but anyway they didn't have sex all the time they would want to. If we stick to Buddha's own sermons, the deterioration of Buddhism began even before Shakyamuni's parinibbana. When Buddha permitted women to join the female sangha, he said that as a result of this, the 'golden era' will be reduced from 1000 years to 500.</dd>

<dd>Sex? Not relevant or accurate. The answer is probably a good deal more complex than one or two reasons. I would err on the side of caution on this one, and say that there are various theories about why - then quote the sources if you wish. Here is my theory: latter-day Indian Buddhism was pretty much centred around Nalanda university - and it may be that the muslim invaders saw that institution as too much of a political threat. Secondly, the Udyana buddhists had already been wiped out early on in the muslim invasion, and this probably influenced them away from negotiating settlements.

<dd>Whether Atman belongs to Buddhism depends on how dogmatic you are. I am sure there will be a diagreement on this subject among followers of various schools. But then Atman is not a philosophical concept, it's something you need to experience by way of practice, to attain by way of meditation. Many Buddhist esoteric practitioners (you can find some in caves of Indian Himalayas, they are not interested much in sophistics) do not differetiate that much between the Hindu yogic terminology and Buddhist terms. If we follow their logic, the following words mean the same thing: Atman, Nirvana, Emptiness, the True Self. Various schools lead to this goal, but use different roadmap. As to the scientific community and followers not so advanced in meditation, there is disagreement whether (for example) 'the true self' and 'emptiness' are the same, Atman and Nirvana is the same etc. I remember H.H. Dalai Lama 14th lectured on this topic when he compared various Tibetan schools. So, I am of the opinion that Atman fits perfectly well into Buddhist concepts. But there always will be some dogmatic Theravadin that would remove it as 'un-Buddhist'&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Amongst the core principles of Buddhism, besides The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eight-Fold Path, is the Three Characteristics (Marks) of all Phenomena -- Anicca, Dukkha &amp; Anatta (Impermanence, Suffering, Non-Self). Depending on the definition of Atman used, if it refers to an eternal, everlasting, permanent self, then it would be in somewhat contradiction with the Buddha's own words! In some later texts, the True Self or Nature is used to describe Emptiness, and although it seem to imply the same word, its meaning is still "having no inherent self or characteristics", which points back to the basic Three Characteristics. In its common usage, Atman refers to a "fixed, permanent entity", a soul, hence would detract from Buddha's words, and hence would in this sense *not* be considered a Buddhist philosophical concept. -- <a href="../../../z/h/i/User%7EZhiXing-Bhikkhu_de0b.html" title="User:ZhiXing-Bhikkhu">ZhiXing-Bhikkhu</a> 20:08, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: edits by Usedbook</span></h2>
<p>A couple days ago, Usedbook re-added a couple changes that he had put in place originally towards the beginning of the month. I think they should be removed again, but I wanted to give my reasons before doing so. With regard to nirvana="unbinding", Kukkurovaca, whose Sanskrit, I think, is better than any other regular editors here, has said on <a href="../../../n/i/r/Talk%7ENirvana_987d.html" title="Talk:Nirvana">Talk:Nirvana</a> "Nirvana does not literally mean 'unbinding'". Usedbook says in his edit summary, "extinguishing definition rejected by Siddhartha". What's the source for this? And what does this even mean? How do you reject the meaning of a word? I could say something like, "The Great Extinguishment is not the putting out of a fire," but that wouldn't change the definition of the word extinguishment, especially not if you're giving a literal translation of it into another language. I also take issue with "all beings have non-self", which is grammatically questionable and adds nothing over "all beings have no self." - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 10:17, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm no expert, and Nirvana <i>is</i> a rather widely interpreted word. But I'm pretty certain it <i>originally</i> meant extinguishing, and certainly that's the <i>literal</i> meaning. I think I suggested previously that if the "unbinding" definition has roots in a tradition, we should talk about that as part of that tradition, but certainly it shouldn't be given as the base definition. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 19:26, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Already discussed above.</li>
<li>Already pretty good, though I wonder about the work of art - who else is there? Is it a special moment in Buddhist history (like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Supper_7593.html" title="The Last Supper">The Last Supper</a> is in Christian history)? When was it made? etc. If you recognize more about it, perhaps that could go on the image description page.</li>
<li>Buddhists are praying at the temple - do Buddhists usually/always/occasionally pray at the temple? Are they praying to the statue or near it? What's with all the gold? It looks like the people are holding scepters. There's much more in this picture than I understand.</li>
<li>Sutras? I figured out those were Buddhist reference materials by reading context within the article, but I would mention that in the caption.</li>
<li>These three Buddha images are each different. Are the differences significant? Is there anything else special about these statues? Are they characteristic of a particular branch of Buddhism? Do you suppose they're for sale?</li>

<dd>The Pali cannons started to be translated into Japanese in late 19th century. Japanese Imperial Universities always had Indian Philosophy department and that created sizable population of Sanskrit scholars in Japan. And when I say Sanskrit, I mean all Sanskrit dialect including Pali. The complete translation of Pali cannons was first published somewhere in late 50s. Aum attracted lot of young university science graduates but they didn't attract any people who were engaged in serious academic study of buddhism. English Translation of Pali Cannon published by Pali Text is about 20 volumes and it involved decades of hard work. Aum's claim is total BS. <a href="../../../f/w/b/User%7EFWBOarticle_a3c3.html" title="User:FWBOarticle">FWBOarticle</a> 06:26, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems you're discussing the changes I made (those that appear to be written by a member, although I am not a member). I still can't check whether the full Aum translation is full and whether it is unique, but hope to finish with that someday. One correction: Sanskrit and Pali shouldn't be mixed. Sankrit was the language the educated elite spoke, but simple folks didn't speak it. Shakyamuni taught in Pali, that's important. So the most ancient (and thus reliable) sutras are in Pali. That's why I believe Aum was so interested in Pali sutras (they are harder to obtain and besides, much less scholars know Pali than Sanskrit). As to actual ability to translate, that's another topic. To my knowledge, the group that translated the sutras learned Pali during their Aum period (but I may be wrong, can't check right now). Anyway, Aum had close relations with Ven. Ananga Maitreya and this monk was even called 'translator monk' in Sri Lanka. So, to obtain sutras, learn Pali and translate the Canon to Japanese is still possible, however unbelievable it seems. I know nothing about how hard is to translate from Pali, but if we were talking about translating 20 books from say, German to English, it is entirely possible for a group of five people to do it in 4 years at most. Depends on how well you know the language and how hard-working you are.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Translations of Pali Canon: was it ever translated in full?</span></h2>
<p>To my knowledge, the full Pali Canon has never been translated directly from Pali into any of the modern languages, including English. Can anybody shed light on this fact - is that true? The thing is that I recently learned than Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese new religion (it is known for its subway gas attack in 1995) has translated the Pali Canon into Japanese (and in full). But NatKrause says that the Pali Canon was translated to Japanese even before, but I can't check it. How could it be? Anybody can confirm?</p>

<dd>Didn't the PTS do a full translation to English? And I believe the major Asian languages have had their versions of the canon since ancient times.

<dd>The Pali Canon is also available in Sinhalese, Burmese and Thai. In the Mahayana (Chinese) Canon, is one of the sections on the Agamas, though that is from the Sanskrit translation and *may* differ from the Pali sources. PTS has more or less the full translation, though I believe some of the "smaller texts" (Khuddka Nikaya) is yet to be translated. Furthermore, the Sinhalese, Burmese and Thai translations each had minor differences in terms of their Abhidhamma.--<a href="../../../z/h/i/User%7EZhiXing-Bhikkhu_de0b.html" title="User:ZhiXing-Bhikkhu">ZhiXing-Bhikkhu</a> 20:09, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want to clarify what appears to be a minor confusion on the part of Kukku and ZX-B. "Pali Canon" is a subcategory of "the agamas", i.e. it is specifically the Theravada version. Therefore, the fact that the traditional Mahayana canons have their own versions of the same texts, while very interesting in general, is not relevant to the specific claims that Aum Shinrikyo makes about the Pali Canon. Well, it is not relevant to the literal truth of those claims, although it might put their claims in a different light if there were pre-existing versions that were nearly identical. (And, of course, the Sinhalese, Burmese, and Thai versions that ZhiXing mentions are almost certainly translations of the Pali version, anyway). - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 09:27, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Suggestion: regarding the Buddhism box, I think the entry at the top "terms and concepts," is a redundant piece of human labor that does not well utilize Wikipedia's built-in tools, like ((Category:Buddhist terms)). In other words, rather than building a separate word list, we can just add Category links at the bottom of all these terms. I've begun to do it.

<dd>I've been thinking about this for awhile. Eventually, categories will probably replace all sorts of lists. In the meantime, some people still avoid using categories, so duplicating efforts might not be a bad thing. I think one should feel free to work on one or the other or both. Currently, lists do provide some advantages, primarily that it is easier to edit entries in one action. Suppose we have a list of people, and I want to add the years when each one lived. I can do that in a category by the format [[Category:Ancient Buddhist rock stars|Attila T. Presley (566-593)]] or whatever, but it's a hassle to go through and do that for a bunch of people.

<dd>Well, there's an essential error in the way it's phrased, actually. "Siddharta Gautama" <i>is</i> Sanskrit, no matter what <i>script</i> it's written in. Now, the computer I'm using now can't read the unicode in question, but I'm assuming it's <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanagari.html" title="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>, in which case it's inappropriate simply because Devanagari has no special relation (I don't think) to whatever language Gautama would have spoken, in the first place--it later acquired an intimate relationship to Sanskrit, true, but it's not as though the Buddha spoke Sanskrit either. It's useful to use Sanskrit forms because they're the forms from which multiple prakrit terms derive, but that shouldn't give the language pride of place in discussing Buddhism. So, if that is Devanagari (if it's not, I look pretty silly) it shouldn't be included in <i>any</i> Buddhism articles. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 18:42, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as I'd imagine my signature proves, I'm no opponent to Devanagari. On the other hand, I don't think there are any historical Buddhist communities that have used Devanagari (I may be wrong about this--paleography isn't really my department), which can't be said of Chinese or Japanese. I mean, if someone can put together the unicode for Kharoṣṭhī, or some other such script used in Buddhist texts, I'd be all about throwing that in here. I mean, I'm not stridently opposed to it, because one can make the argument that Devanagari is a tolerably close relative of whatever scripts Indian Buddhists actually used, though there's little visible resemblance between, say, Devanagari and Kharoṣṭhī, which uses rather different shapes and is written in the other direction. (I mean, they're definitely related, but you don't get a sense of the one just by looking at the other.) <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 16:57, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
