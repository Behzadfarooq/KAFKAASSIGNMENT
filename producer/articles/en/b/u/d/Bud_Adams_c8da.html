<p>K.S.

He made a considerable fortune with Adams Resources, and became interested in the prospects of owning a professional football team. In the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> there was not a major professional football team in operation in Texas, despite a level of interest in the sport.</p>

<p>Bud Adams was one of the charter team owners in the former <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a>, which was announced in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_sports.html" title="1959 in sports">1959</a> and played its first games in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960_in_sports.html" title="1960 in sports">1960</a>. He had previously talked with several figures in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>, including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Halas_b12c.html" title="George Halas">George Halas</a> of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> and commissioner <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Bell_fff1.html" title="Bert Bell">Bert Bell</a>, about getting an NFL expansion franchise, but met with frustration and decided to go another direction. He is probably less associated with the formation of the AFL in the mind of the general public than fellow Texan and AFL team owner <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamar_Hunt_30d6.html" title="Lamar Hunt">Lamar Hunt</a>, but was probably almost as crucial to the league's remaining a viable business venture in its early years, as he and Hunt were more financially stable than some of the other early owners.</p>
<p>Adams helped establish the league by fighting and winning the battle with the NFL for LSU's All-American Heisman Trophy winner <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Cannon_b090.html" title="Billy Cannon">Billy Cannon</a>. Particularly crucial to the league's early years was Adams' relationship with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Wismer_6094.html" title="Harry Wismer">Harry Wismer</a>, original owner of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Titans</a>. The New York Titans played in the rotting remains of the old <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo_Grounds_af11.html" title="Polo Grounds">Polo Grounds</a> and were largely either derided or ignored by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a> media, and Adams' help was essential in keeping Wismer's team in business until it could be sold to more financially capable ownership and moved into <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shea_Stadium_9f78.html" title="Shea Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>. Without a New York franchise, U.S. <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">television networks</a> have limited interest in a team sports league, as it is by far the largest media market in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a></p>
<p>Adams' team was the best of the beginning period of the AFL, winning the first two championship games behind the quarterbacking and kicking of former Bears reject <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Blanda_d5f6.html" title="George Blanda">George Blanda</a>, and losing the third in <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudden_death_%28sport%29.html" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a> overtime in what was until that point the longest game of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> ever played, the 1962 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_American_football_championship_games_bce1.html" title="Professional American football championship games">AFL Championship game</a>. His team played in a total of four <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_American_football_championship_games_bce1.html" title="Professional American football championship games">AFL Championship games</a>, and he is a member of the American Football League Hall of Fame.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Adams_c8da.html" title="Edit section: The Houston Oilers and the Astrodome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Houston Oilers and the Astrodome</span></h2>
<p>Adams and the other AFL owners received a tremendous boost in credibility and net worth when the merger of the AFL with and into the NFL was announced in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_in_sports.html" title="1966 in sports">1966</a>, effective with the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_sports.html" title="1970 in sports">1970</a> season. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_in_sports.html" title="1968 in sports">1968</a> Adams moved his team into the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astrodome_3bd9.html" title="Houston Astrodome">Houston Astrodome</a>, which had been, since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_sports.html" title="1965 in sports">1965</a>, the home of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a>. While this took the hot, humid Houston weather during the early part of the season away as a consideration and made Adams' team the first pro football team ever to play its home games in a domed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium.html" title="Stadium">stadium</a>, the Astrodome had several downsides as a venue for the Oilers. Its round shape made for poor sight lines for football. Also, it meant that the seats that should have been the most desirable (and expensive), those near the fifty-yard line, were in fact the farthest from the field of play, while those nearest the action were otherwise-undesirable seats in the end zone. Additionally, it seated only about 50,000 for football and was by the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> the smallest venue in the NFL with regards to seating capacity. Also, Adams chafed at being the Astrodome's "secondary" tenant, but this was unlikely to change as long as the Astros were playing eighty-one home games there and his team was playing eight, and he knew this.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Adams_c8da.html" title="Edit section: Houston vs. Adams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Houston vs. Adams</span></h3>
<p>Adams was initially a hero in Houston for making the city a major-league town, but his popularity tailed off during the Oilers' early NFL years. This was in part due to what was seen as his mishandling of the team. He had a tendency to micromanage the Oilers, which brought him considerable scrutiny especially since he had no background in the sport. For example, he required that any expenditures of $200 or over to be personally approved by him.</p>
<p>However, in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> the Oilers had again risen to football prominence. Had they not been in the same division as one of the greatest teams in the history of the NFL, the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, the Oilers would have almost certainly played in a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> during this time, and probably even won one. As it was, they were nonetheless extremely popular nationwide, especially their <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28sports%29.html" title="Coach (sports)">coach</a>, Adams' fellow Texan <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bum_Phillips_1843.html" title="Bum Phillips">O. A. "Bum" Phillips</a>, who dressed, spoke, and acted much like the popular image of a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranch.html" title="Ranch">rancher</a>, which he in fact was. The Astrodome became known as the "House of Pain," and the Oilers were almost unbeatable there. After the Oilers lost two straight <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Football_Conference_f0dc.html" title="American Football Conference">AFC</a> championship games to the Steelers, Adams fired Phillips. The team soon afterwards became a laughingstock, and most of the Houston sporting public blamed Adams. This era of rotation between mediocrity and disaster was to last several years, but by <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_sports.html" title="1987 in sports">1987</a>, the ship seemed to have been righted again, at least on the field, and the Oilers were to make the AFC playoffs every year from then until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_sports.html" title="1993 in sports">1993</a>, each time losing short of appearing in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>By the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, several NFL teams had new stadiums built largely or entirely with public funding, and several more such deals had been agreed to. These new venues featured amenities such as "club seating" and other potential revenue streams which were not part of the NFL's revenue-sharing arrangements. Adams began to lobby then-Houston mayor <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Lanier_%28politician%29_b982.html" title="Bob Lanier (politician)">Bob Lanier</a> for a new stadium for his team. Lanier disliked Adams intensely, and told him that what had been done for him a decade earlier, which had been financed with bonds to be paid off over thirty years, was enough. With this, Adams again began to shop the team to other cities. He had taken particular notice in the offer that had been made by <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville%2C_Tennessee_0fa5.html" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> to the ownership of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Devils_e3e5.html" title="New Jersey Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> to become the primary tenant of a new <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena.html" title="Arena">arena</a> then under construction in downtown Nashville (and now called the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaylord_Entertainment_Center_3277.html" title="Gaylord Entertainment Center">Gaylord Entertainment Center</a>). While this deal was never to be consummated (Nasvhille eventually received an expansion team, the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Predators_500a.html" title="Nashville Predators">Nashville Predators</a>), Adams wondered what sort of offer might be made to him regarding a venue for his NFL team. After meeting with then-Nashville mayor <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Bredesen_394a.html" title="Phil Bredesen">Phil Bredesen</a> on several occasions, a deal was announced which would bring the Oilers to Nashville effective in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_sports.html" title="1997 in sports">1997</a> season to a new <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadium.html" title="Stadium">stadium</a> (originally called Adelphia Coliseum, now known as <a href="../../../l/p/_/LP_Field_7382.html" title="LP Field">LP Field</a>) to be built across the <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland_River_7ef7.html" title="Cumberland River">Cumberland River</a> from downtown Nashville, largely with city and state funds. Nashville opponents of this arrangement forced the issue to a <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a> vote, which passed easily, with over 57% of those voting in favor of it.</p>
<p>Adams' opponents in Houston were not idle during this time. <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Majority_Whip_3905.html" title="House Majority Whip">House Majority Whip</a> <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_DeLay_86e9.html" title="Tom DeLay">Tom DeLay</a>, whose district included portions of Houston and its suburbs, even introduced a bill in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> banning the move, which eventually did not pass. Lawsuits were filed as well, but all were dismissed in a way favorable to Adams. His immediate problem became having a suitable place to play prior to the completion of the new stadium in Nashville. The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_sports.html" title="1996 in sports">1996</a> "lame duck" season in the Astrodome was a disaster, with crowds so sparse at times that the few in attendance (and watching on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> or listening on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a>) could hear all of the action on the field, including play calling, collisions, and the players talking to one another, even the occasional profanity. In addition, the Oilers' radio network, formerly statewide, was reduced to a single station in Houston and a few new affiliates in Tennessee. All of this was unacceptable to both Adams and the league, and it was announced that the next two seasons would be played at <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Bowl_Memorial_Stadium_9b6b.html" title="Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium">Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium</a> in Memphis while the new Nashville stadium was being completed. Its opening had been forced back a year by the time necessary to get the appropriate enabling measure on the ballot in Nashville. The largest stadium in the Nashville area at the time, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_Stadium_a5d4.html" title="Vanderbilt Stadium">Vanderbilt Stadium</a> on the campus of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_University_3e3f.html" title="Vanderbilt University">Vanderbilt University</a>, seated only 41,000 and was considered inadequate even as a temporary home for anything beyond preseason games.</p>
<p><a name="The_Tennessee_Oilers" id="The_Tennessee_Oilers"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Adams_c8da.html" title="Edit section: The Tennessee Oilers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Tennessee Oilers</span></h2>
<p>The 1997 season in Memphis proved to be almost as disastrous as the prior years in the Astrodome had been. Whether it was out of disappointment at their own city's numerous failures to get professional football in its own right, or their longtime rivalry with and disdain for Nashville was the primary culprit, Memphians showed almost no interest in the Oilers. Nashvillians balked at travelling 210 miles to see "their" team, especially since <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_40.html" title="Interstate 40">Interstate 40</a> between the two cities was undergoing a major reconstruction near Memphis at the time. As a result, the Oilers played before some of the smallest NFL crowds since the 1950s. For many games, there appeared to be more visiting fans than Oiler fans.</p>
<p>Despite this, Adams announced every intention of staying the course in Memphis for two years. However, only one game, the finale against the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, attracted a larger crowd than could have been accommodated at Vanderbilt. Although 50,677 people showed up, the crowd appeared to be composed of nearly two-thirds Steelers fans. Adams was so embarrassed that he scrapped plans to play the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_sports.html" title="1998 in sports">1998</a> season at the Liberty Bowl, and instead opted to play at Vanderbilt after all.</p>
<p>When only four of the eight regular-season home games at Vanderbilt sold out for the 1998 season, it began to appear as if the move of the team was going to be a net loss for all concerned. Also, a major <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado.html" title="Tornado">tornado</a> had hit the downtown Nashville area in the interim, tearing directly through the new stadium construction site and knocking two tower cranes down onto what is now the playing surface, and for a while the timely completion of the new stadium appeared to be in doubt. But superb work by the contractors and some apparent slack time having been built into the construction schedule obviated the need to play any more games at Vanderbilt. Oilers players becoming personally involved in the post-tornado cleanup proved to be a public-relations bonanza for Adams and his team, as did a large charitable contribution made by Adams to relief for the storm's victims. The overall effect of the storm, incredibly, had seemingly been a positive development for Adams and the Oilers. More than a few fans, some of them quite seriously, suggested renaming the team the "Tennessee Twisters".</p>
<p><a name="The_Tennessee_Titans" id="The_Tennessee_Titans"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Adams_c8da.html" title="Edit section: The Tennessee Titans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Tennessee Titans</span></h2>
<p>The following year and the team's arrival at their new stadium was to change almost everything that had occurred in the three previous seasons. (The team had by this time become the only team in NFL history to play four consecutive "home" seasons at four different venues.) Adams announced that the team would henceforth be known as the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Titans_ab07.html" title="Tennessee Titans">Tennessee Titans</a>, that navy blue would be added to the team's color scheme, and that this team would be considered to be the continuation of the former Oilers franchise, with all team records to be considered to be continuous and that there would be a Titans/Oilers Hall of Fame honoring the greatest players from both eras. In fact, Adams' desire to ensure that no NFL team in Houston would revive the Oilers name was thought to be one of the major causes of the delay in announcing a new name for the team; he did not desire the experience which had occurred with the "<a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>" name to be repeated.</p>
<p>The rechristened Titans in their new stadium proceeded to finish the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_sports.html" title="1999 in sports">1999</a> regular season with a 13-3 record but nonetheless qualified for the playoffs only as a wild-card team. In their first-round playoff game against the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Bills_71a1.html" title="Buffalo Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>, they won on a wild, controversial last-minute kickoff return play which the media dubbed the "<a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_City_Miracle_e7ff.html" title="Music City Miracle">Music City Miracle</a>". The kickoff, caught by fullback <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_Neal_ea75.html" title="Lorenzo Neal">Lorenzo Neal</a>, was handed off to tight end <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Wycheck_d3cd.html" title="Frank Wycheck">Frank Wycheck</a>, who then made a lateral pass to wide receiver <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Dyson_bce0.html" title="Kevin Dyson">Kevin Dyson</a>. Dyson ran the ball 75 yards down the sideline while Buffalo's defense had converged on Wycheck on the other side of the field. Many Bills fans contended it was an illegal forward pass, though officials ruled it a lateral and subsequent video analysis backed up the ruling on the field. The team went on to win two subsequent playoff games and appear in its first-ever (and, as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, only) <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> appearance, in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta's</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Dome_ad5b.html" title="Georgia Dome">Georgia Dome</a> losing 23-16 to the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>, having come just one yard short of a touchdown on the game's final play that would have likely sent the game into overtime had the extra point after the touchdown been made. It was one of the most thrilling conclusions in Super Bowl history.</p>
<p>Since the initial season in Nashville the Titans have not done quite as well. The team won the former AFC Central Division the next year but fell short of the Super Bowl; after the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_sports.html" title="2003 in sports">2003</a> season the team advanced as far as the AFC Divisional Playoffs, losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_sports.html" title="2005 in sports">2005</a> was by far the team's worst season since its arrival in Tennessee and it finished with an overall record of 4-12. Adams was again criticized for his decision not to renew the contract of the team's president, returning to that role himself despite continuing to live in Houston and appearing in Nashville generally only on home game days and occasional Titans-related events. Adams is said to have arranged his affairs in such a way as to ensure the team will remain in his family's possession after his death, which appears in no way to be imminent as he has the appearance of a man in remarkably good health for his advanced age.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Adams purchased the rights to operate an <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Arena football">Arena football</a> franchise in Nashville for a reported $4,000,000. He found it impossible at first to negotiate a favorable <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lease.html" title="Lease">lease</a> for the use of the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaylord_Entertainment_Center_3277.html" title="Gaylord Entertainment Center">Gaylord Entertainment Center</a> from that facility's primary tenant and operator, the Nashville Predators. A previous Arena team had been forced by financial losses to leave Nashville and move to Atlanta despite average attendance of over 10,000 per home game and blamed most of this on an unfavorable lease. Adams' bitter memories of being a secondary tenant at the Astrodome caused him to consider briefly either financing the renovation of the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Municipal_Auditorium_25a4.html" title="Nashville Municipal Auditorium">Nashville Municipal Auditorium</a> for use as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indoor_football.html" title="Indoor football">indoor football</a> venue, building an entirely new facility with a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seating_capacity.html" title="Seating capacity">seating capacity</a> of 12,000 or so (dropped when Adams was convinced that the potential $30,000,000 price tag for such a building he had apparently initially been quoted was wildly optimistic), or expanding the Titans' existing indoor practice facility (at "Baptist Sports Park", named for a local <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a>) for use as an Arena venue. Negotiations dragged on, and the <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_Football_League_e313.html" title="Arena Football League">Arena Football League</a> extended his option on the new Nashville franchise at least twice.</p>
<p>By 2004 Adams and the Predators finally hammered out a mutually-acceptable agreement and it was announced that the new <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Kats_813b.html" title="Nashville Kats">Nashville Kats</a> franchise would begin play in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_sports.html" title="2005 in sports">2005</a> Arena season. (The predecessor franchise also continues to operate as the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Force_5526.html" title="Georgia Force">Georgia Force</a>; the current Kats franchise has now reclaimed the Nashville history of the earlier franchise as its own.) Late in 2004 it was announced that <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country</a> <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_McGraw_5bfb.html" title="Tim McGraw">Tim McGraw</a> had bought into the Kats franchise as a minority owner.</p>
