<p>Sorry, I'm not sure what your question is exactly, but creating some links to Aamjiwnaang: A Canadian Community Under Seige from other articles will help, as people will be much more likely to read/improve it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks W. marsh: Sorry. The question was, "Why was your name connected to the name of my contribution?" I didn't see any editing or suggestions or other in-put - just your name. The short larger Q was, will the reading public ever see this contribution? Thanks BW</p>
<p>W. marsh: May I prevail upon you to ask one more Q. Every time I click on "my talk" the reply I get is there is, no "user talk" exists under this name, to create one... But yet, we're using one now. Why is that?</p>
<p>Someone flagged my submission as NPOV, but failed to point out the discrepency. Under the rules as I understood them, anyone who chooses to flag this as NPOV must be clear on the objectional part of the read. Bud Whiteye</p>
<dl>
<dd>I (or rather, my bot) editted the page because it adds a message to all pages that don't have any inbound links, just pointing that out, since most people don't realize that problem. Your talk page didn't exist until I posted here, so that should explain that. As for NPOV, see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>... pages need to be neutral and so on. If someone won't explain what the problem is though, you can remove the tag. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, there is always a certain amount of stress that new editors experience, especially when articles they write are questioned, or even deleted outright. There are certain policies and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">community consensus</a> about how Wikipedia articles should be written. The most important of these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Articles must be written from a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. This is very difficult and almost impossible to implement 100%, but it is a good to strive for neutrality, because if you are obviously biased, your edits will be challanged, and possibly removed.</li>
<li>What you write should be verifiable. Give references. Asserting that one knows something is not enough. This is especially important when one writes about topics that are controversial or disputed.</li>
<li>No original research. And this one may refer to the article Aamjiwnaang: A Canadian Community Under Seige which you wrote. Original research refers to previously unpublished theories, concepts, arguments, interpretations etc. The reason for this is that otherwise Wikipedia may be used as a vehicle for propaganda or advertising, which is contrary to the concept of the encyclopedia.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more, see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a>.<br />

<p>Wow, you sure ask a lot of questions! (just kidding, actually they're all good questions). Wikipedia is owned by the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I'm not an owner, I'm an admin. There are about 1000 admins (probably more by now), though not all of us are active at any one time, and some are more active than others. I do a lot of editing and creating new articles, but I also spend a lot of time with the mop and bucket, cleaning things up, trying to keep things from boiling over when there are disagreements, removing stuff that fails our notability standards. Unfortunately, your article fails our most basic premise, that of <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>. In other words, you set out with an aim of trying to right a wrong, but we're an encyclopedia, not a place for people to try to get others to accept a point of view. If you want to write an article on the Sarnia area's pollution, you might get away with it so long as you remembered to write it from neutral point of view, and you cited your evidence (See our policy at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). We also have several guildelines on "notability", meaning whether or not the subject of an article is of sufficient merit to rate an article. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks again for your response (a quick one; over in a page where I tried to reach all of the editors (I wrote them all) who had concerns. I have only your reply (NPOV) and a sentence that includes "...please don't hesitate to ask." So, I did. I explained that everyone, including the manufacturers hold the view on how polluted Aamjiwnaang and Sarnia are. Then I asked some technical q's to try to be inkeeping with Wiki Policies. Now, this is in "My Page" (Bud Whiteye) can you get this from here?

<dd>Hi, Bud. Your comments seemed to indicate that I had not replied to your question, but I guess I misread what you were trying to say. An Articles for Deletion discussion is for everybody at Wikipedia to chime in with their opinions as to whether or not an article should stay. Unfortunately, although your article would make a good op-ed piece, it isn't an encyclopedia article. An encyclopedia article presents facts, not opinions. Like I said above, if you could write an NPOV article on Pollution in Sarnia (or add it to the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarnia%2C_Ontario_248b.html" title="Sarnia, Ontario">Sarnia, Ontario</a> article as a section, and give us statistics and not the flowery language of your article (which is good writing, I'm not knocking that, it's just not the straightfoward method of writing that we want to see in an encylopedia article), then nobody would mind your doing that. So long as you present links to sites on the web or books or articles which support your thesis. Right now what you have is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, something we can't keep. You also need to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to see what we are looking for as far as verifiability. Am I explaining things to your satisfaction? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:19, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Editor Z told me that since my article is "out there" (Google, Anishenabek News, and so on) it is not OR</i>. I don't know who Editor Z is, but if he/she told you that, they're wrong. Your article has gotten picked up by the Google spider which reads all of Wikipedia articles, but that doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it can stay. It's original research, and violates our policy at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Like I said above, if you rewrite it as a statistical analysis and provide verifiable references, you can keep it. But you cannot write articles promote a point of view. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:45, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for replying late, I didn't see your message, which is completly my fault. Anyways on to explain some of your comments. You mentioned that I'm "advising others that (your) story is up for a 'delete.'" That is not true in the slightest bit, all I did was put down my 2 cents, anyone can agree or disagree with me as much as they want to. Also, please see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, in regards to that comment. I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to say when addressing your writing ability, as a fellow writer, I don't critize anyone's work. The issue with the article really had to due with it's nature of stating opinions and being from a onesided perspective. Please see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, sorry if I missed anything. If you want to contact me press that little talk thing next to my name.

<dd>Don't worry Wikipedia's processing can be confusing, it gets us all at one time.&#160;:) Um, right now, I'm going to look through the article and just point out certain points that really don't confirm to NPOV standards. Don't let this get you down! Seriously, you are a great addition to the project and I would love to help you out more. I'll probably be back online in a few hours.

<dd>I hope that was a joking comment, you should be proud of yourself. Many people on Wikipedia don't make a great first article, look at mine:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wally_%28mascot%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38967481" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wally_%28mascot%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38967481" rel="nofollow">Wally</a>. Um, looking through the article, it would make an excellent argument essay, however over here we have to try to be fair and balanced (not exactly like Fox News&#160;:P), um some quick statements from the article, "So the picture remains as it has for decades, if you live there, you find there are ceaseless hissing sounds from the plants and, smoke and steam billowing upward without end from any direction, no matter where you stand on Aamjiwnaang territory." That statement seems to just not fit in very well, it appeats to be something that would appear in a local newspaper, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a newspaper</a>. Also, I'm noticing nice descriptive, imaginative wording, however, we need to be blunt. That doesn't mean we be straightforward, but we need to be simple yet can use elaborate wording. It's a tough job, but people do it all the time. "The CEOs of these monoliths scurry for answers to leaks and spills only to report that it couldn’t be helped – for so many years that has been the standard. As if a flurry of activity after the fact is a sign of caring – only to show the same report time after time." That statment is <b>very</b> POV, prehaps a better wording could be, "The company's CEOs have attempted to answer all questions, however most residents feel unsatisfied by the response." Not the best, but a little less POV. "Empirical evidence; empirical law appears to show there is no fail-safe means to end the leaks and escapes of toxins, perhaps because of the sheer size of each site. Can the scientific community conclude the same within natural laws as well?" You end here with a question mark, which is awesome to end an essay and make the reader think. However, we need the reader to feel like they have an answer and have gained new knowledge so they can ask answers and go forth. It's giving them the power of knowledge. I know these aren't the best answers, but we can keep chating about this. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 02:59, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, you replied quickly! Everybody has as any shots as they need to really complete an article. About rewriting Aamjiwnaang, there isn't any rule agaisnt it, but keep in mind an AfD debate lasts sometime around five days, so it will closed. Of course, I can put an extension request up there. But, if this article can be rewritten, which I know you can do, then it could be kept.

<dd>Um, to be honest, I'm not sure. But if it gets deleted, it's not the end of the world. I can file a request with <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, and see what happens. I'm going to guess a few days till an admin wonders over to it. Btw, have you ever read <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Confederacy_of_Dunces_7e1c.html" title="A Confederacy of Dunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by John Kennedy Toole? Remember, there are alot of people around here who are willing to help, and if you need help as soon as possible, put {{helpme}} on your talk and say what's wrong. Someone should be there rather soon.

<p>I'm not exactly sure about it being done else somewhere else on here, I'll look into it. About deletion, they wouldn't delete you! You would have to be <b>really</b> bad to be blocked forever.

<dd>I would recommend, copying and pasting your original article, while examing the recommended style of Wikipedia and slowly build upon that article. No one person <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owns</a> an article. It's a big community and we all want to support each other. I think too often we forget there are people behind these words. I know you can contribute well to that article. I think if you know anything else about the town you can definitly add on to it.

<p>Hi, I'm sorry I didn't respond earlier, but I haven't had a chance to edit Wikipedia that much recently.</p>
<p>You don't really need to keep user talk page discussions in one place (usually). Most of the time you can talk to people on their user talk page and they reply to you on yours. But you can also reply to others on your talk page, and they'll see it if they have it on their <a href="../../../w/a/t/Special%7EWatchlist_0b89.html" title="Special:Watchlist">watchlist</a>. I've found that most of the time it's good to reply to people on their own talk pages though. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 12:32, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, the names of user talk pages are of the form 'User talk:Username'. Some people put a link to their talk page in their <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">signatures</a>, but if they don't, you can get to anyone's talk page by clicking their user name (which will take you to the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERPAGE_c347.html" title="WP:USERPAGE">user page</a>) and then the little 'discussion' tab on top of the page. Another way to get there is to type 'User talk:Username' (for example User talk:Ulayiti for me) into the bit of the address bar of your browser that normally has the article name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to put a link to your talk page on your signature, you can do it by adding something like <i>[[User talk:Bud Whiteye|(talk)]]</i> into the signature field in your <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">preferences</a>. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 14:45, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can create an external link by typing in the web address (remember to start it with 'http://', or else it won't work) and a name for the link inside single square brackets, separated by a space.
