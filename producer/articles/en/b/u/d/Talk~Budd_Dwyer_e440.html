<p><i>In 1995, rock band Filter had a hit with the song "Hey Man, Nice Shot", which, although not explicitly mentioning Dwyer, was clearly about his suicide.</i></p>

<dd>Looks like the discrepancy has been fixed by simply stating, "A number of television stations throughout Pennsylvania..." However, what might have accounted for the discrepancy in the first place is that at least one station in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youngstown%2C_Ohio_46da.html" title="Youngstown, Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio</a> covered the news conference, thus would not count as a "Pennsylvania station". (I believe it was <a href="../../../w/k/b/WKBN_6d6c.html" title="WKBN">WKBN</a>, but am not sure enough of this to edit the article.) The Youngstown station opted to edit the footage for broadcast. However, Cleveland station <a href="../../../w/e/w/WEWS_0d37.html" title="WEWS">WEWS</a> aired the footage from fellow ABC affiliate WPVI without editing, but with a warning. Meadville is in the Youngstown market, and Cleveland is close enough for the story to be of local interest there as well. -- <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwissCelt_5ca3.html" title="User:SwissCelt">SwissCelt</a> 23:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill Smith was the person who arrainged the crime and then blamed Budd. Smith and his wife were the only ones who provided first hand evidence aganst Dwyer.

<p>i find this guy a real star he seems to me to have been fitted up by people around him and was unable to prove he wasnt guilty so maybe he committed fraud but he still had a sense of humour calling a press conference to shoot yourself an "update on the situation" is hilarious maybe i've got a sick sense of humour but who doesnt agree with me that this guy was one courageous man r.i.p BUDD</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a sight probem with the sentence <i>Thinking that someone in the crowd might attempt to thwart him, Dwyer put the gun barrel into his mouth and pulled the trigger, in front of five television news cameras.</i> Since Mr. Dwyer committed suicide and there's no way to ask him what he was thinking before pulling the trigger the phrase <i>Thinking that someone in the crowd might attempt to thwart him,</i> should be struck as subjective. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbean_391f.html" title="User:Wjbean">Wjbean</a> 23:54, 2005 Apr 21 (UTC)</dd>

<p>pmj. It seems that a powerful <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> ethic pervaded Dwyer's actions. In the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">West</a>, we often think of suicide as an act of cowardice, running away from responsibility. But this man, wrongfully dishonoured and faced with an unbeatable enemy, decisively proved that he had guts -- if not as <a href="../../../s/e/p/Seppuku.html" title="Seppuku">literally</a> as his oriental counterparts. Certainly his act was more powerful (and dare I suggest, graceful?) than jail and trials and retrials and eventual death in obscurity. Budd Dwyer was, in my opinion, a brave and noble man; and I take some solace in the knowledge that the unusual video footage of his last seconds will keep him in the public consciousness for many years to come. pmj 14:06, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why in the hell is it called the "ultimate act of cowardice"? I'm 99.9% sure Wikipedia doesn't call OTHER suicides this. Yeah, he was found guilty, but saying it's an act of cowardice is an opinion. Just say he shot himself in the head.24.250.68.193 02:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"<i>In late 1986, Dwyer was charged as having agreed to accept a related kickback of $300,000. Dwyer never actually received any money and some suspect that this was an elaborate scam by Torquato's attorney, William Smith, to skim a supposed bribe.</i>" - is there a source of this quite bold assertion? An authoritative source that absolves Dwyer and damns the people who he held to blame? And does his conviction still stand?

<p>based on the video of the incident I've seen, Dwyer's speech ends with "so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me." One explanation would be that the video I saw was edited, but it could be that the speech text in the article is taken from his prepared notes, and he never got around to reading the last paragraph.

<p>When exactly was the press conference? The article notes that the conference was held on January 22, but does not mention a specific time during the day. The article also says Dwyer died at 11:31 a.m. at Harrisburg Hospital, but does not note a date. I'm wondering if doctors kept Dwyer alive through the night, or if the conference was simply held very early in the day with Dwyer dying hours or minutes after being shot.</p>
<p>--I would almost assume that he died minutes after. He was probably transported to the hospital and called very shortly after. With the caliber of weapon and the blood loss, I can't imaging that he would have survived. If he was alive on arrival of EMS, he probably died on the way in.</p>
<p>--Besides artificial life support, there's really no way to keep someone alive after they've painted half their brains on the ceiling. When someone is shot in the brain, it is not the bullet that instantly kills them, its the shock wave it sends out. But rest assured, he was dead when he closed his eyes after hitting the floor.</p>

<p>The way this article is written with regards to the live coverage makes it sounds like there was absolutely no chance for the stations to cut him off. However it sounds like there was probably a not insignificant amount of time, perhaps at least 30 seconds between the time when he took the gun and the time he shot himself. While obviously the people broadcasting the press conference might not have been expecting the need to suddenly cut the feed and so perhaps were not ready/paying attention, I would assume they could have easily cut off the feed if they had wanted to and were on the gun so to speak. Obviously footage of him with the gun would still have been broadcast but it sounds like the actual suicide could have been cut off. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 12:24, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a serious problem with the way the article continues to imply that the cameras were sending a live feed back to the tv stations which was being broadcast live to the public. I can find no documentation of this. The cameras were on obviously, but this was not being shown live, in real time, to the public. I'd like someone to provide evidence that it was.

<p>Thanks, Kestenbaum, for the edit but I have more trouble with the immediate next part under "Aftermath." It says "A number of television stations throughout Pennsylvania carried the press conference live via feed from one of the five news cameras present, airing Dwyer's suicide before a mid-day audience without the chance of editing. Due to a major snowstorm throughout Pennsylvania that day, many home-bound school-aged children witnessed the suicide live on television." I still want to see the proof that one of those cameras was sending a live feed back to a tv station WHICH WAS SHOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN REAL TIME, thus allowing all those snow-bound kids to see it. Can anyone name a tv station which was showing the live feed as it happened? Any documented evidence? Samclem 00:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't give you such evidence; in fact, to the best of my recollection, it <i>wasn't</i> live. I seem to remember that footage from the shooting was aired on newscasts at noon, 5, and 6 pm... not live. My recollection coincides with WPXI's By Williams' statement that he chose to air the shooting at noon. Were it live, the choice would be to cut away (if there were a choice, that is). -- <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwissCelt_5ca3.html" title="User:SwissCelt">SwissCelt</a> 02:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, am I allowed to go in and change the language in that section? Carefully, of course. I mean, unless someone has proof, then the wiki article gives out incorrect information. Samclem 19:58, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just wanted to know how disgusting the scene is. I mean does he shoot his head clean off or what?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's pretty horrific. No, his head does not come off. Rather, he falls to the ground, and blood spills out of his nose covering his mouth, neck, and clothes. The blood flow out of his nostrils is like two kitchen faucets letting out water, and it continues like that for at least 10 seconds. 21:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, though I think it's fair that people have access to a text description so they can decide whether or not to watch this disturbing piece of footage. Just to add to the above description, events move too fast on the film for one to see too much graphic detail of the actual gunshot (the photos are more graphic in this regard though as noted in the article they are all black and white). The disturbing part of the video is that Dwyer is clearly still alive as he crumples to the floor, and as the camera zooms in for a closeup of his face, you can see the moment of his death where the "lights go out" for all intents and purposes. That IMO is more disturbing than the rest of it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was city editor of the Erie, Pa., Morning News at the time. The Times Publishing Company owned our paper and the Erie Daily Times, which was the afternoon paper. We shared the same office. The Daily Times ran the photo of Dwyer at the instant the gun went off in his mouth. It ran on Page 1, on top of the fold. No one could miss it. The photo can still be found with any search of the internet. That evening when I came to work, the telephone rang nonstop for three hours before we cut off the calls. Each caller was outraged that the photo had run at all, much less on Page 1. I apologized repeatedly. It took very little thought for us on the Morning News to decide to run the photo of Dwyer reaching into the envelope to get the gun rather than even showing it.
