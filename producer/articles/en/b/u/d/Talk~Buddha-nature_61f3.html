<p>Stephen sent the following to me by email out of concern for page size; I've archived old discussion and am pasting the email here:</p>
<p>Dear Kukkurovaca,</p>
<p>You may notice that I have deleted your recent addition to the Buddha-nature entry in Wikipedia speaking of Buddha-nature as a "strategy". As I could only make a brief comment due to storage space in the discussion section, I thought I owed you the courtesy of an explanation before the matter devolves into a Wiki-war.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I mentioned in my emailed response, it's best to keep discussion about changes to article content on the Talk pages, because you don't owe me any courtesies (or at least, this isn't a matter of courtesies), but if there's a dispute regarding content, it's of utmost important that we be transparent about the nature of the dispute to both each other and the broader community of editors. If storage limits are approached, simply archive old material. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK, I shall try to archive material if the page reaches capacity again – I was not aware then that such was possible. Courtesy may be old-fashioned, but it is still something to be valued. While it may be desirable to discuss openly the points I raised in my private email to you, nevertheless it was rather discourteous of you to publish it without my permission, and only inform me after the event, since I would have chosen to express myself rather differently. Because you chose to publish a private email without prior permission with your comments added, some of waht I say below will, unavoidably, be of a personal nature at times. I apologize if they give you offense but you only have youself to blame. NB: I am not interested in wasting time over a lengthy logomachy, so after making the points below, I would like to return to the specifics of the Wikipedia entry on "Buddha-nature"--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Basically, the problem with your addition is that it is a quasi-personal point of view not based on any direct knowledge of what the texts themselves say.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This really has nothing to do with personal POV; and while I have not read <i>all</i> the texts that deal with the question of Buddha-nature, this does not mean I have read none; I have some experience with the Lankavatara, for example, and I can draw on a general background with the academic study of Buddhism and eastern philosophy. However, this really shouldn't be about personal credentials or motivations, but about the issues. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 23:06, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not very evident that you have any great familiarity with the essential primary sources which include the Tathāgata<i>-garbha-sūtra</i>, the <i>Mahāyāna-mahāparinirvāna-sūtra</i>, the <i>Srī-mālā-devi-sūtra</i>, the <i>Angulimālīya-sūtra</i>, the <i>Anūnatva-apūrnatva-nirdesa</i>, the <i>Mahābherika-sūtra</i> and the <i>Ratna-gotra-vibhāga</i>. Without that familiarity, you must rely upon questionable secondary sources dealing with the <i>Buddha-dhātu</i> or <i>Tathāgata-garbha</i> doctrine. I say this because I can assure you, with a fairly high degeree of certainty based on personal knowledge, that very few scholars working in English do have the necessary first-hand acquaintance with the primary sources in any great measure. The late and syncretic <i>Lankāvatāra-sūtra</i> is valueless in this instance since it does not even use the term "<i>Buddha-dhātu</i>", which you should know if you had read it in Sanskrit. It talks about "<i>Buddhatā</i>" – which is quite different, though regretably the latter term is sometimes conflated with <i>Buddha-dhātu</i> via the English translation as "Buddha-nature". So it is really a question of personal credentials – because the scope of those credentials must inform an understanding of the issues. Your motivations must remain a matter of surmise.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You should also be very wary of secondary material in English since most scholars have not read the root texts either and/or rely too much on Tibetan (ie. Gelukpa) doxology.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you're actually trying to claim that all English-language scholarship has cooties, I think we're going to have some broader problems, too--while I'm no thoroughgoing apologist for the West as the source of all valid knowledge, the anglophone scholarly community has a track record for method and especially for rigor that is generally better than the East when it comes to religious studies, since the West's secularist tradition has provided, in general, better mediation of sectarian commitments. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry my command of colloquial American is sadly deficient, so I have absolutely no idea what "cooties" are. Anyway, obviously I was not making assertions about English-language scholarship in general, but only that relating, in this instance, to the <i>Buddha-dhātu</i> matter. You are quite mistaken if you think that all members of the anglophone scholarly community in Buddhist consistently display the methodology and rigour you find so praiseworthy -- I suggest, for example, that you look at books by Jeffrey Hopkins and his proteges. I am very familiar with Japanese (and some Chinese) scholarship and I can assure you that it is often every bit as rigorous and non-sectarian as you may wish, if not more so -- the authors I mention below are excellent examples.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is however a large amount of thorough work available in Japanese, especially that by Jikido Takasaki and Masahiro Shimoda, resulting from decades of reseach on the whole range of Buddha-dhatu material. I would particularly direct you to Takasaki's "Nyoraizoshiso no keisei" [The formation of the Tathagata-garbha concept] (Shunjusha 1974). If one wants, as is desirable, to adopt a neutral point of view, then surely one should report, though not necessarily endorse, what the texts themselves say about the matter.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, though I don't yet see how this relates to my changes. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry to be blunt about this, but it does relate to your changes – without having read recent ground-breaking research based on the primary sources, unfortunately mostly unavailable in English, your knowledge is necessarily insufficient to qualify you to make an informed addition to the entry. Your replacement amendment is even more confused and inaccurate than before – I hope to deal with that in due course.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that this is difficult for you since you do not, I believe, read Tibetan or Chinese - though this problem may be ameriorated sometime in the next couple of years with the publication of translations I have prepared of the MNPS based on the Tibetan and the Faxian versions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I do not read Tibetan or Chinese--nor do the vast majority of Wikipedia readers. Thus, while it is no problem for you to appeal to texts unavailable or scarce in English translation, I think the burden of exposition is upon you to make clear what information in the text is pertinent; I, of course, assume a similar burden when appealing to Sanskrit texts that are unavailable or scarce in English. If you have translations that are going to publication, this should be no special difficulty for you. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But perhaps the vast majority of Wikipedia readers also realize that it is unwise to post entries concerning matters of which they have insufficient knowledge.

<p>While it is true that one could say that the Buddha-nature doctrine is a strategy, one would then have to apply the term to all Buddhist doctrines. If you want to retain "strategy" in this explanation, then, in the interests of complete neutrality, could you please apply the same term wherever you explain "emptiness", "interdependent arising" and a host of other concepts&#160;? It is interesting to note that for the proponents of the Buddha-dhatu / Tathagata-garbha doctrine, and perhaps for Yogacarins (viz. the Three Turnings of the Wheel), the Madhyamika-style concept of intrinsic emptiness is a "strategy" for those who are unable to understand the true import of the Buddha's teachings.</p>
<dl>
<dd>From the standpoint of religious studies, all doctrinal choices <i>are</i> strategic, and they are espoused by people with particular interests to serve and problems to solve, not to mention assumptions bounding their viewpoints. I'm not going to go and use the word "strategy" everywhere that the term "emptiness" occurs, for example, but emptiness is, of course, a strategic concept with specific uses and applications, just as any other concept or doctrine is, and there's nothing problematic with discussing its strategic uses. Also, to speak of the strategic value of doctrines from a secular standpoint is not the same as to speak of the (sectarian) upayic character of doctrines within the Buddhist traditions, or of the use of classification of upaya as a polemic device between Buddhist traditions. And of course it's pertinent to talk about all these uses of upaya--speaking of which, I think Wikipedia's article on that topic could use some considerable expansion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I had erroneously understood you to be using "strategy" as an equivalent to --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)upāya.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I should be clear that I do not describe Buddha-nature as a strategy in any negative sense (nor do I think "strategy" has any negative implications in commonsense English); I think it's a bona fide and interesting attempt to wrestle with the consequences of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatta.html" title="Anatta">anatta</a> doctrine in Buddhism, as a Nagarjunian account of emptiness is also a bona fide and interesting attempt, and ditto the <a href="../../../p/u/d/Pudgalavada.html" title="Pudgalavada">pudgalavada</a>. I happen to find one of these more interesting than the others on a personal level, as I imagine you do, but they're all equally interesting for the standpoint of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<p>Anyway, regarding the two problems that you think the Buddha-dhatu doctrine addresses, the first betrays a complete misunderstanding of the nature of Buddha-dhatu. The Buddha-dhatu is never connected textually to the matter of karma and its continuity -- the problem just never arises. You seem to be confusing this with the Yogacara concept of the alaya-vijñana, adumbrated by the Sautrantika bija theory, which was indeed a "strategy" for dealing with problems of continuity, or else with the ever-popular "pudgala" theory. The whole point of the Buddha-dhatu concept is that it is not a personal bearer of karma.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You assume that the question of the subject of karma is unrelated to the question of the subject of enlightenment, which is naive. However, you're right that the two should not be <i>confused</i>, and perhaps my language was insufficiently precise on this point. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I cannot see how you could rationally derive your comment from my assertion. Of course, karma is related to the question of enlightenment, but I repeat: it does not figure as a issue, implicit or explicit, for the proponents of the Buddha-dhātu or the Tathāgata-gabha doctrines. Read my entry on the development of the Mahāyāna-Mahāparinirvana-sutra for some information on this matter – though I could add more concerning the influence of the Lokottaravādin theory of the docetic nature of the Buddha. Moreover, another facet I have not touched on is the role of Indian medical theory that is clearly evident in development of the Buddha-dhātu doctrine in the MPNS.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for your second point, the idea of a "metaphysical basis" for enlightenment has a very long history in Buddhism and may not have arisen merely as a result of difficulties some people felt. As I mentioned elsewhere, there seems to be good prima facie evidence that teachings attributed to the Buddha in the agamas and related early texts do not deny the existence of some kind of "metaphysical" atman - look for example at the story of the youths, the so-called Baddhavaggiya (Vin i.23).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, here enter into a controversial domain; I have no problem discussing the possibility of an early metaphysical basis for englightenment, but I don't see how this obviates the role of interpretive problems with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatta.html" title="Anatta">anatta</a> in the generation of this doctrine, along with a number of others. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>In that sense, you may be correct.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a tension between two polarities in this and other areas that date back to the earliest days of the Buddhism and it is difficult to determine which should take priority. I am particularly thinking of the tensions between the forest-dwellers and the sedentary monastic dwellers, the role of dhyana and prajña in nirvanic liberation, and so forth. On balance, I get the feeling that one set of doctrines were favoured by the forest-dwellers who were able to specialize in dhyana and another by the vihara-dwellers who had to rely more on prajña and non-meditative discursive methods. There is textual evidence that the Buddha-dhatu and Tathagata-garbha doctrines originated amongst the wandering forest-dwellers. Since the literary material left by the forest-dwellers is, understandably, less than that of the sedentary vihara-dwellers, one is sometimes led to think that the literary products of the viharas are normative. Given that the Buddha himself favoured the forest-dwelling life-style, I would put my money on the forest-dwelling angle as the more authentic - but that's just my opinion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think we're heading into squidgy waters on this point possibly in the direction of original research (not to mention questionable original research)...but I also don't think this is especially pertinent to the present conversation, so I shan't worry too much about it. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a></dd>

I don't know whether they teach this to undergradutes in your part of the world, but it is what we call a hypothesis, and I have also clearly indicated here that some aspects of my assertions are speculative, personal opinion. Moreover, the idea that the forest-dwellers and the monastery dwellers had different agendas and specialities is hardly original or questionable. Try looking at the relevent work by Reginald Ray, Paul Harrison, Tilleman Vetter, Bronkhorst, Gregory Schopen among others. If their work is "questionable", then I am glad to be in such distinguished company.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 19:31, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I shall certainly take your more pertinent comments into considerations for further review; however, I do caution you against associating secondary texts with a reduction in accuracy; I'll take a rigorously scholarly secondary text over a questionable interpretation of primary text any day, and I believe that should be (and is) the standard for Wikipedia as well. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 23:06, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Good question, Sebastian! But difficult to answer! Briefly: in the longest of all the Buddhist "tathagata-garbha" sutras - the "Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra" - there is no apparent difference in usage of the two terms, "Buddha-dhatu" (usually, although not perhaps best, translated as "Buddha-nature") and "tathagata-garbha". The two expressions are effectively used by the Buddha as synonyms in this vast scripture. Texts such as the "Srimala Sutra" and the "Tathagata-garbha Sutra" indicate that the "tathagata-garbha" is the pure Buddha-element within each being BEFORE IT HAS BEEN FULLY REVEALED or DISCLOSED to that being - in other words, it is still covered up (hidden by all the mental negativities of selfish desire, hatred and delusion, etc.). I am not sure that the Mahayana Buddha (as opposed to later commentators) made any major distinctions between "Buddha-dhatu" and "tathagatagarbha". As far as I know, the "Lankavatara Sutra" does not mention "Buddha-dhatu", but does speak of the "tathagata-garbha" as "Nirvana". It also states (may I quote this in German from Golzio's excellent translation?): "Der reine Geist ist der Tathagatagarbha, der von Natur aus hell leuchtet" ("it is the pure mind which is the Tathagata-garbha, which by its nature shines brightly"). My impression is that when the Buddha speaks of "Tathagata-garbha" or "Buddha-dhatu" he is essentially referring to the same thing; but later scriptures apparently do make a distinction, the details of which are not fully known to me. Sorry I am rather ignorant regarding later treatises and commentaries, etc. Maybe a more informed person (such as the excellent Wikipedian named "Munge", who knows much more about later Buddhism than I do!) can give you fuller info. I hope so! All the best to you. Thanks for the interesting query. - Tony (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 00:10, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Best source I've found detailing the relationship between Buddha-nature and tathagatagarbha is in the early chapters of Sallie King's book <i>Buddha Nature</i>, which translates and comments on much of the <i>Buddha Nature Treatise</i>. Stephen Hodge points out they are not identical; and I quite agree, although ("identity" and "difference" in Buddhism is potentially misleading). My current understanding is that in the Yogacara-Tathagatagarbha literature (including the Buddha Nature Treatise), which indeed came some years after the early Tathagatagarbha literature (such as the <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_Sutra_e3d8.html" title="Nirvana Sutra">Nirvana Sutra</a>), tathagatagarbha is an attribute of Buddha-nature; and that this is roughly equivalent to saying that the ability to practice, to transform, to apprehend thusness, and to embody thusness is an attribute of the Buddha. Eventually, I will get around to untangling the leaves and branches if soneone else doesn't get to it first.</dd>

<p>Actually, I did not say that they were <i>not</i> identical in connotation. My impression is that each term was first used by seperate groups to denote the same thing. At some time, memebers of these two groups seem to have merged, so that both terms can be found in the same text, such as the MPNS, as stated synonyms. Part of the problem with discussions on this topic is the lack of exactitude with the terminology. When I write, with some reservations, "Buddha-nature", I am assuming <i>buddha-dhaatu</i> as the underling Sanskrit term. Matters get muddled when talking about Buddha-nature, especially from second-hand Chinese sources, is that other Sanskrit terms may have been used such as <i>buddhatva</i>. It is therefore possible that some usages of "Buddha-nature" can be differentiated from <i>tathaagata-garbha</i>, but less probably in the case of <i>buddha-dhaatu</i> and <i>tathaagata-garba</i> as far as used in such texts as the MPNS.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 01:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My mistake; I jumped to conclusions based on your correct diagnosis of the serious problems with the article on <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tathagatagarbha_doctrine.html" title="Tathagatagarbha doctrine">Tathagatagarbha doctrine</a>. I thought that your remarks on the material were spot on. (With the exception that, regarding methodology, it is provenance, <i>not</i> status as a professional nor cleric, that is deterministic on Wikipedia, as well as in any academy worthy of its name, and even within many Buddhist traditions. Of course, funding can be deterministic in providing the opportunity to demonstrate provenance. Still, it's not always so.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some points on the current matter (and please note that while I am not fluent, I am not entirely incompetent at translation). I am talking about <i>fo xing</i>, which often, but not always refers to Buddhadhatu. I am also talking about <i>ru lai zang</i>, which refers to tathagatagarbha. It is my understanding that Ogawa Ichijo sees some equivalence among <i>garbha</i>, <i>dhatu</i>, and <i>gotra</i>; but that Shinoda Masashige and Takasake Jikido beg to differ. The <i>Buddha Nature Treatise</i> (BNT) presents tathagatagarbha as an aspect of Buddha nature, along with several other aspects; see Sallie King, <i>Buddha Nature</i>, p40-56. For the author of the BNT tathagatagarbha is roughly equal to alayavijnana. In fact, the <i>zang</i> (藏) in ru lai zang is a storehouse.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to tathagatagarbha, Buddha-nature has other aspects such as namelessness, birthlessness, and nonreality (not to be confused with the fact that in the syncretic literature Buddha nature truly exists [<i>bu yu</i>]) There are also three natures (xing), discriminating, relative, and true; and moreover there are three causes that I'll leave for another time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You caution me about using "secondary" sources. Matsumoto Shiro makes the case that it is these very concepts of BN and tathagatagarbha—<i>especially</i> as expressed in the MPNS—are <i>themselves</i> most secondary, even that they are "not Buddhist". Sallie King rebuts that they are "impeccably Buddhist"; I fear you won't like her reasoning, though, namely, Buddha nature is Buddhist becuase the literature you seem to consider "secondary" is actually true to the earlier tradition; the interpretations of these terms presented in the Yogacara-Tathagatagarbha literature (such as the BNT, the Mahayana Awakening of Faith, and the <i>Lankavatara</i>) are free of atman. (King is especially convincing on the crucial point of that literature's <i>atmaparamita</i>; the perfection of self turns out to be the perfection of actualizing <i>sunya</i>.) All this and much more in <i>Pruning the Bodhi Tree</i> and <i>Buddha Nature</i>. Both authors make extremely strong arguments; there are also flaws in both that, while serious, do not in my opinion detract from their main lines of reasoning. My impression is that it is not entirely possible to refute either author without making some embarrassingly wrong assertion. Thus I cannot resolve the matter but think it is vital that any article on the topic of Buddha Nature should cover the current territory. The several Japanese scholars who are involved in recent critiques of Buddha-nature cannot simply be dismissed, nor can Ms. King.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I realize it is dangerous for me to make these assertions to someone who's studied the MPNS so thoroughly. The influence of the MPNS cannot be denied. The doctrine of the universality of Buddha nature, and the implications of Tao Sheng's ouster and reinstatement cannot be overestimated, with respect to later developments in Chinese Buddhism, and indeed in the contemporary Buddhist scene.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That said, it seems to me to be equally dangerous to assume that the tathagatagarbha literature (MPNS, T. Sutra, <i>Srimala</i>...) was unequivocally the primary source and ultimate authority on Buddhism's attitude toward the atman. Kalupahana makes the case (in several books, I think; the one I'm sure of is <i>Buddhist Psychology</i>) that the Nikaya literature, the Mahdyamaka, and the Yogacara are more similar than they are different. And the Nikaya literature did not stop influencing later forms of Buddhism. The Chinese--with their preexisting affinity for "wu wei" (so much like anatman) and "wu" (so much like sunya) did not simply let <i>atman</i> stand. The influence of the <i>Awakening</i> and <i>Lankavatara</i> were considerable. A better argument might be that the Japanese resurrected <i>atman</i> in the form of an aguably tertiary <i>hongaku shiso</i> doctrine, also closely associated with the Japanese conception of Buddha nature--you might find support for that from some who are more or less in Matsumoto's camp.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I will risk the following quote from King (<i>Buddha Nature</i>, p14): "The <i>Mahaparinirvana-sutra</i>...speaks of Buddha nature in so many different ways that Chinese scholars created a variety of lists of types of Buddha-nature that they discerned in the course of their studies of the text". For this assertion, King cites Grosnick's dissertation, <i>Dogen's View of the Buddha-Nature</i> pp128ff. I have not chased that down, but it seems to me that if Buddha nature has multivalent significance in the MPNS, I cannot help but wonder if every such valence is entirely equivalent to tathagatagarbha.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your response. You have raised a number of issues, some of which are not directly relevent to the question in hand. Moreover, I think that some of these issues, particularly those connected with the "Critical Buddhism" movement, would require very extensive discussion for which these Discussion pages are probably not the best medium.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, as for the problem concerning the equivalence of <i>buddha-dhātu</i> and <i>tathāgata-garbha</i>, I feel that your understanding has a certain methodological defect. As you may know, there two ways of dealing with texts that are relevent here: diachronic and synchronic. By quoting the BNT, the LAS and other works, you are conflating differing doctrinal and conceptual systems that need to be dealt with separately. In other words, one first needs to look at each text on its own terms, without reading back into each one ideas that were not current at the time of its compilation. Thus, statements in the BNT are quite irrelevent to an understanding of what the compilers of the MPNS intended. Moreover, in the case of extended texts like the MPNS, it is also necessary to distinguish the different compositional strata – there are at least 8 of these in the case of the extended Dharmaksema version of the MPNS. It is possible that some Chinese scholars thought there were a variety of nuances in the usage of <i>buddha-dhātu</i> in the MPNS, but those distinctions are likely to be a product of Chinese ideas since I have been unable to find any such nuances in the MPNS. The MPNS itself clearly states that <i>buddha-dhātu</i> and <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> are identical in meaning – one can even find them used interchangeably in the same paragraph. Moreover, in this respect, it should be noted that the term <i>buddha-dhātu</i> is first found in the MPNS so it would reasonable to assume that the compilers did know what they intended by the term and knew what they were doing when they identified it with the <i>tathāgata-garbha</i>. The subsequent history of the two terms after the classical <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> sutras, in the various syncretic texts such as the LAS. the BNT and others, needs to be carefully examined and evaluated. It may be that they do distinguish the two terms but I am not convinced.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You mention a certain "Shinoda Masashige" – do you mean Shimoda Masahiro, the author of the major study in Japanese on the MPNS&#160;? If so, I think you have misread his views, which in fact coincide with mine, that the two terms had disparate origins but were brought together as synonyms within the MPNS. As for Takasaki, I have most of his books and articles though I do not recollect any statements distinguishing the two concepts – couild you supply a reference, please&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You write "you caution me about using "secondary" sources" but you seem to have completely misunderstood my meaning – in fact, I wrote "second-hand", not "secondary". By "second-hand", I meant native Chinese sources not based on any contact with, or understanding of, the original Sanskrit source material. Familiarity with native Chinese Buddhist materials should make the extent of this problem very evident – much of the commentorial and exegetical material produced by native medieval Chinese scholars, with a few exceptions, on Indian Buddhist texts is meaningless for a proper understanding of these texts in their original Indian contexts, though they may have intrinsic value for our understanding of how they understood or misunderstood Buddhist doctrines.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You next introduce Matsumoto Shiro and the Critical Buddhism movement and suggest that they "cannot simply be dismissed". Indeed, they cannot be dismissed because their version of Buddhism exihibits serious methodological flaws including a profound lack of understanding or ignorance of the historical development of the early Buddhist canon and the doctrines contained in it. They also seem rather arrogant in their assumaption that they alone can determine what is and is not authentic Buddhism. This discussion is perhaps not the best vehicle for a detailed refutation of their many and egregious misconceptions, but you should also realize that several of these people also have a highly politicized agenda and also, in the case of Matsumoto Shiro, the possibility of psychological unbalance going by the extraordinary correspondence from him reproduced by Tsuda Shinichi in his recent book on the <i>Alaya</i>. Perhaps you should write a Wiki entry on the Critical Buddhist movement and we can take it from there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You mention "<i>atman</i>" several times. The <i>atman</i> of which religio-philosophical system&#160;? Unless one defines what the term means, how can one make definitive statements about the significance of the term in such texts as the MPNS&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You also say that "the Nikaya literature, the Madhyamaka, and the Yogacara are more similar than they are different. And the Nikaya literature did not stop influencing later forms of Buddhism". Possibly, but which elements of the Nikayas do you think are meant here, since it has long been recogized (but seldom appreciated by others) that there are several major contradictory and incompatible strands in the Nikayas, such as those implied by the different paths and goals of <i>ceto-vimutti</i> and <i>paññā-vimutti</i>. Normative Buddhism derived from the Nikayas studiously ignores or fails to account satisfactorily for any inconvenient statements. There are many passages in the Nikayas that entirely corroborate or are completely compatible with the doctrines of the MPNS and other <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> texts – indeed, one might argue that their position is actually closest to the oldest stratum of the Nikayas. You might like to consider the verse at the end of DN 11, which also crops up elsewhere in the Nikayas in several versions. Again what is the Buddha said to have exclaimed in the key accounts of his "enlightenment"&#160;? <i>Amatam adhigatam</i> – "[I have] realized immortality". What do you think these two passsges signify if read in juxtaposition&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, though not a major point of contention, you also mention "the Chinese--with their preexisting affinity for <i>wu wei</i> ...". This is an example of the dangers of a synchronic approach since you are, presumably, using the term in its later Confucianized sense – in classical Daoist texts it actually means "not deeming X to be Y". But I cannot understand why you claim that <i>wu-wei</i>, even in its later connotation, is "so much like anatman".

</dl>
<p>1) Shinoda is not likely the same as Shimoda. King. (who here takes "Buddha-nature" as an English cognate of <i>fo xing</i>) p173-4 cites Shinoda Massashige as author, e.g., of "Bussho to buddhatva", IBK 11 March 1963; "Ogawa...holds that we can safely take <i>Buddha nature</i> to have one meaning rather than several; namely the term <i>tathagatagarbha</i> and its equivalents. Shinoda, on the other hand, sees the <i>dhatu</i> and <i>gotra</i> groups as the standard bases for the "Buddha nature" translation, with <i>garbha</i> and the remaining terms as exceptions to these standards...Takasaki ["Dharmata, Dharmadhatu, Dharmakaya, and Buddadhatu--Structure of the Ultimate Value in Mahayana Buddhism," IBK 14, March 1966]...agrees with Shinoda's view..."</p>
<p>2) Even if one does not agree with the above, you seem to be amenable to the idea there was a revision or reinterpretation, yes? The immediate issue is whether such reinterpretation included some nuances of difference between the two concepts, or not. If the Chinese saw <i>fo xing</i> as multivalent, can we not agree that is significant? If the reinterpreters had subsequent influence (say, on Huayen, on Chan; say, by means of the <i>Awakening</i>), can we agree that is significant in a diachronic sense?</p>
<p>3) Did the revision go off on a new tangent, or had it an element of <i>reversion</i> to the mean? Paramartha was Indian, not Chinese. Whatever issues might dog his credibility are barking quite as fiercely at the authors of the tathagatagarbha literature. That way lies madness. It certainly seems to me that an encyclopedia article on the topic of BN cannot just simply ignore the contributions and influence of the probable author of the BNT. Now, by the pains he took to refute <i>any</i> sort of atman, we can see how controversial the question was then, no less than now. It seems to me that if there <i>was</i> a splitting into two terms with two nuanced meanings, the bifurcation took place squarely in the context of a refutation of atman. And that this refutation was not of one or two but several of the senses in which atman was and is understood by both sages and ordinary people. This rejection was and still is seen in those circles as necessary for personal transformation, viz <i>asrayaparvrtti</i>. By all appearances, Paramartha ended up taking a position very similar to MN2, the Sabbasava Sutta. (Could he have been familliar with it?)</p>
<p>4) Paramartha et al "failed" in the sense that, as you indicate, we still live with countervailing attitudes. Now, the influence of the the tathagatagarbha literature—and yes, of related trends in the Nikaya literature—was and is enormous. But with all due respect it was and is not the last word—certainly not on the significance of atman. If atman is multivalent—for that matter, if <i>wu wei</i> is multivalent (more about that in a second), is there some special reason why BN must be interpreted as having been frozen at the time of the composition of the tathagatagarbha literature?</p>
<p>5) I think it's defensible to draw parallels between anatman and wu wei. Consider: In Analects 15.4 Confucius was enigmatic, ascribing wu wei to Emporer Shun, <i>despite</i> prodigious doings. (Not simply because kings should have discernment.) This is hardly different from Tao Te Ching 37 "The Tao is always "not-doing". Yet there is nothing it doesn't do." (AC Muller's translation) Cancel out the double negative and replace Tao with marga; those are harmless enough. All that is left is to replace nonaction with nonself and we have something quite close to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/dhp/20.html" class="external text" title="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/dhp/20.html" rel="nofollow">Dhammapada 279</a>, all phenomena have no self. (Cf TTC 40, all things...come from nothingness.) As for the origin of <i>wu wei</i>, I am certainly curious about it. But etymologies are keys, not shackles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Taoist wei-wu-wei is the denial of an objective action, that I perform some action. The Buddhist concept of anatta and the "no mind" of Ch'an emphasize the denial of an agent, that I perform some action.

<p>6) As for which atman, I have certainly bit off more than I can chew. I tell you sincerely that you have opened my eyes today to a deeper understanding of the internal contradictions in Nikaya and Mahayana literature. I think I see more clearly the origins of doctrinal discontinuities even among people who are nominally members of the same sects! But I cannot give you sugar unmixed with salt. What I don't see clearly, are any authors whose personal lives are free of embarassment. I am quite sure that you can muster a better line of reasoning (as King did) than an ad hominem about Matsumoto's competence. (In contrast, it is not entirely ad hominem to raise questions about the competence of anonymous authors who imagined Sakyamuni addressed them long after he died.) That King took the trouble is a sign of respect, that the perspective she refutes dignifies a response. As for political agendas, one of the hypotheses of Critical Buddhism is that a misinterpretation of Buddha-nature as a form of crypto-atman was used to justify Japanese imperialism—and it is far from clear that the <i>refuters</i> of Critical Buddhism are free of political bias. Surely some of our Chinese colleagues could further detail the provenance of that bias. --<a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunge_7800.html" title="User:Munge">Munge</a> 07:01, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reply to Munge:</p>

<dl>
<dd>1] I should have looked at my copy of King as, in fact, I realize now that I have had both those articles on <i>fo-xing</i> for decades. The point made here is bit of a red herring since the discussion in those articles concerns the various underlying Sanskrit equivalents denoted by the Chinese <i>fo-xing</i>. Nobody disputes that several Sanskrit terms were translated as <i>fo-xing</i>, but what matters is whether they connote the same thing – which they do as far as the major <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> textual sources, although it should be noted that each term developed in disparate doctrinal environments, but converged in their connotation in this literature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2] You suggest that I "seem to be amenable to the idea there was a revision or reinterpretation". Revision or re-interpretation of what&#160;? If one tracks the usage of <i>tathāgata-garbha</i>, <i>buddha-dhātu</i>, <i>gotra</i> etc in the Indic source materials, of course one can see developments and subtle shifts of meaning, but you started this discussion by claiming that tathāgata-garbha and <i>buddha-dhātu</i> signify different things in the MPNS, which they do not as they MPNS itself states on several occasions. The Paramārtha usage of the terms does seem to represent a major shift in connotation, but this lies outside classical <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> literature, given that he is attempting to synthesize the Yogācāra and <i>tathāgata-garbha</i> systems. This is perhaps not unimportant for Chinese Buddhism but lies outside my area of interest.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3] I think you may be right is suposing that Paramārtha may have been back-tracking or reverting to an "orthodox" position. But I do not know enough about the BNT apart from King's study – I do note even know how reliable her work is as a presentation of the BNT, but I can say that what I have read of her suggests that she is not very familiar with the primary sources. If you feel that the BNT is so important, then I urge you to write an article on it. You mention "a refutation of <i>atman</i>", but nowhere in the Nikayas does the Buddha actually deny the existence of <i>atman</i>. The first outright denial of <i>atman</i> is in the Questions of Milinda. The reports of the Buddha's words just tell us what it is not. If I show you a picture of my father, grandparents, brothers and sisters and point to them in turn and say, "This is not my mother", "All of these people are not my mother", does this mean I do not have a mother. Despite what we are led to believe, the Nikayas are basically non-dogmatic about the <i>atman</i>. As I mentioned previously, there was a split very early in Buddhist doctrinal history between the "mystics" and the "intellectuals". The mystics (probbaly including the Buddha) used <i>samādhi</i> as a way to liberation and tended to use more postive language, including many terms that are compatible with an <i>atman</i> or <i>tathāgata-garbha</i>. For those who could not achieve <i>samādhi</i> adequately, somebody then developed the "negative" intellectual analytical approach, with its <i>skandhas</i>, <i>āyatanas</i>, <i>dhātus</i>, <i>pratitya-samutpāda</i> etc etc which is associated with the anatman doctrine. I suggest you read Lambert Schithausen's extremely detailed monograph "Liberating Insight and Enlightenment in early Buddhism", Studien zum Jainismus und Buddhismus pp 199-250, Franz Steiner Verlag 1981.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You also ask if Paramārtha could have been familiar with the <i>Sabbasava Sutta</i> – yes, of course. All panditas of his stature would have been completely familiar with one of the Agama recensions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4] I am not sure what point you are making here. Who was suggesting that the BNT was "frozen at the time of the composition of the <i>tathagata-garbha</i> literature"&#160;? It post-dates the classical TG literature and, as a syncretic text, obviously presents a differing understanding of the TG. One might try to judge whether it is an improved presentation but that would largely lie within the domain of opinion and belief.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5] If you want an alternative interpretation of the Daodejing, try looking at my translation for details or stuff by Chad Hansen. You will see that "<i>dao</i>" in Laozi and Zhuangzi probably has nothing to do with any "path" as popularly claimed. By failing to put the classical Daoist works into their context as critiques of the Confucian and Mohist quest for a universally valid prescription for behaviour, most writers, such as David Loy whom you quote, miss the point entirely – they just don't get past Wangbi&#160;! As for "<i>wu-wei</i>", it is not an etymology, but the correct meaning that is at stake here</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6] I am glad to read that you now appreciate the existence of internal contradictions with Buddhism. These go back to the very earliest times – perhaps you would like to read the Tillman Vetter book I mentioned previously, the Schmithausen monograph and Brockhorst's study on the two meditation traditions of ancient India. Things should become even clearer to you then – you may begin to see why Matsumoto Shiro and his followers are so completely mistaken. But please do your entry on Critical Buddhism and then I'll enjoy showing in an additional article why their claims are invalid and based on poor methodology. BTW, if you think my aside about Matsumoto was ad hominem, you should read more of his work in Japanese to see the way he attacks his opponents.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say, "it is not entirely ad hominem to raise questions about the competence of anonymous authors who imagined Sakyamuni addressed them long after he died": what makes you think that he didn't&#160;? What do you understand of the manner in which later sutras were compiled&#160;? Sutra literature is a particular genre that makes use of certain conventions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the political agendas, I cannot comment on how the Buddha-nature doctrine was used by the Japanese imperialists but, from what I know, its input would have been quite minimal. But that is an area in which I am not interested because I think it is quite irrelevent to a correct understanding of tathāgata-garbha – even if it were mis-used by some people, this does not invalidate the soundness of the doctrine.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 03:01, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, Stephen Hodge, above, mentions an interesting subject: different strata with the Nikaya sutras. I haven't been exposed to much information on this in the past. Can anyone recommend a good source with which to introduce myself to the scholarship on this issue? - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 08:45, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Nat -- I am doing some research in this area in connection with the atman / anatman debate. The main "fault-line" is that between dhyana-orientated liberation and praj~naa-orientated liberation -- everything else follows from this. The implications of this is rather startling: the Buddha did not teach much of what passes as standard "Buddhism" or else he changed his mind during his long teaching career. If/when I get enough time, I could do a Wiki entry on this topic. Most of the (few) relevent sources are found in various journals but one useful introduction is "The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism" by Tillman Vetter (Brill 1988). Over the next few days, when I have time, I am intending to post a reply to the last msg from Munge in which I hope to mention a few other titles. In the meantime, I think some of this discussion pasge needs to be archived -- I am not sure how to do this so can you help&#160;? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 02:29, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There must have been such a fault line, else Huineng (or his redactors) would not have taken such pains to say otherwise! The BNT also addresses the "samadhi that destroys false emptiness"; e.g. see King p124-6. Now, the current wiki on <a href="../../../a/t/t/Atthakavagga_and_Parayanavagga_fa3f.html" title="Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga">Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga</a> says these older, shorter Nikaya sutras were "leaning heavily on what would come to be defined as samatha and showing very little evidence of vipassana". I can cetainly see how people might have interpreted Attha and Para that way. But not everyone does/did. Moreover, it need hardly be mentioned that right samadhi (consisting of four dhyanas) <strike>and right prajna are</strike> part of the eightfold path. And that the first line of the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_Sutra_72d3.html" title="Heart Sutra">Heart Sutra</a> also seems to defy any supposed tension between samadhi and prajna.</dd>

<dd>(blush) I really wrote that, didn't I. Well, it's no excuse but teachers often divide the eightfold path into three groups: panna, sila, and samadhi.

<dd>No problem, we all make mistakes. The <i>sīla</i>, <i>samādhi</i> and <i>paññā</i> trio are thought to post-date the eightfold path in development and represent an alternative, abbreviated path. The rather clumsy attempt to superimpose them onto the eightfold path is a well-known feature of post-Nikāyan Theravadin dogmatics as a way of somehow explaining the ommison of <i>paññā</i> from the eightfold path which is needed to account for <i>paññā-vimutti</i>.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 01:05, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may be as good a place as any to point out that Tao Sheng, the very Chinese prophet of Buddha Nature, was once allied with a school of the Abhidharma, according to Whalen Lai in "Tao Sheng's Theory of Sudden Enlightenment Re-examined", <i>Sudden and Gradual</i>, Peter Gregory ed., esp. p174-5. His interpretation (or misinterpretation if you prefer), which colored subsequent developments, thus may have been colored by the Nikayas.

<dd>This again represents a later phase of doctrinal development that laudably tries to reconcile the conflict between <i>jhāna</i> (<i>dhyāna</i>) and <i>paññā</i> (<i>prajñā</i>). Another aspect of this conflict can be seen in the situation described in AN IV.46, which this Dhammapada verse not doubt tries to address.

<p>For some months now, I have felt uneasy about the section on Rigpa suddenly cropping up in this article on the Buddha Nature. I did add a linking sentence at the time to the effect that Rigpa could be seen as similar to the Buddha Nature - but in truth, I don't really think this Rigpa piece belongs here (I am not sure that Rigpa is exactly congruent with the Buddha-dhatu). This interpolated Rigpa piece sticks out like a sore thumb! It deserves its own special entry/article (in fact, I've just seen that it has been lifted from the legitimate main article on "Rigpa" - which in turn is lifted from Sogyal Rinpoche's "Rigpa" website) and need not be included under the "Buddha Nature". A mere internal Wiki-link to "rigpa" would suffice, I feel. Unless there is strong support to keep the section on Rigpa, I shall remove it in the coming days. Thanks!

<p>I see that it has been proposed that the two entries, "Tathagatagarbha" and "Buddha-nature" be merged. While I can see why this might be suggested, I do believe (as a major contributor to those two articles) that it is best to keep the two articles distinct, as they contain quite a lot of separate material. I think it is better for people searching for information on the Internet about either Tathagatagarbha or Buddha Nature to be able to see two self-contained (though linked) articles on these two closely related concepts. I think keeping the two entries as they currently stand is not causing harm of any kind - so I would vote to maintain things as they are. Best wishes.

<dd>I am in agreement with the above: no merger&#160;! Although there is a degree of overlap, tathagata-garbha and buddha-nature are not conceptually identical. Also, if they were to be mergered, there would also be a considerable amount of work needed to rewrite the article to include all the material currently distributed in the two articles.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 02:19, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
