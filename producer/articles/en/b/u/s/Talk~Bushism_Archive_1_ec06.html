<p>This article is about mis-uses of the language and not speach patterns?</p>
<p>Otherwise, the POTUS' frequent use of "I understand" / "I understand that" (or as pronounced "Ah uhnnerstahn") could be included; as he frequently uses them in stituations where it is clear that he doesn't or didn't 'uhnnerstahn'.</p>

<p>I don't see any need to delete the article, but it needs massive reworking and should focus on quotes. As it stands, it's far too quasi-academic and dead boring. I would use the articles on Yogiisms, Colemanballs, etc., as a guide for completely overhauling this article.</p>

<p>Surely, Bush's domestic political opponents are focusing on picking out embarrassing remarks. But let's not conflate emerging ideology with off-the-cuff speaking style.</p>
<p>Or let's write an article explaining the POV of partisans that the totality of Bush's character, platform and administration can best be understood via soundbites. But that would only be one POV, and the Wikpedia should neither endorse nor oppose it, just report on it. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>

<p>Folks, at the risk of kicking up a storm, I have resuscitated the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushism.html" title="Bushism">Bushism</a> page, but in a very sensitive and careful manner. Knowing the bitter past of this and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Goreism.html" title="Goreism">Goreism</a>, I have kept this as balanced and analytical as possible. The term does deserve its own article, but only if it doesn't become a dumping ground for anything/everything embarrassing to G.W. Bush. That would be doing the page a disservice. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 07:07, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In this spirit, I have put the following text into the article area:</p>
<p>&lt;!-- It is important to keep this article NPOV and sticking to facts, and not to make this a dumping ground for everything embarrassing to G.W. Bush. There is merit in having this information here in its own article as a linguistic and neutral description of the phenomena. --&gt;</p>

<dd>Quotes from Bush's speeches that create an impression of incompetence are also called Bushisms. Many quotes include misconceptions about geography, history, political process and the world in general, but there is no easy way to tell how many of them reflect Bush's knowledge and opinions and how many are just results of verbal mishaps.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This should read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bush opponents select quotes from his speeches to create an impression of incompetence. Other politicians make just as many mistakes, but get a pass (see <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_media_bias.html" title="Liberal media bias">liberal media bias</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some books of "Bushisms" choose quotes to highlight what they claim are "misconceptions", etc. These books typically make no attempt to divide verbal mishaps from either (a) points they simply disagree with politically or (b) outright errors of fact. These books take a lighthearted tone but basically call Bush an "idiot" more from political motives than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or am I just biased? Let's think about it over the weekend and try to find a neutral way to describe all this. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--user:Ed Poor</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 22:08, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The version suggested above is more biased than the original, only in a different direction. It is not factual to state that "Other politicians make just as many mistakes, but get a pass (see liberal media bias)". Perhaps that opinion could be attributed to someone notable, but to simply state it definitively is not valid (I am relatively certain that Bush has made humorous errors in speech with significantly higher frequency than the average politician, but lacking data on the subject we shouldn't conjecture in the article). Also, I don't think its accurate to state that these books are "more from political motives than anything else". "Bushisms", at least in the context of the <i>Bushisms</i> book that I paged though at a bookstore, are more humor-motivated than anything else. The book I saw wasn't about disagreeing with the president as much as about laughing at him. I would not oppose including some of your suggested text if it can be NPOVed a bit, but for now here is my attempt at a more NPOV version of what was already in the article:
<dl>
<dd>Quotes from Bush's speeches that create an impression of incompetence are often called Bushisms. Many quotes, sometimes taken out of context, seem to imply that Bush has significant misconceptions about geography, history, political processes, and the world in general. There is no easy way to tell how many of the quotes reflect Bush's actual knowledge and opinions and how many are merely results of verbal mishaps, but that has not stopped some of Bush's critics from using a number of embarrassing mistakes in efforts to discredit him.</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Quotes such as "Wow! Brazil is big." and "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_forgot_Poland_e1ef.html" title="You forgot Poland">You forgot Poland</a>" are a direct attack to Bush. According to the article "A Bushism is a word, phrase, or other grammatical configuration unique to the style of President George W. Bush", which means that Bush should be quoted on <b>grammatically</b> incorrect phrases, instead of the significance of these. Whether these quotes might seem semantically stupid or incoherent is beyond what should be discussed here. I suggest deleting this article or at least working on its NPOV. This article is clearly POV.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_ffb9.html" title="User:Sampi">Sampi</a> 00:55, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I support the removal of the NPOV tag. "You forgot Poland" is not an accurate quote, and should be edited. In fact, you're right, it should be removed, because there's no Bushism in the correct version, which is "Well, actually, he forgot Poland." However, "Wow! Brazil is big" does not push any point of view, and it is a Bushism in that it would seem to indicate that President Bush is entirely ignorant of the geography of South America. The reader will make his or her judgement based on President Bush's words, and that is all that we can do at present. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 07:48, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see "Wow Brazil is big" as particularly bushistic. it's just making awkward conversation. Reminds me of when you visit somebody's house and say 'wow, your house is nice". <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 15:31, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"Wow! Brazil is big" is not syntactically incorrect, it’s just redundant. The same goes for the following quote: "[T]he best way to find these terrorists who hide in holes is to get people coming forth to describe the location of the hole, is to give clues and data." That is certainly a very stupid thing to say but it's not grammatically incorrect. The article defines <i>bushisms</i> as</p>
<dl>
<dd>"a word, phrase, or other grammatical configuration unique to the style of President George W. Bush while speaking publicly and usually extemporaneously."</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Wow! Brazil is big" does not use a style unique to Bush. If we wish to create an article, we must first define what <i>bushisms</i> really are; if they are indeed <b>stupid</b> or <b>redundant</b> things that Bush has said, then bring back "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_forgot_Poland_e1ef.html" title="You forgot Poland">You forgot Poland</a>" and others; otherwise, stick to Bush's lousy grammar. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_ffb9.html" title="User:Sampi">Sampi</a> 21:38, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Actually, he forgot Poland" is not stupid or redundant. "Wow, Brazil is big" is. Even if I'm wrong about both of those, neither is worth an NPOV tag. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 06:54, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is not that these quotes are stupid or redundant, the point is that they don't contain any sintactically unique style such as, for example "so we can more better do our job.". They are humorous when looked at semantically. When Bush said "Wow, Brazil is big" the obviousness of his statement created laughter in popular culture but it's not grammatically wrong.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_ffb9.html" title="User:Sampi">Sampi</a> 21:43, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see how you can say "Wow! Brazil is big" is redundant. There is no problem with the sentence at all. The fact that it is a statement of widely known fact doesn't make it much of a Bushism. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrdinary_Person_f894.html" title="User:Ordinary Person">Ordinary Person</a> 23:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Someone ought to collect sources for these quotes so that readers can see what the phrase meant IN CONTEXT. Don't get me wrong here, I'm not volunteering for this. It would just be polite to readers, despite their own bias, to provide them with this information with which they may draw their own conclusions, not just from any existing (possibly not deliberate) bias in the article.</p>

<p>I didn't catch this speech, nor did I ever come across it before this article, but I'm (fairly, at least) sure that this had something to do with taxes, writeoffs, et cetera. I'm not certain about this particular quote, but all of the quotes on this list would benefit from at least a paragraph of context available... somewhere (if not just linking to the whole text itself). In my opinion, until context is provided for the quotes, NPOV stays.<br />

<p>I think the sentence</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>but that has not stopped some of Bush's critics from using the unusually large number of embarrassing mistakes in efforts to discredit him.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>is superfluous, and not entirely npov. "this has not stopped X from" implies that X was not deterred by a valid objection, while the preceding sentence only explores the possibilities that (a) Bush has really no idea about <i>anything</i>, or that (b) Bush is simply incapable of speaking for half a minute without butchering English grammar. Both possibilities entail a remarkably low intelligence on the potus' part. It may be a matter of opinion whether Bush is sent from God. It is certainly beyond dispute that he is essentially aphasic. I am not proposing the term <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphasia.html" title="Aphasia">aphasia</a> is inserted (although it may be justifiable), I am arguing that the sentence suggesting that Bush is in some way "made look" (rather than simply making himself look, or being) stupid. 83.77.216.101 20:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does it belong here? Wikipedia is a wonderful encyclopedia, and I think on of the main reasons that it is is because it expands and talks about areas of culture and happenings that aren't found from other information sources. Most people in America have probably heard about the president's strange quotes before... for people looking for information like this that don't pick it up from living in everyday life, it is nice to have a factual, non-partisan source to give you information. And why is it so important to get it deleted? Or have its neutrality disputed? I thought the article was very non-partisan in its approach, and they taught it as a serious thing instead of something to make fun of the president about. And if you don't want to read it or think its stupid, you don't have to. Just let it stay up, for other people's sake, who want to read it.</p>

<p>I've never seen any proof that the President ever said this. Sure he's quoted with it all the time, but verbal speech doesn't leave evidence in the air. Maybe he said, "Is...Are children learning?" When politicians speak freely, they often change the tense of the sentence in the middle of it. I know it would ruin everyone's day if "is our children learning" is a misquote, but I just don't see it. -65.66.103.43 16:36, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some people regard George W. Bush's speech mannerism as a gimmick, employed to make him appear ordinary and in tune with the population (see e.g. <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20051207.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20051207.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20051207.htm</a>) The view is backed up by at least three factors. In both the 2000 and the 2004 election, the Bush team strived to portray the opponnent (Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004) as being statemen, remote of the polulation. As Chomsky as pointed out, it is very unlikely that George W would speak this way, given his background: wealthy family, prep schools and elite universities (ibid.).

<p>Those are both just dialectal forms. In particular, "misunderestimate" is not, as often thought, an error for "underestimate", it's specifically "to underestimate in a way that results in a disadvantage". For example, if I'm preparing my budget, and I underestimate my income, it's a good thing. I'll end up with more money than I thought I would. On the other hand, if I underestimate my costs, it could cause problems.

<dd>Nik42, if there were a word with such a meaning it would be 'malunderestimate' not 'misunderestimate'.

<p>There is no justifiable reason to attribute malapropisms to binge drinking. It is my opinion based upon observation that Bush's humor is self-deprecating.

<p>This has turned into a very disappointing article. It has been emasulated by those sensitive to Pres Bush's feelings and over scholarliness. The attempt at a scholarly approach has to a degree missed the point- a Bushism is something the president said that a number of people think are stupid or poor use of language. In some cases his may be unfair to him because they are taken out of context- but this doesn't make it any less of a Bushism if it finds it's way into a cheap paper back. A Bushism is not neccessarily well defined, scientific, polite or fair to the President. To discount any of his words because it is not one or more of these things ignores that fact that the growth in popularity and perception of the Bushism is popularist and often lowbrow. The detailed linguistic analysis, although interesting, is only half the story and Pres Bush defenders apparant denial of the phenomenum is unhelpful. Epeeist smudge 11:42, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really wouldn't see the point in deleting this. Sure it this isn't a site for jokes, but a site for notable knowledge and information. Seeing as the amount of times I've heard bushism is about on par with the amount of times I've heard someone say google when they mean search the internet, and google is now a word... I'd have to say bushism is very near a word, and quite a part of todays popculture, much like star trek and all these articles people write about the latest band or new cd. --67.185.55.69 06:11, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even though this page sounds funny, it is still fact. And that's what matters. Wikipedia didn't make up these words or mispronunciations. Bush did and that it sounds humorous to us, is not Wikipedia's problem, nor our problem, but only Bush's problem. And as long as this is factual information, described under one common name you need to categorize this information, which is commonly referred to as Bushism, then there is no justification for deleting this article.</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is true. Yes, it is called "Bushism". I don't believe however that an online encyclopedia that struggles as it is to be known as accurate should have this material. It is pointless and slanderous. Because of articles that don't get deleted, as much needed, wikipedia has yet to be reputable to anyone above a high school level. -- <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamien_Vryce_38b1.html" title="User:Damien Vryce"><font color="orange">Damien Vryc</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamien_Vryce_Esperanza_e93c.html" title="User:Damien Vryce/Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a> 18:40, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He didn't mix up the two annyversaries, it was a combined celebration of all Hungarian revolutions (or state holidays, I'm not sure anymore). It was falsly reported by the media, in fact they mixed it up. There was a lot a of talk about it here in Hungary, even an interview with the Hungarian ambassador to the USA, he said everything was allright with this statement.</p>

<dd>Of course it is—you can construct a noun meaning "person/thing who/that X'es" for any verb X, and everyone will know what you mean, so in a sense all of these potential words are real. The point is that <i>decider</i> for "one who decides, the person who does the deciding" was rare before Bush brought it to the light, and it was immediately associated with him when he did. Of course, it could be the case that <i>decider</i> has been independently coined this way by less notable people dozens of times, but that doesn't mean it's not a Bushism. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>it's sound so much like deicider...it's fun 'cause around the globe there are lots of people starting to believe bush is an alien, or a demon, or an et, or a clone, or the beast, supporting that there is a guy who can't speak his native language and says "i'm the deicider". that's starting to freak me out! nah but it's fun the way his bad speech sometimes leads to a totaly darker context like "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we" or "The ambassador and the general were briefing me on the — the vast majority of Iraqis want to live in a peaceful, free world. And we will find these people and we will bring them to justice."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the life of me I don't understand what's wrong (on the syntactical level only, of course) with this statement. I have checked it in multiple dictionaries: all list it as a legitimate derived form of "decide," just like decidable and decidability. None list it as obscure, archaic, or rare, and the OED has a specific entry for the word. It seems many are so quick to mock or criticize Bush that even when he is OK, they pounce on him. Of course, like all of Bush's statements, it betrays his particular arrogance and simplemindedness, but this does not satisfy any of the criteria in the definition. Therefore, I move to delete this one from the list. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 04:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I deleted "The Decider" quote. More justification: OED definition of decider: "One who or that which decides (a controversy, question, etc.)," and has the following list of quotes: "1592 W. WYRLEY Armorie 23 The Scriptures of God, the decider of all controuersies. 1764 FOOTE Patron I. Wks. 1799 I. 329 The paragon of poets, decider on merit, chief justice of taste. 1862 WILBERFORCE Let. in Life III. 106 The..danger of having..the Irish Bishops made the actual deciders of our doctrine." Contrastly, OED makes sure to mark as nonstandard words such as reigner, approacher, and recompenser. I think the reason The Decider phrase sounds so wierd is not because it is erroneous but because it is exceptionaly aloof and self-rightous. Notice how the OED quotations all have a religous flavor; Bush's statement is typical of his belief that he has been chosen to carry out God's will. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 05:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are not the deciders of what bushisms are. If it is generally reagarded as a Bushism, then it is a bushism. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 22:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think "decider" should go back in. I seriously doubt that Bush had knowledge of the fact that "decider" is technically correct. I think to most people the word simply sounds odd, and I think Bush probably didn't realize that either. I think it's a Bushism simply because it sounds so odd and because it is generally regarded as one. Technical correctness shouldn't be the only measure of speech that's really fitting or appropriate for a President. "Decider" sounds odd and sounds like a Bushism. I doubt Bush was aware that it sounds odd or even that it sounds religious. I don't think it sounds religious - the OED quotes are all very old, from a time when most literature was religious. The OED justification doesn't hold water to me; the OED is full of very unusual words that haven't been seen in print in hundreds of years let alone spoken in normal discourse. I think the fact that "decider" is technically correct is really just a coincidence. <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 13:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article clearly defines a Bushism as a linguistic error; it cannot just "sound odd" to you. My <a href="../../../n/a/d/User_talk%7ENadav1_c801.html" title="User talk:Nadav1">talk page</a> includes a long list (which is but a small sample) of sources in which the word appears. It includes the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, the Washington Post, John Kerry, and a decision-making textbook published last year. I used the ProQuest and Lexis-Nexis newspaper searches, which returned many more results. I think the burden of proof now lies with you for showing decider is a bad word. In responding, please identify exactly who thinks it is a Bushism and why.<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 04:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

Suggestions? <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 23:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC) Perhaps adding a section in Bushisms to explain that the phrase is not really a mistake but has become a rallying point for critics of Bush and his policies? I am concerned that such a section would detract too much attention from the rest of the Bushism article, so I am sad that the specific decider article was deleted.

<dd>Well if The Decider isn't technically a Bushism then I think that it should definately be given its own page and that we should ask for a deletion review. The original reason for the deletion was that people didn't like the idea of a single quote getting its own page. A single quote my ass!!! There are 2 cartoons and a song for it now and is quoted regularly on the news as a catchphrase. I thought the catchphrase might actually be an exageration but if you turn on a news channel they really do quote the president quite often on the it. Just today Larry King quoted it when I randomly turned on the television in describing making of the show Runway.</dd>

Well type The Decider into Google... 7,280,000 results, and if you type The Decider +Bush you get 1,590,000 results. I think those results should speak for themselves. The Decider is a BIG THING.

<dd>Well, there was almost no participation in the vote. The decision was "Merge closure endorsed; editorial discretion may always un-merge if warranted, subject to talk page discussion."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Make the Pie Higher edit</span></h2>
<p>I reformatted Make the Pie Higher to expose grammatical errors so they don't get mistaken as wikipedia errors. Also changed mental -&gt; mential apropos the actual speech, the same as was previously done with 'human being and fish can coexist -&gt; can coexist peacefully'. While this isn't part of the poem as is generally found on the internet, it makes more sense in the context of a Bushism article to keep the poem closer to actual Bushisms so long as they don't interfere with flow or meaning in any way. If you don't like what's been done to it, by all means revert it -- I was just experimenting with a different way to convey the same thing and will by no means defend it to the death.

<dd>I don't like these edits. The poem is an original composition by well-known satirist; you can't change it as you see fit and claim it is the same work.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Frank quote - can we compromise?</span></h2>
<p>(Disclaimer: I am in no way a Bush supporter.) I think the summary leading up to the Frank quote is far more on-topic than the quote itself. The quote proceeds to talk about "untreated symptoms," etc., with some rather alarmist rhetoric. The lead-up, on the other hand, makes a relevant and sourced statement that this individual thinks the Bushisms may indicate certain specific conditions (though I'd remove the words "thought disorders," as it's a technical term and usually used to refer to psychosis-type conditions).<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 21:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The page even refers to the decider remark as an example of what sort of materials belong on this page "Adding agentive endings to words not usually accustomed to such treatment, such as "suiciders", "game changer", or "decider"", but doesn't actually state the sentence that Bush used it in.</p>
<p>I added the reference since no one objected to this. I gave a reference from CNN and personally I think that it deserves more than just a short reference on this article for the above reasons, but none of the other Bushisms have one.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Each line contains some sort of grammatical or logical error"</span></h2>
<p>I don't this think is accurate. Some of the lines are just chimeric idioms. "Make the pie [become] higher" is neither ungrammatical nor a logical error. One could conceivably take a pie and make it higher by adding another layer of crust. It's a Bushism because it mixes one idiom (a bigger piece of the pie, or some such) with another (reach higher or raise the bar, perhaps?) in a metaphorically awkward way. Similarly, "put food on your family"="put food on the table"+"feed your family", but it fine grammatically and logically. The pitbull at the pantleg of opportunity line isn't even a metaphorical mixup, it's just a weird metaphor.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 15:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Namely that the term "Bushism" relates only to George W. Bush. However, the first use of this term that I know of was in 1992 and it referred to similar linguistic problems by George Herbert Walker Bush.

<p>"nucular" for "nuclear" is not a Bushism. It's fairly widespread in the US and no more remarkable than dropping the 'n' in government or pronouncing "Wednesday" as two syllables. Whether you want to call it a mispronunciation depends on how much you believe in arbitrary rules of correctness in the face of actual usage.</p>
<p>Use of multiple modals is also widespread in some regions. I've heard "might could" and "might ought", for example. I haven't heard, or heard of, "musta coulda". It would be interesting to hear the audio. It might be a genuine innovation, or he may have said "must have" and changed his mind in midstream to "could have". This sort of thing happens all the time in real speech, which is why pretty much <i>anyone's</i> transcribed speech looks at least a bit incoherent. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a> 05:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right that "nucular" is not a Bushism, <i>per se</i>, but it <b>is</b> incorrect. The fact that it's widespread doesn't make it correct, nor does Bush's use of it.</dd>

<pre>
Merriam-Webster dictionary:
"Though disapproved of by many, pronunciations ending in [kjə.lə(ɹ)] have been found in 
widespread use among educated speakers including scientists, lawyers, professors, 
congressmen, United States cabinet members, and at least two United States presidents and 
one vice president. While most common in the U.S., these pronunciations have also been 
heard from British and Canadian speakers." 

Oxford English Dictionary:
"The colloquial pronunciation .. has been criticized in usage guides since at least the 
mid 20th century, although it is now commonly given as a variant in modern dictionaries." 

American Heritage Dictionary:
"The pronunciation [ˈn(j)uːkjə.lə(ɹ)], which is generally considered incorrect, is an 
example of how a familiar phonological pattern can influence an unfamiliar one." 

</pre>
<p>Given the spelling, which in no way indicates this mispronunciation, and the general disapprobation it receives from academics, I stand by my position that this is not merely stigmatized but incorrect, and I feel I'm pretty well backed up on this by the above information. However, I don't want to seem to be getting into an edit war (at least not without backup), so I'm bringing this up here.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESeptegram_6fcd.html" title="User:Septegram">Septegram</a> 20:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Merriam webster does not declare it incorrect. Oxford English does not declare it incorrect but as a variant. American Heritage says it is "generally considered incorrect".</p>
<p>Dictionary.com quoting Random House Unabridged says: "—Pronunciation note In pronouncing nuclear, the second and third syllables are most commonly said as /-kliər/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[-klee-er] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation, a sequence of sounds that directly reflects the spelled sequence ‑cle‧ar. In recent years, a somewhat controversial pronunciation has come to public attention, with these two final syllables said as /-kyələr/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[-kyuh-ler] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation. Since /-kliər/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[-klee-er] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation, the common pronunciation of ‑cle‧ar, might also be represented, broadly, as /-kləyər/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[-kluh-yer] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation, the /-kyələr/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[-kyuh-ler] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation pronunciation can be seen as coming from a process of metathesis, in which the /l/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[l] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation and the /y/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[y] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation change places. The resulting pronunciation is reinforced by analogy with such words as molecular, particular, and muscular, and although it occurs with some frequency among highly educated speakers, including scientists, professors, and government officials, it is disapproved of by many."</p>
<p>As from this survey, I would conclude that 1 in 4 declare it to be "Generally considered incorrect" while 3 in 4 suggest or say that it is "disapproved". Now, I quote a more detailed analysis by a Standford Linguistics Scientiest as it pertains specifically to Bush (and others):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it isn't always easy to tell whether an error is a typo or a thinko. Take the pronunciation of nuclear as "nucular." That one has been getting on people's nerves since Eisenhower made the mispronunciation famous in the 1950's. In Woody Allen's 1989 film Crimes and Misdemeanors, the Mia Farrow character says she could never fall for any man who says "nucular." That would have ruled out not just Dubya, but Bill Clinton, who said the word right only about half the time. (President Carter had his own way of saying the word, as "newkeeuh," but that probably had more to do with his Georgia accent than his ignorance of English spelling.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the face of things, "nucular" is a typo par excellence. People sometimes talk about Bush "stumbling" over the word, as if this were the same kind of articulatory problem that turns February into "febyooary." But nuclear isn't a hard word to pronounce the way February is -- try saying each of them three times fast. Phonetically, in fact, nuclear is pretty much the same as likelier, and nobody ever gets that one wrong. ("The first outcome was likular than the second"? ) That "nucular" pronunciation is really what linguists call a folk etymology, where the unfamiliar word nuclear is treated as if it had the same suffix as words like molecular and particular. It's the same sort of process that turns lackadaisical into "laxadaisical" and chaise longue into chaise lounge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That accounts for Eisenhower's mispronunciation of nuclear, back at a time when the word was a new addition to ordinary people's vocabularies. And it's why Homer Simpson says it as "nucular" even today. But it doesn't explain why you still hear "nucular" from people like politicians, military people, and weapons specialists, most of whom obviously know better and have been reminded repeatedly what the correct pronunciation is. The interesting thing is that these people are perfectly capable of saying "nuclear families" or "nuclear medicine." I once asked a weapons specialist at a federal agency about this, and he told me, "Oh, I only say 'nucular' when I'm talking about nukes."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mouths of those people, "nucular" is a choice, not an inadvertent mistake -- a thinko, not a typo. I'm not sure exactly what they have in mind by it. Maybe it appeals to them to refer to the weapons in what seems like a folksy and familiar way, or maybe it's a question of asserting their authority -- as if to say, "We're the ones with our fingers on the button, and we'll pronounce the word however we damn well please."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But which of these stories explains why Bush says "nucular"? Most people seem to assume he's just one of those bubbas who don't know any better. But that's hard to credit. After all, Bush didn't have to learn the word nuclear in middle age, the way Eisenhower did. He must have heard it said correctly thousands of times when he was growing up -- not just at Andover, Yale, and Harvard, but from his own father, who never seems to have had any trouble with the word. But if Bush's "nucular" is a deliberate choice, is it something he picked up from the Pentagon wise guys? Or is it a faux-bubba pronunciation, the sort of thing he might have started doing at Yale by way of playing the Texas yahoo to all those earnest Eastern dweebs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In combination with all of this, I suggest that this is NOT a Bushism (because it is not unique to him). Furthermore, while it is "generally disapproved" (probably because it is considered by those who look at such things as "errors", but who also recognize that English is a language that changes, and they recognize that changes do, in fact, become standard and not errors), it is only explicitly called an error or incorrect in one source. So, first of all, it should not even be listed as a Bushism but in the interest of WP:NPOV, it should not be said to be an error without some extended explanation of the issues involved -- which is a distraction in the article. So, to avoid that, a simple "disapproved" allows for possible incorrectness but does not insist on it. But really this all goes away if we realize it is not a Bushism.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 21:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most or all of this section should be removed. There was already an extensive, sourced list of quotes on this page, but it was moved to wikiquote because it was very long.

<p>===+Origins of the Remark===+ The comment was made amidst speculation that Secretary of Defense <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> would resign, as many generals had been calling for his resignation. During one of President Bush's press conferences, a reporter asked him to comment on the speculation. He responded:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">I say I listen to all voices, but mine’s the final decision. And Don Rumsfeld is doing a fine job. He’s not only transforming the military, he’s fighting a war on terror. He’s helping us fight a war on terror. I have strong confidence in Don Rumsfeld. I hear the voices, and I read the front page, and I know the speculation. <b>But I’m the decider, and I decide what is best.</b> And what’s best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></td>

<p>It is a legitimate Bushism. But should they all go in here? A few examples are good enough for the article, with a link to other lists.

<dd>So is a Bushism anything that someone makes fun of when Bush says it? That is not in the description of what a bushism is. The article should not include EVERY possible Bushim, but only some examples and if that is so, then it definitely should not include things that do not meet the definition of what a Bushism is. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 01:48, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with everything you said. However, because of the phrase's great popularity, discussion of it in secondary sources, and its usage in the media, I believe it deserves mention on wikipedia. The quote used to have its own article, but an afd decision (see above for link) was to move its content to Bushism. I started a deletion review, but there was not enough interest to reinstate the article. So I think it is better that decider appear here rather than nowhere. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 02:21, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if it deserves mention on wikipedia (I do not think it does) then it belongs in some other article. This is an article about gaffes and ordinary quotes are not appropriate. I do not think all Bushisms should even be listed. Just some representative examples. And when they appear, a simple list is enough, not a detailed discussion of the event. Maybe you should include it in wikiquotes. Then it would be part of wikimedia but not inappropriately part of this article. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 15:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I greatly appreciate this article, and I definitely think it should be rolled into 'Bushism'. I understand that a Bushism is a word that Mr. Bush made up. I haven't read the book, but I'm sure it includes other speech related gaffes. Maybe, if there was a good 'Bush quotes' article, 'the google' could go there, but I'd lump it into 'Bushism' until that juncture is reached. 'The decider' should be included in some general 'G. W. Bushism/Quotes area', for lack of a better place, I'd propose to put it in 'Bushism', I believe it is widely viewed as a gaffe. 'Bushism' should contain gaffes until there is a better place to put them (someone create a Bush gaffe page). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Sailor_7136.html" title="User:Tim Sailor">Tim Sailor</a> 20:05, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though you appreciate the article the issue is really: Is it correctly categorized as a Bushism? If it is not a Bushism, it belongs somewhere else. You are incorrect about the origin of the term. The term was originally created by the editors of the New Republic, specifically Jonathan Bines back in the early 1990's. There is a good "Quotes" area in wikimedia. It is called "wikiquotes". The Decider is also not a Bushism unless a Bushism is ANYTHING that Bush says. In which case we should include things he said to his wife and phrases written for him by speech writers. But wait... there's a place for that.. its wikiquotes! --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 20:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is agreement on this page, I think, that decider quote is correct English (it has been in use since 1592). The question is merely whether Bush's comment and discussion of its use by critics deserves to be on wikipedia. Judging from the afd and deletion review decisions, as well as comments made earlier on this page, consensus is that it does. I urge you to reinstate the material. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadav1_2465.html" title="User:Nadav1">nadav</a> 00:59, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
