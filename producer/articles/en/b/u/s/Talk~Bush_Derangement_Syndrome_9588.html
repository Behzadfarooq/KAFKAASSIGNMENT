<p>I believe this article is unencyclopedic because:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. It is original work of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Krauthammer_0f21.html" title="Charles Krauthammer">Charles Krauthammer</a>, who is a columnist for the <i>Washington Post</i>. One man, even if he has a medical degree, cannot invent a diagnosis. It is his opinion, or hypothesis. Without research and peer review, I don't think it could even be called a theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. I cannot find other published information about this article's title, except that which leads back to Charles Krauthammer. This is not an established theory that can be referenced to in verifiable sources - other than in Mr. Krauthammer's column, and web pages that discuss or point to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Since "Bush Derangement Syndrome" is not recognized as a medical condition, it constitutes opinion, or a term. The article itself refers to "BDS " as a "term." However, WIKI guidelines remind us that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, mirror, or soapbox.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. The article mentions that "BDS" is usually used "tongue-in-cheek." This makes the article political and without a neutral point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mr Krauthammer may have something here, although I am sure that there are already terms to cover the general claim, such as prejudice, bias, as well as terms from the area of logic and debate - non of which are specific to an individual person. Regardless of political persuasion, I would support this article's inclusion if it met the criteria for being encyclopedic. In all honesty, it seems to be more of a political commentary - great for a newspaper column, but not for an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorje_Shedrub_c421.html" title="User:Dorje Shedrub">Dorje</a> 03:28, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am saying that his proposed "theory" is the source of the google hits, which seem to predominately consist of blogs and opinion pieces. I have searched for "Bush Derangement Syndrome" in various databases that cover hundreds of journals, and the only instance I can find for this term is Krauthammer's original newspaper column. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorje_Shedrub_c421.html" title="User:Dorje Shedrub">Dorje</a> 02:41, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>It doesn't neccessiarly have to be a "real" digagnosis to be a real term used by real people, therefore it can be encyclopedic. Not all the things refered to in Wikipedia are non-fiction, such as Apple Cigarettes 4.240.36.14 03:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Use of a term by people does not necessarily qualify it as encyclopedic.

<dl>
<dd>Isn't Krauthammer the origin of this term? I think it constitutes OR because Krauthammer is defining a new term and it has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal - only in his newspaper column. Yes, many websites use this term, but I don't think they constitute a reputable source by Wiki standards, since they are predominately blogs, op-eds, and partisian sites. If this term could be found to be published in some other reputable sources (such as a political science journal), I think it would be more acceptable. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorje_Shedrub_c421.html" title="User:Dorje Shedrub">Dorje</a> 16:11, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I oppose any merge to the Krauthammer page. He originated the expression but it is now in widespread use. This article will also shortly be expanded.

<dl>
<dd>The talk page is for discussion the merge. To me, there are legitimate concerns raised about this article. If the verifiable use of this term is mostly with one guy, it's appropriate to merge it into his article. If other people use it, by all means, MAYBE there is a reason for a standalone article. But please don't remove the tag simply because you happen to disagree. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My main opposition to this article is that it is original research. Although the term does seem to be used by a number of people, it is not used in the main stream and is not common knowledge. Merging the article would not solve the issue of original research, but I think it would be much better than a stand alone article, since Krauthammer did originate the term. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorje_Shedrub_c421.html" title="User:Dorje Shedrub">Dorje</a> 16:04, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree there's probably too much OR here. But, it just went thru Afd. So, my thought was that a sensible thing to do is merge whatever <i>is</i> verifiable into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Krauthammer_0f21.html" title="Charles Krauthammer">Charles Krauthammer</a> since he originated it. I agree that this doesn't need a whole article, but I suppose there's no harm in a sentence or two about it in the other article. As long as we take care about what info gets merged, I think we can solve the OR concerns this way. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:17, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we going to need a poll or something to get consensus on a merge? I looked at the archived Afd discussion, and I cant figure how it didn't pass for deletion. I must have counted wrong - the vote was surely very close. Some of the explanations for keeping the article were not in agreement with Wiki policy though. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorje_Shedrub_c421.html" title="User:Dorje Shedrub">Dorje</a> 19:27, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not personally crazy about polls. But if anyone wants to start one, I certainly won't try to interfere. To me the way to get consensus on this is exactly what we're doing- discussing it on the talk page. We could argue about the Afd closure, but thats a matter for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. In my book, that's over and done and no longer matters. As for the article, this seems to me like a tiny little topic, most closely associated with one guy who we have an article on, and that is why I favor a merge. I sometimes rush into things too quickly tho so I'm hoping for some kind of consensus to emerge before I do much with it. I guess the merge could start happening at any time, though- that's a matter for the other article. Once we're satisfied that the merge is adequately done, I favor turning this into a redirect. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:32, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just as the anti-Bush '<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_forgot_Poland_e1ef.html" title="You forgot Poland">You forgot Poland</a>' is in common usage in the blogosphere, and indeed, has its own <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> entry.</p>
<p>BDS is closely linked to Post Election Selection Trauma, a real, identified, psychological issue for some people. People have killed themselves over Bush. BDS is real. BDS is driving some people to try to deny that BDS exists. Could this opposition to a wiki entry about BDS be used as evidence that BDS does indeed exist?

<p>I might be nit picking but this phrase, "former psychiatrist" seems somewhat ambiguous. As far as I know, medical and academic degrees are more like titles than jobs and unless you are disgraced in your field (or perhaps loose your license) you don't quit being a doctor simply by ending your practice.Apple Rancher 20:48, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that a note to the effect that the term "Clinton Derangement Syndrome" is not in general use, but describes similar attitudes during the prior administration would be useful, just to add clarification.

<p>The reason this article was added in the first place was not as a joke but as to <b>describe the phrase "Bush Derangement Syndrome" as it is used in certain circles on the internet and elsewhere.</b> the phrase itself is toungue-in-cheek, but the article describing its use is not supposed to be. If people are editing the article into a joke, then it needs to be changed. And for those who comment on C.K. not being a psychologist: <b>It's not supposed to be a psychology article</b>, but instead an internet slang dictionary entry.</p>
<p>The fact that this term IS USED by certain web communities and others should be enough for it to be considered as an entry.</p>
<p>wikiDictionary seems to be a reasonable move suggestion if at all.</p>

<dd>I don't think it's as much of a joke as people would like to think. It's a tongue-in-cheek description of a political philosophy that is "Oppose Bush No Matter What." Bush's popularity numbers, ironically, has made this particular philosophy more popular. The use of the term "syndrome" highlights the philosophies irrationality, not a medical condition. The notability of this term as an expression of a political philosophy, and the philosphy itself, has only increased with Bush's falling approval ratings. Since the first AfD, the term has become more notable.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:23, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This page and the deletion page has been home to some of the dumbest things I have read on Wikipedia. And that is saying a lot. I'll be removing this from my watchlist after this comment so I don't have to keep picking my jaw off the floor every time I look at this, so if you feel the need to respond to me or insult me, don't bother to do it here as I won't see it. My final comments on this ridiculous matter, which I have already wasted far too much of my time on: First, of course there are people whose political philosophy is as described, just as I can find plenty of people <a href="http://freerepublic.com" class="external text" title="http://freerepublic.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> whose philosophy is "Oppose Clinton No Matter What" -- which is even more bizarre since that guy hasn't been president in the better part of a decade. Where is the Clinton Derangement Syndrome article? The fact that some people are irrationally tied to a particular political perspective is not something we need a new name for, and if it is, it would make sense to choose a name that is not tied to a particular political figure, since that kind of irrationality is not "liberal" or "conservative" in its essence. Second, it seems that it is the Bush supporters, not the BSD'ers (or whatever they're supposed to be called) who have gotten more irrational as his approval ratings have sunk. (Several of the comments on this page and the AfD page stand as evidence for this, and it's obvious - in fact, several of the commenters outright stated - that the reason some folks (e.g. see the comments by Tbeatty, Morton Devonshire, and TDC) voted so enthusiastically to keep the page had nothing to do with Wikipedia policy and everything to do with pissing off people perceived as "liberal.") Third and finally, what I find most bizarre is the insistence that this is a real syndrome, not an insult or joke. At least one who voted "keep" gets it (Armon), and his argument might have persuaded me in a different setting (probably not, though; I tend to be more conservative about Wikipedia pages; as I stated on the AfD page, I also suggested deleting the "whenever you masturbate god kills a kitten" page, and I lost that battle too). But this is an obvious insult, and the textual evidence from Krauthammer's article supports the view that this is tongue in cheek -- those who insist it is a "real" syndrome are themselves showing signs of the kind of irrationality the term is being used to signify. Anyway, I'm sorry I pissed you all off by AfDing this article; it's my opinion that stuff like this is why so many people think Wikipedia can never be taken seriously.

<p>I removed and replace this section: "However, Bush Derangement Syndrome is psychological displacement, the root psychological cause of the left's intense Bush Derangement Syndrome. What makes Bush Hatred insane is the almost delusional degree of unremitting certitude of Bush's evil; while simultaneously believing that the TRUE perpetrators of evil in the world are somehow good and decent human beings with the world's intersts at heart." even if this dr. sanity thinks that it is psychological displacement, that doesn't mean that it is true. also the use of "insane" and "evil" and saying that it is the "left" that believes this, is hardly npov. perhaps it needs to be toned down a little. at any rate, i didn't think it should replace the sentence that was there previously. it should come after if at all.<a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapetite526_7dbe.html" title="User:Mapetite526">Mapetite526</a> 15:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed a couple of sources that, as far as I could tell, were simply examples of what the contributor thought was BDS, instead of examples of the use of the term "BDS". Let's be sure to make that distinction. If I do a text search on an article, and I do not find the strings "BDS" or "Bush Derangement Syndrome" in the article, I'm probably going to remove it. Putting in a link to an article where a lefty is losing it as an example of BDS without the article actually mentioning that it is BDS, is original research. The article seems to have degraded some since the last time I spent much time here, so I'm going to try to at least improve the source lists, and how they are listed.</p>
<p>Also, I want to remove the merge tag from the top, since the person who added it has a total edit count of two, and both are merge tags. This article has survived AfD with "keep" twice, so unless the person tagging it has some sort of case to make here on this page (which they chose not to do), then I have no compunction about removing it. However, <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">User:Derex</a> objects, so I left the anon a note on their talk page to come here and state a case.
