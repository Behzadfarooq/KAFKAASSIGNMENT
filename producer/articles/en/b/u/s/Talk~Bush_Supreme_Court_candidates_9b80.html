<p>This is ridiculous. There is only one administration that can make nominations to the Supreme Court, why does it need to be spelt out in the article name? It also means a new article will have to be created if and when the administration changes.

<p>I think this article is very informative and useful. However, I do agree with the arguments in the vote for its deletion that it will be largely irrelavent once a nominee is appointed. I think this page should be kept until a nominee is appointed, and then the information should be summarized and added to the page describing the new justice (once appointed).</p>

<p>I think this is a useful page to have when people want to look up who current nominees are. Perhaps it could be generalized and expanded to <b>Current United States Judicial Nominees</b> or such, and cover all pending nominations at the federal level - SCOTUS, Circuit, Appellate, etc.</p>
<p>Less ambitiously, I feel this page should be called "nominees", not "candidates". The latter word sounds like people running for office to me. Roberts and anyone else covered here are nominees.</p>

<li>I think the reason they use the words candidate is because only one person will be the nominee. But there are many candidates for the nomination. Just like when people are interviewed for a job, they are considered "candidates" for whatever position is open (in this case, a seat on the Supreme Court) - <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpickett2005_27d6.html" title="User:Ryanpickett2005">Ryanpickett2005</a></li>

<p>With Rehnquist's death, the Supreme Court's membership became for the first time plurality Catholic by religious affiliation, with three Catholics (Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy) of eight justices (also plurality Protestant with three Protestants as well as majority-minority, with five members of minority religious groupings, e.g. non-protestant). The confirmation of Judge Roberts as Chief Justice would add a fourth Catholic Justice to the Supreme Court, confirming the primacy of the Catholic plurality, and an additional Catholic named to the court would for the first time create a Catholic majority Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Since there is already a paragraph in this article concerning Catholics on the Supreme Court, the above entry seems overly redundant. Except as an interesting piece of trivia, I do not think that it matters objectively how many Catholics there are on the Supreme Court.</p>

<dd>I agree. This is an article about potential nominees. If someone wants to research the religion of each candidate and list it by their name, it may have some merit (I added the birth years to each candidate several months ago, since it seemed relevant). General trivia about the supreme court might belong in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a> article, but not in this article. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 01:14, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While relatively young, Paul Clement has already been confirmed by the Senate last June as Solicitor General. He was sponsored by Wisconsin Democratic Senator Russ Feingold for the Solicitor position. Clement has argued several dozen cases before the High Court, was Supreme Court Editor of the Harvard Law Review and clerked for Justice Scalia. He also has an economics degree from Cambridge University in England which means that his selection would bring a Justice with economic expertise to the court. This guy is John Roberts, only younger and, perhaps smarter (if that is possible). The court also needs a Midwesterner and his selection would sew up the state of Wisconsin for any Republican running for President in 2008. Bush needs to choose the single most qualified person, he cannot at this point fall prey to considertions of ethnic background, religion or gender as qualifications for office. Clement is the most qualified, period. And the Senate would look foolish rejecting him after confirming him just six months ago.</p>
<p>He has also served as an adjunct Constitutional Law Professor at Georgetown Law School the last several years. He could lecture the Senators and educate them at the hearings, too. Clement was the counsel to the Sente Subcommittee on Constitutionalism, Federalism and Property Rights in the 1990s. Clement has the broadest, most finely honed legal mind in America and the broadest exposure to most of the issues the court would face. I don't really see how any of the sitting Appeals Judges competes with him.</p>

<p>I recall having read once that Presidents facing troubles with their Supreme Court nominees have sometimes opted to nominate a sitting U.S. Senator for the job, on the theory that the collegiality of the Senate makes it highly unlikely that Senators will reject one of their own. This notably happened in 1894, when Grover Cleveland overcame a string of rejections by nominating sitting senator <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Douglass_White_4d1a.html" title="Edward Douglass White">Edward Douglass White</a>. In any event, a pick from the Senate would not surprise me. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 02:26, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't get back sooner. I don't mind the slight change in size of the image. I just aesthetically don't like small pictures that leave a lot of empty space. I prefer trying to minimize empty space.
