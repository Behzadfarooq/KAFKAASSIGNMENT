<p>Welcome again! I wanted to let you know that I removed your comment from the article above because it violated a policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. We can't say things like "I think that's great," etc. The Tom Green comment is interesting, but right now on the talk page we are discussion whether we should include reactions by other people. You can join us there to discuss it. It's <a href="../../../m/i/c/Talk%7EMichael_Richards_05ef.html" title="Talk:Michael Richards">Talk:Michael Richards</a>.

<p>Viriditas -- Why are you posting on my Talk page? The article has it's own Talk page. Isn't the article's Talk page the proper place to discuss this?

<dd>I haven't edited that article. I asked you this question because I saw this link on your talk page and I recently heard a discussion about this particular subject. This is the second time I have asked you to explain your position, and this is the second time you have refused. And, since you think I am harassing you, I will voluntarily withdraw from this talk page and direct all future communication towards you on the article talk pages. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 00:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viriditas -- There are a variety of uses for both article Talk pages and user Talk pages. The definitions are not "carved in stone." But you've repeatedly shown a tendency to want to discuss issues about the content of articles on this, my user Talk page, and to address issues concerning my abilities as an editor on article Talk pages. I think that there is a time and a place for each, and that there is something to be gained by trying to respect the different purposes for these two different types of Talk pages. But, thank you for trying to help me as an editor, and I look forward to relating to one another amicably in the future. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:13, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Happy holidays, Bus stop. Could you make an effort to keep your comments brief and to the point? I'll also ask Apostle to stop the personal attacks. I'm also interested in resolving this argument, so if you want to try and convince me of why you think you are correct, you can use my talk page.

<dd>Hi. Due to time constraints, I was hoping you and Apostle could summarize the main points in contention. Looking at the discussion, it appears to be a semantic, not a content dispute. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 23:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello, again. The meaning of visual arts in the context of the hippies appears to be in dispute, hence semantics, not content. As for the discussion, I am presently mobile, editing from my cell phone, and the IE ver. doesn't allow me to edit large sections for some reason, so I am unable to reply. I'll try Opera and see if that works. Either way, I would still appreciate it if you could summarize your position in 50 words on my talk page.

<p>When one asks for a source, the protocol is to do so without removing content. If a source is provided within a reasonable period of time and you disagree with content, then the protocol is to add a counterpoint. Your approach is aggressive...therefore obnoxious. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostle12_61c4.html" title="User:Apostle12">Apostle12</a> 18:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Apostle12 -- I think in this instance what I am doing is neither aggressive nor obnoxious, but you are entitled to your opinion. I removed something that was both un-sourced and untrue. I explained my edit as the material being un-sourced, but I was also concerned not to have untrue material left to stand. Any editor can take issue with my removal of that material, and that editor may prove to be be more "aggressive" and "obnoxious" than I am. The result should be a well written article that can withstand scrutiny. But I respect your point of view, and thank you for speaking up about it. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 18:56, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apostle12 -- I don't think I am "missing the point." I think I am addressing the point, the point that you made, that is. Are you trying to provoke me to respond angrily? You don't seem interested in constructive conversation. You seem interested in labeling. You seem to be trying to offend me, by labeling me with various negative terms.

<dd>Of course you don't think you are missing the point! On "Hippie-talk" you had asked for tips regarding "obnoxious." Well, here goes, though I suspect there is little hope that this will somehow connect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One might define two primary modes of human interaction:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Approach one is assertive and aggressive. It encourages contentiousness, countervailing powerplays, and narcissism--all talk, little listen. "Never give an inch." "My source bests your source." "I'm willing to revert more times than you are."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Approach two is collaborative and works through suggestion and a willingness to recognize the "other"--limited talk and an active attempt to listen. More demonstration than assertion. Encourages inclusiveness, creative editing and the addition of content to clarify subject. Asks for sources, waits for sources to arrive, discusses the issues, tries to arrive at consensus. Wholesale deletion of content and/or sources is avoided.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Approach one makes a virtue of narcissistic contentiousness. In some cultures this is the dominant mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those who favor approach two find narcissistic contentiousness destructive both to the quality of life and to the human spirit...pushy and obnoxious. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostle12_61c4.html" title="User:Apostle12">Apostle12</a> 21:37, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apostle12 -- It looks like you are still trying to provoke me to say similar sorts of things to you as you are saying to me. The article that we both find ourselves editing should be the primary thing that we are discussing. Yet you seem to be intent on analyzing me as a person, making value judgments about what makes me tick, and playing pop psychologist. I don't recall saying anything about you, as a person. At first I tried to engage you in discussion, concerning your judgments of me, as a person. I figured we could just get that out of the way. But you are relentless. You seem determined to address the sort of person that you see me as being. How did that become the primary topic of discussion? Can I ask you to try to keep our dialogue on the topic of whatever it is we may be discussing vis-a-vis editing articles? Do you really expect me to discuss with you whether I am really a narcissist, or obnoxious, or aggressive? Correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that I have called you any derogatory names whatsoever. Have I implied that your character is deficient in any way? Let's try to be more cordial towards one another in the future, OK? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 22:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bus stop, my friend, I agree with your sentiment, but I can also understand Apostle's frustration. Please do not continue to delete things that do not deserve to be deleted. Discuss it, use the appropriate tags, and engage other editors before you delete things like "art" from the counterculture article. That was really silly of you. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 02:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viriditas -- Aren't you the one who wrote that un-sourced reference to "art" in the "Counterculture" article in question? And aren't you the one who deleted Korky Day's writing more than once from the "Hippie" article, citing as a problem that it was un-sourced, as your reason for deleting it from the article? As I recall he complained that you did not even talk to him about it before deleting his efforts. I recall him complaining that he put "30 minutes" into composing what he wrote and then you just deleted it without even talking to him about it. Do you see any similarities between your own actions and what you are now criticizing me for? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 03:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take a deep breath, please. The answer to your first question is no, I am not the author, however I did split the article off of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a>, and that is where you will find the author-in the page history. To be perfectly honest, I cannot imagine any justification for your edit, and it almost approaches vandalism. As to your second question, Korky's information was not only unsourced, but appeared to be incorrect, and I did comment on the talk page about its removal. There is a huge difference between removing matters of undisputed, historical fact, exemplified by dozens of articles and categories, and deleting unsourced opinion. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Response to Viriditas -- Did you split the article off of "Hippie," or did you split the article off of "Counterculture?" It is not vandalism to delete un-sourced material. Material is supposed to be sourced. If material is not sourced, it is a candidate for deletion. I think you treated Korky Day with just as poor etiquette as you are saying I displayed in deleting the word "art" from the "Counterculture" article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 05:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I just finished explaining to you that the article was split from counterculture, so why did you ask me which article it was split from? You are beginning to sound like a sock puppet of Korky. The article was already tagged as unsourced, so you would have had to have an additional reason for removing content like you did. You didn't and you don't, so your edit was made in bad faith. I suggest you drop this issue and go back to productive editing. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:47, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viriditas -- You are the one who thinks that the word art is nothing but "semantics." I do not. To me art (and related terms and phrases) is a word that has to be used properly. If you scroll up on this page (and also in our conversation on your Talk page) you will find your reference to semantics in relation to "visual arts." You suggest that I "drop" this "issue," and I suggest you drop this issue. I thank you for sourcing the word "art," and you can thank me for calling attention to the need for it to be sourced. By the way, I don't agree that Korky Day's material was without merit. No, I am in no way related to Korky Day. Please stop throwing around terms such as "vandalism" and "sock-puppet." I "vandalized" nothing and this is the only Wikipedia account I have. I speak only for myself. I need nothing but my own brain in order to contribute to Wikipedia. I do not need secondary accounts to support my point of view. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 06:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Viriditas -- This is a quote from your post on this Talk page: "The meaning of visual arts in the context of the hippies appears to be in dispute, hence semantics, not content." That is what you wrote on December 27, two days ago. Just scroll up to see it. For my response to that you will have to look on your own Talk page, because that is where I responded. I don't know if you are now going to say that those two instances were two different contexts, in two different articles. But if that is what you are going to say, I don't see it that way. In both the "Hippie" article and the "Counterculture" article, a very similar issue comes up. It involves shades of meanings of various "art-indicative terms." (I am making up the phrase "art-indicative.") In both articles the objects concerned were not (in most cases) paintings and sculptures and closely related matter, found in museums or galleries of contemporary art. As such I was not readily willing to apply the same terminology to the production of the "counterculture" or the "hippies." I am aware of the prevailing trend to call almost everything "visual art," or "art." I make no value judgments, but for the sake of clear writing, and so as not to mislead the reader, I like carefully choosing terms that are not too broad in meaning. Of course they should not be too narrow in meaning either. Broad, sweeping statements don't serve anyone's interests. They sound good, but they obscure more than they illuminate. As to your suggestion that I "drop the issue regarding sources," let me point out to you that it is the cited sources that indicate what sort of objects are being referred to by the word "art" in the "Counterculture" article. I cannot, as an editor, know whether the word "art" is being properly used, without knowing what it is referring to. Therefore I need to know sources. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 10:05, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Response to Virditas -- It sounds like you didn't read a word I wrote, because you didn't respond to anything. In lieu of dialogue you referred me to a Wikipedia page for "Citing sources." You overlook that I didn't write the sentence containing the un-sourced material. What is your point? I removed the un-sourced information because it was vague and unclear, and I think that is what Wikipedia wants. Wikipedia does not want vague suggestions without sources to back them up. Consider this: Did the editor who wrote that sentence (which included the word "art") have <i>oil paintings</i> in mind or did that editor have <i>tie dyed T shirts</i> in mind? Without a source, no one has any idea what the word "art" refers to. It happens to be a vague word, in common usage. Wikipedia can overcome that unclarity, with due diligence. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:04, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Viriditas -- Why are you so enamored of telling people what to do? Are you aware that after your shabby treatment of Korky Day, which he complained about in a long paragraph on the Talk page for the "Hippie" article, he virtually has not posted anywhere on Wikipedia again? Are you aware of that? He only posted one more time, and that post was not to the "Hippie" article, which he seemed to be very enthusiastic about. Who are you to boss people around? You are telling me, "Don't do it again?" I think you should check with someone who might know more than you about the general philosophy concerning un-sourced material on Wikipedia. Or perhaps you may want to research it on your own. It is my understanding that un-sourced material is a candidate for deletion. And please spare me your accusations of "vandalism." I deleted one word. I deleted the word "art." I wrote in my "Edit Summary" that it was "un-sourced." That alerted anybody who wished to provide a source for that word to do so. I helped the article by my action. My motives were good. The outcome was a good one, since you came along and provided the needed source. Why don't you drop this subject? I don't enjoy this interaction with you. I don't like your manners. I think you treated Korky Day shabbily. And you are showing the same personality to me. No one is an authority around here. As long as we try in good faith, and assume the same of others, this enterprise can work. Can you try to operate without telling people, "Don't do that again?" <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding of unsourced material is in error. That approach generally applies only to statements about living people. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Korky was treated badly in any way. And, I've already addressed this issue on talk.

<p>Viriditas -- Do me a favor -- don't even talk to me unless there is something to talk about. You have been pursuing me and pursuing me and pursuing me. I did not initiate this conversation. And I have been trying to extricate myself from it. When you speak to me with the same courtesy that I speak to you, then I would be happy to engage in dialogue. But whatever this discussion is about has been long lost in the layers of accusations and counteraccusations. Can we drop this?

<dd>"The so-called hippies, and other free spirits of the mid-1960s who congregated around Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco precipitated an "alternative" lifestyle that rapidly caught on in many cities, and even some rural areas, around the nation. Unlike the Beats before them, the hippies captured the imagination of middle-class Americans, especially its youth, who credited them with starting a sexual revolution that encouraged free love and with popularizing the use of marijuana and other hallucinogenics such as LSD and mescaline to "open" the mind. The visual art forms usually associated with hippie culture - psychedelic posters, album covers, comic books, and other graphic designs celebrating the hippie lifestyle or advertising outdoor gatherings called "be-ins" or "love-ins" - is fully represented in Made in California. So, too, is the work of painters, sculptors, decorative artists, and fashion designers influenced by hippie culture's embrace of unconventional media and libertine subject matter." <a href="http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa311.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa311.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> See also Australian artist <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Whiteley_80bd.html" title="Brett Whiteley">Brett Whiteley</a>.

<p>Viriditas -- Thank you for the invitation. That is nice of you to say. I will keep it in mind. But I tend to skip around. My thoughts are evolving. I am presently concerned with the appropriate use of art terms, as they relate to the field broadly known as visual art. That is probably evidenced in several of my edits. I am a stickler for the right terminology concerning these things. The words matter, and I would rather use more words or awkward descriptions than use the terminology that most readily comes to mind, but which fails to identify the visual entity being referred to with the appropriate amount of specificity. But, thanks for that invitation. I much appreciate it. Like I say, I will keep it in mind for the time being.

If you genuinely had something new to say to me I would think you would find your own words with which to express it. There have been no changes made by me to the article on the "Hippies" that we both worked on, in the past several days, so why are you coming back now to post the above two links on my user Talk page? Apparently you don't want healing. Though you have criticized me as being too aggressive, your own actions, seen in the above post, seem to be aggressive too.

<p>RexNL -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to remove that content. Thank you for putting it back. But, what I was trying to do was to make it so that one could "edit" the section called "Other Art-Related Terms" separately from the two sections below it, namely the sections titled "References," and "External links." How would that be done? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 20:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Bus Stop.&#160;:-) I removed the link from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_art.html" title="Contemporary art">Contemporary art</a> because Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> on external links suggests avoiding commercial links. They tend to be seen as advertising and "spam" because if one commercial site is linked then every other commercial site in the world will want to add a link too. I hope you didn't think I was too harsh.

<p>Hello Random Passer-by -- No, after giving it some thought, I didn't think it was improper to remove that link.

<p>Tyrenius -- There are multiple, single purpose user accounts popping up regularly to support "Nadia Russ." They cite articles published on "Webspawner." It seems to me anything can be written on Webspawner. All you need is a keyboard. I tagged the article for deletion today, again. The supporters don't engage in dialogue. They think they can foist artists and terminology on Wikipedia readers without substantiating their claims with citations or at least an engaged dialogue. I would be more inclined to withhold my objections to this article if the supporters of it engaged in a dialogue with me, so that I could get a feel as to where they are "coming from." When they remove the tag proposing deletion, doesn't that shut down the dialogue process? And, over the past few days, I think I have tried to draw the participants into a dialogue with me on the Talk pages. That has not worked either. There is a "my way or the highway" attitude, it seems to me, on the part of the supporters of this article. I have been trying to find the template for the tag that says that the tag cannot be removed, but I have not been able to locate it. Do you know where that tag can be located? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 18:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Bus stop--you may want to connect with <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a>--he's an administrator and somewhat of a goto guy for visual arts. We're definitely dealing with sockpuppets here. I asked Tyrenius to look at the NeoPoprealism article and he blocked one of the sockpuppet accounts.

<p>Freshacconci -- I don't think they have at all defined the term "NeoPopRealism." That is where I entered this discussion, several days ago. I don't think they have at all shed light on what NeoPopRealism means. Most of their argument for the importance of the art of "Nadia Russ" relates back to the importance of NeoPopRealism. They have shown, in my opinion, a distinct propensity for shying away from any discussion as to what they mean by that. So, in the final analysis, I don't see sufficient significance for inclusion on Wikipedia of this artist or of the "art movement" that they argue is associated with her. I do feel a little bit bad about trying to "knock an artist off of Wikipedia." But I don't think the reader of Wikipedia should be subject to an article that in my opinion has very little substance to it. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 19:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as we all in good faith attempt to be inclusive, given the scope and size of wikipedia, I also don't think this means we need to open the door to everyone who is an artist. There needs to be some standard for notability, otherwise all of this is meaningless. If an artist wants a web-presence, they can get a website. I'm an artist, but I'm not notable. Maybe someday, but not now. I guess some cannot accept that, or become over-zealous in their promotion of others. Whether or not the Nadia Russ page is self-promotional or not, I'm uncertain. But given the number of artists <i>not</i> included on wikipedia, it's a little irritating to see this sort of activity. To AfD an article, go to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion</a> and follow the steps.

<dd>Yep, that seems about right. Speedy tag can be removed by anyone apart from article creator. Prod tag can be removed by anyone at all. AfD tag can't be removed until AfD is closed (only by admin with exception of obvious keep). I have a lot of leeway for artists too, but the article has to demonstrate an adequate degree of shows/coverage/reviews or whatever and verifiable sources for the info. Blog-type sites aren't enough, and so far there's only one review from NYArt. However, please concentrate on the article and not the editors, despite the temptation to do so. If it's an article that benefits wiki (at the moment I don't see that it does) we should save it, despite its proponents. Keep me posted on any socks. I'm busy offline, but I'll keep an eye open. I think you and Freshacconci have exercised a lot of patience and understanding over this article. I recommend a bit more severe editing of it to see what remains that is worthwhile and verifiable. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ginsberg never advocated sex with pre-pubescent children, very true. He did, however speak of children's bodies as beautiful and he joined NAMBLA as a political protest.</p>
<p>Ginsburg also advocated, and occasionally practiced, sex with adolescent boys. This may have constituted a violation of "informed consent" laws in some jurisdictions--worldwide the variance in informed consent laws is great, from age 9 to age 21. Those who define pedophilia strictly would not count Ginsberg's fondness for adolescent boys as "sex with children;" others would.</p>
<p>In any case, Ginsberg hardly spoke for, nor did he typify, hippies....so I'm glad you reinstated "except sex with children." <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostle12_61c4.html" title="User:Apostle12">Apostle12</a> 08:49, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, there's something I'm really interested in. Do you REALLY feel that the "fork up your ass" reference doesn't refer to lynching? Bulbous 18:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bulbous -- I wouldn't joke about such a thing. I have misgivings about reducing the seriousness of something that is in the realm of the very serious. I want to condemn lynching without any reservations. Nothing could be more barbaric. But I think it is unfair to attribute all of the barbarity of lynching to the comment that Michael Richards made. I think it is thoroughly wrong, what Michael Richards said, concerning that "fork" comment. But no, in my opinion, it is not a reference to lynching. In my opinion it is imagery used to convey the utter control of one human being by another human being. It is certainly derogatory. It certainly is deserving of condemnation. But it is only referred to as lynching by the news media because they have a powerful agenda. We happen to live in an age strongly marked by the need to distance ourselves from such things as racism. That is certainly a good thing. But in our frenzy to distance ourselves from such things as racism we sometimes distort things too. The news media could just as well have reported verbatim what Richards said. But they choose to interject words (lynching) that will demonize Michael Richards further, and thereby distance themselves from his racist outburst. We cannot do "original research" so my opinions are irrelevant. Our article on Michael Richards has to say that it was a reference to lynching, because that is what all of the news media have said. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 19:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been a fan of Richards for some time, but reading those specific words, I can't see how they can possibly be interpreted in any way BUT a reference to lynching? To me, it's extremely blatant. I appreciate your idea of "utter control", but isn't the "one human being by another human being" negated by the fact that Richards said "We"?

<dd>I did not mean literally one person. Yes, I used the term "one man." I chose my terms incorrectly. What I meant is the "control" part. I think Richards was trying to be insulting.

<dd>I am not denying that the reference alludes to, or at least comes pretty damn close to alluding to, violence to Blacks. I just take exception to characterizing it as "lynching." It is a reference to what it literally says. It is not necessary to interpret it. It says, "Fifty years ago you would have been upside down on a fork." Correct me if I am wrong. I think that's what he says. First of all, you've got to take into consideration, I think, that these words were not thought about for a long time before they were spoken. If Richards had a five minute time delay, and he saw what he said, I think he would have deleted his words. My point is that these words hardly represent his premeditated thought. But the words do not spell out lynching. If you put your emotions aside, I think what you see is a reference to <b>food.</b> What goes on the end of a fork? The reason why those words leapt into his mind is because food is <b>utterly controlled.</b> I know I am being irreverent. I don't mean to make light of lynching. But why interpret what Richards said? He said what he said. He didn't say, "Fifty years we would have had you hanging from a tree with a rope around your neck." He didn't say that. It's bad enough that there is a terrible history of lynchings. But do the news media have to incorrectly paint Richards as an advocate for lynching? Have you ever heard the trite saying that two wrongs don't make a right? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 03:00, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, thanks for responding. I know the cellular footage has been excluded from the official article, but for the purposes of our discussion, it should be sufficient. From that source, it sounds to me that the exact wording is, "Fifty years ago we'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass". I don't think it's a tremendous leap between an allusion to "lynching" (to which you object) and an allusion to "group violence against blacks" (to which you don't necessarily reject). Isn't the rest semantics? Or is the whole point one of semantics? Bulbous 03:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bulbous -- Does he say, "Fifty years we would have had you hanging from a tree with a rope around your neck?" That would be a reference to, because that would be description of, lynching. Is the "fork" comment evocative of the above comment? Yes. But there is a difference. Is the New York Times indicating that difference? It is a very serious charge to attribute to Richards a reference to lynching. Yet the news media (I'm just using the New York Times as an example, because of their stature) don't take the effort to stop at some point short of calling it a reference to lynching. "Upside down with a fucking fork up your ass" means "upside down with a fucking fork up your ass." Is news reporting about accuracy or interpretation? We, the consumers of news, don't need the New York Times to digest and interpret and regurgitate for us in a form that our feeble minds can easily grasp. In an editorial column they can feel free to expound on how the imagery of one statement is similar to the imagery of another statement. I don't see it as a reference to lynching. The reason why is because it is not a strict description of lynching. You can feel free to interpret it and reach a different conclusion. But then, shouldn't you preface your mention of "lynching" with something like, "according to my interpretation?" <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm not responding to him. It's killing me, but I am NOT responding! You gotta love this guy! I use the word bully as a VERB. He CALLS ME a bully ("like most bullies") farther down the page (not to mention accusing me of lying, being dishonest and disingenuous) and somehow he tries to twist it all around. Hopefully, an admin will dig a little deeper on him and read the Richards talk page, as well. I'm inclined to think that your initial theory on him may have ALSO been correct. Seems like the anti-Richards camp may have had alot fewer editors than it had appeared. Curiouser and curiouser...

<p>I'm not pro or anti Richards. Some things just make more sense to me. I see no need for a <i>"Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident"</i> page. The supporters of that page make it sound like that incident has an equivalent amount of significance as, say, the <i>Boston Tea Party.</i> Besides, it shares the term <i>"Michael Richards"</i> with the original article, so anyone searching for the "incident" article (unlikely, I think) will find the original article, and read the same account of the incident. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't consider myself to be on one "side" or the other either. I'm just using "their" terminology. If anything, I'm on the "side" of Wikipedia, as I suspect are you. If you get a chance - you should read the full talk page archive. It's AMAZING how MANY editors have remarked that the incident deserves no more than a few sentences. When the AFD is over, I plan on trying to get the Mel Gibson DUI article merged back into his biography. It's a dangerous precedent to have been set because it opens such a pandora box! <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a>? LOL!!!

<p>I was very tempted to speedy delete this and associated articles. I didn't because the speedy tag had been removed earlier by another admin I noticed, and also by going to AfD it does two things: 1) a delete then has more weight 2) it gives the article time to redeem itself if there really are sources etc that validate notability. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:40, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bus stop. I was intrigued by your commentless vote to keep Karl Kenda. I was about to write you a comment to ask why the change of heart, so I hope you'll pardon if I went back and looked at the earlier revisions of the page and saw your more complete thoughts on the issue.</p>
<p>I'm curious if you thought I was applying different standards in my nomination of this article, primarily based on it being original research, versus my vote to keep some of the street artists and delete some of them, largely based on the availability of outside resources to support their individual claims of notability.</p>
<p>I guess I'm really just looking to better understand what you were trying to say (and then I'm also curious as to why you blanked the comment). Cheers. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 01:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> -- Thanks for the message. I was not even aware that you were involved in the articles for deletion concerning the group of "street artists." I simply hadn't taken note of that. I actually haven't thoroughly read everything concerning that issue. But here's what happened: I happened to notice the Discussion page writing from the author of the Karl Kenda article. I had prior to that (today) been looking at the AfD street artist issue. I was struck by the basically different approach taken by the defenders of each of these categories of artist. (I was wrong in calling it different "standards.") I was moved by the earnestness that comes across in the writer defending the Karl Kenda article. On a gut level I take a skeptical view of some street art. These are not Wikipedia considerations. But I just thought I'd cast my vote concerning the Karl Kenda article as my conscience, not my intellect, guided me. I deleted my explanations because they could not stand up under logical scrutiny. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 04:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, seeing as I've been mentioned enough times here already... First thing that occurs to me - we're the good guys, remember? The best thing is to avoid possible contentiousness by simply referring to such edits as "derogatory" or "negative" or "contentious" etc as appropriate. Then no one can argue. "Racist comments" is ambiguous anyway, as it could simply mean comments which mentioned the notion of being racist, which of course the first comment did. It's not actually necessary to determine whether they are racist or not. They are a violation of various protocols anyway, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for a start. I think time would be best spent attending to other things.

<p>Has Netscott been "promoted" to be an administrator??? If he hasn't I can't imagine why he would be reprimanding you for remarks you left on a vandal's page. What business could it possibly be of his? Perhaps, it wasn't necessary to "describe" the vandalism as racist - but I really don't see how that concerns Netscott.

<p>Hi <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> -- To tell you the truth I couldn't care less what anybody says about me. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> can be as uncivil as he would like toward me. I think it is absurd to call Michael Richards a racist. And more than that, it is racist to call Michael Richards a racist. Richards apologized. That alone should clear him of racism charges. Richards is a comedian. Comedians push the envelope. That's what comedians do. The trouble is that the all too human emotion of anger takes over whenever we let a little bit of it out. I know I am playing pop psychologist but I see that as the operative mechanism in Richards' remarks that evening. It is really no big deal. He apologized and he was embarrassed by it and he felt bad about it. When people post accusations or implications of charges of racism on Michael Richards' article, those are (potentially) racist acts. The Michael Richards article isn't in perpetual open season for accusations of racism. I think if an article on any other living person were vandalized by charges of racism it would be called racism. Why doesn't Michael Richards enjoy the same protection? Because he is today's official-unofficial scapegoat for racism? I think it is an educational act to post on an editor's Talk page that their recent edit to the Michael Richards article was, among other things, racist. That is exactly why I responded as I did in this recent incident. The question is, how does one respond to vandalization to the Michael Richards article, especially when that vandalization includes implications of charges of racism aimed at Michael Richards. I am of course taking seriously <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a>' advice to refer to such edits as "derogatory" or "negative" or "contentious." But I'm still unsure why, in some instances, "racist" would not be applicable. Perhaps I should not have invoked the concept of racism in response to this most recent incident. It was actually a fairly mild attempt to smear Michael Richards with the charge of racism. But I think that in more acute instances it would be appropriate to respond with the countercharge of racism. I will try to refrain from doing so, and I will try to find other ways to say the same thing, but I'm unsure at this time why the countercharge of "racist" should be ruled out. I obviously respect <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a>' views, but I have questions about them too. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:39, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Introducing a more specific term such as "racist" then has the potential to open a needless debate as to whether it is or isn't racism, as well as possible counter accusations that the cure is as bad as or worse than the disease. Why court possible problems when they can be pre-empted. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Go to the article. Near your "edit" button is a "move" button. Click it and you will get an edit box where you can enter the new name of the article. It will automatically turn the previous article into a redirect to the new name, so anything linked to the old name will be redirected. You're meant to check to see if any redirects link to the old article, because redirects of redirects (double redirects) don't work, so you should change them manually to link directly to the new article. I shouldn't imagine it will be a problem in this case. FYI to edit a redirect, you have to search for it, but of course it redirects you to the new article, near the top of which is a link to the redirect page. If you ever want to move an article, and there is already something at the new name, you have to get an admin to delete it, before you can make the move. Never cut and paste to do a move, as it loses the edit history. Using the move button moves the history and also the talk page to the new destination. See <a href="../../../m/o/v/WP%7EMOVE_8a50.html" title="WP:MOVE">WP:MOVE</a> for more info. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. In case you didn't know, when you add content to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">talk pages</a> and Wikipedia pages that have open discussion, you should <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your posts</a> by typing four tildes ( ~~~~ ) at the end of your comment. You may also click on the signature button <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikisigbutton.png_6b1e.html" class="image" title="Image:Wikisigbutton.png"><img src="../../../upload/7/74/Wikisigbutton.png" alt="Image:Wikisigbutton.png" width="23" height="22" longdesc="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikisigbutton.png_6b1e.html" /></a> located above the edit window. This will automatically insert a signature with your name and the time you posted the comment. This information is useful because other editors will be able to tell who said what, and when. Thank you! <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagermanBot_d869.html" title="User:HagermanBot">HagermanBot</a> 13:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are about to break <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, but you are edit warring anyway and that can lead to a block. Please note that 4 reversions is a maximum not an entitlement. Use the talk page to discuss differences!!!

<dd>I wasn't really edit warring, though I can see how it might seem that way. I was just expressing my disapproval of the adding of names to the list of artists without establishing notability first. I had no intention of reverting it again. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 23:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is, er, what edit warring is. Some friendly advice - you can get done before you reach 3RR. <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a> is a far better approach. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:39, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
