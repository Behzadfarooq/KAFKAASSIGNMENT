<p>This article previously redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_corporate_leaders.html" title="List of corporate leaders">List of corporate leaders</a>. I do not find this appropriate, since this group forms only a very small segment of what we refer to as <b>businessmen.</b></p>
<p>I think that anyone who has followed a link to this term probably does so because he wants to know just what a businessman is or does. I find the word to be a somewhat pejorative term for a person who engages in generic profit-making activity of any kind. This parallels the way that a generic <b>consultant</b> will give advice on anything that you care to ask him about; he may be knowledgeable about the subject, but that is not a prerequisite. The archetype of a businessman may very well be <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a>'s Pointy Haired Boss.</p>
<p>A little Googling has not been very productive. Commonly the hits referred to various individuals who called themselves businessmen, or to news reports of businessmen who had been arrested for some white collar crime, or at best it is a tag used by the media when they don't know what a person does. I found this at <a href="http://lamar.colostate.edu/~dlyons/CH4.htm" class="external free" title="http://lamar.colostate.edu/~dlyons/CH4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lamar.colostate.edu/~dlyons/CH4.htm</a></p>

<dd>Indeed, the BUSINESSMAN can be distinguished from the 'professionals' in this way: a lawyer could be called a 'splendid lawyer' if he wins a lot of cases, even if he forgets to collect his bills and ends up with a very small income. This holds for all professionals: there is for them a standard of excellent performance that is not solely 'making the most money'. (This holds even for salesmen: a person could count as a successful salesman if he sells a lot of goods, even if somehow he ends up not earning much money. It also holds for a 'good prostitute'!) But a person is labeled a 'successful businessman' solely according to the profit he accrues in the long run. This means that the ROLE of businessman is sharply defined as NOT aimed at benefitting society directly. (Believers in the Hidden Hand will claim that such entrepeneurs benefit society indirectly far more than 'do-gooders'!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another notable speech extract which serves to enlighten us is from the 1896 Democratic convention.</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you come before us and tell us that we shall disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your action. We say to you that you have made too limited in its application the definition of a businessman. The man who is employed for wages is as much a businessman as his employer. The attorney in a country town is as much a businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. The merchant at the crossroads store is as much a businessman as the merchant of New York. The farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, begins in the spring and toils all summer, and by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of this country creates wealth, is as much a businessman as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain. The miners who go 1,000 feet into the earth or climb 2,000 feet upon the cliffs and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured in the channels of trade are as much businessmen as the few financial magnates who in a backroom corner the money of the world.</dd>

<p>Ultimately, I have no idea what the word "businessman" really menas. In my more waggish moments I take MBA to mean Master of Bugger-All. There also appears to be a tradition among writers to use the term in anticipation that readers will understand it even if the writer doesn't. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 21:27, 2004 Feb 17 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've moved the above Bryan quote to the body of the article. "Businessman" is such a common weasel word that a series of quotes may be the best way to grasp its importance. It is too imortant and pervasive to be deleted. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 18:06, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Precisely. As it's not the only word in the English language with multiple meanings, there is nothing wrong with the generic use of "man."

<p>What is a man?? A male person, of course! So why should "businessman" be the proper gender-neutral term?? Do most people <b>as of 2004</b> think that "-man" is a gender-neutral suffix or a masculine suffix?? This is the first time I asked sexist language to be removed from a Wikipedia article when it got objected to easily. Why are there people who continue to use "man" generically instead of a word like "person"?? Because any word suffixed with -person looks stupid and yet again overly PC? <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_BlahDeBlah_b4da.html" title="User:Lady BlahDeBlah">Lady BlahDeBlah</a> 09:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The male gender has always been the nuetral in refering to many people. Hence the use of 'men' in older books to refer to the people of a society. I dont think it's meant to be offensive to females. <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrenosogullari_f545.html" title="User:Evrenosogullari">Evrenosogullari</a> 14:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dont see any history or extra info. If the article is going to stay it should probably elaborate a bit more on the term. <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrenosogullari_f545.html" title="User:Evrenosogullari">Evrenosogullari</a> 14:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That isn't bad, nor is magnates, executives, and so one, concerning the classification of biographies. Because it is mainly those whose business is or becomes big who will be the subjects of biographies. Isn't it true that "businessman" and "businessperson" appear in the 'pedia mainly in the first sentences of biographies, where there is a systematic effort to classify subjects by nationality and occupation?</dd>
<dd>But the article <a href="../../../b/u/s/Businessperson.html" title="Businessperson">businessperson</a>, in contrast to the category, should have broader scope. It should tell us what (original researchers and writers say) about business as an occupation ranging beyond economics to psychology and politics. (Eg, if a town in the U.S. appoints a committee of nine to report on the state of the school system, it will appoint three businessmen, three teachers, and three other citizens. If the subject of report will be the library system, three businessmen, three librarians, and three other citizens.)</dd>
<dd>I suspect that many Wikipedia articles are "poor" in general because they have been written as main pages for categories and subcategories. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 17:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, his biography may belong in categories Businesspeople and Comics characters.</dd>
<dd>But the role of businessmen may be to run the country. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 17:07, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
