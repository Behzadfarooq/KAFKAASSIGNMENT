<p>Keep this article. Let each reader decide for him- or herself whether or not what is written is true. Do not delete it because some people don't believe it. Just leave it as it is, and keep the disclaimer that it is disputed. But do not delete it. Also, to the doubtful Rjensen, Spivak indicated that he believed that certain Jewish financiers, as well as Gentile financiers (the Gentiles being the majority) were connected in some way. You would do yourself a favor by doing more research than just reading Spivak's article; he also wrote a book that has two chapters devoted to the plot. Also, just because Dickstein's credibility was no good doesn't mean that Butler's credibility was no good. Dickstein's committee didn't do much with the evidence provided; if anything, they tried to suppress it from the public by pooh-poohing it and releasing an eviscerated report on the committee's hearings on the matter.

<p>Nearly every historian, journalist and public official who investigated this spectacular story has concluded it was a hoax.</p>

<dd>Wow. Great. Thats all cleared up then. And the sources for this are? Wich historians? which journalists investigated this you say? I mean: could you please supply the sources that can substantiate this statement you've made here?213.172.204.59 03:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only "evidence" ever presented was the testimony of General Butler. He admitted that at the time he did not bother reporting to authorities that a conspiracy was underway to overthrow the United States Government. I suggest that Wikipedia should report the outline of the story, and indicate that the overwhelming consensus among scholars is that it is a hoax. Since the 1980s historians have had access to the letters of the major figures supposedly involved, and not a shred of evidence has surfaced that they ever planned a coup. The Russian archives, opened after the fall of Communism, show that Congressman Dickstein, the main person arguing there was a fascist plot, was on the Soviet payroll as a spy. That shoots his credibility. The only journalist who believed the story was John Spivak; he saw it as a Jewish plot. If anyone still thinks it's a legit story better read the Spivak 1935 article online at [<a href="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/spivak-NewMasses.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/spivak-NewMasses.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:35, 21 November 2005 (UTC) ]</p>

<dd>Sure: look at Graham, Franklin D Roosevelt (1985) or studies by George Wolfskill, David Kennedy (Freedom from Fear) and William Leuchtenberg. Which historians endorse the theory??? Any?? The only journalist who supported the plot theory was this wild man Spivak-- you really have to read him to see how fantastic his conspiracy theory was. You also have to explain why the richest men in America tried to make that oddball Butler a dictator (at a time when he was a leading spokesman against the DuPonts who supposedly were behind the plot. This is what hoaxes look like.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You didn't supply any sources here that substantiated your claim. you just started telling us how stupid the other side was. How is "Butler was an oddball" any serious argument at all?? He was taken seriously enough to make him a general major and in charge of US military operations conducted for US corporations and "big business". 213.172.204.59 03:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The plot theory has to explain why the FBI, Secret Service, etc all rejected it, alomg with every newspaper and magazine, every Senator, every Congressman (except one), every governor. Big coverup? If the plotters were so good that they could cover it up so well, then why did the plot not work? Did 500,000 men take over Washington. Well no, not one did. Isn't that odd--I just saw the "Rome" episode on plotting to kill Caesar. If you plot to kill a king you really have to go all the way or flee the country. The plot theory never caught on, so Butler stopped talking about it. Only Spivak tried to keep it alive. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 03:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> Where does William Leuchtenberg mention Smedley? In his book "Franklin D Roosevelt And The New Deal" there seems to be no mention of the plot, or are you talking about another book? What chapter, what page?</p>
<p>"Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945" by David M. Kennedy also appears not to mention the plot, there is no mention of Smedley. What chapter, what page?</p>
<p>The George Wolfskill book: The All but the people: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his critics, 1933-39? Is this the book?</p>
<p>The Graham book: Franklin D. Roosevelt: His Life and Times&#160;: An Encyclopedic View by Otis Graham? Is this the book? Publisher: G K Hall (June, 1985)</p>
<p>On the other side, most historians that I have read on the plot felt that there was something to Smedley's story. I will provide those later today as time permits. Travb 17:53, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When historians find evidence they report it when they spot a hoax they ignore it.</dd>
<dd>One historian to discuss it in detail was Schlesinmger, Age Upheaval, and he dismisses it.</dd>
<dd>There is ZERO EVIDENCE that DuPont, Raskob, Clark etc ever ebgaged in any plot.</dd>
<dd>Butler says a bond clerk MacGuire told him. MacGuire denied it. All the big names denied it.&#160;::MacGuire died a few weeks later of brain fever.</dd>
<dd>The Congressional committee announced it had found no evidence re the big names and did not call any of them.</dd>

<p>HISTORIANS WHICH SUPPORT BUTLER</p>
<p>HISTORIAN ONE:</p>
<p>Quotes from:</p>
<p>Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History by Hans Schmidt University Press of Kentucky; Reprint edition (September, 1998) <i>(Schmidt is an established historian, I have read his book, The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915-1934)</i></p>
<p>"<b>Even if Butler was telling the truth, as there seems little reason to doubt</b>, there remains the unfathomable problem of MacGuire's motives and veracity. He may have been working both ends against the middle, as Butler at one point suspected. In any case, MacGuire emerged from the HUAC hearings as an inconsequential trickster whose base dealings could not possibly be taken alone as verifying such a momentous undertaking. If he was acting as an intermediary in a genuine probe, or as agent provocateur sent to fool Butler, his employers were at least clever enough to keep their distance and see to it that he self-destructed on the witness stand." p. 228, 229</p>
<p>"MacGuire repeatedly purgered himself" p. 226</p>
<p>HUAC's final report to Congress: <b>"There is no question that these attempts [the plot] were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient."</b> The committee had verified <b>"all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization."</b> p 245</p>

<p>This fear drove a number of prominent businessmen to back fascist activities, including a plan to draft U.S. Marine Major General (Ret.) Smedley Butler to lead a military to lead a military coup d'etat against Roosevelt. Butler rejected the businessmen's financial offer and reported the plot to members of Congress.

<p>No evidence for the plot has ever been given by anyone--except what Butler said MacGuire told him. Van Zandt said all his information came from Butler and he (Van Zandt) never was in contact in any way with any plotter. Someone on the House staff did write up a few pages of a draft report that said the unspecified charges were true. The House Committee rejected that draft report and refused to publish or endorse it. (The draft was found in the files 30 years later.) Congressmen Dickstein said there was no evidence whatever regarding the big names (all of whom denied the story). The Committee decided to stop because it could find no evidence whatever, and it said so again in the official report that was published. And look at the "report" again: no names were named. So how does Wikipedia suddenly name names? Where do those names come from? Answer: it all comes from Spivak's article of 1935. It's a wild anti-semitic rant that says the Jews are plotting this coup. In fact there was a great deal of anti-semitism at the time. Henry Ford was involved in a similar hoax in 1920s re Protocols of Elders of Zion. People who are pushing this Butler hoax are basing their argument on Spivak's anti-semitic conspiracy theory. Please read Spivak and decide for yourself. The Schmidt book on Butler clearly says MacGuire was a liar &amp; perjurer and cannot be trusted. So why trust him now? Let's gop over the historians who say the plot really existed: none. Hundreds of historians have worked over the material. The rule in history books is to ignore hoaxes, or (Schlesinger, Schmidt) to expose them. Now there were German-based Nazi activities in the US and the Committee turned its attention to the Bund and similar groups. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 20:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Butler testified regarding MacGuire's 20 minute conversation with him in a hotel room laying out the plot and inviting Butler to be dictator. Butler had no direct contacts or documents from Dupont and the other big names. All Butler had was MacGuire's story (which MacGuire denied telling). MacGuire himself knew only one "big" person (the millionaire Mr Clark who bought and sold bonds through MacGuire.) Clark vehemently denied any plot. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 21:19, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does Travb believe there was a plot or not? I say there was no plot. What does he say? I suggest that no scholars think there was a plot. It is true that there are people today, and in 1934, who believe in gigantic conspiracies. But they never seem to have much evidence. For example there is zero evidence linking the plot leader, DuPont, to the plot. So why does Wikipedia say DuPont was a plotter? <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:10, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All answer your question, and then you answer mine.</p>
<p>Does Travb believe there was a plot or not?</p>
<p>I believe what Butler said was true, so did the committee. Was there an actual plot linking all of those big finacers? There is not enough evidence to prove it. So based on the evidence, "no"--it was not as wide as MacGuire claimed.</p>
<p>You will be happy to note I typed up a scathing review of "The Plot to Seize the White House" and even quoted it on the page. I plan to add a critical footnote from Hans book about Spivak, John L. I am also deleting the "Alleged Conspirators" section, because there simply is not enough evidence to implicate these people. MacGuire probably did say those things to Butler, but there is no evidence to prove any of what he said. Happy? Now please answer my question.Travb 23:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK we're making progress. Travb says that Butler was telling the truth and that MacGuire was lying. OK, that's a respectable interpretation: Some loony (MacGuire) makes up a fantastic plot in a 20 minute conversation. Now I'm happy to answer (which question...the one about books? I said that historians have all looked over the plot evidence and they all decided it was a hoax. Some think Butler invented the hoax (including me) and others think MacGuire invented it. Close call. (I say Butler because he had a long record of wild and reckless exaggerations. His unfounded Mussolini gossip got him court martialed and forced out of the Marines, for example.) Usually historians do NOT mention hoaxes or rumors or gossip they consider to be false. So when a major scholarly book is blank on a story that hit all the newspapers, you can be sure he does not beieve it's true. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 23:47, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No Hans, a respected historian says that Butler is telling the truth. MacGuire was caught purging himself several times. I think that MacGuire was hired by Clark. Clark possibly had the sponsorship of those big businessmen, but there is not enough evidence to prove it either way, because the committee never investigated further. Lack of knowlege, yes, lack of evidence yes. Not because the leads were not there, and the argument was weak, the argument was compeling and the argument was compeling, but because the investigation did not go as far as it could have, and should have.</dd>

<p>Why would right wingers select a popular left winger as a figurehead? One scenario: Use him to rally the troops, since he has name recognition among veterans and has no obvious links to fascism, then once the coup succeeds and the troops go home, replace him. There was a novel about a coup in the Soviet Union (I do not recall the title) where they used a distinguished Soviet General as the initial figurehead to replace the Communist leaders, then replaced him soon after.

New Tack - There was an almost hysterical mood in the country - rich and poor alike. The depression, Hitler and Commies had the rich in a funk/frenzy. FDR was suspected by the rich of being a little too commie for their welfare. A fascist dictatorship probably sounded better than a job. Who else would you recruit other than the most decorated soldier in the country to be front man in such a big operation? Really, who would you pick?

<p>You wrote: "The Committee said it believed MacGuire had talked to Butler about a coup attempt, but the Committee could find no evidence that MacGuire was in league with anyone else. The Committee said it would not call any further witnesses because it had no evidence for a plot beyond MacGuire's disputed conversation with Butler. The Committee investigated MacGuire's finances in depth and found nothing amiss and no evidence of secret payments from conspirators. The multi-million dollar fund for the plot was never located and historians conclude it never existed. Whether Butler exaggerated or MacGuire invented everything is a puzzle, but historians agree with Arthur Schlesinger's conclusion that "it can hardly be supposed that the republic was in much danger."</p>
<p>Page 83 says:</p>
<p>"No one quite knew what to make of the Butler story. It seemed as ridiculous as Dr. Wirt's fantasies. MacGuire himself denied most of the statements attributed to him. Most people agreed with Mayor La Guardia of New York in dismissing it as a "cocktail putsch." But James E. Van Zandt, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and subsequently a Republican congressman , corroborated Butler's story and said that he, too, had been approached by "agents of Wall Street." As for the House committee, headed by John McCormack of Massachusetts, it declared itself "able to verify all the pertinent statments made by General Butler" except for MacGuire's direct proposal to him, and it considered this more or less confirmed by MacGuire's European reports. No doubt MacGuire did have some wild scheme in mind, though the gap between contemplation and execution was considerable and it can hardly be supposed that the republic was in much danger."</p>

<p>On Van Zandt. He gave an interview to Associated Press that was carried by the NY Times Nov 23, 1934 p 23. It's online through PROQUEST. He said Butler told him of the plot and that he (Van Z) "would be approached by envoys at Louisville, Ky, during the VFW convention. The commander said he informed Butler he 'would not be in when the envoys called.'" I read that as saying Van Zandt had not yet met with any plotters and he refused ever to meet them in the future. Who talked to van Zandt? apparently only Butler. Therefore Van Zandt does not provide any independent confirmation--he only repeated to the press what Butler told him. Schlesinger used the same NY Times source but misreads it. Van Zandt did not say that he had been approached directly by the plotters, he said he had been approached by Butler. Schlesinger thinks that Van Zandt met with plotters other than Butler, but Van Zandt never says that, saying instead he refused to meet with plotters. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 01:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Says Butler Described. Offer.</p>
<p>By The Associated Press.</p>
<p>HELENA, Mont., Nov. 22.—James E. Van Zandt of Altoona, Pa., National Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, reiterated here tonight that he had been approached by "agents of Wall Street" to lead a Fascist dictatorship in the United States under the guise of a “Veterans Organization.” The commander said General Butler informed him of the request to him less than two months ago. Butler told Van Zandt, the commander said, that Van Zandt had been selected to be one of the leaders of the organization, and that he would be approached by envoys at Louisville, Ky., during the V. F. W. convention. The commander said he informed Butler he would "not be in when the envoys called."</p>
<p>The V. F, W. chief said Butler then asked the agent what the purpose of the organization was. He was told it was to return the American dollar to the gold standard and to “get rid of this fellow in the White House.” <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 01:23, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we're in broad agreement: either Butler or MacGuire concocted a hoax. Maybe MacGuire thought it up and Butler exaggerated it. Both I think were nut cases prone to wild exaggeration. Butler thought the war mongers and DuPonts were trying to start a war. New Dealers saw the American Liberty League as a very dangerous right-wing threat. There really were Nazis and Communists active in New York City. Dickstein soon volunteered his spying for Stalin. Add Spivak who sees a vast Jewish conspiracy and you have the grand, glorious Wall Street Plot. They should make a movie, but nobody would believe it. Actually they DID make a couple movies that mimick the plot: "Meet John Doe" is my favorite. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 01:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rjensen, I am concerned with your edits that show that you haven't even read the article you are editing. You first state:</p>
<p>"Many historians treat it as a hoax."</p>
<p>Then, many becomes "All":</p>
<p>"All major historians have dismissed the "plot" because the only evidence came from one person, Gerlad McGuire, almost unanimously considered a trickster and perjurer."</p>
<p>This last statment is lazy editing. Read the section which has major historians supporting Butler.</p>
<p>In addition: "the only evidence came from one person, Gerlad McGuire" is completely untrue.</p>
<p>I STILL await your references on those books.</p>
<p>You have consistently shown that you will twist the facts and leave out relevant information to fit your narrow ideology, and blatantly twist what you references say. I thought you would be EMBARRASED to return to this page, but now your twisted, dishonest edits creep up again.Travb 09:07, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I repeat: all major historians dismiss it. The article itself cites only one scholarly book, and it calls MacGuire a perjurer and trickster. Let's face it: this was a left wing hoax set up to promote Butler's speaking tours. The Congressman who promoted the story was a Soviet spy. DuPont and all the big capitalists wanted to be ruled by Butler--no historian EVER believed that. The closest you get is some historians say that Butler believed the story. That is possible, but keep in mind he got 100% of his informatioon from MacGuire. I Suppose several hundred scholars have worked over and rejected the hoax. I remember discussing it in graduate school at Yale in the 1960s as an example of how historians have to be able to spot hoaxes.</dd>

<p>So let's go over YOUR list of major historian? You refuse to let the readers see any evidence that suggests Spivak was violently anti-semitic, that Dickstein was a Soviet spy.

<dd>*Historian James E. Sargent reviewing "The Plot to Seize the White House" by Jules Archer: "Thus, Butler (and Archer) assumed that the existence of a financially backed plot meant that fascism was imminent and that the planners represented a wide speared and coherent group, having both the intent and the capacity to execute their ideas. So when his testimony was criticized and even ridiculed in the media and ignored in Washington, Butler saw (and Archer sees) conspiracy everywhere. Instead, it is plausible to conclude that the honest and straightforward, but intellectually and politically unsophisticated, Butler perceived in simplistic terms what were in fact complex trends and events. Thus he leaped to the simplistic conclusion that the President and the Republic were in mortal danger. In essence, Archer swallowed his hero whole."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_critical"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_Plot_cf63.html#endnote_critical" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_Plot_cf63.html#endnote_critical" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span></dd>

You are selectively choosing what to use as evidence, AGAIN. As you have for weeks. Admitting that MacGuire was a perjurer and trickster only makes your views more dubious--MacGuire was lying under oath, and Butler's story convinced the congressmen that he was telling the truth.

<dd>Again, you ignore the other 7 congressmen on the committee. You pick and choose what history to ignore, and what history to use for your view. If you want to list a biography of all the congressmen on the committe, so be it. But all of the other congressmen on the committee WERE NOT spies. In fact, one was the speaker of the house from 1961-1968. If you insist on listing information on Dickerson, it is only fair to list all of the other congressmen careers--this was not the Dickerson committee, with one sole congressman.</dd>

<p>Most if not all the folks here missed the point. SDB certainly believed it was true and that is the real story.He did testify and that testimony was filmed and those archives are available for public perusal. Whether or not any of the Plot actually happened is correctly stated in the article as never proven. So, FAMOUS? Yes. HOAX? Not proven. I was amused that anyone thought the article should be deleted because SDB never proved his case or that the government did not accept his story. That was never the point of the article. The facts are stated in the article and the difference between accusations and the facts is also plainly stated. This episode demonstrates once again that there are censors in WikiWorld who do not read what they want deleted or chose very fascile reasons to do so. This is a disservice to Wikipedia--disagreeing with someone ain't the point of constructive censorship. The point is did SDB testify that it happened? He most certainly did. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 18:03, 31, 12, 2005 (PST)</p>

<p>If we accept that Butler and Van Zandt were telling the truth as they were apprised of it, there would have to be either a plot or a hoax costing thousands of dollars either way. Given Butler's known and public sympathies, for American businesses to support such a plot would seem unthinkable. The possibility of such an expensive and dangerous hoax would seem even more unlikely. My question? Who would have been in a position at the time to have had thousands of dollars to dump into either destabilizing the USA, making American business look bad, causing apprehension and doubt in America, had a tin ear for American culture and the place of the military in it, and had agents operating in the US capable of such a stunt?</p>
<p>My vote, ever since the Venona Decrypts became public, has been Joseph Stalin, as he would benefit his interests no matter what happened, and throw blame on his enemies if it failed.</p>

<p>There never was a march on Washington--article has to say that. The key Congressman (Dickstein) was a Soviet spy--that needs to be said. Butler was chosen to rule America by Democrats/ wets/ capitalists even though Butler was a Republican/ a dry leader/ a strong opponent of capitalism and bankers. That paradox needs emphasis. The naming of Al Smith etc was all done by a fellow named Spivak who said they were part of a giant Jewish plot.

<p>I hate to have to be pulled into this arguement again, and waste my time, but I fear you are not going to let this die until I debate you into a corner again, as I was forced to do before. Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=45072522&amp;oldid=44695190" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=45072522&amp;oldid=44695190" rel="nofollow">your edits</a></p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i><b>The Business Plot</b>, <b>The Plot Against FDR</b>, or <b>The White House Putsch</b> was a discussion between a retired <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a> General <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smedley_Butler_6a12.html" title="Smedley Butler">Smedley Butler</a> and a bond salesman named <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_MacGuire_9141.html" title="Gerald MacGuire">Gerald MacGuire</a> about a plan to march on Washington and seize the government. The discussions supposedly happened in 1933...All of the inofrmation comes from testimony of two men: Butler said MacGuire was organizing a coup that Butler was to lead; MacGuire denied it.</i></p>
<p>It was so much more <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>, and your statment ignores this. Your edit makes it sound like the sole bit of evidence is a discussion between Butler and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_MacGuire_9141.html" title="Gerald MacGuire">Gerald MacGuire</a>. This is patently false. I am disturbed that you continue to present this view when I have exhastively shown that this is false. Why do you cling onto such ideas?</p>
<p>Your edits are littered with POV, in the form of weasel words, which are unenyclopedic and which I have reapeatedly (and consistently) argued in many articles not to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Of course</b> there never was a march or a coup."</li>
<li>"The discussions <b>supposedly</b> happened in 1933."</li>
<li>"supposedly happened between July and November 1933."</li>
</ul>
<p>Other milder unencyclopedic POV in your edits is present:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wrote: <i>The official Congressional report was <b>ambiguous</b>, and did not name names beyong Butler and MacGuire</i>. Definition of ambigous: Open to more than one interpretation: an ambiguous reply. Clearly many of Butler's accusations were confirmed, your edit ignores this. Your edit also ignores that the reason that the report did not name names, is because portions of the report were edited and suppressed. This is clearly written later in the article.</li>
<li>"and the news media laughed it off"</li>
<li>"and his reputation as a strong left-wing critic of capitalism"</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>True or untrue:</b></p>
<p>In their final report, the Congressional committee supported Butler's allegations on the existence of the plot <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_committee2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_Plot_cf63.html#endnote_committee2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_Plot_cf63.html#endnote_committee2" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></sup></span>, but no prosecutions or further investigations followed, and the matter was mostly forgotten.</p>
<p>You delete this sentence completely, and instead add:</p>
<p>However a prominent anti-Semite named [Lawrence Spivak]] claimed the plot was a Jewish plot to take over the country, and he named numerous prominent Democrats as plotters. The people mentioned such as <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Smith_22a8.html" title="Al Smith">Al Smith</a> all issued vigorous denials and the news media laughed it off.</p>

I talk in length about [Lawrence Spivak]] below, and add information about him. How is [Lawrence Spivak]] a marginalized anti-semite who wrote one article in a communist paper make him: "prominent"?</p>
<p><b>Dickstein</b></p>
<p>When the archives of the Societ Union were opened in 1991, it was revealed that Dickstein had been a spy for the Soviets, reporting on actions in Congress.</p>
<p>We have gone through this all before. Why are you opening up this argument again? If you want to list that Dickstein was a spy, you need to mention the members of the entire committee, REMEMBER its called the <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCormack-Dickstein_Committee_d8cb.html" title="McCormack-Dickstein Committee">McCormack-Dickstein Committee</a> committee. Why don't you mention that McCormack, the other half of the committee name, was a prominent democrat and leader of the house for several years? I made a laundry list of everyone on the committee, starting with McCormack, and I included that Dickstein was a Soviet spy (it appears like it was later erased by someone else). But this is not good enough for you--you want to completly discredit the entire article as a hoax, in the first paragraph, with highly POV, slanted points, some points which are clearly false.</p>

<p>"Rather odd here that people will have total faith in the weirdest stories (Dicksen-as-Soviet Spy) and yet distrust a two time medal of honor winner, whose testimony was confirmed in the house, and who had not only himself as a witness, (unlike Weinstein, and despite your repeated misleading edits), but also had three witnesses who collaberated his story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Veterans of Foreign Wars commander James Van Zandt, who told reporters that Butler had approached him to lead the 500,000-man march on Washington, but that he had refused.[12][13]</li>
<li>Captain Samuel Glazier—testifying under oath about plans of a plot to install a dictatorship in the United States. [14][15]</li>

<p>This are contributions to the article which you repeatedly ignore, because they do not match your own POV, edits which are also footnoted heavily. You continue to be misleading Rjensen. It is really annoying.</p>

How would you feel if someone changed <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Dickstein_%28congressman%29_11e0.html" title="Samuel Dickstein (congressman)">Samuel Dickstein (congressman)</a> and added the word "supposedly" throughout the paper.</p>
<p>I respect your edits and input to <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States_5048.html" title="Labor unions in the United States">Labor unions in the United States</a> but you are wrong here Rjensen. I fear you are simply too stubborn and bull headed to admit your mistakes, that you were wrong, that I now know more about the subject of the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Plot_26b5.html" title="Business Plot">Business Plot</a> then you do. I pray that you have the humility to admit that you are incorrect. I admit that I am wrong all the time. There is an unwritten rule on the internet chat boards that a person can never admit they are wrong. This is the achilles heel of so many macho bull headed men, which I exploit with glee all the time.</p>
<p>I agree with you on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Dickstein_%28congressman%29_11e0.html" title="Samuel Dickstein (congressman)">Samuel Dickstein (congressman)</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States_5048.html" title="Labor unions in the United States">Labor unions in the United States</a>, but the historical evidence clearly does not support your views here at <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Plot_26b5.html" title="Business Plot">Business Plot</a>.</p>

<dd>Well I don't want a fight but I don't want hoaxes here either. This is the most outlandish "plot" ever. Doi you honestly believe that America's richest bankers picked a far-left man with a wild reputation to be their boss?

<ul>
<li>The Dickstein evidence comes from the Soviet archives --as reported by Weinstein who is the Archivist of the United States--how much better authority than that?</li>
<li>Was there a coup? no. Was there an army funded and readied to march on Washington? no. Was there millions of dollars involved? no.</li>
<li>Were rich businessmen involved? very unlikely that they would have picked general Butler to be their leaser, don't you agree? The "evidence" comes from Spivak--have you read his Nation stories? He says Jews are taking over, Pretty raw anti-semitism!</li>
<li>Did Butler believe MacGuire's stories about a plot? probably--but he waited a year to reveal it, which seems odd.</li>
<li>Did MacGuire invent the stories? well yes I think so and so do the academic historians who have looked into the matter.</li>
<li>Did Dickstein have a motive to spread the hoax? yes if indeed he was closely associated with Communists who were trying to discredit capitalists.</li>
<li>Were any New Dealers involved? Not a shred of evidence has turned up.</li>
<li>Were any businessmen --besides Clark-- involved? Not a shred of evidence has turned up. The Clark evidence does not show any interest in a coup.</li>
<li>Verifiable evidence of a plot? Not enough for McCormick to take to Congress or the FBI. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 11:39, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Question 2:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Van Zandt says he only talked to Butler, no one else.</li>
<li>Medals of honor are given for heroism. Butler was drummed out of the Marines for wild exaggerated stroies about Mussolini that he heard from someone at a party. Weinstein was confirmed by the Senate for Archivist of the US.</li>

<li>I did read all the documents. All the info on the coup comes from 2 men (Butler and MacGuire). MacGuire was a con man from day 1 I agree.

<p>So, let me edit your edit, based on your acknowledgements, using your own statments above, and the sentence which you deleted (but kept the footnote):</p>
<p>"All of the inofrmation comes from testimony of five men, Van Zandt who said he was approached by leaders of the coup*, Captain Glazier testifying under oath about plans of a plot to install a dictatorship in the United States, and French who talked only to MacGuire and says he got the same story Butler got, Butler said MacGuire was organizing a coup that Butler was to lead; MacGuire denied it. Bank statements for $20,000 confirmed Butler story. In their final report, the Congressional committee supported Butler's allegations on the existence of the plot [2], but no prosecutions or further investigations followed, and the matter was mostly forgotten."</p>
<p><br />
Would you agree with this edit, if so, this is exactly what the article said before your edit.</p>
<p>True or false: all of the information came from Butler and MacGuire. TRUE OR FALSE. By your own acknowlegement, the word "all" really doesn't mean "all" does it? The majority, but not "all". <b>Would you agree that the sentence "all of the information came from Butler and MacGuire"? Yes or no?</b> Simple question.</p>
<p>*"Van Zandt says he only talked to Butler, no one else" your facts are incorrect, please go back and read the footnotes I provide. I await your retracation.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a> appeared to disagree: <i>"Allen Weinstein's word, that the material he looked at -- and which he doesn't have copies of to allow comparisons."</i> Butler had no paperwork, correct. Butler <b>did</b> have four people who corroborated there was some kind of plot. As I discuss fully in the article, I feel in a very even handed manner, that many historians scoff at the idea of the plot. What we do know is that MacGuire approached Butler, it was coroberated by French, a reporter. That Van Zandt and Glazier were also approached. Glazier was approached indepently. Glazier may not even have known Butler. We know that MacGuire was a liar and perged himself several times, and that the bank statments confirmed some portions of Butler's testimony. We know that the case was dropped and powerful names from the Congressional testimony were secretly deleted from the final report, and never called to testify which McCormick confirmed later to Spivak. This is all in the article already.</p>
<p>Now, if I were practicing law, and I had to choose between both cases, I would think that Butler's case is stronger. There is hard evidence supporting Butler's story--4 testimonies (in a court of law, testimonies are evidence)--one testimony which is completly independent of Butlers. There is very strong circumstantial evidence which supports Butlers claims about the money. In addition, MacGuire is a liar, and purges himself. There was a very strong case here, but it was dropped and clearly buried by the committee. Whereas you have the testimony of one man, Allen Weinstein, with no cooberation, and, unless you can document your assertion, no photocopies.</p>
<p>Ad homenien attacks on Weinstein and Butler prove nothing. In Butler's case, you not only have to destroy Butler's credibility, you have to destroy four people's credibility--one person who never even knew Butler. Thus far you have attempted to destroy Butler's credibility with evidence which shows that he was an outspoken person who told people how he felt--no matter how uncomfortable it is. Hardly daming evidence that he was lying.Travb 13:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok let's me go through them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1. Van Zandt. I have read his statement to reporters. He said that Butler talked to him, and no one else had approached him. Have you read his statement?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note 9: Schlesinger, p 85; Wolfe, Part IV: "But James E. Van Zandt, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and subsequently a Republican congressman , corroborated Butler's story and said that he, too, had been approached by "agents of Wall Street." "Zandt had been called immediately after the August 22 meeting with MacGuire by Butler and warned that...he was going to be approached by the coup plotters for his support at an upcoming VFW convention. <b>He said that, just as Butler had warned, he had been approached "by agents of Wall Street" who tried to enlist him in their plot."</b> I can find the newspaper clipping, I have it somewhere. Or you can admit that you are wrong. Your choice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2. Glazier had zero contact direct or indirect with Butler, MacGuire, Clark or any Am Liberty League person. He was talking about someone quite separate.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes or no: Captain Samuel Glazier testified under oath about plans of a plot to install a dictatorship in the United States.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>3. French got his information from MacGuire &amp; Butler.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes or no: French cooberated what Butler said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>4. Bank statements don't say anything about a plot, do they? We know that MacGuire was buying and selling municipal bonds for Clark--several million dollars worth. Having $20,000 in a bank account seems consistent with this. How does having the $ indicate there was a coup? Butler said there was millions of dollars involved--as surely there would have to be. Congress found $20k with no indication one penny went for nefarious expenses (like buying uniforms or guns). Odd coup with no guns, I guess.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It showed that MacGuire lied, repeatedly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>5. MacGuire was on salary of about $5000 a year. -- rather like $100,000 today. Nice but not rich on Wall Street.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, my apologies. You are probably right. Good catch.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>So let's say: ""All of the information comes from testimony of two men, Butler and MacGuire. Butler said MacGuire was organizing a coup that Butler was to lead; MacGuire denied it. In their final report, the Congressional committee supported Butler's story that MacGuire said there was a plot, but said it could not confirm MacGuire's role or the role of anyone else. No prosecutions or further investigations followed, and the matter was mostly forgotten. Historians dismiss MacGuire as a con man and perjurer." <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 12:31, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, you didn't really address how you can beleive the testimony against Dicksten, which has less evidence, and disregard the testimony of Butler. I guess it is ultimatly a matter of opinion on whether you are being hypocritical, but I think the average ordinary person would say "yes" you are, just as Claton was.Travb 12:45, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>New York Times Nov 23, 1934; Pg-3</i></dd>
<dd>Says Butler Described. Offer.</dd>
<dd>By The Associated Press.</dd>
<dd>HELENA, Mont., Nov. 22.—James E. Van Zandt of Altoona, Pa., National Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, reiterated here tonight that he had been approached by "agents of Wall Street" to lead a Fascist dictatorship in the United States under the guise of a “Veterans Organization.” The commander said General Butler informed him of the request to him less than two months ago. Butler told Van Zandt, the commander said, that Van Zandt had been selected to be one of the leaders of the organization, and that he would be approached by envoys at Louisville, Ky., during the V. F. W. convention. The commander said he informed Butler he would "not be in when the envoys called."</dd>
<dd>The V. F, W. chief said Butler then asked the agent what the purpose of the organization was. He was told it was to return the American dollar to the gold standard and to “get rid of this fellow in the White House.”</dd>

<dd>Actually almost all of the info comes from Butler. MacGuire denied everything to the committee so it did not come directly from him EXCEPT French did say (I think) that MacGuire said something similar to French as Butler reported. So French may be a second source regarding MacGuire. MacGuire was a con man and perjurer and it's very hard to figure out what he said to Butler. It's hard to see why Butler waited a year--surely a patriot would go to the FBI immediately?? <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 13:12, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Butler explained that he waited because he wanted to get more evidence. If he went to the feds (precusers to the FBI)--with no evidence, they would think he was a nut case. There were rumors of a plot, and so he felt like he couldn't wait any longer. He took what he got--his testimony and the testimony of three others, and broke the story. Glazier, to my knowledge (and please correct me if I am wrong) was completly independent but supported the idea of a plot. I need to study and take my son to school.

First the old information:</p>
<p><i>powerful financial interests made sure that the Commission's investigation stopped: its time was allowed to run out and its appeal to renew and continue its investigations was denied. In other words, the Commission was allowed to expire.</i></p>
<p>there is no evidence that "powerful financial interests made sure that the Commission's investigation stopped",</p>
<p>"its time was allowed to run out and its appeal to renew and continue its investigations was denied." is partially correct. The committee did run out, but I don't know of anyone who denied it.</p>
<p>"In other words, the Commission was allowed to expire." That is true, and is reflect in the new edit.</p>

<dd>BUTLER: [MacGuire said,] "They are for Douglas MacArthur as the head of it. Douglas MacArthur's term expires in November, and if he is not reappointed it is to be presumed that he will be disappointed and sore and they are for getting him to head it."</dd>

<dd>He [MacGuire] said, "There is going to be a big quarrel over the reappointment of MacArthur . . . you watch the President reappoint him. He is going to go right and if he does not reappoint him, he is going to go left."</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have been watching with a great deal of interest this quarrel over his reappointment to see how it comes out.

You just see how it goes and if I am not telling the truth."</dd>

<p>Anon, you have all your facts muddled. Butler went public about the allegations, he was not secretly infomring the subcommittee while speaking with MacGuire. This makes all of the rest of the information you provide, to my knowlege, incorrect.</p>

<p>...which is partially Rjsens edit, partially my own.</p>
<p>Why? space issues. Rjsen, <b>if you want to add this all back, you can, or better yet, you can write more about Spivak in the article</b>. The only reason that Spivak is important is not because of his hair brained conspiracy plots, but because he was unwittingly given the full congressional report, which he published.</p>
<p>As Historian Schmidt said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Journalist John L. Spivak, researching Nazism and anti-Semitism for New Masses magazine, got permission from Dickstein to examine HUAC's public documents and was (it seems unwittingly) given the unexpurgated testimony amid stacks of other papers. Spivak's two-part feature "Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy" appeared in early 1935, a month after the hearings closed. He cogently developed a case for taking the suppressed testimony seriously. But this relevant material was embellished with overblown aspersions against "Jewish financiers working with fascist groups"-a mishmash of guilt by association that connected Morgan interests with Jewish financier Felix Warburg, HUAC, and certain members of the American Jewish Committee. Spivak was intent upon grinding his own axes, and elucidation of the plot was obscured. The suppressed Butler-MacGuire conversations could hardly support all this. Moreover New Masses was left-wing with a limited readership; the scoop was stigmatized as "red" propaganda and generally not cited elsewhere." --From Schmidt, Hans <i>Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History</i> University Press of Kentucky(1998) ID=<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0813109574</a> p. 229.</dd>

<p>Again, please add back this info if you wish, I just want to keep the timeline short and succeint. (sp?) I added that Spivak wrote in a communist magazine, I figured that was a good comprimise: i didn't include his hair brain plots, but I didn't include the most important part either: he was unwittingly given the full congressional report. If McCormick hadn't had given him the full report, his article would have been forgotten.

<p>On Van Zandt. He gave an interview to Associated Press that was carried by the NY Times Nov 23, 1934 p 23. It's online through PROQUEST. He said Butler told him of the plot and that he (Van Z) "would be approached by envoys at Louisville, Ky, during the VFW convention. The commander said he informed Butler he 'would not be in when the envoys called.'" I read that as saying Van Zandt had not yet met with any plotters and he refused ever to meet them in the future. Who talked to van Zandt? apparently only Butler. Therefore Van Zandt does not provide any independent confirmation--he only repeated to the press what Butler told him. Schlesinger used the same NY Times source but misreads it. Van Zandt did not say that he had been approached directly by the plotters, he said he had been approached by Butler. Schlesinger thinks that Van Zandt met with plotters other than Butler, but Van Zandt never says that, saying instead he refused to meet with plotters. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>

<p>HELENA, Mont., Nov. 22.—James E.

Butler told Van Zandt, the commander said, that Van Zandt had been selected to be one of the leaders of the organization, and that he would be approached by envoys at Louisville, Ky., during the V.

<p>The V. F, W. chief said Butler then asked the agent what the purpose of the organization was. He was told it was to return the American dollar to the gold standard and to “get rid of this fellow in the White House.”</p>

F. W. convention. The commander said he informed Butler he would "not be in when the envoys called."</p>
<p>The V. F, W. chief said Butler then asked the agent what the purpose of the organization was. He was told it was to return the American dollar to the gold standard and to “get rid of this fellow in the White House.”<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." rel="nofollow">[27]</a></p>

<p><b>Re: The Politics of Upheaval by Jr., Arthur M. Schlesinger</b></p>
<p>This exact page was brought to my attention by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>. The sentence about Van Zandt was ignored. When I looked up The Politics of Upheaval by Jr., Arthur M. Schlesinger, which <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> was using to support his argument, it actually <b>contradicted several things <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> had claimed that the article said</b>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Business_Plot#Something_doesnt_jibe..." rel="nofollow">See evidence of this above.</a></p>
<p>Schlesinger sites a follow up New Masses article, and two articles in the NYT. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> brought the Nov 23, 1934 article to my attention, and I can't find the Nov 30 article (maybe you can <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>?). The New masses article is not online, Schmidt mentions it in his book <a href="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/butler01-by_schmidt.html" class="external text" title="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/butler01-by_schmidt.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Re: New York Times Nov 23, 1934; Pg-3</b></p>
<p>This article was brought to my attention by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>. In fairness, we both missed the sentence which said he was approached, until this week.</p>
<p><b>Re: Maverick Marine: by Schmidt, Hans</b></p>
<p>Schmidt states mention of Van Zandt is in the Philadelphia Record, 23 Nov. 1934, and somewhere in the NYT, I am not quite sure where. He cites completly different dates for the NYT article than Schlesinger and <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Van Zandt was obviously approached. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> says now that "Were there OTHERS in addition to Butler who approached Van Z? Maybe." I think this is the closest I will ever get to an admission that <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> was wrong.</p>
<p><b>Rhetorical Question for <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a></b></p>
<p>Do you ever come out and say you are wrong <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>? I do all the time, even in this article.</p>
<p><b>My concern</b> I am concerned about many of your edits, particularly your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=45111866&amp;oldid=45098935" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=45111866&amp;oldid=45098935" rel="nofollow">March 23 edits</a>, in which you deleted a lot of content which contradicted your point of view. You state that you were "cleaning out the speculation", your speculation included four footnoted entries from four different sources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the actual testimon of The House Un-American Committee,</li>
<li>two historians, and</li>
<li>a journalist.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition you deleted a photo, and two of the categories that this article is in. If I wasn't around to guard the article against such deletions, what else would you delete?</p>
<p>I have attempted really hard to assume good faith from the beginning.</p>
<p>I also admit. particularly later I was particularly [Wikipedia:Civility uncivil].</p>
<p>I am concerned because some of the ways you source information on this article has been shown to be questionable.</p>
<p>I repeatedly have rebutted a lot of your information, but you continue to argue and edit in partially and sometimes completely incorrect statments. It is a lot of work for me to go back and refine your broad, incorrect statments. I guess the article has expanded as a result of this dispute between the two of us.</p>
<p>I have to try to assume good faith. That said maybe you simply don't know that much about the business plot as I first assumed. This is my good faith assumption. My bad faith assumption we won't go into here, although in the heat of the moment, I have expressed my bad faith assuptions above.</p>
<p>Every single fact I am going to have to prove to you beyond a resonable doubt that it is correct. And even when I prove beyond a resonable doubt that you were incorrect. Cornered you will you ask rhetorical questions, such as this gem today: <i>Were there OTHERS in addition to Butler who approached Van Z? Maybe.</i> Would it be to much to admit that you were wrong on this one point?</p>
<p>There is an unspoken rule on web blogs that a person can never admit they are wrong. I argue this is people's weakness, their <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_Heel_0388.html" title="Achilles Heel">Achilles Heel</a>, not a strength. I ruthlessly exploit this weakness all the time.</p>
<p>Again, are you wrong on Van Van Zandt? By my lack of diplomacy, have I made it such a "face saving" issue that you can never admit that you are wrong? Travb 10:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well Schlesinger and I relied on the exact same news report from AP, printed in NY Times. It clearly says Butler approached Van Zandt about joining the plot in Sept 1934. Were there OTHERS in addition to Butler who approached Van Z? Maybe. I read headline as yes but the actual quotes as saying no. It certainly sounds like Butler was recruiting people as late as Sept 1934--why else did he approach Van Z? <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 08:51, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page was listed on <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_Opinion_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Third Opinion">Wikipedia:Third Opinion</a>. I'm not entirely sure what the point of the argument is, but based on the last few edits, it seems there's a disagreement over whether to, among other things, refer to this as an "alleged" plot or not. I would probably use the word, unless it has been proven in some court that this has happened. Similarly, it makes more sense to say someone testified that something is the case than to simply say it is true. It doesn't take away from the usefulness of the article, but does clarify where the story comes from. That said, attacks on those who testified in this case should be referenced. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 14:21, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be useful to look at a similar situation with <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Fitzgerald_e075.html" title="Jennifer Fitzgerald">Jennifer Fitzgerald</a>. Please remember that it is not up to a Wiki editor to decide what the truth of any situation is - that would be barred under NOR. It is up to a Wiki editor to report what the different sources say about something and to reference it. If Fred says there were Martians in his back garden and it is reported in the paper, it is not the Wiki editors's job to decide whether there really were Martians in the back garden. It is the editor's job to say that Fred said there were and to give the reference where this happened.</p>
<p>Obviously there will be many occasions when people do agree on a fact. There is no need to cite a reference for the fact that <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> happened, because there is an overwhelming consensus. However, when dealing with a situation where there is not such a concensus, then there is only one solution, which is simply that if something is referenced it can be used, and, under Wiki rules, if something isn't referenced, then any editor is entitled to delete it.</p>
<p>The discussion on this page is not valid, because the Wiki editors are discussing whether the plot is true or not. The editors' job is to report on other people's discussions about whether it is true or not.</p>
<p>It is certainly out of order to delete properly referenced material without a discussion and consensus.</p>
<p>I suggest also that the discussion is switched from the use of the second person to objective language, i.e. not "your edits", but "the edits", and also that expressions such as "your POV" are not used, as they make an assumption, which is in itself a POV (maybe justified, maybe not - that is irrelevant). The edits, at the end of the day, are not the property of any individual. They are the property of the community.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Contact me on my talk page if you want. Good luck - and look, at least you both care about it.</p>

<p><b>The word alleged</b></p>

<p>Yes and no. I accept the idea that this is an "alleged" plot. And currently have no problems with this plot being called "alleged", within reason. Some people use "alleged" and "claimed" as weapons, in this case they can be <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> there is a fine line. I have no problem in the first paragraph using the word "alleged". I think the word "testified" is more accurate than claimed when Butler and others are testifying in court. "Claimed" is okay when Van_Zandt speaks to the newspaper. As long as those words are used in moderation, and not as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry I was not clearer. I would have written more about the debate on <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_Opinion_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Third Opinion">Wikipedia:Third Opinion</a>, except that the rules on <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_Opinion_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Third Opinion">Wikipedia:Third Opinion</a> forbid no more than a sentence.</p>
<p><b>The underlying problem</b></p>
<p>The problem is really between myself and <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> has argued that their is no merit to this plot. His stand has remained consistent over the months. I have gone from a skeptic leaning toward believing the plot, to believing that their was a plot, based on my extensive research, forced upon me by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> edits. That is the one good point from this debate, I have learned so much, and the article is much better and much more detailed.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have comprimised with <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> and added the following information:</li>

<p>....The last two sections I added in detail, with footnoted references...</p>

<p><b>deletions in the first paragraph</b></p>
<p>But my comprimises have not been enough for <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a>, he continues to delete footnoted sections of the article, and continues to want to include all of the negative information, and <b>only the negative information</b> in the first paragraph. He has repeatedly erased this footnoted sentence:</p>
<p><i>In their final report, the Congressional committee supported Butler's allegations on the existence of the plot, [2]</i></p>
<p>...despite the Congressional committees footnoted final findings later in the article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Plot_26b5.html#Final_resolution" title="Business Plot">Business_Plot#Final_resolution</a></p>
<p>This sentence is actually a quote from a book which <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> actually first brought up on the talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=28936381&amp;oldid=28935732" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&amp;diff=28936381&amp;oldid=28935732" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, and actually <a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_Plot_cf63.html#Something_doesnt_jibe..." title="Talk:Business Plot">contrdicted what he was claiming</a> ):</p>

<p>Since I caught him in his contradiction months ago, he has not referenced anything he has written on this page. He has not added a single footnote that I recall. His edits increasing consist of deleting my footnoted work, and changing the wording of the article, deleting anything which does not fit his view of the plot, particularly in the first paragraph.

<dd>Hi Travb</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was only citing <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Fitzgerald_e075.html" title="Jennifer Fitzgerald">Jennifer Fitzgerald</a> because it was a deadlock between two editors. I went through, took out anything that was an editorial opinion or not referenced, and stored it on the talk page so it could be reinserted if/when a reference was found. All that was left was referenced material. Any editor challenging that would be in a weak position and would not get wider sympathy. As with this article, there is not a consensus either between editors or in the wider world as to the truth of the situation. The only solution is to represent the different/opposing points of view (I don't mean the editors' points of view, but the points of view "out there" in the world). I think the main problem is when there is a deadlock between editors, both get frustrated and act in a way that they wouldn't normally. It becomes a personal battle and wastes a lot of energy. I was in the beginnings of this with the <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saatchi_Gallery_abfe.html" title="Saatchi Gallery">Saatchi Gallery</a>, but as soon as it became apparent what was happening, I went to a third party <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> for a neutral opinion, followed that advice re. editing and said so on the talk page. Fortunately this resolved it. I have put this on my watch list. I'm glad you've called for help and let's hope things calm down.</dd>

<p>I would like to suggest that this article is edited with extreme caution in the near future. I request that any new information is only inserted in the article with a tight reference. Furthermore, I request that any editor who has inserted unreferenced material which is in any way a source of dispute removes that information themselves, and stores it in the section below for the time being, and that if unreferenced material is removed by any other editor, they accept that editor's right to do so under wiki rules.</p>
<p>If there is a difference of opinion as to how to reach any concluding statement, and two opposing sources are cited, the simple solution is to include both sources. If there is a conflict over which word(s) to use, again words should be taken from sources, and editors not attempt to make their own summary, unless a consensus can be reached.</p>

<p>I have to agree with <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">User:Tyrenius</a>. Although I wrote the majority of this article, and believe the plot was real, using the word "alleged" at the beginning of the article does not weaken the article at all. Unfortunatly no one was convicted of these crimes, so throughout history it will always be an "alleged" crime. That is not me "downplaying" the plot, because I have "up-played" the plot more than anyone on wikipedia. That is simply me being realistic. No convictions=alleged.

<p>I think that this article is needed and that any effort to delete it is a mistake. The fact that there were actually congressional hearings held about the topic, and there undeniably were, makes it <i>indisputably</i> encyclopedic IMO. Whether these hearings revealed anything over and above Gen. Butler having an overactive imagination is a different issue. (I believe that they did, but it seems to be true that the "proof" regarding the plot centers around Gen. Butler's on the record testimony, and not much else.) What we don't need, though, is a bunch of self-referential links back to this article. There are facts in dispute here, and what we need is links to outside sources showing the dispute in legitimate published sources. My effort has centered around removing links that just take one back to this article, as the link to the McCormick-Dickstein committee did.<a href="../../../r/l/q/User%7ERlquall_e541.html" title="User:Rlquall">Rlquall</a> 17:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think somebady made it all up. I have honestly never heard of some plot by a bunch of businessmen against Roosevelt before. There was a plot against Reagen that is mentioned in history, but this is questionable. I don't see any believeable evidence in this article, either. If people were trying to murder the president in the 1930s, wouldn't they have been executed in jail in a famous news story? It is ludicrous to suggest that a plot on a president's life in that time period would happen with no references in a history book. 205.166.61.142 19:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I first came across this in a syndicated broadcast of <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Angels_f1a5.html" title="City of Angels">City of Angels</a></i> &amp; didn't even (really) believe Smedley Butler was real. (With a name like that?) Baseless? Maybe. Implausible? Certainly. Yet desperate people do odd things, &amp; a lot of powerful people were almost certain FDR was a dangerous Socialist, if not a Communist. Might they have trusted Butler? Or thought they could manipulate him? German industrialists were sure they could manipulate Hitler... <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 04:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this is a misusage of the word "paradoxically." I had tried to address this in a previous post, which was somehow deleted. The sentence itself seemed to be extraneous, so I deleted it. I meant to post it here for the consideration of everyone else, but I appear to have made a slight mistake. 24.184.52.69 19:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article was anti-Jewish. I changed the sentence slightly. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 19:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
