<p>In 1989, the oil and automotive industries and the National Association of Manufacturers created the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Climate_Coalition_44af.html" title="Global Climate Coalition">Global Climate Coalition</a> (GCC) to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming. In 1997, when the Senate overwhelmingly passed a resolution against ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the industry funded a $13 million industry advertising blitz in the run-up to the vote.<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/snowed.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/snowed.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In 1998 the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> published an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Petroleum_Institute_d793.html" title="American Petroleum Institute">American Petroleum Institute</a> (API) memo outlining a strategy aiming to make "recognition of uncertainty ... part of the 'conventional wisdom.'"<a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/documents/3860_GlobalClimateSciencePlanMemo.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/documents/3860_GlobalClimateSciencePlanMemo.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The memo has been compared to a late 1960s memo by tobacco company <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_and_Williamson_af8b.html" title="Brown and Williamson">Brown and Williamson</a>, which observed: "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/some_like_it_hot.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/some_like_it_hot.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Those involved in the memo included Jeffrey Salmon, then executive director of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_C._Marshall_Institute_fc99.html" title="George C.

<p>In 2002 the GCC considered its work in the US against regulation on global warming to have been so successful that it "deactivated" itself,<a href="http://www.globalclimate.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalclimate.org/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> although the loss of some leading members may also have been a factor.</p>
<p>At the same time, since 1989 many previously skeptical oil and automobile industry corporations have changed their position as the political and scientific consensus has grown, with the creation of the Kyoto Protocol and the publication of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Panel_on_Climate_Change_bf89.html" title="International Panel on Climate Change">International Panel on Climate Change</a>'s Second and <a href="../../../i/p/c/IPCC_Third_Assessment_Report_92b4.html" title="IPCC Third Assessment Report">Third Assessment Reports</a>.

<p>In 2004 <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Re_4770.html" title="Swiss Re">Swiss Re</a>, the world's second largest reinsurance company, warned that the economic costs of climate-related disasters threatened to reach $150 billion a year within ten years.<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2005/09/911_in_new_orleans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2005/09/911_in_new_orleans.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Their predictions came true in 2005/06 with huge losses for the Re-insurance industry due to weather related phenominon. There is debate as to whether the increased hurricane activity in the US and elsewhere is due to climate change or rather cyclical norms. But for the world's largest re-insurers such as Swiss Re and Munich Re they know that climate change is a huge threat to their businesses - affecting the predictability and stability on which they rely - and that what has started to happen, largely due to warmer seas (especially in the Gulf of Mexico) is mirroring their predictions worryingly.</p>

<p>Businesses take action on climate change for several reasons. Action improves corporate image and better aligns corporate actions with the environmental interests of owners, employees, suppliers, and customers. Action also occurs to reduce costs, increase return on investments, and to reduce dependency on uncontrollable costs.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_action_on_climate_change.html" title="Edit section: Increased energy efficiency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Increased energy efficiency</span></h3>
<p>For many companies, looking at more efficient usage of energy can pay off in the medium to long term; unfortunately, shareholders need to be satisfied in the short term, so regulatory intervention is often required, to encourage prudent conservation measures. However, as carbon intensity starts to show up on balance books through organizations such as the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_Disclosure_Project_6f95.html" title="Carbon Disclosure Project">Carbon Disclosure Project</a>, voluntary action is starting to take place.</p>
<p>Recently there has been a spate of companies acting to improve their energy efficiency. Possibly the most prominent of these companies is <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the US, has announced specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores and pressure its 60,000 suppliers in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead. On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% over the next three years and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg. This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year. The company also wants to build a store that is at least 25% more energy efficient within four years.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_action_on_climate_change.html" title="Edit section: Use of renewable energies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Use of renewable energies</span></h3>
<p>In August 2002, the largest gathering of ministers in the history of the world met at the World Summit on Sustainable Development <a href="http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/portal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/portal.html" rel="nofollow">WSSD</a> in Johannesburg. The global environmental community discussed the role of renewables and energy efficiency in lowering carbon emissions, mitigating poverty reduction (energy access) and improving energy security. One result from WSSD was the formation of <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/partnerships/partnerships.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/partnerships/partnerships.htm" rel="nofollow">Partnerships for Sustainable Development</a> to carry forward the international dialogue on sustainable energy and its role in the energy mix.</p>
<p>Partnerships formed include the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_Energy_and_Energy_Efficiency_Partnership_5e1e.html" title="Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership">Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership</a> <a href="http://www.reeep.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.reeep.org/" rel="nofollow">REEEP</a>, the Global Village Energy Partnership <a href="http://www.gvep.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.gvep.org/" rel="nofollow">GVEP</a>, the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC), and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development <a href="http://www.gnesd.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.gnesd.org/" rel="nofollow">GNESD</a>.</p>
<p>Renewable energies and renewable energy technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts. These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous studies have shown that the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company. A happier workforce is a more productive workforce.</p>
<p>More directly, the high oil and gas prices of 2005 have only added to the attraction of renewable energy sources. Although most renewable energies are more expensive at current fuel prices, the difference is narrowing, and uncertainty in oil and gas markets is a factor worth considering for highly energy-intensive businesses.</p>
<p>Another factor affecting the uptake of renewable energies in Europe is the EU Energy Trading Scheme (ETS or EUTS). Many large businesses are fined for increases in emissions, but can sell any "excess" reductions they make.</p>
<p>Companies with high-profile renewable energy portfolios include an aluminium smelter (<a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcan.html" title="Alcan">Alcan</a>), a cement company (<a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafarge.html" title="Lafarge">Lafarge</a>), and a microchip manufacturer (<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a>). Many examples of corporate leadership in this area can be found on the website of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_Group_2a0e.html" title="Climate Group">The Climate Group</a>, an independent organization set up for promoting such action by business and government.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_action_on_climate_change.html" title="Edit section: Carbon offsets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Carbon offsets</span></h3>
<p>The principle of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_offset.html" title="Carbon offset">carbon offset</a> is fairly simple: a business decides that it doesn't want to contribute further to global warming, and it has already made efforts to reduce its carbon (dioxide) emissions, so it decides to pay someone else to further reduce its net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies. Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees -- or not emitted due to funding of renewable energy deployment -- offsets the emissions from fossil fuel use. In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or tree planting -- particularly in developing nations -- can be a relatively cheap way of making an event, project, or business "carbon neutral". Many carbon offset providers -- some as inexpensive as $0.10 per ton of carbon dioxide -- are referenced in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_offset.html" title="Carbon offset">Carbon Offset</a> article of this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Many businesses are now looking to carbon offset all their work. An example of a business going carbon neutral is <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>: their <b>2006 World Cup</b> Final will be carbon neutral. FIFA estimate they are offsetting one hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide created by the event, largely as a result of people travelling there. Other carbon neutral companies include the bank <a href="../../../h/s/b/HSBC_f8f8.html" title="HSBC">HSBC</a>, the consumer staples manufacturer <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie%27s_Homegrown_f57b.html" title="Annie's Homegrown">Annie's Homegrown</a>, world leading society publisher <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwell_Publishing_6c48.html" title="Blackwell Publishing">Blackwell Publishing</a>, and the publishing house New Society Publishers. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> newspaper also offsets its carbon emissions resulting from international air travel.</p>
