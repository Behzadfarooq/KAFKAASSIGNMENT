	    <p>This category should stay - it's intended for leaders who have really made a mark in the business world, and is intended to be a subset of people who were involved in business.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, marking this for deletion borders on vandalism - simply asserting that it is redundant to another category and therefore must go, does nothing for the quality of WP. If there are two categories that seem to cover the same topic, it would be more appropriate to a) ask how one is different from the other; and b) discuss which one is more useful. In any event, it is hard to see what the benefit is of <i>deleting</i> categories. Seems to me that it's better to have one too many than one too few. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:20, 2005 Mar 31 (UTC)</p>

<p>This category was created on 24 February 2005. It is a clear duplicate of long established and far more widely used <a href="../../../b/u/s/Category%7EBusinesspeople_d3b5.html" title="Category:Businesspeople">category:Businesspeople</a> - a business person who wasn't in a leadership position doesn't merit an article. It isn't a subcategory of any other category, and some very prominent people like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Welch_253f.html" title="Jack Welch">Jack Welch</a> are marooned in it. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 23:30, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The creator of this category removed the nomination, and I have replaced it. I believe it is basically a one-man fork. He apparently intends it to be equivalent to a "Great Writers" category or the like, and such point of view categories have been deprecated. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 23:56, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It appears that Wincoote has taken it upon himself/herself to be the category police, based on little else but his/her own judgment. It only standds to reason that a longer-standing category would have more entries, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a better category, nor that it is a "duplicate" of the oh-so awkwardly named and overcrowded "businesspeople." I would propose that a better and more civic approach would be to make an entry in the discussion section of each category so that the creators can discuss it. This is the kind of behavior that discourages participation in all this. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:29, 2005 Mar 31 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the proper approach is to use the official forum. Yes, I am working on the category system, which is an entirely legitimate Wikipedia activity. The discussion should not be controlled by the creator of the category. Your criticisms of the other category up to now, both here and on my user page, have been mere abuse. You have not provided any response to my points about the duplication and point of view issues. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 05:05, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have read the policy on categorizing people, and you simply don't have a basis for your efforts to delete categories. The guiding principle should be to add rather than remove information - I'm all for rationalizing categories, but information shouldn't be lost in the process. The deletion of "industrialists," for example, was a destructive act, and if I'd been aware of it, I would have made every effort to stop it. I don't know anything about you besides what you're doing here, and I find it reprehensible. That's my opinion. As for your interpretation of what this category is supposed to accomplish, you'd do better to ask rather than assume. Anyone with knowledge of the individuals listed would know what the category is intended for, even if the definition needs work. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:29, 2005 Mar 31 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have set up a wikiproject to clean up the whole business category. Please consult <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Business_world_40d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Business world">Wikipedia:WikiProject Business world</a>

<li><b>Keep</b>, business leaders are an obvious subset of business people. And could Wincoote kindly cut down on the personal attacks here? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:40, Mar 31, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you (a) define the difference between a business person who is a leader and one who is a business leader and one who isn't in a way that isn't open to debate in every single case. <s>(b) desist from accusing me of personal attacks in one discussion after another, completely without regard to how I have behaved and how the other person has behaved. I am believe I am clearly the victim here. It is outragous that <i>you</i> commit one personal attack on me after another, while treating me like I'm some sort of monster and you are an angel of righteousness.</s> <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 00:23, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since many people accuse you of making personal attacks, you should consider if they are in fact correct.</li>
<li>Anyway, to answer your question, a business person is someone who works in business (and presumably has done something noteworthy, or the article might get deleted as vanity). A business leader is the leader (CEO, for instance) of a business. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:19, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's all calm down here, folks. This is going to work like every other CFD. People who care to vote will, and at the end of the week we'll do what the consensus says. No point arguing about it. -<a href="../../../k/b/d/User%7EKbdank71_f952.html" title="User:Kbdank71">Kbdank71</a> 15:55, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
