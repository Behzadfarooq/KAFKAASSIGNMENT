<p>My afd nomination seems to have stirred up a hornets nest, but as I've stated over there Wikipedia should provide insight and knowledge, and not just indiscriminate information. I think a good strategy for articles on Buses in Sydney would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the nominated articles</li>
<li>Expand this article so that is includes:
<ul>
<li>More historical information</li>
<li>A discussion on the importance of bus transport in Sydney</li>
<li>Some patronage information (current and historical)</li>
<li>Information about regulation and political issues</li>
<li><i>Detailed information on all routes is not needed</i>. It isn't important that the 316 runs every 30 minutes, or that 132 (and 133) travels between Manly Wharf and Warringah Mall. <i>Some</i> current route information is useful though, such as a description of the suburbs serviced and the main corridors (eg Military Rd, Anzac Pde). A link to www.131500.info should be prominent so that readers who need timetable information can find it.</li>
<li>References for the above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As this article becomes large, split it into smaller articles, either:
<ul>
<li>Articles covering specific knowledge for the whole of Sydney (eg Regulation of buses in Sydney), or</li>
<li>Geographic specific articles (eg Buses in Sydney's eastern suburbs) that cover local bus history, the importance of buses in that area, and general information on routes. Possibly articles that also cover trams, trains and ferrys (eg Public transport in Sydney's eastern suburbs) would be better for these though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about the kind of article that could make a featured article, and what it would contain. It certainly wouldn't just be a list of bus routes.</p>
<p>I'll do some research, and help out on expanding this article. What do others think about these ideas? What do others think should be included in articles on Sydney's buses?--<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 02:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some level of information on the <b>Route numbering system</b> would be nice. That is, are routes just allocated a number in the order they are drawn on a map? Is there a map that says "Routes starting here have route numbers starting with 1, if they start here it starts with 2..."&#160;? That is <b>encyclopaedic information</b>. The number of the bus route that runs from Central Station to Circular Quay via whatever road, is <b>trivia</b> or <b>directory information</b> best left to <a href="http://131500.info" class="external text" title="http://131500.info" rel="nofollow">131500.info</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 04:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with both points. Out of curiosity, does anyone know when the current numbering system started being used? Photos of buses prior to the 1950s don't seem to use the current system:<a href="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?388317,I" class="external autonumber" title="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?388317,I" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?389146,I" class="external autonumber" title="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?389146,I" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?36237,I" class="external autonumber" title="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?36237,I" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?7897,I" class="external autonumber" title="http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/ENQ/PM/FULL1?7897,I" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> .

<dd>Most of the routes in the 1950s were pure replacements for the tram lines that were being removed, so they followed the tram lines and therefore (as was the convention with the tramways), did not carry route numbers. By the early 1960's when all tram lines had been removed, this situation became untenable and the current route numbering system came into play, at least amongst the government run areas. I can't vouch for the private company areas- they seemed to just do what they liked with route numbers until the early 1990's when the private company areas were reorganised into the current 3 digit route number system. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuaidy_ad92.html" title="User:Quaidy">Quaidy</a> 21:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With no references, the entire article probably needs to be regarded as OR. I think a lot of the historical info on the Sydney public transport articles is from railpage.org.au<a href="http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/sydhist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/sydhist.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, I'm not sure of its reliability as a secondary source, but it does list some books etc that would make good sources. Anyway, STA buses do cover all of the tram routes out of Circular Quay, though they probably don't all follow exactly the same route as the trams did. And of course not every STA bus route follows an old tram route. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 05:05, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think its a fairly well established fact that the <i>area</i> that the STA bus network covers is the area that the tram network formerly covered, as most of the bus routes were direct replacements of the tram lines as they progressively closed. Of course, the route network expanded and the routes themselves were altered over the 50 years since the trams were replaced. But the point is that it is the main reason taht the STA essentailly does not operate in any graet density in areas further west than they do, apart from recent additions such as the TWay. It is hard to find online references for such information.203.10.55.11 05:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're still misreading the concept of original research, Garrie. Unsourced doth not equal OR.

<p>This page is ideal for covering bus company names, the regulatory framework and the general role of buses in the Sydney public transport network. The information on the individual routes, and the infrastructure that serves them, is better delegates to more region-specific pages. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 10:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The information has now been updated and sorted by region, and linked back to the main page. Pages covering interchanges, suburbs and bus companies can now be linked to more specific bus information. The 100 series etc articles seem unlikely to be deleted, now that the nominator's concerns have been addressed. A list of bus routes in Sydney, without the context of their history and accompanying infrastructure, borders on a directory - something Wikipedia is not. There is still scope for a general <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buses_in_Sydney_3ffd.html" title="Buses in Sydney">Buses in Sydney</a> page beneath <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Sydney_1495.html" title="Transport in Sydney">Transport in Sydney</a>: regulatory frameworks, the role of buses in the wider network and issues facing the bus industry as a whole. The expanding lists were cool, I won't deny it, but were they compatible with old browsers?</p>
<p>In truth, I'm mystified that you would want <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_series_bus_routes%2C_Sydney_8fdb.html" title="100 series bus routes, Sydney">100 series bus routes, Sydney</a> and its sister pages deleted.

<dd>I'm actually with Quaidy on that one - the 100 series bus routes are a fairly arbitrary concept for an article, as was the case with your merged ferry articles, and some of your proposed expansions above. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't want to question your knowledge of the Sydney bus network, Rebecca, but on routes in the MoT's system, the first digit of the route numbers is by no means arbitrary. Buses would be as difficult to sort by region as trains, part of their role is to move between regions. You can see from the template that buses fit rather neatly into 14 categories this way, allowing more specific articles on history and infrastructure. As for your comment on ferries, again without wanting to question your knowledge of the network, these areas are formed on the basis of the divisions set out in the agency's annual report. As a bonus, they also probably accord with a casual observation - specific ferry routes are invisible, and subject to change. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 08:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
