<p><b>Bushwhacking</b> was a form of <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> that was particularly prevalent in rural areas where there were sharp divisions between those favoring the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28Civil_War%29_7a13.html" title="Union (Civil War)">Union</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a> in the conflict. The people doing the attacks were called <b>bushwhackers</b>.</p>
<p>Bushwhackers were not, generally, part of the military command and control of either side. While bushwackers conducted a few well organized raids in which they burned cities, most of the attacks involved ambushes (hence, the term) of opponent individuals or families in rural areas. In areas affected by bushwhacking the actions were particularly insidious since it amounted to a fight of neighbor against neighbor and the attacks bordered on <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigilante.html" title="Vigilante">vigilante</a> justice. Since the attacks were non-uniformed, the government response was complicated by trying to decide whether they were legitimate military attacks or <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal.html" title="Criminal">criminal</a> actions.</p>

<p>The term was widely used during the conflict, though it came to be particularly associated with the guerrillas of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, where such warfare was most intense. Guerrilla warfare also wracked <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and northern <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, among other locations.</p>
<p>Pro-Union guerrilla fighters in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> were called <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayhawkers.html" title="Jayhawkers">jayhawkers</a>. They used very similar tactics as the bushwhackers. One of the most vicious actions during the Civil War by the bushwackers was the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Massacre_5c0b.html" title="Lawrence Massacre">Lawrence Massacre</a>.</p>
<p>In some areas, particularly the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian_Mountains_5657.html" title="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachian regions</a> of Tennessee and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, the term <i>bushwhackers</i> was used for Union partisans who attacked Confederate forces. During the <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gettysburg_Campaign_c04d.html" title="Gettysburg Campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvanian</a> civilians at times bushwhacked stragglers from the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Northern_Virginia_5129.html" title="Army of Northern Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Partisan_rangers" id="Partisan_rangers"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwhacker.html" title="Edit section: Partisan rangers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Partisan rangers</span></h2>
<p>In most areas, irregular warfare operated as an adjunct to conventional military operations. The most famous such "partisan ranger" (to use the title adopted by the Confederate government in formally authorizing such insurgents) was Col. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Singleton_Mosby_c202.html" title="John Singleton Mosby">John Singleton Mosby</a>, who carried out raids on Union forces in the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shenandoah_Valley_5603.html" title="Shenandoah Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>.</p>
<p>In Missouri, however, secessionist bushwhackers operated outside of the Confederate chain of command. On occasion, a prominent bushwhacker chieftain might receive formal Confederate rank (notably <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Clarke_Quantrill_7541.html" title="William Clarke Quantrill">William Clarke Quantrill</a>), or receive written orders from a Confederate general (as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_T._Anderson_31e3.html" title="William T. Anderson">"Bloody Bill" Anderson</a> did in October 1864 during a large-scale <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_Army_46d5.html" title="Confederate States Army">Confederate</a> incursion into Missouri, or as when <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_C._Porter_b6e4.html" title="Joseph C. Porter">Joseph C. Porter</a> was authorized by Gen. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling_Price_4982.html" title="Sterling Price">Sterling Price</a> to recruit in northeast Missouri). For the most part, however, Missouri's bushwhacker squads were self-organized groups of young men, predominantly from the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States_48b1.html" title="History of slavery in the United States">slave</a> holding counties along the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri_River_243a.html" title="Missouri River">Missouri</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi</a> rivers, who took it upon themselves to attack Federal forces and their Unionist neighbors, both in Kansas and in response to Federal invasions of their home state.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwhacker.html" title="Edit section: Jesse James">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jesse James</span></h2>
<p>The guerrilla conflict in Missouri was, in many respects, a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a> within the Civil War. One of the most famous men who fought as a bushwhacker was <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_James_ee9c.html" title="Jesse James">Jesse James</a>, who began to fight in 1864. During months of often intense combat, he only battled fellow Missourians, ranging from Missouri regiments of U.S. Volunteer troops to state <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a> to unarmed Unionist civilians. The single confirmed instance of him exchanging fire with Federal troops from another state occurred a month after the surrender of Confederate General <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, during a near-fatal encounter with <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> cavalrymen. In the course of the war, his mother was arrested, his stepfather tortured, and his family banished temporarily from Missouri by state militiamen—all Unionist Missourians.</p>
<p><a name="Atrocities" id="Atrocities"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwhacker.html" title="Edit section: Atrocities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Atrocities</span></h2>
<p>As is often the case in insurgencies, the conflict with Confederate bushwhackers everywhere rapidly escalated into a succession of atrocities committed by both sides. Union troops often executed or tortured suspects without trial and burned the homes of suspected guerrillas and those suspected of aiding or harboring them. Where credentials were suspect, the accused bushwhacker was often executed, as in the case of Lt. Col. <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisby_McCullough_f2c6.html" title="Frisby McCullough">Frisby McCullough</a> after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kirksville_77df.html" title="Battle of Kirksville">Battle of Kirksville</a>. Bushwhackers frequently went house to house, executing Unionist farmers.</p>
<p>In response to the Kansas Jayhawkers sacking <a href="../../../o/s/c/Osceola%2C_Missouri_a7f7.html" title="Osceola, Missouri">Osceola, Missouri</a>, in which the entire town was set aflame and nearly all of the male residents killed, and the collapse of a <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, jail in which female relatives of bushwhackers were incarcerated and many killed in the colapse, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Quantrill_6f7f.html" title="William Quantrill">Bill Quantrill</a> led a raid in August 1863 on <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence%2C_Kansas_0426.html" title="Lawrence, Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>, burning the town and murdering some 200 men and boys. In response, the Union district commander, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Ewing%2C_Jr._1d3a.html" title="Thomas Ewing, Jr.">Thomas Ewing, Jr.</a>, ordered the depopulation of all men, women, and children (both Unionists and Southern sympathizers) three and a half Missouri counties along the Kansas border from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a> south under the infamous Order No. 11. (The Missouri-Kansas conflict was in many ways a continuation of <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding_Kansas_59d7.html" title="Bleeding Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a> violence.) In other areas, individual families (including that of Jesse and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_James_2d82.html" title="Frank James">Frank James</a> and the grandparents and mother of future President <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Truman_9c27.html" title="Harry Truman">Harry Truman</a>) were banished from Missouri.</p>
<p>Next to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lawrence_c27f.html" title="Battle of Lawrence">attack on Lawrence</a>, perhaps the most notorious atrocity conducted by Confederate bushwhackers was the murder of 22 unarmed Union soldiers pulled from a train in the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centralia_Massacre_%28Missouri%29_7071.html" title="Centralia Massacre (Missouri)">Centralia Massacre</a>. In an ambush of pursuing Union forces shortly thereafter, the bushwhackers executed all of their prisoners, killing well over 100 Federal troops. In October 1864, "Bloody Bill" Anderson was tricked into an ambush and killed by state militiamen under the command of Col. Samuel P. Cox. Anderson's body was displayed by the jubilant citizens, and his head was severed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwhacker.html" title="Edit section: Postwar banditry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Postwar banditry</span></h2>
<p>After the end of the war, the survivors of Anderson's band (including the James brothers) remained together under the leadership of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Clement_e88c.html" title="Archie Clement">Archie Clement</a>, one of Anderson's lieutenants, and began a series of armed robberies in February 1866. This group became known as the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James-Younger_Gang_9983.html" title="James-Younger Gang">James-Younger Gang</a>, after the death or capture of the older outlaws (including Clement) and the addition of former bushwhacker <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cole_Younger_982e.html" title="Cole Younger">Cole Younger</a> and his brothers. In December 1869, Jesse James became the most famous of this group when he emerged as the prime suspect in the robbery of the Daviess County Savings Association in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallatin%2C_Missouri_63b8.html" title="Gallatin, Missouri">Gallatin, Missouri</a>, and the murder of the cashier, John W. Sheets. During Jesse's flight from the scene, he declared that he had killed Samuel P. Cox and had taken revenge for Anderson's death. (Cox lived in Gallatin, and the killer apparently mistook Sheets for the former militia officer.) Throughout Jesse James' criminal career, he often wrote to the newspapers with pride of his role as a bushwhacker, rallying the support of former Confederates and other Missourians who had been brutalized by Federal authorities during the Civil War and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>.</p>
<p>In 1867, near <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada%2C_Missouri_18a9.html" title="Nevada, Missouri">Nevada, Missouri</a>, a band of bushwhackers shot and killed Sheriff <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Bailey_%28general%29_88bf.html" title="Joseph Bailey (general)">Joseph Bailey</a>, a former Union brigadier general, who was attempting to arrest them.</p>
