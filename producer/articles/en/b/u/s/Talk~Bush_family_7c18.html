<p>This article has to be wrong. It says that Richard Bush, who died in 1732, was the father of Timothy Bush, who was born in 1761. There is also a quote from the book "The Faith of George W. Bush" which must refer to Obadiah Bush but seems to refer to Richard Bush. Does anyone know the facts here?</p>
<p><br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>According to the current (31 October 2005) page, Richard Bush's son Timothy was born in 1735, not 1761. But that would still make it a looooooong pregnancy.</p>

<dd><i>Bush and Kerry are first cousins, seven times removed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I seriously doubt that. My first cousin once removed is either the child of my first cousin or the first cousin of my parent. My first cousin twice removed is either the grandchild of my first cousin or the first cousin of my grandparent. In order for Bush and Kerry to be first cousins seven times removed they would have to be seven generations apart from each other, which seems highly unlikely. I suspect they are actually seventh cousins (i.e. Edmund Read and Elizabeth Cooke are the great<sup>6</sup>-grandparents of both men), or perhaps seventh cousins once removed (i.e. Edmund and Elizabeth are the great<sup>6</sup>-grandparents of one and either the great<sup>5</sup>- or the great<sup>7</sup>-grandparents of the other). Can someone doublecheck this, please? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 12:03, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was about to make the same comment. Even 7th cousin seems too close, unless there was later intermarriage between the two families than mentioned in this article. Their common ancestor lived over 3 centuries ago. There'd be too many generations for them to only be 7th cousins, if that is indeed their most recent common ancestor - <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 19:26, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm double-checking this, but based on the Bush family tree I have, he and Kerry are actually 9th cousins three times removed. (For most people that's a population that tops 10 million. Only notable in that it's a <i>recorded</i> genealogy, which after a few generations most people are lucky to have at all.) --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says that the Bushes are the first Presidents descended from Indians, but several of President Coolidge's biographers said the same about him.

<dd>Coolidge himself reportedly acknowledged some Indian ancestry. Apart from that, the existence of Mary Hyanno (the Bushes' supposed Indian ancestor) is uncorroborated. And the article's flat assertion that no other U.S. president had any Indian ancestry is both impossible to know and highly unlikely. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquib_71a8.html" title="User:Squib">Squib</a> 00:20, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The Bush family is sometimes said to have Native American ancestry. Robert Bolling Jr. (a 10th-generation ancestor of George W. Bush) is the son of Robert Bolling and Anne Stith, whom Bolling married after the death of his first wife, Jane Rolfe, a granddaughter of Pocahontas. [2]"</dd>

<p>this should be removed, neither robert bolling nor anne stith were indians, so therefore none of the bush family are. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.189.246.113 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.189.246.113.html" title="User talk:209.189.246.113">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.189.246.113_3ed8.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.189.246.113">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I kinda see your point, but it was mentioned in Salon and other places, so it's notable. I reworded a bit so it's clear that we're not just including direct ancestors in this section.

<p>um no, you can read it so deal with it.</p>
<p>the point is that none of the bush family is blood related to native "americans" so it should be removed, ancestry is blood. hypothetically, would you want your fathers original wifes'(aka not your mother) (who later died or was "removed") family mentioned in your family history?</p>

<p>I had noticed the date myself and hoped to look into it further. For the time being I've rewritten the Richard/Timothy relationship explanations to conform to the document at wargs.com, which seems pretty reliable (calling a conjecture a conjecture). It's quite possibly a question that will never be resolved, of course.</p>
<p>As for Mans Andersson, it's interesting that there's a Swedish ancestor, but that's less than 1% of the current President's genetic make-up, so it doesn't belong in the intro (why not list all the Irish, German, and whatever else too). Some people view genealogy as a kind of panning for gold (look! a king!), others take a more jaded view like Mark Humphrys. <a href="http://humphrysfamilytree.com/famous.descents.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humphrysfamilytree.com/famous.descents.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I'm well convinced of the latter, besides, very often the "minor" members of a family have just as interesting stories to tell (I recently beefed up <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Smith_Bush_6ff2.html" title="James Smith Bush">James Smith Bush</a>, for example -- wow). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 23:51, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, to be on Forbes you have to have at least US$1 billion. A recent WaPo article analyzed George W.'s personal wealth at $10-35M (Cheney is well over $100M), and his dad has been pegged previously in the low single-digit millions. Some of the banker siblings like Bucky may well be worth more than Dubya.

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean by such a cutesy response, but being listed in Burke's is not the same as being "old European nobility". Certainly not directly. Bush is more closely related to Churchill than to anyone in the British royal family. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sort of glad you took the burden to mention the cousinship to Churchill too. But - of course - theres a remarkabel connexion with old European nobility too. Both facts I can't find in the article as yet. <a href="../../../i/_/l/User%7EI_like_Burke%27s_Peerage_fd09.html" title="User:I like Burke's Peerage">I like Burke's Peerage</a> 08:53, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but if your argument is as it seems that the name Bush <i>all by itself</i> indicates pedigree, I'm afraid you're reaching. The earliest American Bush, Richard, was some kind of scoundrel and the (bastard?) son Timothy was just a blacksmith, which does not especially suggest a tony background. It's much more interesting to me that they came from such origins rather than with a silver <s>foot</s> spoon and all. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it worth including her? She is the fourth cousin, 3 and 4 times removed, of the two Presidents, respectively, closer than the related Presidents mentioned.--Chuljin 18:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for asking. My personal opinion is that notability requires some connection, e.g. similar profession or some kind of interaction. Related Presidents of a President is notable, a cousin he knew personally would be, but there are literally scores of notable individuals connected to the Bush family. This is not, however, notable, as it mainly reflects their extensive New England heritage. Most people do not have their Xth cousins Yth removed fully researched, but because of their notability, the Bush family does. I've placed information about <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christie_Todd_Whitman_5f4f.html" title="Christie Todd Whitman">Christie Todd Whitman</a> (in-law) and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Kean_9b45.html" title="Tom Kean">Tom Kean</a> (cousin) in their respective articles because the family connection is notable in light of their appointments to key positions. Ultimately, although Wikipedia <i>could</i> include such information, we're <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate listing</a> of trivia. We <i>could</i> list every relative <a href="http://www.wargs.com/political/bush.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wargs.com/political/bush.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> with a Wikipedia article, but that wouldn't be very useful to anyone, and it would create a false sense that the Bush family is uniquely blessed with famous relatives, just because we've gone to the trouble to list them all. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:36, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I'd been looking for some time for a higher-quality version of the one <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/01/images/20050119-9_p44277-146-515h.html" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/01/images/20050119-9_p44277-146-515h.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, from the 2005 inauguration. It's probably the most "complete" one there is. Yours has the same low-resolution problem (although it's funny to see the President showing off his socks, maybe that's why!), but has a few more cousins. <a href="http://pristina.usmission.gov/images6/dos9b.jpg" class="external text" title="http://pristina.usmission.gov/images6/dos9b.jpg" rel="nofollow">This one</a> has most of the President's generation, but not his dad's siblings.

<dd>I still prefer the photograph I found because it seems to have everyone in what I call the immediate (first) extended family (meaning the president's mom, dad, brothers, sister, nieces, nephews...), basically everyone alive on the article and then some (those few youngins should be added to it). We don't need second cousins and so forth, and anyway the photo I found lists everyone so readers will actually know who's who. But I don't know how to upload photos so I publicized it here. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 20:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
