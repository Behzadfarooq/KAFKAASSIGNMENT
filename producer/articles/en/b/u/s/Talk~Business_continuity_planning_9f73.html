<p>I raised the following article once before and I believe the current article has addressed all the objection points raised during the first round:</p>
<ol>
<li>No references - References Added.</li>
<li>BCP is not "a methodology to create a manual" - Wording corrected.</li>
<li>BCP has a lot of overlaps with the risk management process, but this article doesn't even consider that link. - Referenced in the first paragraph, since this is not an article about Risk Management, risk management doesn't need to be explained.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>no examples of BCP in real life. - Added</li>
<li>No examples of failure of organisations which did not do it and had problems because of it. - Added</li>
<li>No examples of failures of organisations which did do it. - Added</li>
<li>no comments on risk acceptance and the impossibility of completely protecting against all disasters.</li>
<li>extremely focused on small business / office scenario, what about BCP for large factories? Does the BCP methodology not cover that area? - Disagree with this point. The BCP process is applicable to any type of activity, as long as the organization classifies a non-office function like distribution as "critical". I think this is clear.</li>
<li>what about other ways of doing it? - Sorry, there is not other ways of going through a BCP process. If you bypass the process (or a phase in the process), your plan will stink....</li>
<li>please add copyright notice to your diagram. - Done</li>
<li>please add comparison to methodologies used in Japan and Taiwan where a disaster like 9/11 is considered relatively small and massive earthquakes are expected to be handled effectively. - BCP process is the same regardless of the location or the threat!</li>
<li>please consider linking citations - Added.</li>
</ol>

<p>It looks like a nice article so far (I'm no expert in the field, so I can't judge any content). As a laypeson, however, I'm missing context. Where does BCP come from? You must establish that it's not <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a> rightaway by mentioning who originated this methodology, or in what field it started. Any books to add to the references? <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 14:43, 2004 Dec 12 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks again JRM, good input. My professional background is in BCP (i.e. BCP Manager) and this content originated from my head; I was trained on the job in the finance industry. I will need to research the historical precedents to the 'science'. BCP methodology is advocated by governments for organizations of all sizes so it is not proprietary. This can be a highly complex field and I am struggling to keep the context general enough for small industry, non-profit, educational organizations etc. As way of reference, my last firm's BCP manual was 400+ pages long. From your comments sounds like I've made it too generic and need to add color. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 15:18, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Genericity is not bad; Wikipedia is a secondary source. However, anything we say should also be verifiable—i.e, we must mention what we're generalizing over. ("Cat flinging is a hobby practiced by sadists. It was first mentioned in a 1974 article by Isaac Isaacson published in "Unethical Biology" [...] According to Fred Foobar of the Ministry of Excellence, one should always keep the cat to be flung by the tail, but multiple sources, including the Association of Feline Deviants, claim any body part will do.") Etcetera, etcetera, followed by references to the article, Foobar's statement, and multiple references including one for the AFD.</dd>

<p>I have some comments on the article. However, overall it is a good article, and my comments should be read in that context. Indeed, I hope the fact that they will be obscure points, to most 'lay persons', underlines that.</p>
<p>(1) I feel that your article is too focussed on the IT aspects of business continuity. The methodology you described comes from the IT business continuity standards. BS7799 is still valid as an IT standard, but the British Standards Institute is developing a new standard based on PAS56, which is what most UK business continuity practitioners work to (see www.thebci.org). The London bombings of 7/7 exposed that too many organisations’ BCPs did not give enough thought to the human aspects of emergencies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Two ideas here, (1) add what you think is appropriate about PAS56, and/or (2) add a section to describe the such local standards to de-Westernize the article as you see fit. If I don't like it, I will edit. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 13:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BS7799, or ISO17799 as it's known internationally, is indeed chiefly an IT standard, with some more general disaster management procedure standards. It's also official, and recognised by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Standards_5caa.html" title="British Standards">British Standards</a> (not called the BSI any more) and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Organization_for_Standardization_b57e.html" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a>. Whereas PAS56 is a "standard" created by a for-profit organisation calling themselves the Business Continuity Institute (£60 / $111 to see a standard? Real standards are available for free), with under 2000 members worldwide. Any mention of this 'PAS56' will be veering close to advertising. (Try and find anything on PAS01 - PAS55!). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 14:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to comment on your comments, if I may. The new British Standard for Business Continuity, which is to be BS 25999, will replace PAS 56, but I don't belive it is based on PAS 56. I understand that the expert committee involved with its development are building it from the "ground up". BS 7799, as it was called, was in two parts. A Specification and A Guidance. The Guidance part (part 1) was adopted by ISO and called ISO/IEC 17799. Part 2 of the standard is the specification, which means companies can be audit to the standard, or if the wish, to certify to the standard. It is a management system for Information Security and not just IT Security. Yes, it was developed by the IT ISO technical committee, but it is an organization wide standard. In October 2005 this part of the standard was adopted by ISO and is now ISO/IEC 27001:2005. ISO/IEC 17799:2005 will become ISO/IEC 27002 in 2007, but this is expected to be a name change only. BSI Still exists as a company, but has four divisions, one of which is Britsh Standards (I have BSI on my business card). Can I propose that Business Continuity really is about the planning (BCP) of how an organization cn return to normal business operation in the event of a disaster, Service Continuity is about recovering the IT service delivery and Disaster Recovery is about recovering the organizations information in the event of a disaster? The circumstances of when information is lost may be different to the circumstances of when there is an organization wide disaster. Business Continuity is led by the business. Disaster Recovery and Service Continuity are a subset of Business Continuity. --Rob 12:36, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(2) Business Continuity Management emerged from Disaster Recovery, as organisations realised that a focus on IT recovery from disruption might be irrelevant if the wider business could not operate. Business Continuity today focuses as much on business processes, as the IT underpinnings of those processes. It is also tightly coupled with Crisis Management, which aims to ensure the reputation of the organisation survives an incident intact. This topic should be mentioned and linked to.</p>

<p>(3) There is much debate about DR and BCM as labels for activities, which is in part because of the historical roots of the discipline. This reflects that there is a continuum of related activities that may take place under this heading, with a variety of methods. Accordingly, setting out a single method as correct is probably not appropriate for this article.</p>

<dd>Don't understand what you mean here. Personally would avoid an archane treatise about terminology.

<dd>Correct, there is no single 'correct' method of business continuity planning. They all share the same underlying principles, however. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 14:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(4) You state that “This lack of interest unequivocally ended September 11th 2001, when simultaneous terrorist attacks devastated downtown New York City and changed the 'worst case scenario' paradigm for business continuity planning.” Your citation is to an opinion piece, which itself has no evidence that this paradigm shift has taken place, and is in fact a call for it to take place. By contrast there is much evidence to suggest that many organisations still do not have business continuity plans at all.</p>

<dd>Sorry, totally disagree. Regulators, particularly financial regulators, have raised the mark dramatically, added miles/kilometers to minimum safe distances. Companies raised their budgets. Drills became more serious. This is personal experience earned by force marching staff down 37 flights of stairs to make sure they knew how to get out of my high-rise building and being subjected to much more audit scrutinity of my BCP plans. Oh, BTW, when we got to the bottom floor we found the emergency exits were locked from the outside. If that had been for real, we woulda been spam in a can. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 13:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. ISO 17799 didn't exist in its current form until after September 11. A far greater emphasis on disaster planning, business contoinuity, crisis management, whatever you want to call it has definitely been visible since 2001. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 14:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(5) My comments are based on the UK experience, and my reading of your article is that it is mostly relevant to the ‘West’. I would suggest that for a global resource such as the Wikipedia, a context statement is relevant. I personally have no idea about the global spread of business continuity but imagine it is less well advanced in the other parts of the world.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that the BCP discipline is driven by heavily regulated industries such as finance, pharmaceutical, energy, health, etc. In all those fields, the 'West' unfortunately leads the rest of the world, other countries tend to follow, all-be-it with their own adaptions. If you can come up with some relevant information to add a non-Western spin, please do so. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 13:48, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent comments it seems. You clearly have a detailed knowledge of the subject and it is exactly someone like you that needs to fix the things you see. No one, even a very knowledgeable person, such as <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> who I believe wrote nearly the entire article can write without any bias, and you may have uncovered it, or you may be off base on some of your comments--I don't know enough about the subject to decide. But you and Rev can discuss it and fix the issues.

<dd>The concept of Disaster Recovery only embraces one aspect of Business Continuity and the planning that an organization must undertake to ensure reliable service delivery. Perhaps "Disaster Recovery" and "Business Impact Analysis" would more appropriately exist separately from, but still contain links to, "Business Continuity Planning." <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetworktester_e68e.html" title="User:Networktester">Networktester</a> <small>&#160;<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetworktester_fb44.html" title="User talk:Networktester">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Networktester_ca70.html" title="Special:Contributions/Networktester">c</a></small> 12:09, 25 February 2006

<p>There is over reliance on BS7799. We will have to appreciate that BS7799 is a information security standard and it does not clearly spell out BCP practices. BCP is not about IT only! what happened in Kathrina storm/9-11/Mumbai floods is not about IT alone. It's time we cleaned up this article. Let's do justice to field of BCP and put content accordinly.</p>

<p>BCP methodology is <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalable.html" title="Scalable">scalable</a> for an organization of any <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size.html" title="Size">size</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complexity.html" title="Complexity">complexity</a>. Even though the methodology has roots in regulated industries, any type of organization may create a BCP manual, and arguably every organization <i>should</i> have one in order to ensure the organization's <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity.html" title="Longevity">longevity</a>. Evidence that firms do not invest enough time and resources into BCP preparations are evident in disaster survival statistics. Fires permanently close 44% of the business affected <a href="http://www.iwar.org.uk/infocon/business-continuity-planning.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iwar.org.uk/infocon/business-continuity-planning.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 150 businesses out of 350 affected failed to survive the event. Conversely, the firms affected by the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sept_11.html" title="Sept 11">Sept 11</a> attacks with well-developed and tested BCP manuals were back in business within days <a href="http://howe.stevens.edu/Research/ATT/ReportAllSep1004_v3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://howe.stevens.edu/Research/ATT/ReportAllSep1004_v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>A BCP manual for a small organization may be simply a printed manual stored safely away from the primary work location, containing the names, addresses, and phone numbers for crisis management staff, general staff members, clients, and vendors along with the location of the offsite <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data.html" title="Data">data</a> <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backup.html" title="Backup">backup</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storage_media.html" title="Storage media">storage media</a>, copies of insurance contracts, and other critical materials necessary for organizational survival. At its most complex, a BCP manual may outline a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary.html" title="Secondary">secondary</a> work site, technical requirements and readiness, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regulatory.html" title="Regulatory">regulatory</a> reporting requirements, work recovery measures, the means to reestablish physical records, the means to establish a new supply chain, or the means to establish new production centers. Firms should ensure that their BCP manual is realistic and easy to use during a crisis. As such, BCP sits along side <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_management.html" title="Crisis management">crisis management</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_recovery.html" title="Disaster recovery">disaster recovery planning</a> and is a part of an organization's overall <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk_management.html" title="Risk management">risk management</a>.</p>
<p>The development of a BCP manual has five main phases: analysis, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solution.html" title="Solution">solution</a> design, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implementation.html" title="Implementation">implementation</a>, testing and <a href="../../../u/a/t/UAT_19dd.html" title="UAT">organization acceptance</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maintenance.html" title="Maintenance">maintenance</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the BCP material on the internet is sponsored by consultancies who offer fee-based services for BCP solution development, however basic tutorials are freely available on the internet for properly motivated organizations <a href="http://nonprofitrisk.org/tutorials/bcp_tutorial/intro/1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://nonprofitrisk.org/tutorials/bcp_tutorial/intro/1.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>After defining recovery requirements, documenting potential threats is recommended to detail a specific disaster’s unique recovery steps. Some common threats include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">Disease</a> <a href="http://www.continuitycentral.com/feature0162.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.continuitycentral.com/feature0162.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>All threats in the examples above share a common impact - the potential of damage to organizational infrastructure - except one (disease). The impact of diseases is initially purely human, and may be alleviated with technical and business solutions. During the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> <a href="../../../s/a/r/SARS_4359.html" title="SARS">SARS</a> outbreak, some organizations grouped staff into separate teams, and rotated the teams between the primary and secondary work sites, with a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotation.html" title="Rotation">rotation</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency.html" title="Frequency">frequency</a> equal to the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incubation_period.html" title="Incubation period">incubation period</a> of the disease. The organizations also banned face-to-face contact between opposing team members during business and non-business hours. With such a split, organizations increased their resiliency against the threat of government-ordered <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarantine.html" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> measures if one person in a team contracted or was exposed to the disease <a href="http://www.continuitycentral.com/feature0103htm/feature0162.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.continuitycentral.com/feature0103htm/feature0162.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Damage from <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flooding.html" title="Flooding">flooding</a> also has a unique characteristic. If an office environment is flooded with non-salinated and contamination-free water (e.g.m, in the event of a pipe burst), equipment can be thoroughly dried and may still be functional.</p>
<p><a name="Definition_of_impact_scenarios" id="Definition_of_impact_scenarios"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_continuity_planning_9f73.html" title="Edit section: Definition of impact scenarios">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition of impact scenarios</span></h3>
<p>After defining potential threats, documenting the impact scenarios that form the basis of the business recovery plan is recommended. In general, planning for the most wide-reaching disaster or disturbance is preferable to planning for a smaller scale problem, as almost all smaller scale problems are partial elements of larger disasters. A typical impact scenario like 'Building Loss' will most likely encompass all critical business functions, and the worst potential outcome from any potential threat. A business continuity plan may also document additional impact scenarios if an organization has more than one building. Other more specific impact scenarios - for example a scenario for the temporary or permanent loss of a specific floor in a building - may also be documented.</p>

<p>After the completion of the analysis phase, the business and technical plan requirements are documented in order to commence the implementation phase. For an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office.html" title="Office">office</a>-based, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_9235.html" title="Information Technology">IT</a> intensive business, the plan requirements may cover the following elements which may be classed as ICE (In Case of Emergency) Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The numbers and types of desks, whether dedicated or shared, required outside of the primary business location in the secondary location</li>
<li>The individuals involved in the recovery effort along with their contact and technical details</li>
<li>The applications and application data required from the secondary location desks for critical business functions</li>
<li>The manual workaround solutions</li>
<li>The maximum outage allowed for the applications</li>
<li>The peripheral requirements like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">printers</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copier.html" title="Copier">copier</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/x/Fax_machine.html" title="Fax machine">fax machine</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculators.html" title="Calculators">calculators</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paper.html" title="Paper">paper</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen.html" title="Pen">pens</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other business environments, such as production, distribution, warehousing etc will need to cover these elements, but are likely to have additional issues to manage following a disruptive event.</p>
<p><a name="Solution_design" id="Solution_design"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_continuity_planning_9f73.html" title="Edit section: Solution design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Solution design</span></h2>
<p>The goal of the solution design phase is to identify the most cost effective <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_recovery.html" title="Disaster recovery">disaster recovery</a> solution that meets two main requirements from the impact analysis stage. For IT applications, this is commonly expressed as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The minimum application and application data requirements</li>
<li>The time frame in which the minimum application and application data must be available</li>
</ol>
<p>Disaster recovery plans may also be required outside the IT applications domain, for example in preservation of information in hard copy format, or restoration of embedded technology in process plant. This BCP phase overlaps with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_recovery.html" title="Disaster recovery">Disaster recovery planning</a> methodology. The solution phase determines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the crisis management command structure</li>
<li>the location of a secondary work site (where necessary)</li>
<li>telecommunication architecture between primary and secondary work sites</li>
<li>data replication methodology between primary and secondary work sites</li>
<li>the application and software required at the secondary work site, and</li>
<li>the type of physical data requirements at the secondary work site.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Implementation" id="Implementation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_continuity_planning_9f73.html" title="Edit section: Implementation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Implementation</span></h2>
<p>The implementation phase, quite simply, is the execution of the design elements identified in the solution design phase. Work package testing may take place during the implementation of the solution, however; work package testing does not take the place of organizational testing.</p>
<p><a name="Testing_and_organizational_acceptance" id="Testing_and_organizational_acceptance"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_continuity_planning_9f73.html" title="Edit section: Testing and organizational acceptance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Testing and organizational acceptance</span></h2>
<p>The purpose of testing is to achieve organizational acceptance that the business continuity solution satisfies the organization's recovery requirements. Plans may fail to meet expectations due to insufficient or inaccurate recovery requirements, solution design flaws, or solution implementation errors. Testing may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisis command team call-out testing</li>
<li>Technical swing test from primary to secondary work locations</li>
<li>Technical swing test from secondary to primary work locations</li>
<li>Application test</li>
<li>Business process test</li>
</ul>
<p>At minimum, testing is generally conducted on a biannual or <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year.html" title="Year">annual</a> schedule. Problems identified in the initial testing phase may be rolled up into the maintenance phase and retested during the next test cycle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Talk%7EBusiness_continuity_planning_9f73.html" title="Edit section: Maintenance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Maintenance</span></h2>
<p>Maintenance of a BCP manual is broken down into three periodic activities. The first activity is the confirmation of information in the manual. The second activity is the testing and verification of technical solutions established for recovery operations. The third activity is the testing and verification of documented organization recovery procedures. A biannual or annual maintenance cycle is typical.</p>

<p>All organizations change over time, therefore a BCP manual must change to stay relevant to the organization. Once data accuracy is verified, normally a call tree test is conducted to evaluate the notification plan's efficiency as well as the accuracy of the contact data. Some types of changes that should be identified and updated in the manual include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staffing changes</li>
<li>Staffing persona</li>
<li>Changes to important clients and their contact details</li>
<li>Changes to important vendors/suppliers and their contact details</li>
<li>Departmental changes like new, closed or fundamentally changed departments.</li>

<p>As a part of ongoing maintenance, any specialized technical deployments must be checked for functionality. Some checks include:</p>

<p>As work processes change over time, the previously documented organizational recovery procedures may no longer be suitable. Some checks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are all work processes for critical functions documented?</li>
<li>Have the systems used in the execution of critical functions changed?</li>
<li>Are the documented work checklists meaningful and accurate for staff?</li>
<li>Do the documented work process recovery tasks and supporting disaster recovery infrastructure allow staff to recover within the predetermined recovery time objective?</li>
</ul>

<p>As suggested by the diagram included in this article, there is a direct relationship between the test and maintenance phases and the impact phase. When establishing a BCP manual and recovery infrastructure from scratch, issues found during the testing phase often must be reintroduced to the analysis phase.</p>

<p>Please explain the addition of this descriptor to the introductory image? I certainly did not have 'managing collaborative groups' in mind when I created the image. When looking at the wikilink to the MCG outine, nothing particularly jumped out at me to indicate why MCG had any relevance to BCP or the planning process. Please explain your reasoning. Thanks in advance. P.S. Some of the recent changes are quite nice additions. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 10:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An article about the standard for BCP would seem to have a huge overlap with this article. Is there really sufficient distinguishable material for a separate article? -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 02:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't agree. BS 25999 is a significant new development and will evolve into a large topic itself especially when it becomes and ISO standard. It should not be merged into this topic.<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinarygal_f9a3.html" title="User:Binarygal">Binarygal</a></dd>

<dd>I don't agree with the merger proposal. BCP stands independent of BS25999 and was in existence before the standard. Seems to me that the BS25999 article needs a rework and expansion in line with the other BSI standards. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 02:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Intro paragraph grew (in a good way from an information standpoint) and got clunky. Let's be more careful from a style perspective when editing! The Introduction section has been expanded with materials moved out of first paragraph. IMO, the Intro section needs more work. I will do what I can but request collaboration from those other Wikipedian's monitoring this page. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevmachine21_bf58.html" title="User:Revmachine21">Revmachine21</a> 01:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
