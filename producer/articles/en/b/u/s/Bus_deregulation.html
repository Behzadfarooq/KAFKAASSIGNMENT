<p><b>Bus deregulation</b> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> came into force on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">26 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, as part of the Transport Act 1985.</p>
<p>The 'Buses' White Paper (under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> government of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>) was the basis of the Transport Act 1985, which provided for the deregulation of local <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> services in the whole of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> except for <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a>. It proposed the abolition of road service licensing and allowed for the introduction of competition on local bus services for the first time since the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>.</p>
<p>Two kinds of bus service can be provided: <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commercial</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidy.html" title="Subsidy">subsidised</a>. Any bus operator can run whatever commercial services it wanted to as long as it gives 56 days notice of an introduction of a new service, withdrawal of a service or timetable changes. Commercial services are not eligible for any subsidy (except for the provision of concessionary fares) but can charge whatever fares they wanted.</p>
<p>The only cross-subsidy allowed is for commercial reasons, e.g. for a large operator to maintain its network at all times of the day so to keep customer loyalty or so to maintain the attractiveness of that company's travelcard (one which is only valid on that operator). However, this was later amended to allow for 'Quality Partnerships' between local authorities and operators, where an operator agrees to improve a service, in return for infrastructure improvements paid for by the local authority (usually bus lanes or bus stops/shelters).</p>
<p>If there are gaps in the commercial bus network, local authorities (in shire counties) and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passenger_Transport_Executive_d3a3.html" title="Passenger Transport Executive">PTEs</a> (in metropolitan areas) are able to design bus services which bus operators can be paid to operate. These are routes which the local authority or PTE considers as socially necessary, but are not commercially viable. The fares, routes and times of these subsidised services are set by the local authority or PTE. However, local authorities and PTEs are required to seek competitive tenders for these services.</p>
<p>Subsidised services in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_area.html" title="Urban area">urban</a> areas (also known as tendered services) are often evening, early morning or Sunday journeys on routes which are commercial during the day on Monday to Saturday. Many <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> routes are subsidised at all times of their operation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_deregulation.html" title="Edit section: Effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects</span></h2>
<p>Even though the advent of competition has in some places improved service levels and reduced fares, the lack of local authority control over bus services have meant that many of the more outlying areas have seen significantly reduced service, especially off-peak. Fares have also increased significantly in some rural areas and where there are local monopolies.</p>
<p>Aside from healthy competition on service levels and price, critics have claimed deregulation has caused some undesirable effects. For example, large companies like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach_Group_dc5f.html" title="Stagecoach Group">Stagecoach</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Group_1af8.html" title="First Group">First</a> can use their considerable buying power to completely take over the market in a region, using services and tactics that are meant to drive out competition rather than serve the customer better. Some areas see several companies running the same services at roughly the same times with the express purpose of drawing customers away from each other. Such "bus wars" often end in the smaller companies ceasing to operate the route, leading to increased patronage of the larger provider. An example of this practice is the lucrative No. 192 bus route in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> where two large companies began a "bus war" in March 2006, leading to complaints of increased traffic congestion and concerns over safety of passengers and pedestrians. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of bus deregulation have pointed out that bus usage has fallen considerably since deregulation (in South Yorkshire, by 70%) but in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> where regulation is still in operation, bus usage has risen by 55% over the same period<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. This may reflect the unique travel patterns of the capital as well as significant investment in new services and vehicles, but this effect predates the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_congestion_charge.html" title="London congestion charge">London congestion charge</a> which came into force in 2003; bus usage in London has been rising since 1993.</p>
<p>Where bus use has increased outside of London it has been in areas where the transport policies of the local authorities are well coordinated through Quality Partnerships and where investment in public transport infrastructure, such as bus lanes, is prioritised. Prime examples are in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but also passenger growth has been seen, for example, through Kickstart projects where initial service subsidy leads onto full commercial operation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_deregulation.html" title="Edit section: Bus War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bus War</span></h3>
<p><i>Bus War</i> is a phrase coined to describe intense competition between rival bus companies in an area following Bus deregulation in 1986.</p>
<p>In many cases the competition has seen dangerous practises, buses speeding, cutting up rival operators, and jumping red traffic signals were common. Service also suffered as bus passengers, wary of the poor driving standards were often ignored at stops with low passnger numbers in order to insure that the bus would reach the more lucrative stops first. In some areas buses would turn around if a queue could be observed in the other direction and they had no passengers. It was also common for drivers to be running buses by radio to sit at stops until the large operator approached before moving off ahead. In some areas bus drivers were offered a cut of the fare-money as an incentive. Timetables at stops have largely disappeared as bus companies cut costs. Buses are often timetabled to run minutes apart, and it not uncommon for buses to have a 30 minute service — consisting of 3 operators running buses 3 minutes apart every half hour. The many buses also cause traffic congestion, and harm the environment, the very thing public transport is trying to prevent.</p>
<p>Large operators such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach">Stagecoach</a>, often protected their business by introducing their own low-cost operation onto the route in order to squeeze the business of the competitor or offering discounted tickets on their large bus networks which smaller operators can't compete with. In certain circumstances large companies often offer tickets at an unrealistic and uneconmic cost, using their financial muscle to try and out-price the competition.</p>
<p>Despite competition large areas are now virtual monopolies after competition ended, and in general fares rise steeply after the end of a bus war, whilst passenger numbers and drivers wages and service standards fall. <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Buses_44fd.html" title="London Buses">London Buses</a>, where the market was not deregulated, has in general seen a rise in passenger numbers, coupled with realistic fares and wages. Scotland has bucked the trend in recent years, but only due to a national concessionary scheme allowing over-60s free bus travel throughout the country.</p>
<p>In certain areas unscrupulous tactics have occurred including, driver and passenger intimadation by rival operators <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, damage to vehicles, deliberate blocking of vehicles at stops to prevent other companies moving off ahead, and running non-timetabled 'phantom buses' ahead of rivals to damage their business.</p>
