<p>"It's interesting to note that Marx and Engels' <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> specific demands in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Manifesto_2ae3.html" title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a> are now almost wholly implemented throughout the once-capitalist world, with the sole exception of the abolishment of rents in land. This suggests that the Marxian analysis found some traction among decision-makers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."</p>
<p>I deleted that. First, it isn't logical. If I accurately predict rain tomorrow, it doesn't follow I had any "traction" in the clouds, only that I understood enough about the underlying processes to predict where they were going.</p>
<p>Second, it isn't even relevant to the specific issue of the business cycle.

<p>I'd say this article is cluttered. In one sense, from the terse descriptions of each school of thought listed in what seems like no particular order, and in another, its willingness to concede those terms outlining causality (e.g. full employment-- extraneous technical terms) which are, within Wikipedia, obscure. For example, it attempts to explain how fluctuation may be linked to <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_employment.html" title="Full employment">full employment</a> without defining what full employment might mean in each specific case. Speaking as a layman, it is difficult to follow, and it reads POV to me as well. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBordello_82e5.html" title="User:Bordello">Bordello</a> 10:49, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is also largely wrong, speaking as a academic economist. For example, the statements regarding rational expectations and deterministic cycles being inconsistent is demonstrably false -- among many others, Steve Spear and Rao Aiyagari have written down simple models with deterministic cycles.</p>

<p>The Austrian model is certainly just as valid, if not moreso, than the model put forth in the main section of this article.

<p>The Austrian Schools model is the alternative model within the article as developed western countries currently do not follow the Austrian model, and due to that it is the "alternative" to the current system of central banks regulating the interest rate in order to control aggregate expenditure and demand, and also to reduce the movement away from potential GDP in the short term.</p>

<p>I think that information belongs on the RBC page, it is a little bit more oriented toward the merits of that concept. Too much in the introduction on this more basic concept will make it far less readable for anyone not already possessing a basic understanding of business cycles. I don't think there is much of a POV issue any more but I don't know how to clear it. Maybe only the person who tagged it can remove it? BlackVegetable 00:57, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we were to take snapshots of an economy at different points in time, no two photos would look alike. This occurs for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many advanced economies exhibit sustained growth over time. That is, snapshots taken many years apart will most likely depict higher levels of economy activity in the later period</li>
<li>There exist seemingly random fluctuations around this growth trend. Thus given two snapshots in time, predicting the later with the earlier is nearly impossible.</li>
</ol>

<p>A common way to observe such behavior is by looking at a time series of an economy’s output, more specifically <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_national_product.html" title="Gross national product">gross national product</a> (GNP). This is just the value of the goods and services produced by a country’s businesses and workers.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the time series of real GNP for the United States from 1954-2005. While we see continuous growth of output, it is not a steady increase. There are times of faster growth and times of slower growth. Figure 2 transforms these levels into growth rates of real GNP and extracts a smoother growth trend. A common method to obtain this trend is the <a href="../../../h/o/d/Hodrick-Prescott_filter_2f1c.html" title="Hodrick-Prescott filter">Hodrick-Prescott filter</a>. The basic idea is to find a balance between the extent to which general growth trend follows the cyclical movement (since long term growth rate is not likely to be perfectly constant) and how smooth it is. The HP filter identifies the longer term fluctuations as part of the growth trend while classifying the more jumpy fluctuations as part of the cyclical component.</p>

<p>Observe the difference between this growth component and the jerkier data. Economists refer to these cyclical movements about the trend as <b>business cycles</b>. Figure 3 explicitly captures such deviations. Note the horizontal axis at 0. A point on this line indicates at that year, there is no deviation from the trend. All other points above and below the line imply deviations. By using log real GNP the distance between any point and the 0 line roughly equals the percentage deviation from the long run growth trend.</p>

<p>We call relatively large positive deviations (those above the 0 axis) peaks. We call relatively large negative deviations (those below the 0 axis) troughs. A series of positive deviations leading to peaks are booms and a series of negative deviations leading to troughs are <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recessions.html" title="Recessions">recessions</a>.</p>
<p>At a glance, the deviations just look like a string of waves bunched together -- nothing about it appears consistent. To explain causes of such fluctuations may appear rather difficult given these irregularities. However, if we consider other macroeconomic variables, we will observe patterns in these irregularities. For example, consider Figure 4 which depicts fluctuations in output and consumption spending, i.e. what people buy and use at any given period. Observe how the peaks and troughs align at almost the same places and how the upturns and downturns coincide.</p>

<p>We might predict that other similar data may exhibit similar qualities. For example, (a) labor, hours worked (b) productivity, how effective firms use such capital or labor, (c) investment, amount of capital saved to help future endeavors, and (d) capital stock, value of machines, buildings and other equipment that help firms produce their goods. While Figure 5 shows a similar story for investment, the relationship with capital in Figure 6 departs from the story. We need better way to pin down a better story; one way is to look at some statistics.</p>

<p>By eyeballing the data, we can infer several regularities, sometimes called stylized facts. One is persistence. For example, if we take any point in the series above the trend (the x-axis in figure 3), the probability the next period is still above the trend is very high. However, this persistence wears over time. That is, economic activity in the short run is quite predictable but due to the irregular long-term nature of fluctuations, forecasting in the long run is much more difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Another regularity is cyclical variability. Column A of Table 1 lists a measure of this with standard deviations. The magnitude of fluctuations in output and hours worked are nearly equal. Consumption and productivity are similarly much smoother than output while investment fluctuates much more than output. Capital stock is the least volatile of the indicators.</p>

TABLE 1</div>

<p>Yet another regularity is the co-movement between output and the other macroeconomic variables. Figures 4 - 6 illustrated such relationship. We can measure this in more detail using correlations as listed in column B of Table 1. Procyclical variables have positive correlations since it usually increases during booms and decreases during recessions. Vice versa, a countercyclical variable associates with negative correlations. Acyclical, correlations close to zero, implies no systematic relationship to the business cycle. We find that productivity is slightly procyclical. This implies workers and capital are more productive when the economy is experiencing a boom. They aren’t quite as productive when the economy is experiencing a slowdown. Similar explanations follow for consumption and investment, which are strongly procyclical. Labor is also procyclical while capital stock appears acyclical.</p>
<p>Observing these similarities yet seemingly non-deterministic fluctuations about trend, we come to the burning question of why any of this occurs. It’s common sense that people prefer economic booms over recessions. It follows that if all people in the economy make optimal decisions, these fluctuations are caused by something outside the decision-making process. So the key question really is: <i>what main factor influences and subsequently changes the decisions of all actors in an economy?</i></p>
