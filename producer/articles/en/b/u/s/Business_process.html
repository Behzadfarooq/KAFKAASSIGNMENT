<p>A <b>business process</b> is a set of linked activities that create value by transforming an input into a more valuable output. Both input and output can be artifacts and/or information and the transformation can be performed by human actors, machines, or both.</p>
<p>There are three types of <b>business processes</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Management processes - the processes that govern the operation. Typical management processes include "<a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_Governance_f7c6.html" title="Corporate Governance">Corporate Governance</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Management_fa88.html" title="Strategic Management">Strategic Management</a>".</li>
<li>Operational processes - these processes create the primary value stream, they are part of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_business.html" title="Core business">core business</a>. Typical operational processes are <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing.html" title="Purchasing">Purchasing</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturing.html" title="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">Marketing</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sales.html" title="Sales">Sales</a>.</li>
<li>Supporting processes - these support the core processes. Examples include <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">Accounting</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recruitment.html" title="Recruitment">Recruitment</a>, IT-support.</li>
</ol>
<p>A business process can be decomposed into several sub-processes, which have their own attributes, but also contribute to achieving the goal of the super-process. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping of processes and sub-processes down to activity level.</p>
<p>Activities are parts of the business process that do not include any <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decision_making.html" title="Decision making">decision making</a> and thus are not worth decomposing (although decomposition would be possible), such as "Answer the phone", "produce an invoice".</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Process_Modeling_Notation_31c2.html" title="Business Process Modeling Notation">Business Process Modeling Notation</a> can be used for drawing business processes in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workflow.html" title="Workflow">workflow</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process.html" title="Edit section: Adam Smith">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adam Smith</span></h3>
<p>One of the first people to describe processes was <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> in his famous (1776) example of an English <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pin.html" title="Pin">pin</a> factory. He described the production of a pin in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head: to make the head requires two or three distinct operations: to put it on is a particular business, to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which in some manufactories are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometime perform two or three of them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith also first recognized how the output could be increased through the use of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_labor.html" title="Division of labor">labor division</a>. Previously, in a society where production was dominated by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artisan.html" title="Artisan">handcrafted goods</a>, one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks, which would be performed by specialized workers. The result of labor division in Smith’s example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent (sic!), i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Smith did not advocate labor division at any price and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_se.html" title="Per se">per se</a>. The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smith's view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process, today's process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into functional, or cross-functional, processes was not considered as an alternative option until much later.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process.html" title="Edit section: Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition</span></h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, US corporations, and subsequently companies all over the world, started to adopt the concept of <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reengineering.html" title="Reengineering">reengineering</a> in an attempt to re-achieve the competitiveness that they had lost during the previous decade. A key characteristic of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Process_Reengineering_32ec.html" title="Business Process Reengineering">Business Process Reengineering</a> (BPR) is the focus on business processes. Davenport (1993) defines a (business) process as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus’s emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs: a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach implies adopting the customer’s point of view. Processes are the structure by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its customers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition contains certain characteristics a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by a focus on the business logic of the process (how work is done), instead of taking a product perspective (what is done). Following Davenports definition of a process we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, that it consists of smaller parts, activities, which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome- a customer - and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value.</p>
<p>Hammer &amp; Champy’s (1993) definition can be considered as a subset of Davenport’s. They define a process as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can note, Hammer &amp; Champy have a more transformation oriented perception, and put less emphasis on the structural component–process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space.</p>
<p>Rummler &amp; Brache (1995) use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organization’s external customers, when stating that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”a business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or service. Most processes (...) are cross-functional, spanning the ‘white space’ between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in a product or service that is received by an organization's external customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products that are invisible to the external customer but essential to the effective management of the business. We call these support processes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value, or concerned with the organization’s internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Brache's definition follows Porter's value chain model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions.</p>
<p>Finally, let us consider the process definition of Johansson et. al. (1993). They define a process as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”a set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to the recipient either upstream or downstream.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et.al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Definability:</b> It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output.</li>
<li><b>Order:</b> It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space.</li>
<li><b>Customer:</b> There must be a recipient of the process' outcome, a customer.</li>
<li><b>Value-adding:</b> The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream.</li>
<li><b>Embeddedness:</b> A process can not exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure.</li>
<li><b>Cross-functionality:</b> A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Frequently, a <b>process owner</b>, i.e. a person being responsible for the performance and continuous improvement of the process, is also considered as a prerequisite.</p>
