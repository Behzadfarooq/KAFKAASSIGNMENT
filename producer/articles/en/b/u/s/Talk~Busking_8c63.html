<p>There are one or more individuals who are aggresively vandalizing this page and trying to cover up the trend of business cartels in the USA lately to commit the white collar crimes of the monopolization of cash flow and free speech civil rights violations. These people seem to be erasing all information about these crimes in the court cases section and seem to be trying to skew and mislead people about the true nature of these cases. It is my belief that they may be doing this in order to get away with thier own criminal efforts at commiting monopolistic and civil rights violations upon buskers. I don't believe covering up these kind of criminal behaviours is in any way appropriate for wikipedia. This covering up of criminal behaviour implicates the wikipedia community as participants in such unlawful things. They also erased mentions of the differences between british law which allows for licensing of speech and public performance and american law in which free speech is an absolute right for all. Also any mention of the intellectual nature of performance art disappears within a week or so. This kind of behavior is grossly inappropriate and will cause people to loose trust in wikipedia as a source of quality educational information.</p>

<p>Okay, the Pitfalls section has a rather arrogant tone and it sounds like it was written by a busker with a chip on his/her shoulder. Someone needs to revise this. <a href="../../../a/x/d/User%7EAxda0002_6f75.html" title="User:Axda0002">Axda0002</a> 00:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How is it arrogant and how does it reflect a chip on one's shoulder? Revise it to reflect what? I don't get it. Those are just some of the real pitfalls of busking. It is not a candy land out there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.6.41.83 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.6.41.83_3f74.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.6.41.83">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><i>Some people will deliberately try to stigmatize buskers as such regardless of their social status. It is human nature that when a person puts on public displays of intellect it inspires the jealousy of some those who are less endowed and they will heckle and harass buskers to no end. In fact almost any figure in the public eye and even the best of buskers has had to deal with hecklers at one time or another. A good busker must be able to maintain their composure when in public and never do anything inappropriate when confronted by such juvenile behavior.</i></p>
<p>This paragraph containing the previous statment has serious issues with biased tone, weasel words, and some obvious opinionation. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against buskers, but this isn't an acceptable for an article in Wikipedia. I've gone ahead and revised the entire paragraph to conform to a more neutral tone as well as increasing readability.<a href="../../../a/x/d/User%7EAxda0002_6f75.html" title="User:Axda0002">Axda0002</a> 22:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems you are heckling a person for writing about heckling. How perversely pernicious and arrogant is that.? Hecklers are a pitfall of busking and need to be mentioned. There are numerous pages on the net regarding hecklers and how buskers can deal with them. When I get the time I will research and post info about this subject unless somebody else gets to it first.<a href="http://www.blanketfort.com/juggling/heckling.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blanketfort.com/juggling/heckling.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.performers.net/forums/printthread.php?s=203b5126e227bede5cd99c37d4964b52&amp;threadid=487&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.performers.net/forums/printthread.php?s=203b5126e227bede5cd99c37d4964b52&amp;threadid=487&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/printtopic.php?topic=124361&amp;forum=6&amp;PHPSESSID=29c7467bc50022c1d430ebe426a2447b" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/printtopic.php?topic=124361&amp;forum=6&amp;PHPSESSID=29c7467bc50022c1d430ebe426a2447b" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://mmm.com/meetingnetwork/presentations/pmag_hecklers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mmm.com/meetingnetwork/presentations/pmag_hecklers.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.flyingfists.org/archives/000841.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flyingfists.org/archives/000841.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1038/is_n5_v34/ai_11308382/pg_7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1038/is_n5_v34/ai_11308382/pg_7" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.speakernetnews.com/post/heckler.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.speakernetnews.com/post/heckler.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://www.juggling.org/bin/mfs/JIS/publications/two-ply-press/feb_96/spank.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.juggling.org/bin/mfs/JIS/publications/two-ply-press/feb_96/spank.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://ilx.wh3rd.net/thread.php?msgid=1821283" class="external autonumber" title="http://ilx.wh3rd.net/thread.php?msgid=1821283" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.balloonhq.com/twistmail/msg.php?msgid=21727" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balloonhq.com/twistmail/msg.php?msgid=21727" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> the search i did came up with 157,000 hits on dealing with hecklers.

<p>Somebody needs to create WikiP page entries for thew following buskers. Stephen H. Baird, Mr. Goldstein, Michael Berger, Harry Perry and Jingles. They have all been dominant in the legal battles to keep free speach free.</p>

<p>the information on regulated busking in the laws area in the form of citations is helpful, but it is presented in an inelegant fashion. we need to do a better presentation, perhaps on the busking venues category page as a sub catagory&#160;?? we should also try to point out places that busking is forbidden in another subcatagory of the venues page. That way buskers can know where not to go.</p>

You are also in violation of Wikipedia's TOS with crude comments about others here on the discussion page.

<p>u krazy person i havent even tried any spamming here. your behavior is decietful, inflamatory and provacative ive not put a single friend up here i put one link to my url for informative purposes. and virtually none of my book is here. i just feel this page needed some respect and some basic real knowledge about busking added to it. your the one making rude comments. And just what products am i trying to get people to buy? i am a busker i do live performance art at my own pitch how can i sell that on this venue.</p>

<p>Many of those terms are readily found in music, jazz slang and hippie slang dictionaries. some of them may be local colloquial idioms. Dont have the time to re- research and cite them right now. its the weekend and i work when most people play and play when most people work . I'm a busker.

I am a PROFESSIOANL BUSKER, 27 YEARS. And if you are NEW TO THE FIELD, which you obviously ARE if you do not recognize Artis, Chumleigh, The FKB, Page...then BACK OFF! I put FAMOUS STREET PERFORMERS THERE AS THEY ARE FAMOUS! Jason Webbley? Come on. He is a legend on the internet alone. I've been busking 27 years and not one busker I know has worked with him or even seen his act. I find it gross that you are using MEDIA AND MONEY to define FAMOUS also. FAMOUS IN BUSKER TALK IS YOU ARE A STREET LEGEND. AND YES, EVERY ONE of those I just PUT BACK UP ON THIS PAGE is a LEGEND.</p>
<p>Also this is NOT the MALE BUSKER PAGE. QUIT TAKING WOMEN BUSKERS OFF THIS PAGE!</p>
<p>I have added some WOMEN BUSKER'S names, and some asshole keeps taking them down. STOP IT! If this is a busker page, I will fight for it to reflect REALITY. THis is MY world, I have lived in it for 27 years and I think it SUCKS that some nonbuskers for life keep taking down REAL BUSKER LEGEND NAMES ON THIS PAGE, especially egregious is taking down the FEW WOMEN NAMES HERE!! UGH! I cannot believe that this page sucks so bad and I have to keep coming back to clean up the misogynist "cleansing" of it over and over. KNOCK IT OFF! I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. Yes, Reggie Miles IS A LEGEND. YOU DO NOT HAVE A CLUE if you do not recognize Page, Chumleigh, even me, Zosima...so again, this page needs to reflect REALITY and I AM ON THE STREETS BUSKING FOR MY FOOD NOW AS I WAS in 1978.</p>
<p><br />
Man, are NONBUSKERS running this page, and WHY? There IS a vocab and it is IMPORTANT. WTF? And for my creds, go to resist.ca/~kirstena/pageperformerpress.html and resist.ca/~kirstena/pagebusking.html I am putting it BACK UP!!!</p>

<dd>argon u keep resisting the idea of organizing busking terms. when they say say wikiP is not a dictionary the intent is to not have dictionary like entries in the main database. there is nothing that says a subject can not have a lexicon of specific terminology used in that area. you have apparently placed this bottler thing under common things wich it is not. i went to San Francisco this weekend and talked to over 2 dozen buskers non has ever heard of a bottler. it is probably a local idiom or bad joke but it is most definately not a common thing.</dd>

<dd>I am also much more familiar with the term 'hat man', but it <i>is</i> common to have a person (or even the preverbal monkey more commonly found in fiction) performing this task if possible, regardless of what you call them. I moved the description where it is because this is the first time anyone had included this missing piece to the article (I certainly hadn't though to add it until now). I had intended to reword the section to use the more common terms, only keeping the term "bottler" if I can find documented sources, but I've been too busy fixing all of the redundant and not-so-useful internal links that were recently added to the article to work on that yet. Maybe tomorrow.</dd>

<p>I prefer to remain anonymous because in the past when i have spread my knowledge of busking in public places i have been attacked by anti-busking hackers at my website and also hackers sending me virus infected emails. You put that string of citations regarding permits back up and it is inelegant and misleading. Please put it back the way it was in a paragraph format so one may see where it is they are talking about. Nobody seems to question that some places require permits. The underlying information is important so that people know where not to go and waste thier time. So why obscure it and why do we need so many citation's there? It is bizare and makes the page look freaky so why don't you put it back the way it was. If you want tom make yourself useful why don't you create pages for some of the people mentioned above like Bard Goldstein Turly Pery Etc.</p>

<p>We're a small collective of buskers and are too busy laughing at the page to edit it. We can also see this would be a futile task anyway as someone else would just come by and edit the page back to suit their needs. The Famous Street Performers/Buskers is really funny seeing as not a one is actually famous...probably just someones friends taken from someones site or the internet. The duplicate links leads to sales pages. We're staying far away but thanks for all the foo nees.</p>
<hr />
<p>I find it hard to believe that you claim to be buskers and not know about some of these people. Almost all long time buskers are locally famous. If you don't know, Stephan Baird is responsible for defending buskers rights on the east coast boston area and he has been in the business for over 30 yrs. Your claiming nobody has seen him except for his friends? With out him their might not be any busking in the boston area at all. Harry Perry and Jingles are west coast busking icons and also responsible for freeing up free speech. Their pitch is in venice beach and is freqented by over 15,000 people a day in the summertime. Your claiming nobody has seen them except for their friends? The Bushman is truly a world famous busker and even in wikipedia. He has performed for nearly 25 yrs in a very high volume (12 thousand + dailly) traffic environment at the san francisco wharf. Same thing with Louhrie Reed at the wharf. What part of being on the cover of a nationally famous magazine and performing for 12,000 + dailly makes you not famous. All of the people listed were locally famous and findable on the internet. Being "famous" is not an objective thing but a subjective thing. The fact that you set yourself up to judge that is not right. Just because you are ignorant of some things does not mean the world has to abide and remain under your veil of ignorance. Of the remaining people the only one i've ever heard of was the naked cowboy and i've been studying busking for several years to write a book. It seems to me that you are probably one of the 4 remaining living individuals and just trying to monopolize the space for your self. Or possibly a poser with anti busking sentiments trying to dilute and destroy the art form. The fact that so many buskers abound in our nations capitol is proof of it's legitamacy as an artform. You just catagorically denied all of the people listed without citing any legitimate frauds who were not buskers or famous locally.</p>
<p>WITH REGARD TO THE PLACING OF LINKS I THINK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY LINKS TO PERFORMERS PERSONAL SITES IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE DOUCUMENT. list em but do't link em there.

<p>The editors had to remove tons of spam about 2 weeks ago. Somebody has also put their whole website onto the busking page and added multiple links to their own site in an attempt to get people to buy their products. All the busker "vocabulary" is a complete hoax which will contribute to eventually make Wikipedia's concept of self-editing a laughingstock (Source: CNN).</p>

<dd>If you know this material in the vocabulary section is a hoax, please remove it. As I do not know this to be a fact either way (my contributions to this article are mostly formatting and other mundain "polishing" tasks), I have added the approprate tags to this and other sections that need verification.

<p>Hello All I am an expert on busking who was writing a book on it til i shelved the project when my computers were destroyed a few months ago. I discovered this wikipedia page a few weeks ago and have been rewriting it anonymously with the help of a few of you. I have written about 3/4 of what is currently up. I want to thank the person who has been editing and hooking up all the links. My question is to that somebody who wants to cleanup the famous buskers and noted buskers area. What do you see wrong? When I look at those areas all that I can think of is that some of the people listed in the noted practitioners area should be moved to the famous buskers area. Is that what you are thinking?</p>

<p>Excuse me, but why are *nonbuskers* taking off *busker edits* that have total relevance to buskers? Look, stop being asses here. This is an important topic and unless *you* are a 30 year vet at busking, you have a lot of nerve saying this issue of lawsuits is irrelevant. Leave this topic to *those who know it* please. I am responsible for putting up the topic category of *current* buskers, which you did not have up until I put it there. I filled out a list of *current* buskers for you. I know what I am doing. I also resolved this issue re busker and street performer since *I am both for 30 years and know what I am talking about unlike the first posters here* so let me say, I filled this page out from the measley thing it was when I found it and I am going to KEEP filling it up with relevant edits and I want you to knock off removing my posts here as I am the busker here, not the ones editing me so it seems. I am SURE I have more years as a busker than ANYONE editing this page. And again, I am the one who just got this page up to speed with REAL buskers nowadays, not some stupid people who are famous now but were buskers category which is all you had when I showed up.

<p>In the article the sentence</p>
<p><i>Some of them report their income to the Internal Revenue Service; some don't.</i></p>
<p>Is USA specific. The wording should be changed to be more generalized. E.g. I'm sure there are <i>buskers</i> outside of the US but the IRS does not have jurisdiction outside of the US.</p>
<p>Also, implicit in the sentence is the idea that busking income is considered taxable in all places. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkyj_462c.html" title="User:Funkyj">Funkyj</a> 22:25, 2005 May 15 (UTC)</p>
<p>perhaps we should differentiate between buskers, who play a circle-show, who need an audience, standing and looking, passing the hat after the full show, and those who do not play for a standing audience, but for the walking public, letting the hat stay in front of them all the time, they perform (e.g. often musician, or only "practicing" jugglers,...) regards.</p>

<p>THIS BELOW IS NOT RIGHT. I AM A BUSKER FOR 27 YEARS! Buskers ARE NOT just musicians!!!

<dd>I still think they should be merged. If not they at least need clarifying in the intros. Being an American English speaker, I never heard of the word "busk" until I came to this article; I always knew both as "street performer". And the "list of British English differences" articles agrees that in Am.E. busk translates to "street performer". I see busking as a subset of street performers and there definitely are those that blur the distinction (juggling with dancing monkeys while playing music). If you take offense at buskers being classified as street performers, how about a neutral encompassing term -- maybe "street entertainers"&#160;? <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">01-12</a>&#160;12:31<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

<p>Buskers are also known as street performers, I've been one for 15 years so I know that the term is interchangable. However, not all Street performers are Buskers. There are a great many Street performers who get payed to perform on the streets at festivals all around the world, many of these performers never go busking (collecting money during or after the performance from the audience).</p>
<p>Isn't panhandling basically the same thing as busking or street performing? On Wikipedia it says that panhandling is simply begging for money from strangers, but my idea of panhandling is a lot closer to busking than mere begging. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlannel_e372.html" title="User:Flannel">Flannel</a> 21:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC) Yes, I agree, merge busking and street performing, but do note that not all street performers get paid, not all 'pass the hat' or ask for pay, and some get paid by the community or whatever for a certain length of time, or whatever.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 11:55, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I used to catch Phillipe (?) Petite's juggling, unicycle and improvised slackwire act in Washington Square Park when he first came to the US in the early 70s. After he walked between the World Trade Center towers in the summer of 1974 he became famous and no longer did street acts. He was an awesome circle performer who had excellent crowd control using just his whistle, unicycle, and pantomime. I don't think he spoke English at the time. I would post something, but I'm a little fuzzy on the spelling of his first name. -- Etan Ben-Ami</p>

<p>Thought I ought to start a bit of discussion here, if only to give a point of reply for whoever is making all the edits with regards to busker lawsuits and the alleged oppression of buskers. I've edited out most of the rabidly NPOV content, replacing it with a neutral statement that there are some people who feel buskers are oppressed and fighting for free speech, rather than endorsing that view as previously done. Also, the link that was previously present, while on its face appearing to be a link to some kind of legal citation which one would expect to go to an NPOV transcript or summary, in fact was a link to a very plainly POV pro-busker page, which from its content and style appears to belong to the man who is a "BUSKER FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS" and behind many of the previous POV edits. While POV links are not necessarily totally impermissible when used to point out the existence of certain views, to present them in a manner which appears as an endorsement, with no representation of competing views, and at least in my opinion very poor conetnt on the link itself, is not of encyclopedic merit. Also, POV statements don't cease to be POV by taking the previously problematic paragraphs and inserting quotation marks. I'd propose to whoever is making these problematic edits, could you possibly find some neutral sources to link to with regards to the cases you want to point out? Court transcripts, or even reports of a reasonably respectable government or similar entity would be of merit, but a personal web site railing against oppression is hardly NPOV. 203.35.216.230 03:55, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kirsten Anderberg aka Mother Zosima (the man who is a "BUSKER FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS") is a woman, for what it's worth. She does need to learn appropriate wikipedia style, particularly that we do not have arguments with other editors on the article side of the page. As a performer, perhaps she is familiar with the concept of on-stage versus backstage? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a></dd>

<p><b>Kirsten</b>, your contributions may be very valuable, but please keep discussion of the article backstage, to keep the article clean and presentable to the idle reader. Also bear in mind that we insist on a neutral point of view, and do not endorse any viewpoint as correct. Try to keep that in mind when editing, it's possible to express controversial material in a way that does not show a bias toward one or another side of the controversy. Also bear in mind that the wikipedia is used worldwide, and not only in one or another country, some material may be confusing if its geographic context is not included. If I can be of any help to you in understanding wikipedia standards, or in any other way, leave me a message on my talk page. I've worked with street performers and other 'weirdos like you' most of my life, I'm about your age, I'm on your side if you need some help, just ask.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 21:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the following paragraph from the main artivle space &amp; have placed here for discussion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the early 90's PBS aired a video called "Street People". It revealed some very interesting information on studies done from local universities around New York and Boston. They studied street people of all sorts; buskers, street vendors, panhandlers, beggers and the homeless, cops, cabbies and maintenance workers. The studies showed that crime rates tend to decrease around areas in which buskers routinely perform. The old adage "Music Soothes the Savage Beast" was found to be true. The studies also showed that buskers attract and are supported by a better educated, more intelligent, wealthier class of people. This video and those studies were one of the motivating factors in New York's decision to allow buskers to perform in the subway system.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I did an extensive search of the PBS website to verify this information, but could find nothing. this post is an invitation to otheres to cite soutces for these very specific claims. so that this paragraph can legitimatly be reincluded in the main article.

<p><b>Argon</b> I did not say it was produced by pbs. I said it was aired by a pbs statiion. There are 2 pbs affiliated stations in the area it was broad cast. i am emailing them to see if they can give me the producers and source of the video. But it was on the air and does exist as sure as there is wikipedia. Why are you so determined to be arguementative and quash and obfuscuarate everything about busking?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see you have added this paragraph back in. I think it's fine, but please leave the <i>fact</i> tag there, along with the others I have added to the article. By adding the <i>fact</i> tags where I have, I am not disputing that these are actually true statements, or saying in some way that you must personally do this research. Instead I am indicating the locations of specific claims that need someone (you, me, or anyone) to provice a proper citation. Including these tags on Wikipedia articles is one way to demonstrate good faith on the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a> and the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> issues that can be brought up on on many articles. It shows that the areas of the article so marked are still a work in progress, and that it is known that these specific claims need supporting evidence.</dd>

<p>Could someone find some citations addressing busking in other parts of the world? The citations are quite specific to the U.K. right now. <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedantm_9bac.html" title="User:Vedantm">vedantm</a> 03:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the thing is I'd imagine a lot of this is people talking from experience. For example I added, amongst other things, the comment that performing to captive audiences is commonplace in some places, for example in Europe, since while travelling there I saw it on a regular basis on public transport. Yet I can't really use that as a citation. (though if anyone can suggest a way of getting around this, feel free) <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_8397.html" title="User:Plasma">Plasma</a> 10:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel the citation process is being abused here. Most of the things in the law and the code areas are actually common law items. Things such as the captive audience concept, not blocking sidewalks, loud music, etc.</p>

<p>Argon what are you doing. You have vandalized all the work i did in pitfalls. You removed all the info re stereotyping and stigmatizing of buskers which is criminal under the torte of defamation laws. Although these are not major issues, they are real problems encountered by real buskers and legitimate pitfalls of busking. WHY<b>???</b> You also removed all the work i did re legal and rewrote it to be very misleading about the nature of free speech in the USA. U use this locals phrase all over the place, local to where?? u make it seem that it is common and in the USA to regulate free speech when it is not. It is basicly illegal in the USA to regulate free speech above and beyond the common law standards already outlined. In the USA the power free speech is absolute. The judges in all of the decisions have stated so repeatedly. Busking is protected under the first and 14th amendments. What part of that don't u get&#160;??? I was just beginning to lay down some the narrow legal criteria under which free speech can be regulated and you erased it all. Why <b>???</b> The biggest reason people try to regulate buskers is the white collar crime of monopolization of cash flow and you erased all traces of it. Some of the biggest violaters of this are business associations and business improvement districts. Are you representing these interests<b>???</b> The proofs of this are in the waikiki and st augustine lawsuites. Both cities used phony fronts of public safety issues at the urging of local business associations to try and get monopolies on cash flows and the courts saw through this in both instances. Those are just a few of the more prominent cases. Don't make me put down all the other numerous cases i have found. It would be tedious and redundant. You also put in a demand for citation which I am removing. All of those court cases below are the citations needed. Whats up with the obtuse behavior <b>???</b> ARGON u seemed like a sincere decent person. Please don't affiliate yourself with trying to cover up or defend criminal behavior or be responsible for diluting the absolute nature of free speech in the USA. When i get the time I am going to redo the work i did unless you revert it yourself and if you undo it again i will declare a npov issue re this article on the grounds u are trying to cover up scandulous behavior.</p>
<p>also you removed the stuf on the video just when i was gettin some headway on finding out the who and when of it. I had found that the studies it was based on were done at harvard and the time may have been way before what i mentioned. i had the names of the students who did the studies but had to leave the computer before i could record them or the url. i am working to refind the site. my girl friend says i have name wrong and that it was "music underground" or something like that. ive done a litle research on this and it could be except music underground seems to be made in the wrong location. im fairly posative the film was about new york. i wont know for sure until ive viewed Music Underground if it was the one. ther is also a video called "street music" but i dont think it was produced until 2001. i saw my video in the early 1990's</p>

<p>re the case law area in all civil actions there are 2 sides. the defendants pov are stated yet the buskers pov continually gets wiped of the page. that is not nutrality bu a the real lopsided pov for the defendants even though they lost in all these cases. There is a real npov issue here. whoever keeps doing it is not acting in the best best interests of wikipedia or informing people about whats happening in the real world of busking or free speech in america. in order to be more fully informed both sides should be represented but this individual is desperately trying to hide the victorious buskers sides. Ya just gotta wonder why? what underlies such unreasonable behavior.</p>
