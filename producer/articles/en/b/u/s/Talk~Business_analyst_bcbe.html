<p>I've removed a big block of text that praised this Goldsmith fellow's book.. "Goldsmith's book in fact deals exclusively with how to discover the REAL, business requirements and also identifies... Goldsmith also presents public and in-house training on both discovering and evaluating business requirements."

<p>So what qualifies as a cleanup that is good enough to have the notice removed? As a newbie I just thought I'd ask. I did some significant edits but plan to do more. I stayed largely within the existing structure (nervous newbie) but the more I consider it, the more I think the structure can be improved.</p>
<p>One thing I plan to try and tackle is the grey areas around what is a business analyst (vs. a systems analyst <i>et al</i>) and the deliverables and responsibilities of a BA (Business Requirements, Functional Specification etc.) <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Kay_7be6.html" title="User:Andrew Kay">Andrew Kay</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Kay_3f3a.html" title="User talk:Andrew Kay">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andrew_Kay_2e65.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andrew Kay">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>so what you're saying (forgive me for asking the obvious) is that currently there is too much content and it's not encylopedic?

<p>Would like to have some content on the distictions between the following... Business Analysis is what and is performed by a ... e.g. a 'Business Analyst'</p>
<p>Systems Analysis -&gt; Functional Analyst</p>
<p>Systems Analysis &amp; Design -&gt; Functional Analyst</p>
<p>Business Systems Analysis -&gt; Functional Analyst</p>
<p>Business Systems Analysis &amp; Design -&gt; Functional Analyst</p>
<p>Business Systems Analysis is a stage within a systems development framework which seeks to 'produce a logical analysis of the existing system, extracting from it the implicit requirements of the business, which must obviously be taken into account in the design of the new system.' - Crinnion</p>
<p>Business Processs Re-engineering -&gt; BA</p>
<p>Professional Process Analysis -&gt; BA</p>
<p>Business Process Architect -&gt; BA</p>
<p>Business Systems Architect -&gt; Solution Architect</p>
<p><br />
Business Analyst vs. Business Systems Analyst</p>
<p>In this context a 'system' is what? Is it the computerised system only ( i.e. the automated parts of the business ) or is it the whole business function being considered including the manual parts.... which may continue to be manual even if with improved processes.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>A <b>Business Analyst</b> investigates what the Business needs and wants (Business perpective). How this is going to be fulfilled is entirely up to the <b>Functional Analyst</b> who translates the requirements into system functions/solutions. However the requirement could be a manual process without any systems involved or a paper based file etc. A technical BA (Business Systems Analyst) is someone who has BA skills and technical skills. Their focus is primairly on the implementation of a system rather than on what the Business wants.</p>
<p>In sort: Functional Analyst is the same as System Analyst or Solution Designer. A Business Systems Analyst is a Technical BA who focuses on the system that need to deliver the functionality derived from the Business requirements. A <b>Business Analyst</b> is merely focused on the Business than on Function/Solution/Systems. However said that, a <b>BA</b> has as task to track the Business requirements through implementation and roll out to ensure that the Business requirement is correctly translated into a function (or multiple functions). Their role is to solve any Business Issue that might pop up during implementation and present/liaise with the Business to get their approval on the resolution (e.g. work arounds, manual process to solve missing functionality in an of the shelf product).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Answer 2:</b></p>
<p>The above is in disagreement with <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/businessAnalysts.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/businessAnalysts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/businessAnalysts.htm</a></p>
<p>Also it assumes that a group of manual processes can't be a ( manual ) business <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">system</a>?</p>
<p>And a group of manual and computerised processes aren't together a single business <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">system</a>?</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>Agile programming and Waterfall approach are two totally different and opposite ideas. Argile programming is based on an iterative process of defining the requirements. Waterfall assumes that the requirements can be gathered upfront (one off activity) and then the software can be built. I don't think the article or BA's need to follow one of these methodologies.</p>
<p>A group of manual processes can be totally paper/people based or just functions in systems/applications whereby the people form the process (they know what to do and when). The terminology is very misleading. We speak of a Business which is basically a group of people who sell and provide a service/product in exchange money or goods. A business system is basically just an IT system that supports the business in their goal. (e.g. CRM system to keep track of their customers, it basically replaces the manual rollodex with of course lot's of extra functions). That system can be totally integrated or just separate applications (E.g. small businesses that uses excel and word as their CRM, Billing and Order mgt system) Anyway I don't think that requirements engineering is an exact science that produces exact requirements that deliver 100% what the customer wants. It's just a method of getting your wishes clear on paper so that the chances of getting to a proper solution for the problem you want to solve is higher.</p>
<p><b>VLC Response:</b></p>
<p>I don't see why a business system must be an IT system, when other domains such as Ecological, Biological, Astrological, etc. don't require any IT to be able to have a system. So in the Commercial domain, the business is a system, with or without IT Hardware and software to provide automation.</p>
<p>Regarding Agile vs. Waterfall, I can believe that the Business Analyst ( or whatever it should be called ) role might be re-branded, but surely the main difference would be more in the area of when or for how long the BA plays a prominent role in the project, not so much in the actual role played except perhaps that in Agile the role may be performed by a more experienced person and be wider in scope. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the Terminology used to describe the role would differ between the two approaches. So perhaps some of the above terms are specific to certain methodologies?</p>
<p><b>Response:</b></p>
<p>It's just a matter of terminology: with System we refer normally to IT automation, with Business the domain. So basically we agree. The Business Analyst applies analytical skills to gather the requirements: "what" the business wants or needs. The solution can be paper based, people, process or guess what an IT system... With Waterfall or Argile: it's just a matter of revisiting the Business requirements to ensure that they are still valid. Hope that helps.</p>
<p>As a Business Analyst, I disagree with the the above. IT people might well assume that a 'system' is a computer system, but there are plenty of business systems which involve no technology. There is the field known as Business Process Re-engineering, which BAs work in, this does not presume any IT involvement. Non-IT people will not necessarily assume that a 'system' is a computer system. Having said that, I don't think that Systems Analyst is a synonym for Business Analyst; the term Systems Analyst is only used in IT and in my experience refers to someone who analyses computer systems. As such this is a technical role, perhaps akin to a systems or technical architect, and is distinct from the role of a BA. HTH Ian</p>

<p>IMHO, there is a distinction that should be discussed, between a business analyst who has a primary emphasis on working with and improving an information system to meet the needs of a business, and the business analyst who is less hands-on with the technology development responsibilities and more concerned with interpretting the data and resulting information to provide decision support. Often the same person does both, but with larger organizations these are distinct roles that go by the same name. Those outside the IS function with the "business analyst" function really operate in a decision support role while the "business analyst" as known by the IT and IS functions is technology focused.</p>
