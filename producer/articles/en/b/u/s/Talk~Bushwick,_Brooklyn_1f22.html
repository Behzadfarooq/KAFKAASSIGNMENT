<p>this new netherland template is total crap. it makes the article look like crap. 2 questions: how come brooklyn lacks an ugly template like this, and how come manhattan lacks an ugly template like this?</p>
<p>this template is further example of rich white people trying to keep a community blighted.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I see the template as "crap", but I may not agree with the current format/layout. If someone wants to research the history of New Netherland, Bushwick would be relevant. It is supposed to "float" to the right, so whitespace to the left should be avoided if possible. In my browser, whenever I click on a link in the template, the template "moves", and that may be why it's "ugly." But if it is converted to a template in the footer, the moving would probably be eliminated. Also, playing with the placement of images and the template may be helpful.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> has this template. Since there is no link in the template to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, the template is not included in that article.</dd>

<p>Ok...here's a good one, I know for a fact that there are more than NO murders in bushwick. Some guy got shot in the face last year. Oh I think the theft is off a bit as well, my roommate and myself we're both mugged here. 24.189.7.86 06:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)Seamus</p>

<p>So a couple weeks ago I moved the New Netherlands box down to the History section where it seems happier. Brooklyn has a whole History article, so that's where the NN box is.</p>
<p>Anyway, what's with this "eight more assaults" than another precinct, and similar numbers? This kind of annual comparison is microscopic; the numbers are bound to fluctuate by half a dozen or more from year to year for reasons that little do do with whether a place has become safer or more perilous. An overall comparison of crime numbers for all parts of northern Brooklyn coving a few years might bring out information of statistical signficance, but the "New Bushwick" statistical presentation is pretty much useless as it stands. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim.henderson_0161.html" title="User:Jim.henderson">Jim.henderson</a> 16:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>the point is to illustrate that Bushwick is comparable to Williamsburg. If you want to get rid of it, or perhaps just make a reference to that weekly numbers are similiar and avaibale on the compstat sight then feel free.</p>

<p>"Nightlife for white residents remains a problem, and they will need to commute to Williamsburg or Manhattan for their own brand of excitement."</p>
<p>This is such a racist statement, and stupid besides. I'm Puerto Rican (that's right- FROM Puerto Rico) and just moved into the neighborhood, and while my crowd is the hipster and artist set, I am very much not white. Ignorant hateful punks.</p>
<p>-Gaby from Guaynabo City and now Bushwick!</p>
<p><br />
Okay then, if you know of nightlife spots, for hipsters, families, or whatevers, please include them. I'd love to know where to go locally. I think its wrong to sayt nightlife for whites as well, and I have no idea who added that word.</p>

<p>I added the (ed) as a translation as a translation fro colonial english to modern american english. While in colonial times, the humor in and the root of strand appeared clear to Bushwick residents, who must have found this region surrounded by bog and swamp inaccessable to be "stranded" from the rest of bushwick, no one today will ever feel that williamsburg is geographically stranded from the rest of mainland brooklyn. The articles cited call the land "the strand," 310 years later, I think its safe to say that if they spoke todays english they'd call it the stranded.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Eh? Today "strand" has been verbed, but was this already true 300 years ago? Alas, I'm not near my books, but "strand" is Old English for "river bank" or "beach". Eventually it came to be used nautically as "beached" meaning run aground upon a strand, but I thought in Shakespeare's time this hadn't happened yet. Lacking direct evidence, isn't it more likely the term "Bushwick Strand" referred to mudflats along the Left Bank of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown_Creek_7f59.html" title="Newtown Creek">Newtown Creek</a>? <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim.henderson_0161.html" title="User:Jim.henderson">Jim.henderson</a> 01:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Such as the Neighborhood section needs a reworking, it definitely is not objective in the least. That the "adventurous sort can cross Flushing Avenue, stroll down Knickerbocker Avenue" is not only a terrible way to put it but offensive as well. "The New Bushwick" section is also terrible, seeming like its just an advertisment for real estate agents trying to sell apartments to young "hip" kids in Bushwick. --<a href="../../../v/s/t/User%7EVsthesquares_3c3f.html" title="User:Vsthesquares">Vsthesquares</a> 17:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is written largely subjectively and has areas of blantant racism. "African Americans and Puerto Rican migrants, who were poorer and had a lower social class than their white counterparts," for example. Saying they were both poorer and of a lower social class is redundant for one, but what it the need for "than their white counterparts"? "The neighborhood's character becomes less like Williamsburg and more similar to that of neighboring Bed-Stuy and Brownsville, Brooklyn once crossing Gates Ave" is also really offensive. Is it because there are a lot less "white people"? The neighborhoods each have different very distinct characters to them. For example, Bed-Stuy is largely an african-american neighborhood with a long history of being a very afro-centric arts and cultural center. While Bushwick has a very different history with once being a area plagued by the mafia, which caused a flight of people. afterwards the area of the world immigrants moved in from was more Caribbean and Latin American countries, largely Dominican and Puerto Rican. Saying they have similar character is untrue and straight out racist. --<a href="../../../v/s/t/User%7EVsthesquares_3c3f.html" title="User:Vsthesquares">Vsthesquares</a> 17:37, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
