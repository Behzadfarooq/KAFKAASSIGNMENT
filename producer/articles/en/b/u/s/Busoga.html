<p>The three million Basoga <i>(2002 census)</i> (singular <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musoga.html" title="Musoga">Musoga</a>; often referred to simply by the root word and adjective, Soga) make up one of the largest Ugandan ethnic <i>(2nd or 3rd largest)</i> group or <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribe</a>, although they represent only about 11 percent of the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population.html" title="Population">population</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basoga.html" title="Basoga">Basoga</a> are peace-loving people who traditionally lived in small homesteads comprising of the father, mother, children and relatives.

<p>Written history begins for Busoga in the year 1862. On the 28th July 1862, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hanning_Speke_2033.html" title="John Hanning Speke">John Hanning Speke</a>, an explorer for the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Geographical_Society_77ec.html" title="Royal Geographical Society">Royal Geographical Society</a>, arrived at Ripon Falls, near the site of the modern town of <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja.html" title="Jinja">Jinja</a>, where the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Nile_240a.html" title="Victoria Nile">Victoria Nile</a> spills out of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Victoria_60f7.html" title="Lake Victoria">Lake Victoria</a> and begins its descent to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Since Speke’s route inland from the East African coast had taken him around the southern end of the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Victoria_60f7.html" title="Lake Victoria">lake Victoria</a>, he approached Busoga from the west through Buganda. Having reached his goal – the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_of_the_Nile_c21e.html" title="Source of the Nile">source of the Nile</a>, he turned northward and followed the river downstream without further exploring Busoga. He records, however, being told that “<a href="../../../u/s/o/Usoga.html" title="Usoga">Usoga</a>” <i>(the KiSwahili form of the name ‘Busoga’)</i> was an “island”, which indicates that the term meant to surrounding peoples essentially what it means today. The present day Busoga <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">Kingdom</a> was, and still is, bounded on the north by the swampy <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Kyoga_0041.html" title="Lake Kyoga">Lake Kyoga</a>, on the west by the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Nile_240a.html" title="Victoria Nile">Victoria Nile</a>, on the south by <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Victoria_60f7.html" title="Lake Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>, and on the east by the Mpologoma (Lion) River.</p>

<p>Due to the continuous movements and intermingling of people within the Busoga region, the history of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basoga.html" title="Basoga">Basoga</a> is complex. It can be asserted, however, that the earliest inhabitants of Busoga belonged to the same <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantu.html" title="Bantu">Bantu</a> group comprising the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banyoro.html" title="Banyoro">Banyoro</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baganda.html" title="Baganda">Baganda</a>. Their origins can therefore be traced, like other <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantu.html" title="Bantu">Bantu</a> groups, to the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katanga.html" title="Katanga">Katanga</a> region of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Africa_dbbc.html" title="Central Africa">Central Africa</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest ancestors of this group were <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kintu.html" title="Kintu">Kintu</a> and others who came from Mountain Elgon in the east. He founded some families in Busoga before passing on to Buganda where he established the present day Buganda Kingdom. His temporary settlement in Busoga gave rise to various families that were later to form many of Busoga’s <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clans.html" title="Clans">clans</a>. Later on, it is believed that most people from Busoga, especially southern Busoga, were <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baganda.html" title="Baganda">Baganda</a> migrants who originally came from Buganda in the early 14th Century and overwhelmed the original inhabitants – most of who were <a href="../../../l/u/o/Luo.html" title="Luo">Luo</a> who came from the north and <a href="../../../i/t/e/Iteso.html" title="Iteso">Iteso</a> who came from the north-east. They then spread into other parts of Busoga.</p>
<p>Later on, there was a movement of the Babiito royalty from Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom. These early settlers are known as the Baisengobi. The Baisengobi penetrated Busoga through the Northern parts of Busoga and moved eastwards where they made a U-turn under the leadership of one of Bunyoro Kingdom’s sons, called Prince Mukama 'Namutukula' (the light skinned one) and settled in central and northern Busoga. Although the Biasengobi emerged around the 16th Century, well after the group from Buganda had settled in many parts of Busoga, they played a big role in the further formation and evolution of Busoga, as well as the cultural set up of the area. However, Buganda began to play an even bigger role later on, as Bunyoro became weaker.</p>
<p>The Basoga were organized into <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principalities.html" title="Principalities">principalities</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiefdoms.html" title="Chiefdoms">chiefdoms</a> that were partly under the influence of Bunyoro and later under the partial influence of Buganda. In the early times, the death of a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief.html" title="Chief">chief</a> was first reported to the Mukama of Bunyoro who would send the funeral bark cloth and all the necessary requirements for the burial rites. On several occasions, he used to appoint the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir.html" title="Heir">heir</a> or send back the son of the deceased chief if the son happened, as was usually the case, to be at the Mukama's court in Bunyoro.</p>

The Ugandan Asians, who had been brought to Uganda from the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_sub-continent.html" title="Indian sub-continent">Indian sub-continent</a> by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British</a> during colonial times, had helped to establish <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja.html" title="Jinja">Jinja</a> as one of East Africa’s most vibrant commercial centers.</p>
<p>Busoga experienced massive movement of people right from the early period that led to its construction as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>. Several factors contributed to the trend of events. They included mainly factors ranging from <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine.html" title="Famine">famine</a> and security for their lives and property. Today, these factors continue to affect and define the population mobility in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">kingdom</a>, in addition to the quest for <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">employment</a> and social amenities. The changes in the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographical.html" title="Demographical">demographical</a> trends have continued to witness a population influx in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban.html" title="Urban">urban</a> and peri-urban areas of Busoga kingdom for the above reasons. <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towns.html" title="Towns">Towns</a> like <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja.html" title="Jinja">Jinja</a>, <a href="../../../i/g/a/Iganga.html" title="Iganga">Iganga</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamuli.html" title="Kamuli">Kamuli</a>, and their surrounding areas are some of the areas that continue to face high levels of <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration.html" title="Immigration">immigration</a>. Immigrants join town life in search for <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">jobs</a>, security for their lives and food.</p>
<p>Between the period 1920 and 70s, <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja.html" title="Jinja">Jinja</a>, Busoga’s <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_city.html" title="Capital city">capital city</a>, experienced economic changes and gained in economic importance. During this period, it transformed into an industrial town with the stead high <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a> production, the completion of <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda_Railway_3677.html" title="Uganda Railway">Uganda Railway</a> and Owen falls dam. These factors elevated <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja.html" title="Jinja">Jinja</a> into an agro-industrial centre pausing with over 46 factories, several <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage_industries.html" title="Cottage industries">cottage industries</a> and well-developed infrastructure. These developments attracted people in the form of labour from the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> areas of Busoga to work in those factories, help in house keeping or in doing other urban development related activities. Externally, many people came from the neighbouring areas of Busoga. Among the new comers were families of Asian origin who came to do business. Estates like Mpumudde and Walukuba were developed to accommodate the increasing population. Other services like piped water, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roads.html" title="Roads">roads</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospitals.html" title="Hospitals">hospitals</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schools.html" title="Schools">schools</a> were also extended to serve the population.</p>
<p>But in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villages.html" title="Villages">villages</a> the majority of people, with the assured market in towns, concentrated on <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. They grew both cash and food crops like <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bananas.html" title="Bananas">bananas</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potatoes.html" title="Potatoes">potatoes</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassava.html" title="Cassava">cassava</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruits.html" title="Fruits">fruits</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetables.html" title="Vegetables">vegetables</a>.</p>
<p>Their <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standards_of_living.html" title="Standards of living">standards of living</a> drastically improved and Busoga kingdom raised its <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a> and constructed more infrastructures. It forgot about subsistence system of life and turned to real economic production that was in demand by <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europeans.html" title="Europeans">Europeans</a>.</p>
<p>In the pre-colonial era, people left their traditional lands. State structures disappeared. A number of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clans.html" title="Clans">clans</a> and states decimated and peole migrated into Busoga in large numbers in this century, carrying with them the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditions.html" title="Traditions">traditions</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultures.html" title="Cultures">cultures</a> of other lands. The most important causes of these movements were Marjory families and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemics.html" title="Epidemics">epidemics</a>, which occurred within and the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>About the turn of the 16th Century, an important event took place, which was to give the Basoga their peculiar cultural configuration. This was the advent of the Baisengobi <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clan</a>; the light skinned people, who bear their historical discendancy from Bunyoro. Prince Mukama Namutukula from the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">royal family</a> (Babiito) of Bunyoro is said to have left Bunyoro around the 16th Century and as part of Bunyoro’s expansionist policy and trekked eastwards across <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Kyoga_0041.html" title="Lake Kyoga">Lake Kyoga</a> with his wife Nawudo, a handful of servants, arms and a dog, and landed at Iyingo, located at the northern point of Busoga in the present day Kamuli district.</p>
<p>Prince Mukama loved hunting and his adventures exposed him to the beauties of the new found land. For sometime he engaged himself in black smith, making hoes, iron utensils and spears. Prince Mukama and wife Nawudo bore several children of whom only five boys survived. On his departure back to Bunyo, [[Prince Mukama allocated them areas within his influence as overseers. In this way, the first-born Wakoli was given to oversee the area called Bukooli, Zibondo was to administer Bulamogi, Ngobi was given Kigulu, Tabingwa was to oversee Luuka, while the youngest son Kitimbo was to settle in Bugabula. These loosely allotted areas of supervision to the Prince’s sons were later to become major administrative and centers cultural authority in Busoga. With time passing without the expected return of their father, the five sons of Prince Mukama regarded themselves as the legitimate rulers over their respective areas by virtue of their family origin (Babiito). They continued to preside over their respective dominions; employing governing methods and cultural rituals like those from <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunyoro-Kitara_b9e8.html" title="Bunyoro-Kitara">Bunyoro-Kitara</a>. This state of affairs in Busoga's political and cultural arrangement continued till the late 19th century when the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialists.html" title="Colonialists">colonialists</a> persuaded the rulers of Busoga into some form of <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federation</a>. This federation resulted into a regional Busoga council called Busoga Lukiiko.</p>
<p>Before 1906, although it was often called a ‘Kingdom’, it was debatable whether Busoga could really be classified as such. Unlike its more powerful western neighbor, <a href="../../../b/u/g/Buganda.html" title="Buganda">Buganda</a>, Busoga did not have a central ‘all-powerful’ figurehead (<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">King</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen.html" title="Queen">Queen</a>) until 1906, at the behest of the British colonial powers. Prior to this, the Basoga were organized in semi-autonomous <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiefdoms.html" title="Chiefdoms">chiefdoms</a>, partly under the influence of Bunyoro initially, and then later on, under the partial influence of Buganda.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the British to Uganda, there was no uniting leadership in Busoga. When Uganda became a British protectorate, attempts were made to create a central form of administration on the model of Buganda which was a fully fledged <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">Kingdom</a>. The Buganda King – the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabaka.html" title="Kabaka">Kabaka</a> had <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lineage.html" title="Lineage">lineage</a> going back centuries. However, in Busoga some of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiefs.html" title="Chiefs">chiefs</a> had been simply appointed by the Kabaka – and it is believed that in some cases they were descendants of favored Baganda chiefs who were given authority to rule over land in Busoga. Others simply belonged to powerful landowning families in Busoga that had become self-appointed rulers over vast areas. The British brought all these chiefs into an administrative structure called the Lukiiko. The British appointed a <a href="../../../m/u/g/Muganda.html" title="Muganda">Muganda</a> from Buganda, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semei_Kakungulu_of_Buganda_Busoga_52a1.html" title="Semei Kakungulu of Buganda/Busoga">Semei Kakungulu</a> as the President of the Lukiiko and he became Busoga’s first 'King' although the British refused to give him that title.</p>
<p>However wrangles amongst the different chiefs and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clans</a> continued, and most Basoga still retained affiliation to their chief, clan or dialect. It was also not helpful that the '<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">King</a>' was from Buganda. The Lukiiko structure collapsed. The structure had however given the Basoga a taste of what influence they could muster in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectorate.html" title="Protectorate">protectorate</a> if they had a King. It would elevate them to the level of Buganda or Bunyoro.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the white colonial ruler were grooming Chief <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosia_Nadiope_172a.html" title="Yosia Nadiope">Yosia Nadiope</a>, the Gabula of [Bugabula to become the first permanent resident ruler of the formed Busoga federation. <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadiope.html" title="Nadiope">Nadiope</a> had been one of the first <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basoga.html" title="Basoga">Basoga</a> students to study at Kings College Budo in 1906. However, catastrophe struck Busoga in 1913, when <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadiope.html" title="Nadiope">Nadiope</a> died of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. The following year 1914, Chief Ezekeriel Tenywa Wako, the Zibondo of Bulamogi was completing his studies at Kings College Budo. With the support of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British</a> coupled with his background as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">Prince</a>, Zibondo of Bulamogi, with his good educational background, was a suitable candidate for the top post. In 1919, the hereditary saza chiefs of Busoga resolved in the Lukiiko to elect <a href="../../../e/z/e/Ezekerial_Tenywa_Wako_3597.html" title="Ezekerial Tenywa Wako">Ezekerial Tenywa Wako</a> as president of Busoga. Chief Gideon Obodha of Kigulu, a contending candidate for the post was not familiar with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_system.html" title="British system">British system</a>, while William Wilberforce Nadiope Kadhumbula of Bugabula was still an infant. His regent Mwami Mutekanga was a mukoopi (a commoner) who couldn’t run for the post. Eventually, in 1918-9, the title of <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_7a3b.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga">Isebantu Kyabazinga</a> was created and one of the chiefs, <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wako.html" title="Wako">Wako</a> took the throne. He was given a salary of 550 <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_%28currency%29.html" title="Pound (currency)">pounds</a>, permitted to collect <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxes.html" title="Taxes">taxes</a> in Butembe county in lieu of the lost role in his traditional chiefdom of Bulamogi. In 1925, <a href="../../../e/z/e/Ezekiel_Tenywa_Wako_463f.html" title="Ezekiel Tenywa Wako">Ezekiel Tenywa Wako</a>, the <a href="../../../k/y/a/Kyabazinga_of_Busoga_d174.html" title="Kyabazinga of Busoga">Kyabazinga of Busoga</a> became a member of Uganda Kings Council, consisting of the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabaka_of_Buganda_0d9a.html" title="Kabaka of Buganda">Kabaka of Buganda</a>, the <a href="../../../k/y/a/Kyabazinga_of_Busoga_d174.html" title="Kyabazinga of Busoga">Kyabazinga of Busoga</a>, the <a href="../../../o/m/u/Omukama_of_Bunyoro_b4ae.html" title="Omukama of Bunyoro">Omukama of Bunyoro</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/u/Omukama_of_Toro_0c59.html" title="Omukama of Toro">Omukama of Toro</a>/Omukama of Tooro and Omugabe of Ankole.</p>
<p>On 11 February 1939 Owekitibwa E.T.Wako (late father of the current <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a>, HRH Henry Waako Muloki), the Zibondo of Bulamogi was installed as the first <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a> which title he continued to hold until 1949 when he retired due to old age. By the time Owekitibwa E.T. Waako retired as the <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a>, the Busoga Lukiiko had expanded to include people other than the Hereditary Rulers. These members of the Busoga Lukiiko were elected representatives – two from each of the then 55 Sub-counties in Busoga.</p>
<p>When Owekitibwa E.T.Waako retired, it was necessary to replace him. The Busoga Lukiiko resolved then that the <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a> shall always be elected among the five lineages of Baise Ngobi (Ababiito) hereditary rulers – traditionally believed to have been the five sons of <a href="../../../o/m/u/Omukama_of_Bunyoro_b4ae.html" title="Omukama of Bunyoro">Omukama of Bunyoro</a> who immigrated to Busoga from Bunyoro, namely:</p>
<p>Gabula of Bugabula Zibondo of Bulamogi Ngobi of Kigulu Tabingwa of Luuka Nkono of Bukono</p>
<p>This method of election was used for the subsequent elections of the <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a>, beginning 1949 when Owekitibwa Chief William Wilberforce Nadiope Kadhumbula of Bugabula was elected <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isebantu_Kyabazinga_wa_Busoga_8851.html" title="Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga">Isebantu Kyabazinga wa Busoga</a> for two terms of three years each, followed by Owekitibwa Henry Waako Muloki who also served two terms.</p>
<p>In 1957, the title <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inhebantu.html" title="Inhebantu">Inhebantu</a> was introduced as a description of the wife of the Isebantu. This epitomised the gradual unification of Busoga and the evolution of <a href="../../../o/b/w/Obwa_Kyabazinga_bwa_Busoga_0e2f.html" title="Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga">Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchies.html" title="Monarchies">monarchies</a> were abolished in 1966, the <a href="../../../k/y/a/Kyabazinga.html" title="Kyabazinga">Kyabazinga</a> was dethroned.

<p>In the 19th Century, one of the principle routes along which Europeans travelled from the coast to Buganda passed through the Southern pot of Busoga. From <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Speke_c4c2.html" title="John Speke">John Speke</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Grant_6427.html" title="James Grant">James Grant</a>, Sir Gerald Portal, F.D Lugard, J.R. Macdonald, and Bishop Tucket all noted that Busoga was plentifully supplied with food and was densely settled as a result. However, between 1898 - 99 and 1900-01, the first indications of sleeping sickeness were reported.</p>
<p>In 1906, orders were issued to evacuate the region. Despite the attemps to clear the area, the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> continued in force until 1910. As a result, most of the densely populated port of Busoga, the home land of over 200,000 persons in the 19th Century, was totally cleared of the population in the ten years. Lubas palace at Bukaleba, also the coveted European fruit mission, collapsed and relocated to other parts of Busoga. Southern Busoga constituted of about one third of the land area of Busoga, and, in 1910, southern Busoga was vacant. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the evacuees who survived the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> began to return to their original land. However, in 1940 a new outbreak of sleeping sickness resurfaced in the area, and it was only in 1956 that resettlement, promoted by the government began again, but things were not going to be the same again. Few Basoga returned to their traditional lands.</p>
<p>The consequences of the catastrophe were that the Southern part of Busoga, the area roughly corresponding to what <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnston.html" title="Johnston">Johnston</a> delimited as the most densely populated area, was virtually uninhabited. Other areas originally affected by <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeping_sickness.html" title="Sleeping sickness">sleeping sickness</a>, including the eastern margins of Bukooli and Busiki conties were evidently depopulated too. Famines, too, resulted in substantial population movements. Several areas in north east Busoga and in the adjacent Bukandi district across the Mpologoma river were repeatedly struck by <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine.html" title="Famine">famines</a> - 1898 - 1900, 1907, 1908 - 1917 - 1918 and 1944. Populations in these areoss reduced, many people, falling victims to the famines while the survivors moved to other areas for safety.</p>
<p>The effects of these movements were apparent from the growth in population density in the central area of Busoga and in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban.html" title="Urban">urban</a> and peri-urban areas of Busoga. Many Basoga left Busoga in the same period, settling in other districts. The demographic profile of Busoga today is, as a consequence of all these developments.</p>
<p>Today, Busoga is home to many people, of about 6 different origins, due to similar causes mentioned before, but with different faces. According to 2002 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_census.html" title="Population census">population census</a>, Busoga had a population of just over 3 million people.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/g/Soga.html" title="Soga">Soga</a> social organization emphasised <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descent.html" title="Descent">descent</a> through males. It was therefore a patrilineal society. Four or five generations of descendants of one man, related through male forebears, constituted a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrilineage.html" title="Patrilineage">patrilineage</a>. A group of related <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lineages.html" title="Lineages">lineages</a> constituted a clan, which was symbolised by a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totem.html" title="Totem">totem</a>. Clan leaders could summon a council of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lineage.html" title="Lineage">lineage</a> heads, and council decisions affected all lineages within the lan]. Many of these decisions regulated <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, which had always been between two different lineages or clans, forming important social and political alliances for the men of both lineages. Lineage and clan leaders also helped maintain efficient land use practices, and they inspired pride in the group through <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremony.html" title="Ceremony">ceremonies</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remembrance.html" title="Remembrance">remembrances</a> of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestor.html" title="Ancestor">ancestors</a>.</p>
<p>Early <a href="../../../s/o/g/Soga.html" title="Soga">Soga</a> villages surrounded the home of a chief or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headman.html" title="Headman">headman</a>, which provided a common meeting ground for members of the village.

<p><b>Tamenaibuga -</b> Tamenaibuga is a <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kisoga.html" title="Kisoga">kisoga</a> dance, which demonstrates a sign of friendship, and Unity. Once upon a time, there were two great friends in Busoga. Their friendship was very intimate even to sharing all the things they acquired in life. One day they went for a drink (<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>). In Busoga Kingodom, <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourds.html" title="Gourds">gourds</a> are used to drink beer. When they took one too many of this drink, they developed an argument, which led into a quarrel and eventually a fight. The <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourd.html" title="Gourd">gourd</a>, which they had used to take beer, got broken. The broken <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourd.html" title="Gourd">gourd</a> made matters worse and ended up separating these two great friends. The communities realised that it was very bad for friends to quarrel as this would break the friendship (unity). A dance was thus developed to unite the people of Busoga Kingdom.</p>
