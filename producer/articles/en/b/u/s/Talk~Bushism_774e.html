<p>Why is "more of our imports come from overseas" characterised as a Bushism?</p>
<p>Presumably this is considered a stupid remark because all imports come from overseas, but that is a lazy assumption which is not always correct. Would an import into the USA from Canada or Mexico be considered to have come from overseas? If Switzerland imports something from Germany, is that from overseas?</p>

<dd>The answer, to me, is that this isn't really so funny nor stupid as some folks would make it out to be: as you pointed out, some imports don't come from overseas, so I think it should just be taken out of the article altogether. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 02:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Why no section for Criticism with the various criticisms of "bushisms" with Bush's verbal flubs compared to previous Presidents, and the additional (excessive?) attention paid to them for political purposes?</p>

<dd>I still say what you've done, despite your good intentions, amounts to a <b>dumbing down</b> of the article. Almost, but not quite, in the same category as the car sunscreen with the printed warning "REMOVE BEFORE DRIVING". Do we really need to provide explanations and crutches to all readers? Maybe a large-print edition? A 3rd grade version for the kiddies? Versions for retarded readers? Where's the assumption of the least amount of intelligence on the part of a reader?</dd>
<dd>So far as assisting non-English readers, I think that too is not an especially good idea. Just think of what that would entail if it were undertaken in earnest across the board here; it would be an impenetrable forest of explanations and meta-explanations. You've got to draw the line somewhere; after all, this is the English Wikipedia. I certainly wouldn't go to the DE Wikipedia and complain if I didn't get some nuance in an article there.</dd>
<dd>Also, regarding that comment that you pointed out as support for your explanations: to me, all it means is that that particular Bushism (about "imports from overseas") isn't really funny nor an indication of stupidity. G.W. Bush may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but not <b>everything</b> that comes out of his mouth is stupid. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 02:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, good, I'm glad to see you're willing to talk. As the explanation says, it should have been goods, not imports. While it may be true that we're getting increasing amounts of imports from overseas (as opposed to from the Americas), it's doubtful that Bush was referring to that.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the humor value, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia Is Not</a> a joke book. Our job isn't to be funny, it's to explain.</dd>
<dd>In case you haven't noticed, English is the most common second language on the planet. This is an article about a particular facet of the English language and culture, and therefore of interest to non-native English speakers. Why wouldn't we cater to them? For that matter, some native English speakers may not understand a particular Bushism either.</dd>

<dd>No, but regarding that last item, there's a heck of a long ways between an article on quantum mechanics—which I totally agree shouldn't be aimed at specialists (in fact, that's my complaint about much of the scientific content here, which is written in the worst sort of jargon and clearly intended for a specialist audience, the hell with the layperson)—and an article such as this one, dealing with fairly low-level manglings of language that most people "get" without the need for an explanation. I find the interspersed explanations irritating: am I alone in this?</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree with ILike2BeAnonymous. I also find some articles on WP (particularly those relating to phonetics and linguistics, interests of mine) utterly incomprehensible to a layperson, but this article does not suffer from that problem. I believe it's next to impossible to "skip past" the explanations, given the distracting way you've interspersed them. It was a bold idea, but I feel it unnecessarily clutters the article.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 03:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, with all due respect to you, just because someone says something applies to someone doesn't necessarily make it so.

<dd>The term "Bushism" was invented to pertain to the Father and then BORROWED to apply to the son. Its first use was in 1992. It was used as the title of a Book. The Book can be seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bushisms-President-George-Herbert-Walker/dp/1563053187/ref=sr_1_16/103-0360427-7162216?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1172965499&amp;sr=8-16" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Bushisms-President-George-Herbert-Walker/dp/1563053187/ref=sr_1_16/103-0360427-7162216?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1172965499&amp;sr=8-16" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Notice that it is about the Father, not the son and predates any other source of the term. Per wikipedia standards, articles should be complete. This article is not complete unless it recognizes that both the father and the son had speech patterns and phrases that were described as "Bushisms". --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 23:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It does not describe his life at all, so it is not a biography and it was not written by GHW Bush so it cannot be an autobiography.

<dd>It maybe that the article is incomplete. But you cannot just proclaim that something in 2007 refers to Jr. You must cite a reliable and credible source that says so, and it must not be disputed in any particularly important way. Instead of your fix, the article should be expanded to include the information on the Sr. This article highlights a problem with wikipedia: it is heavily influenced by people who are focused on today's culture and today's headlines. But that is not an appropriate limitation for an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 10:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems there are good points on both sides of this thread. Here are some interesting questions that may be applicable. Why has the article not already been developed with a GHW Bushisms section? If the GHW Bushisms content were to be spun off into its own article, would it be notable enough to survive an AfD? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 17:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Unindent) I suppose it has not already included GHWB references (yet) for a few reasons. 1). I have not yet had the time -- I am traveling constantly and my sources are at home; 2). GHWB is not in power and thus less interesting to discuss or malign (and after all, this is mostly a maligning term); 3). Wikipedia is edited chiefly by young people, many who have a stronger knowledge or interest in current popular culture and focus on what can be found on the internet than serious research into articles. (Evidence: you almost never see newspaper articles cited that are more than about 3 years old, unless they are readily and freely available on the web through a google search. In essence, if it isn't found in Google, it does not exist.) One thing though, per wikipedia rules we cannot simply proclaim that the term refers primarily to the son. We must cite something else (verifiable, reliable) that says so, particularly in comparison to father.</p>
<p>The term really has a long genesis. Originally, Reagan's policies were branded by his opponents as "Reaganism". It was generally used in a negative way, though the Reagan whitehouse aides sometimes turned it around and appropriated it in a positive way. Sometimes (very rarely), the things that Reagan would say would also be called "Reaganism(s)". But these were almost always quips or assertions that displayed his confidence and power. When he left office, GHWB was generally seen as a variation or an extension of the Reagan Presidency. But, where Reagan was the Great Communicator, Bush Sr, stumbled and said silly things, which became "Bushims". So it was originally almost a direct comparison of the communication skills that Reagan had vs the communication inneptitude Bush displayed. In Sr's day, the term was exclusively his and, really, much more prominent in the regular press than it currently is for his son. Since his son came out, the term has been borrowed, reinvigorated or reinstanted or something and applied to him.</p>
<p>My "crusade" as someone called it is considered peculiar. I don't think so. The problem is that this is a "contemporary popular culture" thing. In less than three years, the son will then be as irrelevant as the father is now and the term for both men will fall into equal disfavor. There is no cottage industry or return on investment in casting aspersions toward people not in power, and Jr is currently in power, but not much longer. However, the article will remain in place for years and years, though with less and less attention. In the interest of a valid and strong encyclopedia, I say do not get all excited about the latest faddish trend and stick with things that will have long-term value. In that respect, I'm not sure this article has ANY value, but if it does, it should be complete (and thus less biased, though giving a term that is used to malign someone such attention is, inherently the strong interest of ax grinders). --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 14:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an outsider, I agree that references can be provided for both presidents. It cannot be denied, however, that the term became most well-known during the presidency of GWB. I've added references for both to the introduction, but included that the word is ",currently, mainly" used for GWB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bushism&amp;diff=117623681&amp;oldid=117585950" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bushism&amp;diff=117623681&amp;oldid=117585950" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>I greatly appreciate the effort to find some compromise. However, I do not agree that the term became most well-known during the presidency of GWB. Of course, my saying this and your saying what you said, are both Original Research. But my original research informs my opinion of this and I happen to have a memory of both instances, the recent and the former. I also think that "currently, mainly" is really awful English! I would suggest something like this instead: <b>A Bushism is any of a number of peculiar words, phrases, pronunciations, semantic or linguistic errors that have occurred in the public speaking first of United States Presidents George H. W. Bush more recently by his son George W. Bush. The term (a neologism) has become part of popular folklore and is the basis of a number of websites and published books.</b></dd>

<p>Whether or not it technically qualifies as a Bushism, this is a stupid revert war. The man misspeaks on hundreds of occasions and makes enormous gaffes--if the incident is small enough that it's provoking an arguement, then it's most likely an easily droppable example, if only for the reason that there are much stronger examples out there.</p>
<p>IMO, the strongest examples used for this article would fit the following criteria</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>obviously</i> a Bushism</b></li>
<li><b>funny</b></li>
<li><b>well sourced</b>--while not all Bushisms or even bad Bushism are written about as "he did it again" the next day, the worst ones and the most high profile ones often are</li>
<li><b>notable</b> (was it a major speech? did he say the exact opposite of what he intended, like kerry's infamous joke? was there backlash because he offended people? these busmism are more important than ordinary ones)</li>
</ul>
<p>First, while I do believe it's a bushism, I don't see why it's a great candidate for this article. I don't believe that bushisms must have double sources to stay in the article, and we don't remove unsourced items on site--you can put a fact tag in if something needs a source, especially if removing it becomes a topic of some debate as it did here. That said, <b>unless a case can be made for why this bushism</b>, because I don't find it funny, it isn't well-sourced <i>as a bushism</i>, and it isn't particularly notable--<b>this seems like a weak bushism to include.</b></p>
<p>And as for the revert war itself--this is petty stuff people. First, discussion shouldn't be conducted in summaries anyway--explain the edit, but discuss here, that's what a talk page is for. And once it's been reverted back more than once--if you haven't come to the talk page yet, come to the talk page and take a break from that particular edit, especially if it isn't urgent. A revert war over a Bushism? C'mon people. Let's avoid this stuff. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 09:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I agree with most of it except for the sourcing issue. We cannot accept direct quotes from speeches in the list of Bushisms, <i>unless</i> they have been referred to as a bushims by a secondary source. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>Why? Have we created some special sourcing requirement for this article? Now granted, this isn't a case likely to happen. In the world of blogging, most of his gaffes are documented anyway, slow or fast news day, 1st Bushism of the week or fourth of the day, he generally at least gets a blog or two.</dd>
<dd>The word Bushism is clearly defined and we have sources clearly defining it. So, when a Bushism occurs, as defined by one of those sources and society's use of the word in general, we don't need some official to come down from the mountain and proclaim, "a Bushism has occured." What official would count anyway? Any blogger? Anything published on paper? What would be official enough for this proclation?</dd>
<dd>Bush's speeches are primary sources, and articles and blogs etc. are secondary sources. We can write articles about what happened on TV without needing to cite an article about what happened, because the televsion show itself is the primary source. If we need some official to proclaim a Bushism a Bushism, then this word is not clearly defined, has not integrated into the English language and shouldn't be an article.</dd>
<dd>However, I believe that this word is clearly defined and integrated into the language, and that as such, this article should meet the same standards as any other article about a word, and not need special sourcing requirments.</dd>
<dd>Btw, I do agree that if a statement as a Bushism is disputed, it needs a source, but if it's disputed, I think we can find a better Bushism anyway. Also, I do think that these Bushisms should have sources defining them as Bushisms--it makes the article stronger and the example stronger. And I don't think the issue really will ever come up anyway, but, per my understanding of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, Bushisms don't require this additional source. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 07:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>I also think we should add a section for HW's bushisms. We could use <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/funnyquotes/a/georgehwbushism.htm" class="external text" title="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/funnyquotes/a/georgehwbushism.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> as a good starting source. Btw, that site also has a great bushisms quiz where you can see if you can tell poppy's bushisms from dubya's. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 09:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Good idea, but given the recent referencing issue, I suggest we follow the same way for referencing them as the quote for GWB, meaning both a reference for it being a a bushism and for the quote itself. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>Oh, they obviously need to be referenced as quotes, but there's a whole collection of quotes that can basically be googled. It requires someone picking good ones from the page, googling them, getting the source for it being a quote and creating a section. I'll be out of town and therefore out of internet access for a week, but if it's not done by the time I'm back I'll do it. I just think that that's a great collection to google from. And we can use that page as a source for them being Herbert Walker bushisms, and add additional references, like the book, etc. And at some point down the line polish the section--like look for individual bushism references for individual quotes--better referenced, articles that talk about the impact of the quote hopefully. But working from that site can get us a section set up which I think is a great starting point. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 07:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>
