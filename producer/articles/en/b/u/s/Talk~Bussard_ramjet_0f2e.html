<p>I have a question about ramjets: In the section about the example ramjet design the solar wind velocity relative to the ramjet scoop in interstellar space is said to be 50km/s. But what about when the ramjet exceeds this speed? How can a ramjet approach the speed of light if it keeps getting pushed back by the interstellar medium? Can someone put up an example of what would happen if the ramjet was travelling at, say, 0.9c? <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix_Dance_ed17.html" title="User:Felix Dance">Felix Dance</a> 04:20, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The typical velocity of the solar wind within the solar system is 500 km/s."</p>
<p>In the article this is taken as drag. Now, since we still are within the solar system at the time, then this should be taken as draw (or push), instead of drag. The solar wind is outwards, which also is the direction of the spaceship.</p>
<p>Thus, when still within the solar system, it can enjoy capturing a solar wind of 500km/s, and thrusting its ions back to the same direction, "winning both ways", so to speak. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.186.145.218 (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.186.145.218.html" title="User talk:80.186.145.218">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.186.145.218_d0ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.186.145.218">contribs</a>) on 00:17, 17 December 2005.</small></p>

<p>Ignoring the velocity of the solar wind, does drag not scale as velocity squared, whilst thrust scales as velocity?

That is, is not the "drag" actually somehow pulling the vessel forward, since you are charging particles only forward? Or at worst, a net wash in force, at least at low speeds, as particles behind the ship drawn in would slow it, and particles in front would pull it? however, once you start to clear a wake, that will no longer be the case, as you will be travelling through a region cleared of material by the scoop.</p>
<p>That is, it seems to me that the drag is not in accordance with the properties of physics as I know it.</p>

<p>I wouldn't edit the main article directly, I just made this account, but I *am* an astrophysicist.</p>
<p>Now, the whole idea of a scoop fails miserable because particles hitting the collector at an angle (to be scooped up) will either 1) go right through, or 2) bounce back again at an angle depending on the shape of the scoop. The point is that it is not trivial to get the particles that hit the scoop concentrated in to the engine. In fact, you might as well ditch the scoop all together.</p>
<p>When an electrostatic field is used for ion collection the electrostatic attraction force of the charged grid on the ions will prevent scooped ions from bouncing out of the ramscooop. Tmayes1965</p>
<p>The effective area of the scoop will never be larger than the size of your engine. You would be riding a giant cylinder and I'm afraid the time needed to build up any appreciable acceleration would be too long for any practical purposes.</p>

<dd>To see why anyone thought it was a good idea, I believe that a useful way of looking at the ramjet idea is to think of it as something similar to an (open-ended) <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_mirror.html" title="Magnetic mirror">magnetic mirror</a>. You're interested in material within the loss cone (ions that have an angle of incidence such that they pass through the aperture at the point where the field pinches, instead of being deflected). The idea is that this concentrates some fraction of the incoming plasma. The problem is that in order to get sufficient compression for fusion, you need a very tight pinch with a ridiculously small loss cone, and almost all incident ions are deflected. My understanding is that the drag from deflected ions was overlooked in the original analysis. To add insult to injury, of the atoms that do make it into the pinch, only the deuterium has any hope of fusing, so the work done compressing light hydrogen is wasted. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 08:03, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The kind of compression that nuclear fusion uses is the Teller Ulam-radiation implosion of the fusion fuel plasma.In a magnetic fusion reactor this compression is provided by the axial, or toroidial electromagnetic field deflecting the plasma toward the center of the field . Also not all versions of the ramjet try to induce nuclear fusion in the scooped hydrogen . Some versions just use it as reaction mass. tmayes1965</p>
<p>A good ramjet scoop design can use an electrostatic field to attract the incoming ions, and thus draw them inside the ramjet engine. The magnetic field merely deflects the ions, and thus makes the ions follow a helical spiral path around the field lines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tmayes1965 (<a href="../../../t/m/a/User_talk%7ETmayes1965_0775.html" title="User talk:Tmayes1965">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tmayes1965_3181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tmayes1965">contribs</a>) on 05:42, 24 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>There are some well known calculations that show there is not enough intersteller hydrogen for the ramjet to work. That seems to be the primary issue of feasability. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonPMitchell_cdd5.html" title="User:DonPMitchell">DonPMitchell</a> 04:25, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm neither a mathematician nor an astrophysicist, but there seem to be a couple of things off in the calculation that don't conform to normal rules regarding drag and energy calculatons.</p>
<p>The first is the actual "stopping power" of the shield. As you speed would increase, the relative speed of the ions woul increase as well. At some point you shield would need to be abe to stop and funnel to the engine particles at very, very high speeds. My guess is that this alone will cause a hard cut-off point in your speed. Unless the engine is the same size as you disc, which seems imposible from an engineering point of view.</p>
<p>The second problem is that your drag will increase with your speed as well. If your engine exhaust speed is 500.000m/s, then this seems to be your maximum speed in deep space (when the effect of positive solar winds are trivial). Since you captured ions will hit you shield at 500.000m/s, and you also spit them out at the same speed. I've seen nothing in the description about the initial impact speed of the ion being preserved and te exhaust speed being added to it, so I must assume that the exhaust speed is the maximum speed.The ions will exit the ramjet engine at a much higher velocity, then the velocity at which the ions enter the scoop because the ramjet engine accelerates the ions .tmayes1965</p>
<p>The third problems is that the system still seems to require a lot of fuel just to get started and get it past a speed where enough ions are collected to power the shield, the engine and any power overhead some of the suggested might require (a fussion reactor requires a lot of initial energy).Nuclear fission can also power ramjets. It does not have to be nuclear fusion to power them.tmayes1965</p>

<p>I've removed this material --</p>
<p>" It could also be an inertial confinement fusion reactor in which pellets of lithium 6, or lithium 7 deuteride, undergo <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teller-Ulam_0852.html" title="Teller-Ulam">Teller-Ulam</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_implosion.html" title="Radiation implosion">radiation implosion</a> by high energy laser beams, maser beams, or proton or antiproton particle beams. This will heat and compress the fusion fuel pellet until its temperature is more than 100,000,000 degrees Celsius, and increase the density of the fusion plasma by up to 30 times. This will ignite nuclear fusion in the fusion fuel pellet.</p>
<p>-- because it isn't about ramjets, and maser beams and antiproton particle beams aren't among the plausible ways to ignite inertial confinement fusion reactions. 67.117.145.211 03:58, 27 December 2006 (UTC) Your wrong about that .
