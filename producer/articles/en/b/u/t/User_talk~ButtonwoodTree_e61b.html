<p>Hi! I appreciate your desire to take this tiny article on a very important person and make it into a more complete thing, but you can't just cut and paste material from another website into here unless we have evidence that the author of that material has authorized it for release under the terms of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> or has released it <i>completely</i> into the public domain. Otherwise it is incompatible with Wikipedia's copyright policy and may in fact be copyright infringement, which we of course don't want. One way to get around this is for you to read over the other web page, take notes as to the main points, and then re-write the article yourself from the notes, with a link noting the page which was helpful to you in composing it. In effect, you'd be converting what was previously copyrighted material into material which was free for the world to use, because under U.S. law the <i>ideas</i> of a text cannot be copyrighted but the <i>actual text itself</i> can be. Anyway, I hope that makes sense to you, let me know if there are any questions that you have. See our page on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> if you have any confusion over our licensing policy. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:53, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>ButtonwoodTree, you wrote, "I'm not sure what his religion has to do with it. J.P. Morgan isn't identified as a Protestant." ANSWER: Actually, it has a lot to do with it. For example, at the turn of the 19th/20th century, there was an unofficial ban on jews working in banking and the insurance industries because of the jews' history. Should this also not be talked about? Well, it should be talked about. And it should also be talked about that jews are not only allowed into banking and insurance today, but they run a lot of the largest institutions (Weill at Citicorp, Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan Chase). What's wrong with tracking this? It was acceptable to track that jews were NOT in banking a hundred years ago, so what's wrong with tracking who's running things now? Same goes for politics - I mean, just look at the jews in the White House - they are running the place - jews are crawling all over the White House - but this never gets mentioned in the press (just as the reasons for 9/11 are never discussed - other than that Mohammed Atta et al did it "because they envy our freedom" (that's what Bush said) and because "they envy the way we live" (that's what Cheney said). No mention is made of Israel or the role of jews in the U.S. promoting American support of Israel. In the White House, the Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, he's jewish. Dick Chaney's Chief of Staff Lewis "Scooter" Libby (now departed because he got indicted) is jewish. Chaney himself isn't jewish . . . . but his resume states that he was on the Board of Advisors of the "Jewish Institute for National Defense" (gee, I wonder if he might be pro-jewish?). Bush himself became a born-again Christian/Christian zionist in order to control his alcoholism, so he's fervently pro-Israel. Forrmer Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz - the architect of the invasion of Iraq - he's Jewish (he's now President of the World Bank, where he replaced James Wolfensohn who is jewish). Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bernancke - he's jewish - and of the 6 candidates that Bush considered for the job, 5 were jewish. And before Bernancke, we had Greenspan (who is jewish). And under Nixon we had Arthur Burns - who is jewish (basically, the job of Chairman of the Federal Reserve is now a jewish job). And with Paul Wolfowitz at the DOD, we had Douglas Feith (he's jewish). And Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, while a Christian Scientist, he made his money with Goldman Sachs, so one would expect him to be pro-jewish. And in the Clinton administration, the Treasury Secretary was Robert Rubin, is jewish (and he's now Vice-Chairman of Citicorp - fellow jew Sandy Weill brought him in). What's wrong with tracking who is jewish? When they were NOT in banking, they complained loudly that they were not in those industries. Are we not allowed to talk about them BEING IN those industries now? And that they are also running the White House, the Federal Reserve, and the World Bank (amongst other institutions). What? Are they embarassed to say that the are jews? Or do they not want it pointed out that they are running key parts of America these days? This is easily talked about and acceptable to point out in Europe, but over in America, it is not politically correct, apparently. That's why you Americans end up doing stupid things like that idiotic peace treaty that got signed under the "Camp David Accords" - you Americans got bamboozled into PAYING Israel $2.5 billion a year under that treaty - that's right, Israel wouldn't sign the peace treaty unless they got PAID. And who did the paying? Why, America of course. Why not Europe or, say, Japan? Because if that had ever been proposed, there would have been a huge outcry - we don't pay jews (or anybody else, for that matter) money to sign peace treaties. The Japanese would have laughed at you if you had asked them to pay money to Israel to sign a peace treaty. So you have to pay it. And there is no sunset provision on it - you have to pay them that money forever. WHA-HA-HA-HA!!!!! Suckers. That isn't to say that there isn't a jewish lobby over here in Europe - just look at Spain - the Spanish public overwhelmingly opposed participation in the Iraq invasion - but their gov't (with a jewish lobby pushing it) sent troops anyway against the public's wishes. So, what happens? The muslims blow up the Madrid train system and the Spanish public took to the streets in protest - NOT against the "terrorists", but against their own gov't for taking them into a war that they opposed from the get-go. Berlusconi has also recently cut the number of Italian troops in Iraq because it is causing him political problems due to the overwhelming opposition to it by the Italian public. Then why did Berlusconi do it in the first place if his country didn't want to get involved? Answer - the jewish lobby in Italy. Same thing here in Britain - we had the biggest mass demonstration since WWII against the invasion (82% of the public opposed it), but Blair went and did it anyway? Why? Look at his outside advisors - Lord Levy (jewish), tax lawyer Martin Paisner (jewish), etc. Over here in Europe, we know why they are doing it, because we know who is jewish. You Americans don't know that your country is being run by jews. Why? Because it is politically incorrect to identify people as jewish. Hell, you can't even identify Sandy Weill as being jewish on Wikipedia. But the jews will always remind you that they were excluded a 100 years ago. And they will tell you that there was a limit on the number of jews allowed into Ivy League schools in the 1920's - but they won't tell you that they are about 20% of the Ivy League student population these days, and that they are on the admissions committees and let each other in. Anyway, you Ameicans go right on ahead an spend another trillion dollars on a "war on terror" (in Europe, we consider it a "war on muslims", that there are no such things as "terrorists"). And you go on and do that without knowing why, without being told why you're in that war to begin with. You go ahead and continue to believe that Mohammed Atta did 9/11 because he "envied" you. Idiots, he hated you. Gee, I envy the Swiss and their neutrality - I guess I'm gonna consider flying an airplane into one of their buildings because of my envy. Suckers. You have got to be the biggest idiots to believe what your government has told you. The whole thing - 9/11, the "war on terror", the invasion of Iraq - the whole thing is jewish, and it's been directed by the jews. But you don't know that, because you don't even know who is jewish at the top of your country. You are not allowed to talk about it, or point it out. WHA-HA-HA-HA!!!!! Suckers.</p>
<p>Another reason why the protestant religion of JP Morgan is not a comparable situation - the history of the jews. The jews allegedly got thrown out of the Middle East because they controlled all the capital and lived off interest while everybody else worked. The protestants never had that history. Banking, and being bankers, is an integral part of the jews' history. But you don't want it pointed out that the top bankers are jewish again.</p>

<p>I am shocked at what the troll at 80.41.24.77 just wrote. Please spare other users your <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. I think this diatribe should be deleted.</p>
<p><a name="Kuhn.2C_Loeb_links_to_other_German-Jewish_investment_banks" id="Kuhn.2C_Loeb_links_to_other_German-Jewish_investment_banks"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/User_talk%7EButtonwoodTree_e61b.html" title="Edit section: Kuhn, Loeb links to other German-Jewish investment banks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kuhn, Loeb links to other German-Jewish investment banks</span></h2>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to continue a discussion that indirectly came up in Kuhn, Loeb. You say in that article "In its early years, intermarriage among the German-Jewish elite was common. Consequently, the partners of Kuhn, Loeb were closely related by blood and marriage to the partners of J &amp; W Seligman, Speyer &amp; Co., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Lehman Brothers and other prominent German-Jewish firms." You cited Stephen Birmingham's "Our Crowd."</p>
<p>I have now had a chance to read "Our Crowd" and have to say, it certainly filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of investment banking history.</p>
<p>However, I continue to think that your statement about the links between Kuhn Loeb on the one hand, and Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs is misleading, or at least overstated. The former two banks cooperated closely in their early history, but for nearly all of the period covered by "Our Crowd", banks like Kuhn Loeb, J&amp;W Seligman and the Warburgs clearly occupied one strata - as near equals to Morgan who financed railroads, nation-states and heavy industry - and Lehman and Goldman - as commercial paper dealers, bond dealers and financiers of merchants and retail - occupied another, much lower strata. There are numerous statements to this effect in <i>Our Crowd</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that all these banks were German Jewish houses meant that some marriages must have inevitably occurred between persons somehow affiliated with either side of this divide during this period, and perhaps in the post-War period which the book does not really cover. And it is also the case that since the 1970s, Goldman in particular has risen to the pinnacle of investment banking, and Lehman bought the faded Kuhn Loeb. But these late developments do not support the general implication of your statement that all German Jewish investment banks were in league with one another, or had material interrelationships through marriage. This is in distinction to the Warburgs and Kuhn Loeb, who <i>were</i> to some degree in league with one another through intermarriage at the highest levels of the bank.</p>
<p>It is ironic. One of the implications I thought you should avoid (because in this case it is inaccurate) was a suggestion that all Jewish banks were somehow in league with one another. And then I come here to your talk site and, lo-and-behold, I see some nut job with exactly that sentiment. I created a separate user talk page for 80.41.24.77 in case anyone has comments. I did.</p>
<p>In any event, thanks for your numerous valuable contributions in the area of investment banking history. They are useful for a student of the field such as me.</p>

<p>Hi ButtonwoodTree. First, let me thank you for the your wikipedia contributions -- you're one of the few editors who is very active in improving financial services articles, an area that's pretty lacking on wikipedia. And your perseverance on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Weill_76aa.html" title="Sandy Weill">Sandy Weill</a> page is impressive, I certainly wouldn't be able to keep it up, and it's helping to keep the article NPOV.</p>
<p>I see that you reverted my addition of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Template%7EAmerican_Express_c64d.html" title="Template:American Express">American Express NavBox</a> on the bottom of the <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehman_Brothers_d21a.html" title="Lehman Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a> article. I have a feeling it may be a case of seeing it on your watchlist, clicking on the diff, seeing that an american express template has been added, and reverting it for being out of place, without getting a chance to look at the template itself.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the template, what I've done is add a section for companies that were once part of American Express: <a href="../../../a/m/e/Ameriprise_Financial_8d62.html" title="Ameriprise Financial">Ameriprise Financial</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Data_Corp._7ff2.html" title="First Data Corp.">First Data Corp.</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehman_Brothers_d21a.html" title="Lehman Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Railway_Express_Agency_0386.html" title="American Railway Express Agency">American Railway Express Agency</a>, and <a href="../../../r/i/v/RiverSource_747c.html" title="RiverSource">RiverSource</a>. The idea is that each company has a shared history with American Express, that for instance you can't talk about American Express without talking about Ameriprise, and you can't talk about Ameriprise without talking about American Express. While they are no longer the same company, they're interrelated, and I think it's clear from the way it's stated in the NavBox that they're no longer a part of american express. But if you think there's a way to make it clearer, please let me know.</p>
<p>With that in mind, would you reconsider your revert? For readers, I see no downside in having the box there, it can only aid them in exploring related topics. It's at the end of the article, after all of the text, so it doesn't get in the way of the article. Thanks!</p>
