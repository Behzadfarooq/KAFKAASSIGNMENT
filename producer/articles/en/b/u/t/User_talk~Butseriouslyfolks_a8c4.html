<p>thanks for pointing out that I'd left off my copyright info on a recent picture I posted rather than just quashing it. I probably shouldn't wiki while I have the flu, but at least it is not contagious here. Oh yes, your User page by-line reminded me of the Oscar Wilde quote, 'The Truth is seldom pure and never simple." <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 15:50, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're doing just fine, And as for all the rules, well remember the line from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean%7E_The_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl_0914.html" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl">The Pirates of the Carribean</a> - something like "Rules? Well they are more like guidelines." - that's how things are here. Most folks are much more concerned with your attitude and intentions than with the letter of the law. At least with the bunch I hang out with. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 17:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in getting people to vote about this picture which was just removed from the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice.html" title="Sacrifice">sacrifice</a> article, so am contacting everyone recent on my talk page.

<dd>I'd didn't invite you over there to stack to vote but to get your <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. I have no problem with folks not agreeing with me, and this is certainly not a clear cut situation. I'm also sharing this other picture of a rock painting that was overlooking where I found the dog. Again, probably not wikiworthy, but, I found it interesting. Too bad it's not talking. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 18:38, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, much like the sacrifice is folk-religion. I strongly suspect that it's the same folk involved in both.</dd>

I searched for "From 1992 to 1997, the research centre was known as the Northern" without quotes, with did not return anything, but when using quotes it delivers the page.

<dd>Hi, I noticed you removed the db-bio template on this article. Are you suggesting that the article asserts sufficient notability or just that a school is not a proper subject for the "bio" tag? Thanks! -- Butseriouslyfolks 02:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sort of a mix of both. Schools are always a touchy subject to delete on wikipedia. The best bet is to take them to AfD. I didn't see any particular claims to notability there, other than those inherent in being a school, and I don't think a db-bio tag is necessarily the best one for the school. Just prod/afd it and it will likely be gone anyway in a few days, I just don't think the CSD process is appropriate for it.

<p>I would like to point out the three-revert rule official policy <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. I do not want to get into an edit war with you. When editing my edits; please discuss all future edits of Lin-Wood High School on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lin-Wood_High_School" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lin-Wood_High_School" rel="nofollow">Lin-Wood High School talk page</a> proir to making changes.

<p>Hi, saw your comment on my talk page. I have no idea why you are bringing up the 3 revert rule. If you look at the article's history, you'll see that I have only made one edit to it since you started editing it. On the other hand, you have already reverted me two times.</p>
<p>It hardly seems fair to revert somebody and then insist that they essentially seek your permission before changing what you wrote. It is much more reasonable to practice what you preach and take it to a talk page <i>before</i> reverting them. You should not be contributing to WP unless you are willing to have your work edited by others.</p>
<p>You seem to want to limit the article to the high school grades of the school. However, the article deals with a public school housed in a single building that encompasses grades k through 12. The original contributor of the article obviously intended its scope to cover the whole school, as the first sentence was originally "Lin-Wood Public School is an accredited K-12 facility nestled in the White Mountains of New Hampshire." When you came to the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lin-Wood_High_School&amp;oldid=109607663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lin-Wood_High_School&amp;oldid=109607663" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, it covered the whole school (aside from the title). I think if you want to limit the article to the high school section of the school building, you should take that to the talk page.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am restoring the original scope of the article.</p>

<p>I am a history and political buff currently researching European Microstates. I will be adding to this article in the near future. First off, this article is important because Pedini-Angelini was the first female head of San Marino (as well as one of the first women head of state in the world!) Secondly, there are dozens of wikipedia articles about Captains Regents of San Marino with much less information than my article. Thirdly, I have created at least thirty wikipedia articles, so give me the benifit of the doubt. I don't why my article has been singled out.</p>

<p>Yikes! Thanks for telling me. I have started up Wherebot again.</p>
<p>Wherebot uses the RC feed, so it only detects new copyright violations (and it does not detect all partial copyvios). I am working on a supplemental bot to scan the WP database dump, but I keep on procrastinating work on it. I'll try to do some work on it this weekend.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you so very much for telling me about this! I probably wouldn't have noticed for weeks by myself. You are most kind. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 14:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You added a {{coi}} tag to the article. If you are referring to User:Frommeyer, as I am assuming from other tags you placed, you should be aware that I had already removed the contributions from that editor in their entirety before the tag was added.</p>
<p>Also, I question the removal of sourced content in your other edit there. Gorman's notability stems from her work in representing Guantanamo detainees (one in particular) and her public advocacy based on that representation. I believe the references removed in your deletion are valid sources <i>about her</i> and should be reinstated. The same goes for most of the text you removed.

<p>Hi Butseriouslyfolks,</p>
<p>I saw on the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_copyright_violations_65c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected copyright violations">Wikipedia:Suspected copyright violations</a> history page that you work a lot with that page, so I'm hoping you know something about copyright or perhaps can point me to someone or some authority on Wikipedia who does. There's a deletion debate right now about 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s, a list put together by Rolling Stone that someone copied onto Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely certain (but absolutely NOT an expert) that copying a list violates no copyright, but I'll admit it's a bit fuzzy and arguments can be made on both sides. Apparently some other lists have also been deleted by editors worried about copyright violations. It seems to me that unless a case is clear, this is the type of thing that should be referred to lawyers or lawyer volunteers within Wikipedia. Editors without enough clear, strong guidance should be opting for using material and, after referring it to someone who actually knows about copyright law, should wash their hands of it. I'd appreciate any advice you may have about the whole thing and especially on where to go for advice. Thanks.

<dd>Oh, I don't care which way you vote (I'm gonna lose this one anyway). I'm just hoping we can get further away from guesswork as to what the actual copyright status is.

<p>Why do feel it necessary to come along and add cleanup tags to a page that was started just 7 minutes prior to your edit and is clearly in progress?

As an experienced user, I agree with <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> that you should wait more than a few minutes before you putting a new article up for deletion. You should have contacted me or added a tag (expand, notability, etc.) to the page before doing this.

<p>I've tried to rewrite the entry, but I'd thought I'd point out that copying one or two lines isn't a copyright violation. If it was it would be impossible to write an encyclopedic entry on most things, because it would violate the copyright of the encyclopedically written definitions in other encyclopedias. As a rule of thumb, you should look out out for entries that copy more than about 3 lines and entries that <i>could</i> be reworded without affecting its quality. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:06, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Butseriouslyfolks,</p>
<p>I don't think I explained myself well enough in my first comments about changing my vote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_East_Middle_School_299b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/East Middle School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/East Middle School</a>, and I've added what I think is a clearer explanation. You make a good point about an editor's behavior not affecting a vote, but I think the behavior is on the border of disruptive. I'd be interested in what you think, either in the discussion or on my talk page or yours. Thanks for your contributions to the discussions so far. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Geo Swan, two and a half years on the wikipedi. Something like 15,000 edits under my belt. My first year most of my contributions were in non-controbersial areas, like nautical history. Most of my contributions over the last year and a half have been in articles that are related, in some way, to the "<a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_war_on_terror.html" title="Global war on terror">global war on terror</a>".</p>
<p>I do my best to make my contribution in full compliance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wp%7Enpov.html" title="Wp:npov">wp:npov</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/Wp%7Eor.html" title="Wp:or">wp:or</a>. I don't expect to succeed 100% of the time, so I try to make an effort to give every challenge to my contributions a serious, civil effort to engage in a dialog. I think I must be doing an OK job, because, for 10,000 edits I get very few challenges. And sometimes I get people who share the POV I hold priavtely question whether I am a POV-pusher from the other side.</p>
<p>Which brings us to...</p>

<p>You made a big excision from the <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Candace_Gorman_83b6.html" title="H. Candace Gorman">H. Candace Gorman</a> article, primarily excising a huge block of material. I contributed the material you excised. I contributed it, in good faith. It represented a significant effort.</p>
<p>I am giving you a heads-up that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AH._Candace_Gorman&amp;diff=119774149&amp;oldid=112795278I" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AH._Candace_Gorman&amp;diff=119774149&amp;oldid=112795278I" rel="nofollow">have concerns</a> that your excision did not improve the overall value of the wikipedia, rather, the reverse.</p>
<p>I am hoping you will return to <a href="../../../h/2E/_/Talk%7EH._Candace_Gorman_42fa.html" title="Talk:H. Candace Gorman">Talk:H. Candace Gorman</a>, and we can try to reach a meeting of minds.</p>
