<p>Still seems to be arguing against a straw-man (sword=war).

<p>Stevertigo, I'm not sure why you replaced the paragraphs I removed. They are at best original research that interpret the passage in a way I have never before seen.

<p>On the VfD page I was asked about objections to verse-specific pages. As a rule, I support inclusion of almost any well-written WP article, particularly those that I can learn from. My rule of thumb whether the topic is the Bible, Star Trek, Sexology or Taxonomy is this question: "Whould an exhaustive encyclopedia on this topic have an entry on this matter?" I do believe that this article qualifies as a "yes."</p>
<p>But, I do think special attention needs to be taken in naming the article for 1. Clarity for the honest ignorance of the potential reader; and 2. NPOV. This doesn't exclude verses being redirects to an article. Maybe even Interpretations of Matthew 10:34 would be better than a direct quote. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 06:15, Mar 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not convinced that an article interpreting a paraphrase of a saying attributed to Jesus in the Book of Matthew, all without a single attributed viewpoint, is a wise addition to Wikipedia.

<li>I agree that the article in its present version is something other than encyclopedic, but let's try to rehabilitate it before we seriously consider deletion. I can fix it up a little, but I haven't the resources to do the real work. This much I know: There <i>is</i> an ongoing debate about the passage, and there are undoubtedly sources that could be cited on the various viewpoints described. Someone just has to find them.</li>

If kept, move to the most familiar and quoted version, the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">KJV</a> rendition of the Bible title: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

<li>I don't believe Wikipedia should contain an exposition of every Bible verse, or even every major bible verse. The current article is biased towards a non-standard interpretation. Most of this stuff is probably better discussed in <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">Pacifism</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_pacifism.html" title="Christian pacifism">Christian pacifism</a>.

<li>Being the central author of the article, I do have an opinion - I agree with some of the criticisms - yes, it is rather poorly titled (as often are the quotations, tranlsations, and transliterations - this was Aramaic to begin with, kids). I do think it has a place here, and would characterise some of the above people as holding the view that Wikipedia be purged by some secular divine right, of all religiously-contextualized works. Take a look at our articles on other religions? There is nothing wrong or NPOV for using <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblespeak.html" title="Biblespeak">biblespeak</a> in an article about a well-documented term in human culture, as long as its reasonably describes the general context. I might also add that someone with a name like Nuh-uhh, might be <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudiced.html" title="Prejudiced">prejudiced</a> toward disagreement rather than consensus. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><big>SV</big></a><small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">(talk)</a> 23:28, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</small>

<li>It might be a good solution for now, David, but would that mean that this represents an opjection to passage-specific articles? I understand that we dont want each passage of the bible to be entered into wiki - but maybe it would be a good idea. I dont remember any consensus on that - was one of the original discussions. I wouldnt think it problematic to include only those passages that were interesting - meaning no -database dumps, just hand-input articles for (assumingly) the passages that present the most interest. We have had articles on specific idioms, statements, speeches, etc. Maybe this discussion points to new <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:Policy</a> --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><big>SV</big></a><small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">(talk)</a> 17:18, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>Comment on Davodd's proposal above -- I don't recommend merging into a broader topic.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep. This is a well-done article, except TITLE. It's important as an explanation of the verse. (See the misconception mentioned on the page). The Bible was one of the first printed books. Why should it be limited here? Plenty of less worthy articles out there folks! <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZoney_0cf9.html" title="User:Zoney">Zoney</a> 14:14, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete - I'm curious: Why does an encyclopedia need an entry for a sepcific controversial bible verse? There are probably thousands of controversial bible verses! Should there be an entry for every one? And what about other holy books like the Q'uran or Book of Mormon? This article specifically seems quite unbalanced as it is written. It seems more like an advocacy of a specific non-violent interpretation of the bible verse than a write-up of some critical historical phenomenon as should be documented in an encyclopedia.</li>

<p>basically, the overwhelming majority of jesus quotes on the gospels are anti-war and anti-violence. it's therefore ridiculous trying to prove the opposite simply by one sentence - most probably taken out of context - since that would mean that either jesus doesn't know what he's talking about or that someone copied the gospels wrong.</p>

<p>I think this should be retitled <i>Not Peace, but a Sword</i>, Matthew 10:34-39, Luke 12:51-53,14:26-27.

<p>Shouldn't there be some info on this page about the various different translations of this passage? I'd love to see some analysis of the actual Greek (or Aramaic, or Latin), and I can't help but wonder whether or not this whole thing is just a misread intention that was lost in translation.</p>
