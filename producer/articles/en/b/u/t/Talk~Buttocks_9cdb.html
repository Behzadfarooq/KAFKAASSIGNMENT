<p>While the first picture that appears on this page is of the buttocks, I believe that it is an unnecssary illustration because it is obviously not in place to inform the reader of what the buttocks is.</p>
<p>The story of Sodom has nothing to do with the buttocks so I removed the lines related to it. I also removed the lines about Rome and Greece as they admired what they considered perfect human form both male and female and they did not admire the sexual acts related to the buttocks in any special fashion. - 24.7.186.18 19:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I removed the text "However, the wide-spread use troughout time and cultural space, even when the victim is not bared as fetishists generally prefer, tends to point rather to the pragmatical considerations, while some sexual arousal in the inflictor is probably secundary." added on July 5 to the reasons for choosing the buttocks as a target because it should not be there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Saying that spanking is done out of a sexual fetish is a reason often made by those against spanking for why the rear is chosen as a point of punishment. While I agree with the user who added in the text that it was an unlikely reason, it should not be added to the list of reasons simply because the user did not agree with it. I also agree with user Cadr's decision to remove the second picture and think the first should probably be changed to one less artistic and more anatomical. 69.3.92.105 8 July 2005 16:59 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Brazilians' bounty of booty should be noted as should the common (and healthy) marken for ass centric pornography. EG: booty talk</p>
<hr />
<p>This text discusses corporal punishment in length, evenwhile there is an article for that, in itself. I think the corporal punishment stuff should be moved where it belongs. I would also move it, if it wasn't as extensive a part of the article.</p>
<p>Buttock/ass/whathaveyou has a lot of implications, and there's content to be created of it. However, spanking does not contribute significantly to it. It should be dealt separately, so that I (we) could get around to dealing with the real subject.</p>
<p>Which is nice and fun.&#160;;)</p>
<p>This article is needlessly critical of spanking.</p>

Shouldn't there be a link here to the Gluteus Maximus article? Also, I'm fairly sure the muscle's main purpose is to pull the femur back, as when a person stands up or climbs up, something that is never mentioned here. Not complaining about the social and psychological discussion, though. &lt;:)</p>

Just arrived here, out of sheer prurience, via the <i>Articles_which_lack_sources</i> category. The choice of images seems more than a little sexist.

<p>"Early in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, Uncle Henry is holding the gate open for Miss Gulch, and at a seemingly appropriate time he lets it go, and it swats the disagreeable old lady in the fanny... emphasized by a musical "thunk" on the soundtrack's underscore."</p>
<p>Although this may be written in US English, I still think that the word "fanny" should probably be changed to somethine like "butt", or even "behind". From the page "Fanny":</p>
<p>" Fanny is also a slang American English word for buttocks and an impolite British English sexual slang word for the female genitalia (perhaps a corruption of the word vagina)."</p>

<dd>The first picture isn't even a very good one (no offense to the source). If you're going to have a picture of a butt, it should be just a butt, not a g-string or tatoos etc. If this is inappropriate, go with a drawing or classical depiction. Steve.</dd>

<dd>Well, as we all know, there are now two pictures of butts in the beginning of the article, one of a man, and one of a woman. However, the picture of the male's butt is colored, but the female butt is black and white. I think, if it can be done, the second picture should be replaced by the same picture, only in color. I'd say that would make it fair, just my two cents.</dd>

The male butt in the beginning of the article is (according to the article itself) uncharacteristically hairless. Perhaps it should be replaced with something more representative of the average hairy male butt? -Anon. March 8 2007</p>

<dd>Yeah, to me all the butts look the same now. Why are many used in the first place? To be politically correct or because there really is anatomical differences besides the color?

<p>Speaking of the buttocks being "hot", shouldn't there be something about how important the butt is as a secondary sexual characteric? Maybe a link or something. The article does discuss some of the sexual nature of the bum, but it seems like it keeps getting more and more censored. That is, except for that hot picture- NEW JACK 26 Feb 2006</p>
<p>While the buttocks is a sexual attractant for many, it isn't a secondary sexual characteristic.

<dd>The differences are minor and not often apparant when all you're seeing is the butt itself. There was a (since) deleted photo on this article that showed 4 butts, 2 male, 2 female in B&amp;W. They were totally non-descript as to which sex was which. I'm not saying that butts aren't sexy - I believe they are. What I'm saying is they're not a secondary sexual characteristic.

<dd>Actually, the buttocks is indeed a secondary sex characteristic. The buttocks of females becomes thicker and fattier following puberty. Also, there is much research to suggest that the padding of the female buttocks developed as a stimulant for males. 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELepeu1999_5202.html" title="User:Lepeu1999">Lepeu1999</a> is only partially correct; the buttocks are not secondary sexual characteristics per se (both males and females have them, after all). According to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_sex_characteristic.html" title="Secondary sex characteristic">Secondary sex characteristic</a> article, secondary sex characteristics are traits (not having a direct reproductive function) that distinguish the two sexes. In human females, secondary sex characteristics include widened hips and increased fat deposits in the buttocks, thighs and hips. So the differential development (which are "appreciable changes", in females) of these areas during puberty creates secondary sexual characteristics. In other words: butts are indeed sexy, in case anyone wasn't clear on that point. Oh, and by the way "buttocks" is the plural of "buttock". MarkBrooks 05:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, it's not a good picture. The lighting is not good and it just looks like a polaroid someone took and posted for a thrill. There is already another buttocks picture above it. Finally, yes it's male. The fact is that more people find female buttocks appealing and unoffensive than male buttocks. Also it is fully nude whereas the above isn't. This nudity serves no purpose in this case. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowdybob_0489.html" title="User:Howdybob">Howdybob</a> 18:55, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as quality goes, if you have a better picture of nude male buttocks, feel free to use it instead. The picture was taken specifically for use at the German Wikipedia article linked to this one (<a href="../../../../de/g/e/s/Ges%C3%A4%C3%9F.html" class="extiw" title="de:Gesäß">de:Gesäß</a>), not "for a thrill".

<li>all the above arguments pro are true (the lack of Donatello appreciation left aside; still Michelangelo's David is probably impossible to beat) and relevant; the only way to do perhaps functionally better would be to zoom in more closely (even more true for the female one), though the esthetical loss might be greater; historically male nude is actually more accepted; remembering a media controversy concerning (female) modell stereotypes, one might consider deliberately adding less well-formed, boy/girl(ish) buttocks <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 09:40, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've added the image of naked male buttocks again. While it may be something most of us don't want to look at, it's no more offensive or less appropriate than the image of naked female buttocks. It seems to run against the NPOV policy to call the male pic offensive and to remove it while leaving the female pic in its place. For the sake of NPOV, i believe both images should stay. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotman1974_0598.html" title="User:Robotman1974">Robotman1974</a> 04:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Even if the image of male buttocks was somehow offensive, that would not be a justifiable reason to remove it from the article. I must admit, I don't understand what you mean by "Avoid political correctness", that statement seems to contradict your whole point. Could you clarify that please? I would also like to ask you why you haven't removed the image of female buttocks as well. Both images depict the same amount and style of nudity, yet you find only one of them to be offensive.

<p>I am yet to see any explanation as to the removal of the photograph of male buttocks. There have been multiple reverts over the past couple of days, with some people putting it back and others removing it.</p>
<p>I have no strong feeling in either direction about the quality of the photograph, and cannot see any more wrong with this photo than the female one opposite it. The latter is perhaps more controversial, as it has been suggested above that the photo was edited to remove the genitals, resulting in a physically impossible gap between the legs. The angle of the male photo suggests that such editing would not have occurred. I do believe that the male photo is of encyclopedic quality, but I am going to refrain from reverting or adding it back in until the person(s) removing it have had an opportunity to explain their objections.</p>
<p>If no response is forthcoming on this talk page in reasonable time, I will re-insert the image. Any subsequent attempt to remove it from the article without <b>prior</b> discussion on this talk page will be deemed vandalism. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliceJMarkham_2b7c.html" title="User:AliceJMarkham">AliceJMarkham</a> 05:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In African culture big bottoms r a sign of beauty, but in Euro culture bottoms the smaller the better until recently, this needs to be added a cultural section. also the sexual relationshop with bottoms from a pycho perspective--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 01:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>THat image is a good example of butts in media and butts being used in an artistic, touching way. It would be great as a standard image, but her skin colour doesn't seem standard at all. It looks like she is dead <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayKeaton_01af.html" title="User:JayKeaton">JayKeaton</a> 10:12, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>As discussed earlier in this talk page, this image has been in and out of this article numerous times in the past and was removed from the article after discussion about the fact that it has been edited to remove the female genitals, which would otherwise be visible part way down the diamond shaped gap at the top of the legs. It may be very artistic but it is not representative of real anatomy and hence does not belong in an article on a human anatomical feature. An unedited version of the same photo may be acceptable.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliceJMarkham_2b7c.html" title="User:AliceJMarkham">AliceJMarkham</a> 13:44, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, but we don't need to see female genitals, which are kind of unsightly anyway, in this article, so, even if edited out, not much a loss . . . --164.107.223.217 04:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
