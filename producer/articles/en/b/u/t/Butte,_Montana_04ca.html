<p>Butte began as a mining town in the late 19th century. At first only <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a> were mined in the area, but the advent of electricity caused a soaring demand for <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a>, which was abundant in the area. The small town soon became one of the most prosperous cities in the country, especially during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and was often called "the Richest Hill on Earth". With an estimated population of about 85,000 at its peak c. 1910-1917, it was the largest city for many hundreds of miles in all directions. It is estimated that a third of all copper produced in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> in the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th centuries</a> came from Butte. The city attracted workers from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and all areas of the USA. The legacy of the immigrants lives on in the form of the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasty.html" title="Pasty">Cornish pasty</a> which was popularized by mine workers who needed something easy to eat in the mines.</p>
<p>The influx of miners gave Butte the reputation as a wide-open town where any vice was obtainable. The city's famous saloon and red-light district, called the "Line", was centered on Mercury Street, where the elegant <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordello.html" title="Bordello">bordellos</a> included the famous <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumas_Brothel_8b51.html" title="Dumas Brothel">Dumas Brothel</a>, regarded as the longest-running house of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> in the U.S. In the brick alley behind the brothel was the equally famous <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_Alley_b3e4.html" title="Venus Alley">Venus Alley</a>, where women plied their trade in small cubicles called "cribs". The red-light district brought miners and other men from all over the region and was openly tolerated by city officials until the 1980s as one of the last such urban districts in the U.S. The Dumas Brothel is now operated as a museum to Butte's rougher days. Close by Wyoming Street is home to the public high school.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, Butte was nicknamed "The Richest Hill on Earth." Copper was in great demand because of new technologies such as electric power that required the use of copper. Three men fought for control of Butte's mining wealth. These three "<a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper_Kings_a1f5.html" title="Copper Kings">Copper Kings</a>" were <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Andrews_Clark_8968.html" title="William Andrews Clark">William A. Clark</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Daly_6a8e.html" title="Marcus Daly">Marcus Daly</a>, and <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Augustus_Heinze_edac.html" title="F. Augustus Heinze">F. Augustus Heinze</a>. Following their eventual deaths, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda_Copper_Mining_Company_b0f4.html" title="Anaconda Copper Mining Company">Anaconda Copper Mining Company</a> took over their holdings.</p>
<p>In 1899, Daly joined with <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rockefeller_2709.html" title="William Rockefeller">William Rockefeller</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Rogers_f354.html" title="Henry H. Rogers">Henry H. Rogers</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_W._Lawson_%28businessman%29_cfab.html" title="Thomas W. Lawson (businessman)">Thomas W. Lawson</a> to organize the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company. Not long after, the company changed its name to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda_Copper_Mining_Company_b0f4.html" title="Anaconda Copper Mining Company">Anaconda Copper Mining Company</a> (ACM). The company engaged in questionable business practices, and at one point even resorted to gunning down strikers in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda_Road_Massacre_f166.html" title="Anaconda Road Massacre">Anaconda Road Massacre</a>. In the 1920s, it was the fourth largest company in the world, and had a virtual monopoly over the mines in and around Butte. The prosperity continued up to the 1950s, when the declining grade of ore and competition from other mines led the Anaconda company to switch its focus from the costly and dangerous practice of underground mining to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_pit_mining.html" title="Open pit mining">open pit mining</a>. This marked the beginning of the end for the boom times in Butte.</p>
<p>In 1917, copper production from the Butte mines peaked and has steadily declined since. By WW II, copper production from the ACM's holdings in Chuquicamata, Chile, far exceeded Butte's production. The historian Janet Finn has examined this "tale of two cities"--Butte and Chuquicamata as two ACM mining towns.</p>
<p>Thousands of homes were destroyed in the Meaderville suburb and surrounding areas to excavate the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley_Pit_a610.html" title="Berkeley Pit">Berkeley Pit</a>, which opened in 1955. At the time, it was the largest truck-operated open pit copper mine in the United States. Other open pit mines were dug in the area, including the still-operational East Continental Pit. The Berkeley pit grew with time, and in November 1973 the Columbia Gardens, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Andrews_Clark_8968.html" title="William Andrews Clark">William A. Clark's</a> gift to the people of Butte, was torn down to expand the Berkeley Pit. In 1977 the <a href="../../../a/r/c/ARCO_b9ea.html" title="ARCO">ARCO</a> company purchased Anaconda Mining, and only three years later started shutting down mines due to lower metal prices. In 1982, all mining in the Berkeley Pit was suspended. The water pumps in nearby mines were also shut down, which resulted in highly acidic water laced with toxic heavy metals filling up the pit. Only two years later the pit was classified as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superfund.html" title="Superfund">Superfund</a> site and an environmental hazard site. Meanwhile, the acidic water continued to rise. It was not until the 1990s that serious efforts to clean up the Berkeley Pit began. The situation gained even more attention after as many as 342 migrating geese picked the pit lake as a resting place, resulting in their deaths. Steps have since been taken to prevent a recurrence, including but not limited to loudspeakers broadcasting sounds to scare off waterfowl. However, in November 2003 the Horseshoe Bend treatment facility went online and began treating and diverting much of the water that would have flowed into the pit. Ironically, the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley_Pit_a610.html" title="Berkeley Pit">Berkeley Pit</a> is also one of the city's biggest tourist attractions. It is the largest pit lake in the United States, and is the most costly part of the country's largest <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superfund.html" title="Superfund">Superfund</a> site.</p>
<p>Today, Butte's population is about a third of its peak in 1917. Over a dozen of the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallows_Frame_6996.html" title="Gallows Frame">headframes</a> still stand over the mine shafts, and the city still contains thousands of old commercial and residential buildings from the boom times. Mining remains a major employer for the city, but at greatly reduced levels from the past, with just one mine, Montana Resources' Continental Pit, in operation and employing about 350 people. As with many industrial cities, tourism and services, especially health care, are rising as primary employers. Many areas of the city, especially the areas near the old mines, show signs of wear from time but a recent influx of investors and an aggressive campaign to remedy blight has led to a renewed interest in restoring property in Uptown Butte's historic district, which was expanded in 2006 to include parts of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda%2C_Montana_9999.html" title="Anaconda, Montana">Anaconda</a> and is now the largest <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Historic_Landmark_District_467a.html" title="National Historic Landmark District">National Historic Landmark District</a> in the United States with nearly 6,000 contributing properties.</p>
<p>A century after the era of intensive mining and smelting, the area around the city remains an environmental issue. Heavy metals such as <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenic.html" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> are found in high concentrations in some spots affected by old mining, and for a period of time in the 1990s the tap water was unsafe to drink due to poor filtration and decades-old wooden supply pipes. This problem has been remedied to some degree over the past few years, with millions of dollars being invested to upgrade water lines and repair infrastructure. Environmental research and cleanup efforts have contributed to the diversification of the local economy, and signs of vitality remain, including a multi-million dollar polysilicon manufacturing plant locating nearby in the 1990s and the city's recognition and designation in the late 1990s as an <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-American_City_627d.html" title="All-American City">All-American City</a> and also as one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2002. In 2004, Butte received another economic boost as well as international recognition as the location for the Hollywood film <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Come_Knocking_2f95.html" title="Don't Come Knocking">Don't Come Knocking</a></i>, directed by renowned director Wim Wenders and released throughout the world in 2006.</p>
<p>The annual celebration of Butte's Irish heritage (since 1882) is the annual <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Day_ca65.html" title="St. Patrick's Day">St. Patrick's Day</a> festivities. In these modern times about 30,000 revelers converge on Butte's Historic Uptown District to enjoy the parade led by the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians_4ced.html" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> and celebrate in bars such as Maloney's, the Silver Dollar Saloon, the M&amp;M Cigar Store, and The Irish Times Pub.</p>

<p>Sparked by a tragic accident more than 2000 feet below the ground, a fire in the Granite Mountain <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaft_mining.html" title="Shaft mining">shaft</a> spewed flames, smoke, and poisonous gas through the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labyrinth.html" title="Labyrinth">labyrinth</a> of underground tunnels. A rescue effort commenced but the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_monoxide.html" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> was stealing the air supply. A few men built man-made bulk heads to save their lives but many others died in a panic to try to get out. As helmet men, rescue workers came in to set up a fan to prevent the fire from spreading. This worked for a second or two but when they tried to use water, the water evaporated creating <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam.html" title="Steam">steam</a> and burning the people trying to escape. Once the fire was out, those waiting to hear the news on the surface couldn't identify the victims. They were too mutilated to recognize, leading many to assume the worst. 161 bodies were removed from the mine. Due to the heroic efforts of men such as Ernest Sullau, Manus Duggan, and JD Moore some survived to tell the tale.</p>

<li>Manus Duggan, born on May 30, 1887. Worked for the North Butte Mining Company as a "nipper". A nipper was one who sharpened tools for miners that drilled into the rock. Being a "nipper", he was familiar with every crosscut, manway, and drift of the mine. During the mining disaster of 1917, Manus saved the lives of many men by building a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulkhead_%28barrier%29.html" title="Bulkhead (barrier)">bulkhead</a> to prevent <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_Monoxide_4e24.html" title="Carbon Monoxide">Carbon Monoxide</a> from killing them.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butte%2C_Montana_04ca.html" title="Edit section: Butte and Superfund">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Butte and Superfund</span></h2>
<p>Butte sits at the headwaters of America's largest Superfund site, extending along a 120 mile long corridor. Over the past century, mining and smelting operations of the Anaconda Copper Mining Corporation polluted the Clark Fork River watershed at the headwaters of the Columbia River. This area takes in the cities of Butte, Anaconda, and Missoula. Between the upstream city of Butte and the downstream city of Missoula lies the rural and agricultural Deer Lodge Valley. By the 1970s, local citizens and agency personnel were increasingly concerned over the toxic effects of arsenic and heavy metals on environment and human health. Most of the waste was created by the Anaconda Copper Mining Corporation (ACM), which merged with the Atlantic Richfield Corporation (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arco.html" title="Arco">Arco</a>) in 1977. Shortly thereafter, in 1983, Arco ceased mining and smelting operations in the Butte-Anaconda area.</p>
<p>For more than a century, the Anaconda Copper Mining company mined ore from Butte and smelted it in nearby Anaconda. During this time, the Anaconda smelter released up to 40 tons per day of arsenic, 1,700 tons per day of sulfur, and great quantities of lead and other heavy metals into the air (MacMillan). In Butte, mine tailings were dumped directly into Silver Bow Creek, creating a 150-mile plume of pollution extending down the valley to Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork River just upstream of Missoula. Air and water borne pollution poisoned livestock and agricultural soils throughout the Deer Lodge Valley. Though the farmers sought damages in a series of lawsuits between 1905 and 1924, the company prevailed in every case, arguing, “We have a perfect right to carry on legitimate business, and if incidentally we should pollute the atmosphere nobody has the right to complain…” (MacMillan, p. 106).</p>
<p>Following expensive hazardous waste site clean-ups such as Love Canal in the 1970s, Americans formulated and instituted a “polluter pays” principle for environmental pollution. This movement culminated in passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (i.e. Superfund). Soon thereafter the EPA began keeping a National Priorities List of sites. The Superfund process came to the Upper Clark Fork River Basin in 1983 with listings for three sites: Anaconda Smelter-Community Soils (300 square miles); Stream Side Tailings (26-mile long Silver Bow Creek near Butte); and Milltown Dam (2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments).</p>
<p>As agency scientists and local citizens came to appreciate the extent of and the health threats posed by mine waste, the Superfund site list expanded to include more “operable units.” Individual citizens and organized grassroots groups played a key role in expanding the Superfund site list. The open pit copper mine in uptown Butte – known as the Berkeley Pit (more than 30 billion gallons of highly toxic low-pH water) – was added to Butte’s Stream Side Tailings Site in 1984. The entire Clark Fork River (more than 120 stream miles) above Milltown Dam was added to the Milltown Site in 1985. The uptown area of Butte (12.4 million cubic yards of waste spread throughout urban neighborhoods) was added to the Stream Side Tailings Site in 1987.</p>
<p>Currently, the price tag for Superfund in the Upper Clark Fork River Basin is approaching $1 billion, and as remedies are implemented in the near future the cost will exceed $1 billion by a wide margin. Furthermore, the need for perpetual water treatment at some sites, institutional controls at other sites, and money won by the state of Montana for natural resource damages adds considerably to the bottom line (Steele). Any one of the Operable Units within each of the three Superfund sites in the region would qualify as a “megasite”—a term the EPA uses for remedy when costs exceed $50 million (Southland).</p>
<p>The geographical extent and complexity of the Upper Clark Fork River Basin complex of Superfund sites make it an ideal Superfund case study. Toxic waste has been spread by air and water to upland soils, riparian areas, streams and rivers, and ground water. Human health threats range from arsenic in drinking water to heavy metals in residential attic dust and yards. Environmental threats range from acid mine waste and metals-polluted stream side tailings to phytotoxic upland soils. In some cases residents have been forced to abandon homes in particularly toxic areas, and in other cases dense urban populations continue to live amidst toxic mine dumps (Society for Applied Anthropology). Down river, a rural population of farmers and ranchers are burdened with low soil productivity on their property and highly contaminated sediments (“slickens”) along the river that runs through it.</p>
<p>Studies by the EPA and the responsible party (Arco) resulted in a number of emergency remedial actions well before the agency reached any Record of Decision (ROD) for the various operable units within the Superfund area. For example, on the Butte hill 300,000 cubic yards of lead-contaminated soil from mine waste dumps was excavated and stabilized, and 23 residential yards were cleaned up in 1988. About the same time, the city of Butte – in cooperation with EPA and Arco – established a lead abatement program to monitor lead levels in children, identify sources of lead in soils and paint, and remove or cap lead sources (US EPA 2004). As people became more aware of the human and environmental health threats, citizen groups in Butte, Anaconda, and Missoula applied and received Superfund Technical Assistance grants to establish community outreach and education programs (Society for Applied Anthropology).</p>
<p>After more than a decade and about $700 million spent on data collection, remedial investigations, and emergency actions, the Superfund process is now (2007) drawing to a close. Of the many Superfund sites that are part of this megasite, closure (i.e. a ROD) has been achieved for all but one site. The EPA finalized its ROD for the Berkeley Pit and Anaconda in 1984, Silver Bow Creek in 1995, Milltown Dam and the Clark Fork River in 2004, and Butte in 2006. With a ROD the process of social negotiation and public participation ends, and the agency institutes a remedy (i.e. cleanup).</p>
<p>Though the ROD ends the actor-network give-and-take between the public, the agency, and the responsible party, it does not necessarily mean that once remedy is implemented the pollution goes away. In fact, at complex Superfund sites, remediation may involve decades of sequential actions. Institutional controls, maintenance activities, and water treatment may be required in perpetuity. The long-term and uncertain nature of such remedies gives special weight to the ROD as one-way gate, and is a major incentive for citizens, Technical Assistance Grant funded groups, and grassroots organizations to go all out in influencing the agency to produce a decision that incorporates their vision of the best possible remedy.</p>
<p>As conceived in the original Superfund legislation, the ROD was to specify and implement remedy as an end-point. Superfund was generally thought to be a linear process of identifying hazardous materials and then removing or isolating those materials from contact with people or the environment. As the sciences of toxicology, epidemiology, and risk analysis developed, it became clear that thresholds for cleanup and models for exposure pathways could not always be defined a priori (Covello and Mumpower; Cranor; Dourson and Siara) Furthermore, the “unruly complexity” of ecological interactions also complicated remedy selection (Taylor). In the 1990s, as a response to these challenges, adaptive management received broad application in forestry and fisheries restoration (Murray and Marmorek; National Academy of Sciences, 2004).</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency for the EPA to craft RODs using an adaptive management approach rather than as a clearly defined remedy (National Academy of Sciences, 2005). This shift in policy has not been accompanied by a shift that extends the process of public involvement, and might therefore create a significant policy problem in the near future. If remedy is a moving target and yet public participation largely ends following the ROD, it is conceivable that network actors will demand legislation that makes it easier to reopen the agency’s decision. One recent report – based on a survey and subsequent roundtable of federal agency personnel and private sector professionals engaged in the long-term cleanup and management of contaminated sites – recommends that agencies such as the EPA “consider models for improved public participation in long-term management at contaminated sites” because “opportunities for public involvement decline at sites once remedies are selected, and public stakeholders often move on to other issues” (Center for Public Environmental Oversight, p. 8).</p>
<p>Along with increasing scientific complexity and uncertainty in the Superfund remedy process, there has also been an increasing demand for public participation. This demand stemmed both from social movements that begin with the environmentalism of the 1970s (Ashford and Rest; Brulle; Dunlap and Mertig; Gibbs) and from academics promoting public participation through risk communication (Cranor; Hiskes; Krimsky and Plough; Mayo and Hollander). When the public engages in the social construction of a remedy, it increases the difficulty faced by site managers and the agency in designing remedy. Despite the increased complexity, however, there are some indications that public involvement produces remedies that are “better” in both a technical and political sense (Adams; Cole; Laurian; Novotny).</p>
