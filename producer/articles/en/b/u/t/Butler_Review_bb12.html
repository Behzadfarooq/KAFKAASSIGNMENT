The inquiry had access to all intelligence reports and other government papers, and it could call witnesses to give oral evidence. It worked closely with the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Intelligence_Commission_ea44.html" title="Iraq Intelligence Commission">US inquiry</a> and the Iraq Survey Group.

Although <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> had always insisted it was not necessary to set up an inquiry, he was forced to do so because of pressure from comments made by former leader of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Survey_Group_776b.html" title="Iraq Survey Group">Iraq Survey Group</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kay_cf95.html" title="David Kay">David Kay</a>, as well as the political fall-out of the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_inquiry.html" title="Hutton inquiry">Hutton inquiry</a> which was regarded as a <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitewash.html" title="Whitewash">whitewash</a> by many.</p>
<p>The Butler Inquiry's remit did not extend to an examination of the political decision making process. Ministers believed that any question of wrongdoing on their part had been dealt with by the Hutton Inquiry which reported on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">January 28</a> 2004 - Tony Blair said: "The issue of good faith was determined by the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_Inquiry_35cc.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a>". However, the Hutton Inquiry's terms of reference were limited to the circumstances leading to the death of Dr David Kelly. In the course of his investigations Lord Hutton cleared the Government of deliberately inserting false intelligence into their published <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_Dossier_ee88.html" title="September Dossier">dossier</a> on Iraqi WMD. The Hutton Report left the wider questions about the Government's propriety in its handling of intelligence unanswered. For instance, questions remain regarding the possibility that the Government and Intelligence Services <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_picking.html" title="Cherry picking">"cherry-picked"</a> intelligence that tended to support the case for war, and/or that the public presentation of this intelligence was misleading. (See <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_Report_d849.html" title="Hutton Report">Hutton Report</a>.)</p>

<p>The Liberal Democrats opted not to take part, because the role of politicians had been excluded from the Inquiry's remit. (Senior Lib Dem MP <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Beith_d3ef.html" title="Alan Beith">Alan Beith</a> was to have been the sixth member of the panel).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler_Review_bb12.html" title="Edit section: Conclusions of the Review">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusions of the Review</span></h2>
<p>The review was published on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a> 2004. Its main conclusion was that key intelligence used to justify the war with Iraq has been shown to be unreliable. It claims that the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Intelligence_Service_e82b.html" title="Secret Intelligence Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> did not check its sources well enough and sometimes relied on third hand reports. It criticises the use of the 45 minute claim in the 2002 dossier as "unsubstantiated", and says that there was an over-reliance on Iraqi dissident sources. It also comments that warnings from the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Intelligence_Committee_%28UK%29_ecf3.html" title="Joint Intelligence Committee (UK)">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> on the limitations of the intelligence were not made clear. Overall it said that "more weight was placed on the intelligence than it could bear", and that judgements had stretched available intelligence "to the outer limits".</p>
<p>It says that information from another country's intelligence service on Iraqi production of chemical and biological weapons was "seriously flawed", without naming the country. It says that there was no recent intelligence to demonstrate that Iraq was a greater threat than other countries, and that the lack of any success in the <a href="../../../u/n/m/UNMOVIC_e408.html" title="UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a> finding WMDs should have prompted a re-think. It states that Tony Blair's policy towards Iraq shifted because of the attacks of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, not because of Iraq's weapons programme, and that the government's language left the impression that there was "fuller and firmer intelligence" than was the case.</p>
<p>The report indicated that there was enough intelligence to make a “well-founded” judgment that <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was seeking, perhaps as late as 2002, to obtain uranium illegally from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a> and the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo_8cfe.html" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (6.4 para. 499). In particular, referring to a 1999 visit of Iraqi officials to Niger, the report states (6.4 para. 503): “The British government had intelligence from several different sources indicating that this visit was for the purpose of acquiring uranium. Since uranium constitutes almost three-quarters of Niger's exports, the intelligence was credible.”</p>
<p>This intelligence (which had controversially found its way into George W. Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech) had previously (before September 2003 [C. May, 2004]) been thought to rely on forged documents. The Butler Review stated that “the forged documents were not available to the British Government at the time its assessment was made.” (6.4 para. 503) Taking into account the American intelligence community’s findings on the matter, it is true that in December 2003, then CIA director <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Tenet_1671.html" title="George Tenet">George Tenet</a> conceded that the inclusion of the claim in the State of the Union address was a mistake. (<i>CNN.com</i>, 2003) However, Tenet believed so, not due to any compelling evidence to the contrary, but rather because the CIA (criticized concerning this matter by the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Report_of_Pre-war_Intelligence_on_Iraq_117a.html" title="Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq">Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq</a> [Schmidt, 2004]) had failed to investigate the claim thoroughly; however again, the Butler Review states (6.4 para. 497) in 2002 the CIA “agreed that there was evidence that [uranium from Africa] had been sought.” In the run-up to war in Iraq, the British Intelligence Services apparently believed that Iraq had been trying to obtain uranium from Africa; however, no evidence has been passed on to the IAEA apart from the forged documents (6.4 Para. 502). (<i>Times Online</i>, 2003)</p>
<p>The report did not blame any specific individuals. It specifically stated that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Scarlett_7ece.html" title="John Scarlett">John Scarlett</a>, the head of the JIC should not resign, and indeed should take up his new post as head of <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler_Review_bb12.html" title="Edit section: Criticism of Niger conclusions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism of Niger conclusions</span></h2>
<p>Nuclear expert Norman Dombey has pointed out that the information relied upon by the Butler Review on the Niger issue was incomplete; as he noted, "The Butler report says the claim was credible because an Iraqi diplomat visited Niger in 1999, and almost three-quarters of Niger's exports were uranium. But this is irrelevant, since France controls Niger's uranium mines."(<a href="http://www.spinwatch.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=134" class="external text" title="http://www.spinwatch.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=134" rel="nofollow">Independent</a>, 25 July 2004). And when asked by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to discuss the conclusions of British intelligence, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin stated, "The one thing where I think they stretched a little bit beyond where we would stretch is on the points about Iraq seeking uranium from various African locations. We've looked at those reports and we don't think they are very credible. It doesn't diminish our conviction that he's going for nuclear weapons, but I think they reached a little bit on that one point."<a href="http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/us/letters,%20reports%20and%20statements/senate-intelligencereport-070904.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/us/letters,%20reports%20and%20statements/senate-intelligencereport-070904.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
