<p>Reverting someones user page for failure to follow article syle guidelines such as those in WP:Profanity appears to be an abuse of Wikipedia. My opinion is that a user page is not an article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshHolloway_ec7b.html" title="User:JoshHolloway">Josh</a> should consider WP:Civility and, Buttboy666, you should consider warning him for abuse of your user page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mrcfjf (<a href="../../../m/r/c/User_talk%7EMrcfjf_1100.html" title="User talk:Mrcfjf">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrcfjf_6c50.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrcfjf">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I really don't understand what exactly that means. Because someone else who uses my IP address complained about something, you do a lookup on that address and everyone who uses it gets blocked? Furthermore, I don't see how I could possibly speak to or be held responsible for anon edits by my IP adress made months ago by people who are presumably in one of the other offices in my building. Not to mention at least 35 others share my IP address, some of whom presumably utilize wikipedia for legitimate purposes who I would imagine won't be happy when they learn they've been blocked virtually forever. I can't imagine this is how things are always handled here since I'm sure a large portion of your users are on a shared connection. Are the powers that be aware that an IP address does not always equate to a single person? This entire process has been harsh without explanation and terse responses citing threads about policies that don't even seem to apply to me doesn't help the matter. I've never been treated so poorly by an internet community, which is especially disappointing considering how open wikipedia claims to be. Buttboy666 16:02, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd also have to be worried about your username as well. Please see <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>. The name buttboy is probably a little edgy, and it doesn't help with <a href="../../../6/6/6/666.html" title="666">666</a> next to it. However, I would advise, that if they decide to unblock you for not being a sockpuppet, that you immediately go for a username change. As a result, please see <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameblocked_c05c.html" title="Template:Usernameblocked">template:usernameblocked</a> for info on how to do this. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 20:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Buttboy is an old nickname since I picked up smoking at an early age. I was not aware there was another meaning to the word, unless you are simply positing that the word butt (presumably referring to the part of human anatomy) combined with the word boy (male youngster) is offensive, which, with all due respect, is so childish that it didn't even cross my mind when selecting my username. 666 is easy for me to remember, admittedly due to the connotations associated with it, but ultimately it's just three numbers in a row. I really have no idea, but I doubt people have been truly afraid or offended by it for a few hundred years. However, if the community deems that my chosen username is inappropriate then I would be willing to change it to something more suitable provided that it's something unique that I can identify with.

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Request reason: "It is unclear to me why I was blocked. The one policy quoted to me by a rather new editor does not appear to directly apply to the user namespace, both in its own wording and in general practice. As my search through the vast amount of official policies and the related community consensuses did not illuminate the matter, can anyone who can be calm and reasonable please direct me to where the decision was made to disallow profanity on user pages? Also, from my limited understanding of the matter it appears that part of the reason I was blocked was because of edits made by my IP address that were not made by me personally. Like many other editors, my IP address is shared by numerous users, most of whom I do not know and have never met. I made an account to avoid this exact problem and to disassociate myself from the vandals that, by no fault of my own, happen to be on the same network as me. Regardless of the decision made about my appeal, I would be grateful if someone could comment directly on my talk page to tell me what has happened and why, rather than just excercising their power from afar as a faceless admin and blocking me forever with no explanation."</p>

<dd>Hey man, you were blocked because your username is offensive (the possible sockpuppetry is another issue). Please see <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>. Buttboy, no matter how indearing, is offensive, and <a href="../../../6/6/6/666.html" title="666">666</a> is the number for Satan. I realize you may feel strongly, but, you can easily create a username that is less offensive, or change the username on this one: see the instructions at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">Template:UsernameBlocked</a>. Please see <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">WP:SPIDER</a> - it's not the end of the world to create another.

<li>My IP is blocked - I cannot create another username nor can I request a change. Even if I could pursue either of those options, I would still not be able to edit any pages, other than my own user page.</li>
