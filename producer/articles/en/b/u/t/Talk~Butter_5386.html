<p>"Visitors from Europe should know that anything labeled "butter" in the U.S. is salted unless specified otherwise." - This is the same in the UK as well, the rest of Europe too?</p>
<p>No. This is exactly the contrary in France. No surprise we always do exactly the opposite of the British&#160;;-) More seriously I've just there seems to be no label or mention resulting of some EC normalizations on my butter. However in France there's an unwritten color code that red is salted while blue is unsalted. Obviously it's easier to notice in on no-brand or distributor-brand butter than on the "itsee-bitsee teeny weeny yellow polka dot" packaging of well-known commercial brands. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 21:24, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Trivia</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The German expression <i>alles ist in Butter</i> ("Everything is in butter") means everything is in order. In the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_ages.html" title="Middle ages">Middle ages</a>, fragile articles were transported using butter as we use <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styrofoam.html" title="Styrofoam">styrofoam</a> today. They were inserted into warm liquid butter which solidified as it cooled down and so protected the fragile goods. At the destination, the butter was again liquefied and poured off.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The English word "butterfly" has its origins in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstition.html" title="Superstition">superstition</a> that <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witches</a> transform into butterflies in order to steal farmers' cream or butter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The German expression is one among I'm sure hundreds of expressions involving the word butter around the world. The "butterfly" origin is interesting - if reliable - but is more about butterflies than butter; <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfly.html" title="Butterfly">butterfly</a> already has an etymology section, and it looks better researched than this factoid to me.</p>
<p>Finally, butter as packing material. That's... interesting. I can't find a source. It sounds, on the face of it, unlikely, becuase (a) there weren't that many fragile things being shipped in the middle ages, (b) Trips in the middle ages took a while, and the butter would become rancid and nasty, and (c) Packing in butter sounds quite expensive and laborous compared to say, straw. Of course, these arguments just make this practice all the more interesting if true, so if somebody can point to a good source for this, I'm all for putting it back in. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) I found this one: <a href="http://www.allesinbutter.de/Begriffsbedeutung/begriffsbedeutung.html" class="external free" title="http://www.allesinbutter.de/Begriffsbedeutung/begriffsbedeutung.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allesinbutter.de/Begriffsbedeutung/begriffsbedeutung.html</a> - would that qualify as a source?</p>

<p>After the discussions on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Butter_e504.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Butter">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Butter</a>, I wanted to try to rewrite the "Types of Butter" section, to show how it could be changed from a list to a narrative structure. Unfortunately, I don't actually know anything about butter, so I'm not sure that my rewrite doesn't contain some horrible inaccuracies or distortions. I'm posting the rewrite here; if it's correct, I hope someone will consider adding it to the article. The first paragraph is particularly bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a large variety of butter-making techniques, and different types of production can lead to very different final products. Particularly important is the type of cream used in butter production. These production methods, and the resulting butters, have changed over time, and may vary between cultures.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Before modern factory production, cream was typicaly collected from several milkings before it was used, and was lightly fermented by the time the butter was produced. Butter made from lightly-fermented cream has come to be called <b>cultured butter</b>. During fermentation, the cream naturally sourced as <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacterium.html" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a> converted <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactose.html" title="Lactose">milk sugars</a> into <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactic_acid.html" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>. This fermentation produces additional aroma compounds, including <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diacetyl.html" title="Diacetyl">diacetyl</a>, leading to a fuller-flavored and more "buttery"-tasting product.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_diacetyl"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_diacetyl" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_diacetyl" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> Cultured butter is now made from pasteurized cream whose fermentation is produced by the introduction of <i><a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactococcus.html" title="Lactococcus">Lactococcus</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/e/u/Leuconostoc.html" title="Leuconostoc">Leuconostoc</a></i> bacteria, and remains the most common type of butter in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another method for producing cultured butter was developed in the 1970s: fresh cream is produced into butter, to which bacterial cultures and lactic acid are incorporated. The cultured butter flavor grows as the butter is aged in cold storage. This method is more efficient for manufacturers, since aging the cream used to make butter takes more space than storing the finished butter. A similar method is even more efficient, but is not considered real cultured butter: lactic acid and flavor compounds are added to fresh-cream butter, simulating the cultured butter taste. Cultured butter of one form or another is sometimes labeled <i>European-style butter</i> in the United States.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">When heated, butter quickly melts into a thin liquid.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In modern times, dairy products are often pasturized during production to kill bacteria. Butter made from pasturerized fresh cream is called <b>sweet cream butter</b>; this is the dominant category in the United States and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Production of sweet cream butter became common in the 19th century, with the development of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigeration.html" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a> and the mechanical cream separator.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_sweetcream"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_sweetcream" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_sweetcream" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Butter created from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is <b>raw cream butter</b>. It has a "cleaner" cream flavor, without the cooked-milk notes that pasteurization introduces. Raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States and is rare in Europe as well.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_rawcream"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_rawcream" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_rawcream" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>All of these categories of butter are sold in both salted and unsalted forms. Salted butters have either fine granular <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edible_salt.html" title="Edible salt">salt</a> or a strong <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brine.html" title="Brine">brine</a> added to them during the working. Nations that favor sweet cream butter tend to favor salted butter as well, possibly reflecting the blander taste of uncultured butter. The addition of salt flavors the butter and also acts as a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preservative.html" title="Preservative">preservative</a>.</p>
<p>Several <b>spreadable butters</b> have been developed; these remain softer at colder temperatures and are therefore easier to use directly out of refrigeration. Some modify the makeup of the butter's fat through chemical manipulation of the finished product, some through manipulation of the cattle's feed, and some incorporate vegetable oils into the butter. <b>Whipped butter</b> is another more spreadable product; <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen.html" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> gas is used to aerate the butter, since normal air would encourage oxidation and rancidity.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of production is the amount of <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfat.html" title="Butterfat">butterfat</a> left in the butter during production. In the United States, all products sold as "butter" must contain a minimum of 80% butterfat by weight. European-style butter generally has a higher percentage of butterfat than most U.S. butter, up to 85%. <b><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarified_butter.html" title="Clarified butter">Clarified butter</a></b> is butter with almost all of its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to near the boiling point of water, allowing the water to cook off; the remaining components separate by density. <a href="../../../w/h/e/Whey.html" title="Whey">Whey</a> proteins form a skin on top, which is removed, and the butterfat is poured off the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casein.html" title="Casein">casein</a> proteins that settle to the bottom. <b><a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghee.html" title="Ghee">Ghee</a></b> is clarified butter which is brought to higher temperatures (120&#160;°C/250&#160;°F) once the water has cooked off, allowing the milk solids to brown. This caramelization adds flavor to the ghee, and since dissolved water and oxygen are reduced, ghee is protected longer from <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rancidification.html" title="Rancidification">rancidity</a>. Ghee can be kept for six to eight months under normal conditions without refrigeration.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ghee_making"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_ghee_making" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/u/t/Talk%7EButter_5386.html#endnote_ghee_making" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>I corrected slight error (that is cooking does not reduce rancidity, but cooking removes water and free oxygen from butterfat, which in turn reduces rancidity). Also appended without refrigeration.</p>

<p>Saravask (sorry said sam in edit summary), your arbitrary reversion is very concerning. Regardless of who whipped this article on one of our favourite food substances into shape (respect to BofG), and subject of course to certain important provisos, the fundamental principal is that no one editor can determine what changes are acceptable.

<p>Very nice work, people.

<p>Nice article! But I'm wondering about the "shelf-life" of butter - when refrigerated, frozen or left at room-temperature. In the "Storage" section, the article mentions that "light and air hasten rancidity" but I don't find any specific information about how long butter lasts in ideal conditions.

<p>I understand the particular shade of yellow has to do with feed, as the intro says, but we made some butter today, and cream is white, and just by shaking it, it turned to yellow butter.

<dd>I'm guessing the butterfat is yellow. (Why? I don't know.) In emulsion in the cream, the butterfat is too scattered and in too-small particles to have a big effect on the cream's color, but once a mass of butterfat builds up, it can show its true colors. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 05:34, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should information on trans-fat in butterfat be included? It's about 2-5%, mainly C18:1 (e.g. J. Dairy Res. 71, 66-73 (2004)). Seems appropriate, because quite some attention is given to the trans-fat levels in margarine. The emphasis on margarine is a bit peculiar from a European perspective, because the main margarine brands have reformulated somewhere in the mid-nineties. Apparently, the situation in the US is different. (User:Hippolyte) 10:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is butter a pure substance, a mechanical mixture, or a solution? 207.161.15.137 01:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this a homework question?

<p>There is a picture of a blue plastic tub with a block of butter in it 2/3rds down the page. It doesnt really benefit the article because a) the picture is small and has a low resolution so you don't really see anything spectacular anyways (it's ugly) and b) there is already a picture of butter further up the page, it is just a waste of space, so i think i should delete it. If you want to stop me, in defence of this masterpiece of photography, just tell me. Otherwise, i will just go ahead and delete it!</p>

<p>Can't imagine why someone would vandalize an article about butter, but they did, under the heading of "Butter Production". I don't know how to correct it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.110.200.41_09a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.110.200.41">71.110.200.41</a> (talk) 01:57, 2 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I would think that having a list of the types w/ subheadings for each would be easier to read than the current essay style. If I'm I the only one who thinks so I'll forget about it, so I wanted to check with other readers for their opinions. 24.124.29.130 11:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)TRCunning</p>

<dd>Prose is generally considered better form than lists, for some reason.
