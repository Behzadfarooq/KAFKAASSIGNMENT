<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_football.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The origins of Button Football are likely derived from any number of games played with tabs, bottle caps, or coins. The invention of the game using 11 pieces per side with rules simulating <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> is unclear, though a 6-piece version is known to have originated in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the patron of button football is widely accepted as Geraldo Décourt. He began playing in 1922 as a schoolboy, using buttons removed from his clothing as pieces. Décourt published the first known rule and guide book in 1930. He named the game “Celotex”, after the material which covered the tables on which it was played. Décourt continued to promote the game and organize tournaments on and off for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In 1962 the Federação Paulista de Futebol de Mesa (Paulista Federation of Button Football) was formed. To date there are dozens of formalized button football societies and leagues in every region of Brazil.</p>
<p>Button football continued to grow in popularity, especially during the early 50's. At that time, various materials were used for linesmen, some industrial, some hand-made. Industrial buttons could be ten-pieces sets, uniform in size and color, or sold as individual pieces, varying in size according to function (larger ones for defenders, mid-sized ones for midfielders, smaller ones for attackers) and in several layered color combinations usually but not necessarily patterned after the more popular soccer teams; of the latter, the most prized ones were made of galalite, although several other plastic materials were also used such as the covers of discared watches.</p>
<p>Hand-made buttons were usually made from coconut shells, horn or bone sections and similar materials. Industrial buttons often went through some extent of "tuning", such as scraping or slicing off layers or trimming playing edges. The same was done to pieces such as bus tokens, atop which clothes buttons were glued. Goal tenders were most often than not matchbokes about 6 by 4 cm filled with molten lead slabs for stability.</p>
<p>As a rule, in informal games and tournaments players could mix and match different kinds, sizes and color buttons. Later on, the game became more strictly formalized, dispensing with variety for the sake of standardization. Today there are dozens of button football clubs throughout Brazil, rigidly structured, with regular tournaments at the local, state, and national level. The majority of boys (and to a lesser extent girls) in Brazil play button football at some point in their youth.</p>

Sample dimensions of a button football table and field</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The game is played on a smooth, flat surface with markings per a regulation football field. Typical dimensions of the table would be 1.84 m long by 1.20 m wide, with the field being 1.67 m by 1.04 m. Goals are typically 12.5 cm wide by 5 cm tall per the interior dimensions.</p>

Typical ball, buttons, and goaltender game pieces</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each team consists of 11 pieces, 10 field pieces, or <b>buttons</b>, in the form of small circular disks, and 1 <b>goaltender</b> piece in the form of a rectangular block. At the opening kickoff, all 11 pieces are relegated to their respective sides. Button are always circular in shape. Lower quality pieces are made of plastic and of a wide variety of diameters. Higher quality pieces are made of fiberglass, having a diamter of typically between 35 mm and 50 mm, and a height usually no greater than 8 mm. Nowadays, in formal games and tournaments, all buttons should be of the same material, color and size. Such standardization is decried by older players, as in their view it robs teams from variety and from similitude to real-life socccer teams. Buttons can be decorated with markings and numbers typical of a football jersey, as well as graphics of famous players or team logos, but no large diversity within a given team is allowed..</p>
<p>Goaltender pieces are rectangular blocks with dimensions and weights closely regulated. Typical dimension limits include 35 mm width x 80 mm height x 15 mm depth.</p>
<p>The game ball is a sphere of woven felt with a diameter of 10 mm weighing between 0.1 and 0.3 grams.</p>
<p>Buttons are propelled using a flat circular plastic disc of approximately the same diameter as the buttons. Physical characteristics are not critical.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_football.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>There are a variety of different rule systems to define play. The following general guidelines are common to most, if not all:</p>
<p>At the opening kickoff, all 11 pieces are relegated to their respective sides. Field players are moved during the game by using a circular disk to exert a downward force on the field pieces, propelling them forward (pieces may never be pushed with the disk). Field pieces are propelled forward to strike the game ball. The ball is either sent forward and then hit again with the same field piece the next play (i.e. "dribbling"), sent forward towards another field piece on the same team (i.e. "passing"), or towards the opposing goal (i.e. "shooting"). Players alternate manipulating their pieces based on the possession rules defined in each rule system.</p>
<p>Shots on goal must be declared by the attacking team prior to being taken to allow the defending team to adjust it's goalkeeper. If the ball enters the goal without a shot having been declared, the goal is annulled.</p>
<p>If a field piece strikes an opposing piece prior to hitting the ball, that is declared a foul. If the ball hits an opposing piece then stays within the field of play, possession is relinquished to the opposing team. If the ball leaves the field of play, possession is taken by the team that did not hit touch the ball last before going out of bounds.</p>
<p>Button may be manually manipulated at intervals determined by the govenring rule system, usually only during stopages in play.</p>
<p>For corner kicks, free kicks, and penalty shots, the ball is placed in the appropriate location and a button is placed behind it at the attacking player's discretion. Throw-ins and goal kicks are simulated by placing the ball at the appropriate location, then either flicking the ball with disk or goalkeeper, or again by lining up a button behind the ball (depending on the rules of the particular rule system).</p>
<p>Fouls may also be declared for gameplay offenses such as affecting pieces or the ball at inappropriate times, touching the opposing player's pieces, or unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
<p>Specific rules are defined for each rule system, with the primary difference being the number of touches each team may have per possession.</p>
<p><a name="Rule_Systems" id="Rule_Systems"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_football.html" title="Edit section: Rule Systems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rule Systems</span></h2>
<p>The various rule systems differ predominantly regarding the number of touches each team may have. They will also cover specific guidelines equipment and game conduct . Within Brazil, there are three most popular rule systems:</p>
<p><b>“12 Touch”</b></p>
<p>Game duration: two 10- or 15-minutes halves, depending on previously agreed upon rules.</p>
<p>Number of touches: 12 per team per possession, no more than 3 with any field piece</p>
<p>Principal characteristics: Higher scoring than conventional football. This style of play favors skilled touches and shooting rather than offensive strategy. Defensive strategy plays a more significant role in the positioning and marking of offensive pieces.</p>
<p>A variation used mostly in informal games places no limit to the number of consecutive touches by a team in possession of the ball, or by any of its pieces. While favoring ball control, this mode allows skilled players to stall games and play by the clock.</p>
<p><b>“3 Touch”</b></p>
<p>Game duration: two 25-minutes halves</p>
<p>Number of touches: 3 per team per possession, shots on goal only following a pass</p>
<p>Principal characteristics: Scoring typical of conventional football. Strategy primarily revolves around limiting opposing team shots on goal.</p>
<p><b>“1 Touch”</b></p>
<p>Game duration: two 25-minutes halves</p>
<p>Number of touches: 1 per team per possession; 2 at the onset of play (start, half, throw-in and goal-kick)</p>
<p>Principal characteristics: Very difficult to play with very low scoring. Strategy primarily revolves around sending the ball into opposing half of play and maintaining the ball in that position.</p>
