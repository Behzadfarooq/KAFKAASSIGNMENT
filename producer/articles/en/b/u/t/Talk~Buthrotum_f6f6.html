	    <p>Dear Mr "Rory"</p>
<p>Firts of all if you have doubts about my true identity you can contact me by telephone or I am happy to send you my address here in USA. I have no reason to hide my identity as you are doing.</p>
<p>Second those coments about Stalinism facts? Well I am to young to have been influenced by that epidemy, however I see that you write that you have been involve in Albania since 1960. Well we all know who was allowed to visit Albania in those days. Only people who belived in Stalinism or where close to albanian comunist regime and its secret service. You pick wich one. I see that even you write "democracy". Well to me it does explain a lot why you where allowed to visit Albania during the most brutal comunist regime in the Planet</p>
<p>Now back to our argument. Please read the annual Rapport of Butrint Foundation 2003 in regards to a collection of crusaiders coins bought by the english archaeologists under Richard Hodges in Butrint. Is this legal? Albanian Law doesnt allow this.</p>
<p>I am happy to give you more cases if you wish.</p>
<p>Museum of Albanian First Language School in Gjirokastra. Well your argument is very weak. It is the albanian museum of albanian language and it was made an Office for Richard Hodges, yes with aproval of the ex Deputy Mayor of the Town. But have you asked how much money that guy got? Why should a Foundation pay the state officials? You tell me my friend.</p>
<p>I am open to any debate on this issue. As far as Mr. Tare is concern? I do not know him or meet him. I only heard him lecture last year in Harvard University and I have to say I was proud of him representing Albania.</p>

Oh Dear! Despite the odd thoughts on international legal definitions, libel, as expressed by this statement ‘Richard Hodges is accused of buying antiquety [sic] in Butrint’ remains libel and actionable. If there is evidence show it. Claims to have evidence to be shown to me or others in private (as if a meeting were possible) are evidence of nothing. If you’ve got it, show it here or stop writing this sort of drivel.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing some research as well. This historical museum in Argyrokastro, as I now understand it, yes it was converted into an office, with the full agreement of the city council and national monuments inspectorate of the time. Before the conversion it was a decaying wreck with a ‘roof like a sieve’ I am informed. It is at least now watertight, unlike much of the rest of the once wonderful, but rapidly crumbling marvel that is this museum city. But of course, I suspect that this neglect is also someone else’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Why did I edit out Mr. Tare’s name Well it occurred to me that if personalities were to be banned from appearing on this page then the best way forward was to delete them all! What is fairer than that? As for the complaints of Iris Orgicka and Arben Mirtiri about how I insult Albanians, no, I think it is people who canvass absurd publicity, write their own eulogistic Wkipedia pages for example, and twist facts and reality in a fine Stalinist fashion to their own ends, who give Albanians a bad name! It very much reminds me of the days I was involved in radical dialectics. In any case, given that these two complainants seem to share and IP address with my erstwhile opponent as editor of this page, someone who edits the Auron Tare pare page a lot, I have my doubts about the independence of their comments, or indeed their existence.</p>
<p>As for me, I have had connections with Albania since the 1960s, I visit on occasion even these days since ‘democracy’ has come, you may call me Rory. I have contributed on various things, an am interested in the politics of heritage, though the real work has been done by others.</p>
<p>I have left the current page unmodified as together with the history page discussion and history pages it demonstrates clearly the weaknesses of Wikipedia as a truly objective source. Far from removal of names showig the the 'site is not free' it demonstrates quite the opposite! I would concur though what information is 'manipulated by people who are giving false information'. The experiment though is good, and of course I reserve the right to return to editing at some point in the future…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Dear Sir</p>
<p>whom ever is removing the information about the work of albanian team in butrint is making a mistake. This shows that this site is not free and is manipulated by people who are giving false information.</p>
<p>Iris Orgocka</p>
<p><br />
Dear <b>rbremner</b></p>
<p>you are insolting the albanians by removing the note about the albanian managing team of BUtrint and Mr Auron Tare the person who has saved Butrint form illigal buildings as well as the attemps of certant "foreign archaeologists to control the albanian cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Arben Mertiri</p>
<p><br />
Dear Sir</p>
<p>As a person much invole in the issues of my country and specialy in Cultural Heritage I am willing to prove to you according to official accusations by several albanian authorities, Gjirokastra Town Hall, Cultural experts and archaeology that the work done in albania by Prof. Richard Hodges is seen as a colonian attitude towards "the natives"</p>
<p>Do you know that the First Albanian School open in 1908 in Gjirokastra has been converted to an Office by Richard Hodges?</p>
<p>Would you like me to prove this fact?</p>
<p>Arben Mertiri Boston, MA</p>
<p>P.S Please do write with you name. There is not seriouse to have a debate without a name</p>
<p><br />
Don't believe everything you read in the newspapers! Accusations and hearsay are not evidence and unless someone is willing to provide some solid, legally binding, proof of such allegations then it remains libel.</p>
<p>rbremner</p>
<p>From what I have read in the albanian press Prof. Richard Hodges is very much critisised for his arrogance and atemps to controll albanian archaeology. Albania does deserve better that is why people like Prof. Richard Hodges with a highly colonial attitude should not be alowed to work in the country.</p>
<p>Arben Mertiri Boston, MA</p>
<p>HI</p>
<p>I would like to ad something about Butrint but the page is protected. Can I please be alowed to write.</p>
<p>agron</p>
<p>For the benfit of Wikipedia I should point out that the comments in the last para of 'archaeological excavations' may be construed as libellous to the mentioned Prof. Hodges. The problem appears to be IP 217.24.244.230 (anon) who I see from the history has made several similar changes, a number of the latest of which I have already tried to edit. Can nothing be done against this sort of vandalism? Butrint and Albania deserve better than this!</p>
<p>rbremner</p>
<p>The beginning should be changed, namely the phrase: "Its ancient name was Vouthroton, the modern name for the Roman city of Buthrotum." An ancient pre-roman name cannot be modern for a Roman name&#160;?!? I would sugest something like this&#160;: The modern name of the city is Butrint, ancient Greek ( or old name given in Greek, Hellenistic or pre-Roman texts Vouthroton (or with a more correct pronunciation Boutroton), Roman Buthrotum. Also, the phrase "Greek colony of Corfu" doesn't make sense, since there were no other established nations on the island at that time. It should be "Greek settlements" or just cities or just colonies or, to be more precise, "corinthian colonies", if one is sure that the colonies referred to were corinthian and not others.</p>
