<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Reed_069e.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Butch Reed started wrestling in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> in the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a> territory after briefly playing professional football for the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. Early on he’d wrestle as Bruce Reed adopting the “Hacksaw” nickname over time. Reed and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Rougeau_dc03.html" title="Jacques Rougeau">Jerry Roberts</a> beat Mike George and Bob Sweetan for the NWA Central States Tag-Team titles in late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> and lost them to The Kelly Twins in January of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, this is believed to be Butch Reed’s first major title in wrestling. His next title also came as one half of a tag team when he and Sweet Brown Sugar (Not Koko B. Ware but Skip Young) won the Florida version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship]] when they beat <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dory_Funk%2C_Jr._f80f.html" title="Dory Funk, Jr.">Dory Funk, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Von_Erich_0403.html" title="David Von Erich">David Von Erich</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. Reed wrestled mainly for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Wrestling_Alliance_182e.html" title="National Wrestling Alliance">NWA</a> in the early 1980's and made a name for himself in their <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Championship_Wrestling_f2f7.html" title="Florida Championship Wrestling">Florida Championship Wrestling</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Championship_Wrestling_5160.html" title="Georgia Championship Wrestling">Georgia Championship Wrestling</a> territories.</p>
<p><a name="Mid-South" id="Mid-South"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Reed_069e.html" title="Edit section: Mid-South">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mid-South</span></h3>
<p>Reed established himself as a force to be reckoned with while competing in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Watts_8107.html" title="Bill Watts">Bill Watts</a>’ Mid-South Wrestling from 1983 through early 1986. In Mid-South he was known as “Hacksaw” Butch Reed and came into the territory as a tag-team partner for the main <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Face (professional wrestling)">Face</a> in the territory the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkyard_Dog_eb66.html" title="Junkyard Dog">Junkyard Dog</a>. Reed immediately came face to face with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Duggan_46d6.html" title="Jim Duggan">”Hacksaw” Jim Duggan</a> over the “Hacksaw” nickname. Back in 1983 Duggan was part of the <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">Heel</a> group the “Rat Pack” along with <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Dibiase_3991.html" title="Ted Dibiase">Ted Dibiase</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Borne_7377.html" title="Matt Borne">Matt Borne</a> and used every dirty move he could think off to beat Butch Reed. Reed and Duggan would feud over the “Hacksaw” name until Jim Duggan turned face. Duggan’s face turn resulted in Butch Reed’s heel turn when Duggan was picked to be the Junkyard Dog’s tag-team partner over Butch Reed who was JYD’s regular partner.</p>
<p>Reed appeared on TV stating that “Butch Reed is going to start looking out for Butch Reed”, which prompted the Junkyard Dog to join him in the ring. After arguing back and forth Reed attacked JYD and was soon joined in the attack by Ted Dibiase. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> Butch Reed won the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-South_North_American_Championship_0c6c.html" title="Mid-South North American Championship">Mid-South North American Championship</a> and proceeded to turn back JYD’s challenges in subsequent months. In October of 83 Butch Reed’s arrogance made him agree to let the Mid-South fans pick a challenger for the North American title letting them pick from the Junkyard Dog, “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan, newcomer <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Darsow_0c02.html" title="Barry Darsow">Krusher Darsow</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Allen_b69d.html" title="Terry Allen">Magnum T.A.</a>. The fans picked JYD but Reed dismissed the choice, he also said Duggan and Darsow did not deserve a shot and instead gave the title shot to a very young and inexperienced Magnum T.A. As fate would have it Magnum beat Reed to win the title, then lost it 12 days later to <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Volkoff_4809.html" title="Nikolai Volkoff">Nikolai Volkoff</a>.</p>
<p>On the same night that Reed lost the North American title he and partner <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Neidhart_80d7.html" title="Jim Neidhart">Jim Neidhart</a> beat Magnum T.A. and “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan to win the <a href="../../../u/w/f/UWF_Tag_Team_Championship_28bb.html" title="UWF Tag Team Championship">UWF Tag Team Championship</a>. After a few weeks the North American title was returned to Reed claiming that the title match with Magnum T.A. was not legal since the fans chose JYD. Reed’s run as a double champion did not last long as JYD got his title shot with <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Rhodes_be5a.html" title="Dusty Rhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a> as the special guest referee. After losing the North American title Reed and Neidhart focused on the tag-team titles defending them against all comers. When Magnum and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Wrestling_II_b2dd.html" title="Mr. Wrestling II">Mr. Wrestling II</a> challenged for the titles they felt that the challengers had to put up something of their own: Mr. Wrestling II’s mask. Mr. Wrestling did not unmask that night as they took the gold from Reed and Neidhart in a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_cage_match.html" title="Steel cage match">Steel cage match</a> on Christmas <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Neidhart and Reed started to blame each other and had a short, brutal feud.</p>
<p>The Neidhart feud was soon replaced with a feud with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Taylor_9204.html" title="Terry Taylor">Terry Taylor</a> who came out to save Neidhart from being beaten down with a football helmet after a match. The Reed / Taylor feud raged all through the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> and was instrumental in establishing Terry Taylor as a star in Mid-South. The feud soon expanded to include<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Landel_4e2a.html" title="Buddy Landel">”Nature Boy” Buddy Landel</a> as Reed’s tag-team partner and saw Reed attack Taylor with a “Coalminer’s Glove” on several occasions. After fighting with Terry Taylor for months on end Reed’s attention turned from Taylor back to his old enemy the Junkyard Dog. During a match Reed and Landel attacked JYD as he performed under a mask as “Stagger Lee” and painted him yellow. The war between the two brought in <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_King_c66a.html" title="Sonny King">Sonny King</a> and later <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Ladd_16d8.html" title="Ernie Ladd">Ernie Ladd</a> to team with Junkyard Dog, after the tag matches came the brutal singles matches such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_match_types.html#Texas_Bullrope_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Dog Collar Matches</a></p>
<p>Just as the feud was about to reach it’s heated highlight the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Federation_3882.html" title="World Wrestling Federation">World Wrestling Federation</a> without informing booker Bill Watts’ of his decision. This meant that the federation was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wells_83e9.html" title="George Wells">”Master G”</a> to take JYD’s place but the feud between Reed and “G” never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When “General” <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skandor_Akbar_2e1f.html" title="Skandor Akbar">Skandor Akbar</a> entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch with the understanding that it wasn’t actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed he became incensed (storyline wise), stomped on the watch and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar and his cronies came to ringside which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd behind him as he told them he didn’t need back-up. When “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack Reed’s face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar’s army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Williams_%28wrestler%29_8d67.html" title="Steve Williams (wrestler)">Steve Williams</a>, and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Fernandez_eecd.html" title="Ray Fernandez">Hercules</a>. Two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Harris_6032.html" title="James Harris">Kamala</a> who proved to be too much for Reed, beating him all over the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left the territory.</p>
<p>Reed would go to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Wrestling_Association_b6c1.html" title="American Wrestling Association">American Wrestling Association</a> for a short stint as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Garvin_b25d.html" title="Jimmy Garvin">Jimmy Garvin’s</a> bodyguard but would return to Mid-South in the middle of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> only a few short months after quietly leaving it. In October of 1985 Butch Reed beat <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Murdoch_151f.html" title="Dick Murdoch">Dick Murdoch</a> for the North American title. Around this time, he had a famous one-hour time-limit draw with NWA Champion <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">"Nature Boy" Ric Flair</a> and feuded with <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Slater_47c7.html" title="Dick Slater">Dick Slater</a> when Slater helped Ric Flair keep the world title. In January of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> Slater won the North American title from Butch Reed through underhanded means</p>
<p>After leaving the Mid-South Reed returned to Kansas City and the “NWA Central States” territory run by Bob Geigel. In Kansas Reed initially teamed with Rufus R. Jones as the <b>Soul Patrol</b>. Reed later turned on Rufus and joined manager <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Johnson_240b.html" title="Kenneth Johnson">Slick’s</a> group in 1986. After a brief feud with Rufus R. Jones Reed got involved in a feud with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Goodish_3111.html" title="Frank Goodish">Bruiser Brody</a>. That summer, he lost a loser leaves town match to Bruiser Brody and left the territory along with Slick.</p>

<p>Butch Reed and Slick signed with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWF</a> and was brought in as a package. Reed dyed his hair blonde and became "The Natural" Butch Reed, an updated version of “Sweet Daddy Siki”. Reed made his PPV debut at <a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleMania_III_4bdf.html" title="WrestleMania III">WrestleMania III</a> where he defeated <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ware_21b5.html" title="James Ware">Koko B. Ware</a>. He initially feuded with <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstar_Billy_Graham_f567.html" title="Superstar Billy Graham">Superstar Billy Graham</a> and according to the storyline injured Graham so badly that he had to retire from wrestling. When Graham started managing <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Muraco_c712.html" title="Don Muraco">Don Muraco</a>, Reed targeted the Hawaiian as well. After the feud with Muraco ended Reed targeted then Intercontinental Champion <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Steamboat_cca9.html" title="Ricky Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a>. A myth has spread that Butch Reed no-showed the match where he was booked to win the title and ended up in the WWF's dog house because of this. Reed himself has said this is untrue in a shoot interview. In fact, when the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honky_Tonk_Man_60f3.html" title="Honky Tonk Man">Honky Tonk Man</a> won the title, Butch Reed was shown celebrating with Honky and the other heel wrestlers in the locker room. Reed went on to participate in the main event the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_Series_%281987%29_4e25.html" title="Survivor Series (1987)">first Survivor Series</a> but was eliminated. He was also eliminated in the first round of the <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestlemania_IV_e28d.html" title="Wrestlemania IV">Wrestlemania IV</a> Championship Tournament to eventual tournament winner <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Savage_5911.html" title="Randy Savage">"Macho Man" Randy Savage</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after WrestleMania IV Butch Reed and the WWF parted ways, Reed’s manager stayed with the federation while Reed struck out on his own once more. Butch Reed resurfaced in the NWA's <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crockett_Promotions_2a91.html" title="Jim Crockett Promotions">Jim Crockett Promotions</a> as "Hacksaw" Butch Reed. He more or less immediately resumed his Mid-South feud with The Junkyard Dog. He was briefly managed by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_J._Dillon_71e6.html" title="James J. Dillon">James J. Dillon</a> before his contract was "sold" to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiro_Matsuda_cc15.html" title="Hiro Matsuda">Hiro Matsuda</a>'s "<a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamasaki_Corporation_c2ef.html" title="Yamasaki Corporation">Yamasaki Corporation</a>". Reed did not see much success in the early parts of his run with JCP, the highest he ever rose was as an unsuccessful challenger to the <a href="../../../n/w/a/NWA_World_Television_Championship_56e4.html" title="NWA World Television Championship">|NWA Television Champion</a> <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting_%28wrestler%29.html" title="Sting (wrestler)">ting</a> at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi-Town_Rumble_eae7.html" title="Chi-Town Rumble">Chi-Town Rumble</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. During the summer of 1989 Reed would flounder in the mid card as Jim Crocket Promotions grew to become a national wrestling organization.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Steiner_Brothers_d613.html" title="The Steiner Brothers">The Steiner Brothers</a> were involved in a storyline with <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Daus_3a75.html" title="Nancy Daus">”Woman”</a> whom promised <b>Doom</b> for the two brothers but never specified what exactly this “Doom” was. At <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_Havoc_ce5f.html#1989" title="Halloween Havoc">Halloween Havoc 1989</a> Woman unveiled her threat, a couple of brawny, hard hitting masked African Americans. It was quite obvious to most wrestling fans who were under the black masks, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Simmons_9ae3.html" title="Ron Simmons">Ron Simmons</a> and Butch Reed. They had both been on WCW television shortly before Doom debuted and they were the only two African American wrestlers in the federation that had the same massive physical appearance but the announcers kept up the storyline. Doom won their debut match against the Steiners when one of the members of Doom pinned Rick Steiner after a headbutt with an illegal object in his mask. Doom followed up on this success by defeating <a href="../../../22/h/o/_Hot_Stuff__Eddie_Gilbert_d44c.html" title="&quot;Hot Stuff&quot; Eddie Gilbert">Eddie Gilbert</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Rich_7cf8.html" title="Tommy Rich">Tommy Rich</a> at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_the_Champions_cb0a.html#Clash_of_the_Champions_IX:_New_York_Knockout" title="Clash of the Champions">Clash of the Champions IX</a>, looking very strong in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Doom’s next PPV outing did not come with the same success. Along with the Steiner Brothers, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Road_Warriors_b61e.html" title="The Road Warriors">the Road Warriors</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Headshrinkers_6321.html" title="The Headshrinkers">the Samoan Swat Team</a> they were entered in a one night, tag-team <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round-robin_tournament.html" title="Round-robin tournament">round robin tournament</a> but did not score a single point ending dead last in the tournament. Doom’s misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team and left the federation. Then on February 6, 1990 Doom hit rock bottom when they were defeated by Rick &amp; Scott Steiner and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask. When Doom unmasked no one was really surprised to see Ron Simmons and Butch Reed underneath the black hoods. Freed of the masks and now under management of former referee <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Long_b4d1.html" title="Theodore Long">Teddy Long</a>, Doom began to prosper. Free to use their full movesets and not trying to hide who they were, Doom earned another shot at the Steiner Brothers.</p>
<p>At <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Combat_ee65.html" title="Capital Combat">Capital Combat</a> Doom shocked the world when they beat the Steiner Brothers, a team that at that point in time did not lose very often. Doom won the tag-team titles and quickly set about defending them against the former champions the Steiners as well the rest of WCW’s very talented tag-team division. In the fall of 1990 Doom soon got their hands full with <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Horsemen_%28professional_wrestling%29_bddf.html" title="Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)">The 4 Horsemen</a> and defended against them in two inconclusive tag-team title matches at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_Havoc_ce5f.html#1990" title="Halloween Havoc">Halloween Havoc 1990</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starrcade.html#1990" title="Starrcade">Starrcade 1990</a>. At <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_the_Champions_cb0a.html#Clash_of_the_Champions_XIV:_Dixie_Dynamite" title="Clash of the Champions">Clash of the Champions XIV</a> Doom lost a non-title match to <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting_%28wrestler%29.html" title="Sting (wrestler)">Sting</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luger_0f7a.html" title="Lex Luger">Lex Luger</a> in a match that foreshadowed the trouble that lay ahead for Doom.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> at WCW’s <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestle_War_836f.html#1991" title="Wrestle War">1991 Wrestle War</a> PPV Doom took on former tag-team champions <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabulous_Freebirds_3cec.html" title="Fabulous Freebirds">The Fabulous Freebirds</a> and lost due to miscommunication between Reed and Simmons. After the Freebirds left the ring Reed turned on Simmons and beat him up, turning Simmons face and ending the team of Doom forever. Teddy Long sided with Butch Reed as the former Doom partners engaged in a short but intense feud. The feud culminated at <a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperBrawl_44c7.html#SuperBrawl_I" title="SuperBrawl">SuperBrawl I</a> where Ron Simmons pinned Butch Reed in a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_cage_match.html" title="Steel cage match">Steel cage match</a> (referred to as a "Thunder-Doom" cage match). After the PPV Reed left the company for a short while only to return in 1992 siding with <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sione_Vailahi_6d24.html" title="Sione Vailahi">The Barbarian</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Foley_9e70.html" title="Mick Foley">Cactus Jack</a>. Reed and the Barbarian teamed up to defeat <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Runnels_III_e560.html" title="Virgil Runnels III">Dustin Rhodes</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Windham_1b60.html" title="Barry Windham">Barry Windham</a> at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_the_Champions_cb0a.html#Clash_of_the_Champions_XX:_20th_Anniversary" title="Clash of the Champions">Clash of the Champions XX</a> but left WCW for good shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>After leaving WCW Reed went to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Wrestling_Association_b21a.html" title="United States Wrestling Association">United States Wrestling Association</a> where once again started feuding with long time opponent the Junkyard Dog. Reed even managed to beat JYD for the <a href="../../../u/s/w/USWA_Unified_World_Heavyweight_Championship_a7e5.html" title="USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship">USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. Reed only held the title for a week before he lost it to <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Champion_8456.html" title="Todd Champion">Todd Champion</a>. Reed left he promotion before 1992 ended.</p>
<p>The next time Butch Reed appeared for a notable promotion was in 1994 when he started to wrestle for the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Wrestling_Federation_6d2e.html" title="Global Wrestling Federation">Global Wrestling Federation</a> during it’s last days of existence. Reed became the second to last <a href="../../../u/s/w/USWA_Unified_World_Heavyweight_Championship_a7e5.html" title="USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship">GWF North American champion</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> when he beat Rod Price for the held up title. The title had been held up the previous day after a match between Reed and Price got out of hand and ended inconclusively. Reed held the title for almost a month before losing it to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Adams_5947.html" title="Christopher Adams">”Gentleman” Chris Adams</a> who would be the last GWF North American champion.</p>
<p>Reed continued to work on the independent scene on a part time basis so that he could participate in the <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo.html" title="Rodeo">rodeo</a> circuit in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a>. When Ron Simmons formed the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Domination_04af.html" title="Nation of Domination">Nation of Domination</a> in the WWF the rumour was that Butch Reed would be one of the members, but nothing ever came of these rumors. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Butch Reed started working for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Race_0005.html" title="Harley Race">Harley Race</a>'s WLW promotion. Reed beat “Luminous Warrior” for the WLW Heavyweight Title on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> and held the title until Dennis McHawes beat him for it on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. After losing the title Butch Reed retired from wrestling.</p>
<p>After being retired for about three years Butch Reed decided to return to the squared circle in 2005, appearing several times for “Mid States Wrestling”. He also participated in the “Legends of Wrestling” tour in 2006 and remains at least semi-active to this day.</p>
