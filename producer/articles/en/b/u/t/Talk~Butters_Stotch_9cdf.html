<p>I didn't watch the entire episode, but it appeared as though Butters lost an eye in the first episode of the 8th season. Is that correct? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 00:33, Mar 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, yes, shurikens are tough on eyes, but that doesn't mean he won't have two eyes in the second episode. Kenny's still not all that dead.... (Did you miss Cartman's penis?) -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:36, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps that "he was blinded in his left eye by Kenny's shuriken" part should be deleted as he wasn't blinded after all?
<ul>
<li>He got hit in the eye, but in the end he gets it bandanged up and it eventually heals. As for Cartmans penis, he shows it after he walks on stage naked. He does this because he belives he can turn invisible when he is in ninja mode so he takes off all his clothes and tries to sneak across a stage. Halfway through they all see him and he realizes he isn't really invisible. At the town meeting they all act as if it was just liek Janet Jacksons "Wardrobe Malfunction."</li>

<p>Is there any real reason to have this article at "Butters (South Park)"? I thought the convention was to have the article at the simplest title possible, and I don't see any reason to add "(South Park)" to this article's title, since this character is the only Butters. Personally, I think the article should be at "<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butters_Stotch_fd5e.html" title="Butters Stotch">Butters Stotch</a>", following the format of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Cartman_34c6.html" title="Eric Cartman">Eric Cartman</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Marsh_013f.html" title="Stan Marsh">Stan Marsh</a>... <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELachatdelarue_f99b.html" title="User:Lachatdelarue">Lachatdelarue</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELachatdelarue_dc2e.html" title="User talk:Lachatdelarue">(talk)</a> 01:55, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, articles should be at the simplest name, but <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butters.html" title="Butters">butters</a> should logically redirect to <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter.html" title="Butter">butter</a> rather than being about a fictional character. -03:06, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thats extremely interesting you recognized that, and after reading that article Butters does exhibit a few of the symptoms, but also lacks a couple of really important characteristics to be diagnosed. Primarily he does not exhibit "Mind-blindness" and is not "rude" as it seems most people Aspergers seem to exhibit. He also does not seem clumsy, on the contrary he is one of the best tap dancers in the country, a skill that requires great motor skills. I am no expert though so I could be wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>He does exhibit the sort of logical thought process described and has obsessive repetitve habits like wring/kneeding his hands together.</p>

<p>I don't think they're overprotective. They're strict, but they always blame him for everything when the chance arises. In the episode with the chinese wall around the city, they don't recognize him on first sight. It seems more like they use him to satisfy their sadistic urges.</p>
<ul>
<li>South Park is full of lousy parents, but I really think the Stotches take the cake. How about the time they kept accusing him of making faces when he was just being normal?

<p>The most recent Butter-centered episode is "Marjorine",in which Butters is dressed up as a girl and goes to a girls party to find out more about their forunte telling device. His suicide is faked, leaving his parents distraught. Thier psycotic side comes out yet again when they practice pagan rituals, and then proced to chain up their son on return and feed him a dead body.</p>

on the issue of PC the article currenty states that it is based upon Dr Doom. i personally think the style of the costume especially the helmet is more remanicent of the marvel supervillan Magneto. is there some original source that states the creater was inspired by Doom or should i go ahead and make note that magneto may also be a source of inspiration?--Dr noire 16:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I might be wrong, I'm not really addicted to South Park, but I think he goes to a Festival where he shows off his dance skills while singing "Loo, loo, loo" in the episode "Erection Day". This is not listed in the main page.</p>

<p>I think that its needless. Butters is a main character now, so pretty much all recent episodes are ones where he "plays an important part". A simple line indicating this, instead of a list is needed instead. -~~</p>

<p>It says at that "Butters received annilingus from his uncle" at the bottom of the page. Is this really appropriate? I mean, I'm not doubting this happened (I saw that episode), but at the very least, shouldn't it be reworded? The statement itself implies that Butters, as a minor, wanted it.</p>

<p>"Butters places second only to Cartman as the most popular character on South Park" Where is that coming from? I doubt there's any real way to validate this statement so it should probably be removed. <a href="../../../t/w/e/User%7ETweeks_Coffee_b282.html" title="User:Tweeks Coffee">Tweeks Coffee</a> 14:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>IN Cartman Sucks he said that he was bi curious</p>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly without understanding that word, though. He's deferring the priest, his father, and the counselors at the church camp, all authority figures who label him that way by mistake.</dd>

<dd>Butters clearly has no idea what "bi-curious" means. And when he is told he is confused because he is bi-curious, he is literally cofused "what the heck are they talking about". This was the entire gag behind the Butters plotline in this episode, the hes realyl straight but is convinced by others he is bi-curious and does not even know what that means. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Thrawny (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thrawny_ef1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thrawny">contribs</a>) 16:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>In the first paragraph, the source for Butters' birthday is referenced to another Wikipedia article. I'm not entirely sure about the WP etiquette on this is, so I'm bringing it up here, but it seems very unlikely that it is within wikipedian guidelines to reference another wikipedia article as a source. It would make sense to me to ammend the sentence to read "His birthday is <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, as revealed in episode "<a href="../../../a/w/e/AWESOM-O_95b9.html" title="AWESOM-O">AWESOM-O</a>." <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeopold_Stotch_e88f.html" title="User:Leopold Stotch">Leopold Stotch</a> 20:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
