<dd>All I know is this: At least since I was in secondary school, it has been <i>in</i> to be a "lesbian". In my Highschool, at least 1/3rd of the girls claimed to be lesbians, but hardly any did anything beyond kissing in front of the boys to get them excited.

<p>The word "fem" is usually used for men and "femme" for women. The phrase "fem men" returns 28,300 results on Google, "femme men" returns 1,870. "Fem man" returns 15,800 and "femme man" returns 992 (most of which seem unrelated).

<dd>As I recall, google would include the results for "femme" as well as those for "fem" in your search, because everytime you use the letters f-e-m-m-e connected to each other, you're also spelling out f-e-m. So, those results would be invalid.

<p>My view is that transwomen and transmen are generally self-identified labels whereas transgendered fe/male also describes those that don't necessarily identify with the gender they choose to present. Of course, the usage of any labels or descriptions within a genderqueer context is fraught with opportunity to offend, even for those of us on the inside. Personally, I prefer "person of gender". <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFanx_30a1.html" title="User:Fanx">Fanx</a> 16:42, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see it precisly the other way around - transgender is one of many possible self-identifications, and so are male and female. Transman and transwoman have been coined to replace the old male-to-female and female-to-male; so many people protested against the first part that new words seemed to be in order. Hence transman and transwoman are less problematic than those, especially since they also avoid the war about transsexual vs. transgender vs. transvestite vs. whatever. They are not perfect, but they are an improvement. If, on the other hand, you start defining many transsexual-identitfied woman as transgender, you are bound to get an edit war.</dd>
<dd>And I don't quite understand your definition - transgender people are people who don't identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, but why should they not identify with the gender they choose to present? The whole point of transitioning is to be able to present as a gender one can identify with - or that is at least closer to the one a person identifies with. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case we are not talking about persons that identify as female or are transitioning, what we are talking about is men who have sex with persons they identify as being male but presenting a female appearance in order to deny their own same-gender sexual activity as being homosexual. A transgendered person does not necessarily have to identify as being of the gender they are presenting - there are plenty of drag queens, (self-identified) she-males and en-femme transvestites that that do not consider themselves as female even if they are engaging in sexual activities with self-identified heterosexual males. As transgender(ed) female also means presenting a female external identity regardless of the internal (male or female) identity I feel my definition is more correct than yours. You are wrong in presuming that I am about to start defining any transsexual-identitfied woman as transgender - quite the opposite, and having read your userpage and some of your edits I would have thought we were broadly in agreement that transgender doesn't necessarily mean transsexual. Given that this article is about butch and femme identities I do not propose to enter into any edit war over a definition that is best left to the appropriate <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">Transgender</a> pages. Of course my reference to preferring the definition "person of gender" should in no way be taken seriously as it is no more than a parody of a couple of well-known euphemisms. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFanx_30a1.html" title="User:Fanx">Fanx</a> 14:59, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm ... well, if those male-bodied people do not identify as female (or at least as not-male) then they are not transgender, either. At least according to every definition I have come accross so far. Now, as for "presenting a female appearance in order to deny their own same-gender sexual activity as being homosexual", that is a very tricky one. Because, you know, there are an awful lot of transpeople who use a claim like this to deny their transgender feelings. Of course, people you describe exist as well. Making it extremely tricky to firmly put people showing that behaviour into one one category or the other. Besides, if they also have relationships to women, they are not homosexual anyway, they would be bisexual. And there are certainly enough men who have sex with other men who otherwise identify as straight without presenting as or identifying as female or not-male. One can of course say that is kind of missing the point - or one can questiont the identity politics behind trying to fit people into neat hetero-, homo- and bisexual boxes. Either way it is problematic to slap them with a label they neither necessarily fit nor self-identify with. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 17:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Transgender is a broad category. It does include people who do not have any intention to transition to a different gender but they do not identify with their current gender assignment. I typically hear transgender used more within the butch-femme community, mostly comprised of born biologically female individuals. You have transgender butches who are still female but do not identify as woman. Judith Halberstam has a good definition in her book <i>Female Masculinity</i> (1998) (quoted under fair use clause from wikipedia): "Transgender describes a gender identity that is at least partially defined by transitivity but that may well stop short of transsexual surgery" (p. 161). Please delete the quoted material if it falls outside of fair use.--Mic 05:44, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not only do I see no reason at all to link that page -- Wikipedia is not a link repository -- I was very close to remove even this comment from this talk page. This is so unashamed advertising, that it makes me wonder whether you have even the faintest idea where you are. Unless a site has <i>lots</i> of information on a topic not present already on a linked page -- and a site that advertises itself as dating site has most probably not -- it does not belong in the Wikipedia. Which, just so that there is no misunderstanding, does mean I have anything against that site, if I currently had a page where it is appropriate I would link there -- only, as I said, not here. Unless there is a really good reason. And then you can do it yourself. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 15:49, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
