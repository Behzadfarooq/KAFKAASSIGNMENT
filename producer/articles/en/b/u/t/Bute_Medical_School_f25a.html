<p>From the 17th to the 19th centuries, medical degrees from St Andrews were awarded by an early version of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance_learning.html" title="Distance learning">distance learning</a>. The university awarded the degree of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine">MD</a> to individuals who were usually already established in medical practice, the first being conferred in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1696.html" title="1696">1696</a>. This degree was awarded on the basis of a testimonial written by a supervisor, and a fee was paid to the university. The whole process was conducted through the post, and the candidate did not have to visit the university. Recipients of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine">MD</a> at this time include the infamous French Revolutionary, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Marat_dd83.html" title="Jean-Paul Marat">Jean-Paul Marat</a> (1743 – 1793), who obtained his MD in 1775 for an essay on gonorrhea, and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Jenner_379d.html" title="Edward Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> (1749 - 1823), who developed the first <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox_vaccine.html" title="Smallpox vaccine">smallpox vaccine</a>, and was awarded the MD in 1792.</p>

<p>In 1898, the University of St Andrews merged with the, then newly established, University College Dundee. Together, the Bute Medical School and clinical facilities at University College Dundee formed a conjoint medical school. Medical students could undertake their pre-clinical teaching at the Bute Medical School in St Andrews and then complete clinical training in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>, across the <a href="../../../t/a/y/Tay_Railway_Bridge_d155.html" title="Tay Railway Bridge">Tay Railway Bridge</a>. Students were awarded the degree of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Medicine_and_Surgery_8f82.html" title="Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery">MB ChB</a> by the University of St Andrews.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, University College changed its name to Queen's College, but remained part of the University of St Andrews.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, following recommendations by the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbins_Report_7ca1.html" title="Robbins Report">Robbins Report</a>, the <i>Universities (Scotland) Act 1966</i> came into force. This granted independent university status to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dundee_7d13.html" title="University of Dundee">University of Dundee</a>, separating Queen's College from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a>. In many respects, the medical school at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dundee_7d13.html" title="University of Dundee">University of Dundee</a> inherited the medical traditions of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Andrews_University_0043.html" title="St Andrews University">St Andrews University</a>.</p>
<p>As the clinical medical school (along with other parts of the University of St Andrews including the Law faculty) had been based in Dundee, this left <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">St Andrews</a> with no clinical medical school or teaching hospital. The <i>Universities (Scotland) Act 1966</i> also removed the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a>'s right to award undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in medicine, including the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Medicine_and_Surgery_8f82.html" title="Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery">MB ChB</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine">MD</a>.</p>

<p>In order to continue to be able to teach medicine, St Andrews therefore established a new link with the English <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manchester_aff5.html" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> which was at that time seeking to enlarge its medical school. Students completed a three-year BSc in medical science at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">St Andrews</a>, and could optionally complete an extra intercalated year for the award of BSc Hons at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">St Andrews</a>, before completing their clinical training at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manchester_aff5.html" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, with the final <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelors_of_Medicine_and_Surgery_30c1.html" title="Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery">MB ChB</a> awarded by <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Manchester_aff5.html" title="University of Manchester">Manchester</a>. This arrangement has been under threat many times over the years.</p>
<p>Since 2002, there has also been the option of completing clinical training at <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keele_University_Medical_School_d42a.html" title="Keele University Medical School">Keele University Medical School</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoke-on-Trent_bd53.html" title="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, and around twenty St Andrews graduates each year between 2002-2006 have gone to <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keele_University_dd1e.html" title="Keele University">Keele University</a>.</p>

<p>Major changes to the curriculum were made in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> with increased emphasis on psychology and cellular biology in the course.</p>
<p>in 2002 the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> passed the <i>University of St Andrews (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Act 2002</i> which re-instated the university's right to award the postgraduate research degree of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine"><i>Medicinae Doctor</i> (MD)</a> to students who have completed two years of full-time or up to 5 years of part-time research, which had been removed by the <i>Universities (Scotland) Act 1966</i>. The first MD since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> was awarded in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Calman_59c4.html" title="Kenneth Calman">Prof. Sir Kenneth Calman</a>'s report into medical education recommended that medical graduates from St Andrews should remain in Scotland to complete their clinical medical education, and arising out of this, discussions about a link with <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Edinburgh_53c2.html" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> have taken place. Students are likely to stay in Scotland to complete clinical training in the future.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Bute_Medical_School_f25a.html" title="Edit section: A new style of teaching">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A new style of teaching</span></h2>
<p>Since September 2005, the Bute Medical School has offered a Bachelor of Science with honours in Medical Science (BSc Hons Med Sci). The new curricula allow for an honours degree to be attained after three years' study.</p>
<p>A further three years' study is required to receive a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB, ChB), and requires training at a university that supports a clinical course. The course therefore takes an extra year in comparison to other Scottish universities.</p>
<p>Teaching methods include lectures and practical classes, utilising self-directed learning and problem-based learning. Examination methods include multiple-choice questions, short answers, and essays in written exams and OSPEs (Objective Structured Practical Exam).</p>

<p><i>Main Article: <a href="../../../b/u/t/Bute_Medical_Society_b3d0.html" title="Bute Medical Society">Bute Medical Society</a></i> The notorious Bute Medical Society has a long and prestigious history. It was formed in 1915 by six bejants and bejantines, with the aim of providing clinical lectures in an otherwise non-clinical course, which it still does today with bi-monthly 'Cheese and Wines'. It has many proud and long standing traditions such as <i>the Hecklings</i> as well as organising a variety of social events including the Bute Ball, a charity pub crawl, sports events and the hilarious <i>Bute Revue</i>.</p>
