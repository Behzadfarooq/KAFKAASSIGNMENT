<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_mashing.html" title="Edit section: Athletic games">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Athletic games</span></h2>
<p>In athletic games, button mashing is the usual way of making the athlete run or set strength. Over time, different ways of achieving this result have been tried: <a href="../../../e/p/y/Epyx.html" title="Epyx">Epyx</a> relied on moving the directional pad left and right (this practice is commonly called <i>joystick wobbling</i>) and occasionally on 360° turns, <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accolade_%28company%29.html" title="Accolade (company)">Accolade</a>'s <i>Challenge</i> games used only one button, while other companies (such as <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Gold_1375.html" title="U.S. Gold">U.S. Gold</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention_To_Detail_d80f.html" title="Attention To Detail">ATD</a>) use two buttons. In <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_videogames.html" title="Olympic videogames">Olympic video games</a> based on the Summer Games, usually only technical events (diving and gymnastics), archery, shooting and others that in reality rely more on skill than on physical strength are free from button mashing. In games based on Winter events, button mashing usage decreases greatly, since those events are either aerobic (such as cross country) or Alpine skiing, button mashing is reserved for starts (bobsled and luge) or in speed skating.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_mashing.html" title="Edit section: Fighting games">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fighting games</span></h2>
<p>In fighting games, mashing is usually a desperation tactic rather than an actual skill. Less experienced players will button mash in an attempt to do moves that require a complex series of button presses. In some games, such moves often require combining over 10 button presses in under 3 seconds. Others, like many games based on the <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_86ec.html" title="Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball</a></i> franchise, require the player to mash the button to win a "power wave" move (such as a <i>Kamehameha</i>). In games involving swords, like <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushido_Blade_%28video_game%29_d397.html" title="Bushido Blade (video game)">Bushido Blade</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai_Showdown_8de1.html" title="Samurai Showdown">Samurai Showdown</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../j/e/d/Star_Wars%7E_Jedi_Knight_II%7E_Jedi_Outcast_a215.html" title="Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast">Jedi Outcast</a></i>, in order to break a sword lock, the player has to press one button repeatedly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_mashing.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes, button mashing can prove to defeat a skilled strategy through random chance on singular occasions. This is often frustrating for skilled players, who have merely the opportunity for a rematch at their disposal.</p>
<p>There are many games that greatly reward the player for punching, kicking, or shooting a gun as fast as possible, which must be achieved through button-mashing.</p>
<p>In order to reduce wear on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_controller.html" title="Game controller">controllers</a> and allow players to gain the advantages of button mashing without having to actually mash the buttons, some game controllers feature a turbo button. This easily allows the player to maximize performance in games where a single button must be pressed repeatedly, but gives no advantage in fighting games or when two buttons must be pressed repeatedly one after the other.</p>
<p>Some games (like <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_Solid_5e39.html" title="Metal Gear Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a></i> during the torture sequence) attempt to detect turbo buttons and end the game if they receive an unreasonable number of button pushes in a short time or a pattern that is too regular. In response, newer game controllers with turbo buttons feature a lower hit frequency, closer to "human" values, but still high enough to allow passing even the most difficult sequences. Most modern game devices for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">PCs</a> have drivers and applications that allow the same, and can record complex button sequences for fighting games.</p>
<p>Modern game designers recognize that many players do not enjoy hours of button mashing to complete games. The designers often incorporate auto-fire features or power-ups that alleviate button mashing requirements in their games. Button mashing is still used in gameplay, but sparingly during climactic points, such as a tight grapple with an enemy or breaking free from a confining attack.</p>
<p>"Button Masher" may be used as a deragatory term for a game that purports to require a high level of skill to complete but can be easily conquered by "button mashing".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Button_mashing.html" title="Edit section: History and examples">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History and examples</span></h2>
<p>Button mashing was first popularized by <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_%26_Field_%28video_game%29_d6d2.html" title="Track &amp; Field (video game)">Track &amp; Field</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Daley_Thompson_05cb.html" title="Daley Thompson">Daley Thompson</a> Decathlon</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>) used mouse clicks and holds, but the formula proved to be only effective or rewarding while playing in a working environment, as it can be perceived as working from distance.</p>
<p>Probably the most recent button mashing sequence in a console game is <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Warriors_%28video_game%29_c3e4.html" title="The Warriors (video game)">The Warriors</a></i> produced by <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockstar_Games_0326.html" title="Rockstar Games">Rockstar Games</a> (which is based on the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">movie</a> of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Warriors_dd79.html" title="The Warriors">same name</a>), where one can increase one's fighting stamina by performing basic gym exercise.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddy_Gordo_1087.html" title="Eddy Gordo">Eddy Gordo</a>, a character in Namco's <i><a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_%28series%29.html" title="Tekken (series)">Tekken</a></i> series, has been criticized in the past for his useful, low hitting capoeira attacks. Some fans complained that he was cheap, as mashing the two kick buttons could actually lead to a reasonably powerful string of attacks. This has been toned down somewhat in more recent games.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VIII_4d12.html" title="Final Fantasy VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></i>, the strength of Guardian Forces can be increased by repeatedly pressing the square button during the sequence showing the GF powering up. Although if square is pressed during certain intervals, the GF’s power is set back to the lowest level, causing the player to boost from scratch.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/p/Capcom.html" title="Capcom">Capcom's</a> <i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_4_0efe.html" title="Resident Evil 4">Resident Evil 4</a></i> featured several sequences of button mashing incorporated in the gameplay.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../g/o/d/God_of_War_c88a.html" title="God of War">God of War</a></i> used several instances of this, such as when trying to finish off the 1st boss, the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydra.html" title="Hydra">Hydra</a>, and dealing with the various minotaurs throughout the game.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, there has been something of a resurgence of games relying extensively on button mashing, two examples being <i>Fahrenheit</i> (<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> in the US) and <i><a href="../../../l/e/i/Leisure_Suit_Larry_07c1.html" title="Leisure Suit Larry">Leisure Suit Larry 8: Magna Cum Laude</a></i>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Rush_5781.html" title="Sonic Rush">Sonic Rush</a></i> for the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_DS_b235.html" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a> features a boss (the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28character%29_deef.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">Sonic</a> vs. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaze_the_Cat_8c83.html" title="Blaze the Cat">Blaze</a> fight) which has an intense button mashing finale. This intense mashing of the A and B button causes actual pain<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and many gamers have had to pause during the button mashing part to let their hands recover. What's more, before this boss, there is another boss requiring you to button mash to avoid being blown off the battle platform by a pair of huge <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan.html" title="Fan">fans</a>. <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Riders_aaca.html" title="Sonic Riders">Sonic Riders</a></i> requires lots of control stick rotation, which is similar to the Mario Party series (see below).</p>
<p>Many of the minigames in the <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_series_cf8a.html" title="Mario Party series">Mario Party</a></i> series utilize button mashing of some sort, usually in a competitive setting (i.e. the person who can mash the most before time runs out, or who can hit a button multiple times the fastest, will win the minigame). In the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_69c6.html" title="Mario Party">first game</a>, there were also some minigames that required to rotate the analog stick very fast in order to win. This forced gamers to rotate with their palm, causing severe damage to the stick and themselves. As a result, the stick rotation games were discontinued immediately; there were none in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_2_257b.html" title="Mario Party 2">Mario Party 2</a></i> or any subsequent game in the series (though, it might no longer be a problem, as the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_GameCube_cf58.html" title="Nintendo GameCube">Nintendo GameCube's</a> control stick is more comfortable than the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_64.html" title="Nintendo 64">Nintendo 64's</a> stick). There are also many microgames in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/WarioWare_f638.html" title="WarioWare">WarioWare</a></i> series which require the player to mash buttons in order to clear said microgames.</p>
