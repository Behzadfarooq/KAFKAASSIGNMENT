	    <p><b>Butwal</b> is a large town in southern <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, approximately 240 kilometres west of the Nepalese capital <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathmandu.html" title="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a> and 22 kilometers from district headquarter <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhairahawa.html" title="Bhairahawa">Bhairahawa</a>. Its population in 2001 was 75,384.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lying at the very foot of Chure Pahad (Fragile Hills), Butwal is famous not only from cultural, business and nature viewpoints, but also for its strategic geographical position. This is where the hills meet the plains: the Mahabharat Hills are just a few kilometers away and the Indogangetic plains start from Butwal. The Tinau (Tilottama) River flows between the starting point of two chure ranges; one goes east and the other goes west.</p>
<p>Butwal is the main gateway to western Nepal because it is the intersection of north-south and east-west highways. Since archaeologist Dr. Munthe and a group of American archaeologists excavated 10.1 million year old teeth of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramapithecus.html" title="Ramapithecus">Ramapithecus</a>, a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate.html" title="Primate">primate</a> closely related to humans, on the bank of the Tinau River, Butwal has also been proved to be a significant site for the study of prehistoric ages.</p>
<p>Before the highways, Butwal was a trade centre and gateway to the western hills. It is suggested that the first of the Shah Kings who fled from South India went to Ridi by way of Butwal. It was and continues to be a trade route for the western hilly region of Nepal.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butwal.html" title="Edit section: Phulbari (Manimukunda Park)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Phulbari (Manimukunda Park)</span></h2>
<p>Phulbari, the palace of Palpali Sen clan for the winter season, is known for its natural and archaeological values. There are ruins and antiquities of the majestic palace of Manimukunda Sen, an ancient Palpali King, containing 6 large rooms as well as the royal residence. The fascinating scenic grandeur of Butwal, Siddharthanagar and other neighbouring villages of Rupandehi district can be vividly seen from here at night also. Nepal Government, archaeological department, attempted to maintain it in 1991. Now Butwal municipality has formed a council for the conservation of Manimukunda Sen Park to conduct the Phulbari Development Programme and has attempted to make it a tourist resort.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butwal.html" title="Edit section: Jitgadhi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jitgadhi</span></h2>
<p>Jitgadhi, a fortress during Angol Nepal war, Narayan temple built by (1864 B.S.) Hanuman temple and Shivalaya of Hanumagngadhi, Jalabinayak Mehadev temple, Siddababa temple, Nuwakot etc. are famous centres of attraction in Butwal. Jitgadhi, means victory fortress. It was here the Nepali troops defeated East Indian troops under Major-General Woods. They say Nepalis beat them twice. It is believed that there used to tunnels running from Jitgadhi, all the way up to Nuwakot fort.</p>
<p>It is believed Butwal got its name during the Anglo-Nepal war. When the East Indian troops came to Butwal, they were taken aback by the rocks and cliffs in that area. The commanding officer told his troops not be afraid, as he said "It's nothing BUT WALL."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/t/Butwal.html" title="Edit section: Siddhababa Temple">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Siddhababa Temple</span></h2>
<p>Siddhababa Temple lies 3 kilometers north of Butwal on the way to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokhara.html" title="Pokhara">Pokhara</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpa_district.html" title="Palpa district">Palpa district</a>. It is perhaps the most sacred temple in the vicinity of Butwal and Palpa. It lies near "Kuire Bhir" (meaning foggy cliff). <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Lord Shiva</a> is worshipped in this temple. No one exactly knows who Siddhababa was, but, whoever he was, he was a follower of Lord Shiva and had attained "<a href="../../../s/i/d/Siddhi.html" title="Siddhi">Siddhi</a>".</p>
<p>Legend has it that the temple used to be a few hundred metres from where it is now. When they decided to build a highway to link Sunauli and Pokhara, the engineers decided to take the highway through Kuire Bhir, which was deemed sacred. Furthermore, a hermit had challenged the engineer that he would not be able to construct the highway in that sacred terrain. They could never construct the road on that stretch until they shifted the temple of Siddhababa from near the large waterfall to where it is now. Even today the 1 km stretch of Kuire Bhir is supposed to be the most dangerous road in all of Nepal with numerous deaths each year mostly due to boulders falling down from Kuire Bhir. A few years ago, a massive rock came down and crushed a passenger bus killing everyone aboard. Most passengers pray to Siddhababa while crossing this stretch of Kuire Bhir.</p>
