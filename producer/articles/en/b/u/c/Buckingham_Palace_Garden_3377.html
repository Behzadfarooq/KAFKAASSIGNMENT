</div>
</div>
<p><b>Buckingham Palace Garden</b> or, to give it its full title, "The Garden at Buckingham Palace", is generally referred to as <i>the Garden</i>. Situated at the rear of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, it covers much of the area of the former "Goring Great Garden", named after Lord Goring, occupant of one of the earliest grand houses on the site. It was laid out by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wise_dd04.html" title="Henry Wise">Henry Wise</a> and subsequently redesigned by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Townsend_Aiton_a85e.html" title="William Townsend Aiton">William Townsend Aiton</a> for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_IV_aba2.html" title="George IV">George IV</a>.</p>
<p>The Garden occupies a 42&#160;-<a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">acre</a> (17&#160;-<a href="../../../h/e/c/Hectare.html" title="Hectare">hectare</a>) site in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Westminster_d04f.html" title="City of Westminster">City of Westminster</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and has two-and-a-half miles of gravel paths. Its area is bounded by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Hill%2C_London_fe6a.html" title="Constitution Hill, London">Constitution Hill</a> to the north, <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park_Corner_02e0.html" title="Hyde Park Corner">Hyde Park Corner</a> to the west, Grosvenor Place to the south-west and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Mews_2862.html" title="Royal Mews">Royal Mews</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Gallery_2066.html" title="Queen's Gallery">Queen's Gallery</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to the south and east. The planting is varied and exotic, with a mulberry tree dating back to the time of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I of England</a></p>
<p>Notable features include a large 19th-century lake which is graced by a flock of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flamingo.html" title="Flamingo">flamingoes</a>, and the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo_Vase_46a8.html" title="Waterloo Vase">Waterloo Vase</a>. In the Gardens there is a summerhouse, a helicopter pad, and a tennis court.</p>
<p>Unlike the nearby <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Parks_of_London_15ef.html" title="Royal Parks of London">Royal Parks of London</a>, Buckingham Palace Garden is not usually open to the public. However when <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> is open during August and September, visitors have access to part of the Garden, which forms the exit from the Palace at the end of the tour. (A large gift shop in a marquee is erected along the path at that time.)</p>
<p>The Garden is where <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">the Queen</a>'s <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_party.html" title="Garden party">garden parties</a> are held. In June 2002 she invited the public into the Garden for entertainment for the first time during her reign. As part of her <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Jubilee_Weekend_048d.html" title="Golden Jubilee Weekend">Golden Jubilee Weekend</a> thousands of Britons were invited to apply for tickets to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_at_the_Palace_66ca.html" title="Party at the Palace">Party at the Palace</a> where the guitarist <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_May_ae5a.html" title="Brian May">Brian May</a> of the band <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> performed his <i><a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_The_Queen_4d28.html" title="God Save The Queen">God Save The Queen</a></i> guitar solo on top of Buckingham Palace. This concert was preceded the previous evening by a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prom_at_the_Palace_274e.html" title="Prom at the Palace">Prom at the Palace</a>. During the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations in 2006 the Garden was the scene of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Party_at_the_Palace_b3c0.html" title="Children's Party at the Palace">Children's Party at the Palace</a> for an audience of 2,000 children.</p>

<p>The landscape design was by <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capability_Brown_5ff2.html" title="Capability Brown">Capability Brown</a> but the Garden was redesigned at the time of the palace rebuilding by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Townsend_Aiton_a85e.html" title="William Townsend Aiton">William Townsend Aiton</a> of <a href="../../../k/e/w/Kew_Gardens_dbf0.html" title="Kew Gardens">Kew Gardens</a> and John Nash. The great manmade lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water by the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpentine_Lake_22e2.html" title="Serpentine Lake">Serpentine Lake</a> in <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park%2C_London_cc60.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>.</p>
<p>According to Palace tour guides, the Garden is maintained by approximately eight fulltime gardeners, with two or three part-timers. The trees include <a href="../../../s/y/c/Sycamore_maple.html" title="Sycamore maple">plane</a>, Indian chestnut, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_maple.html" title="Silver maple">silver maple</a>, and a <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp_cypress.html" title="Swamp cypress">swamp cypress</a>. In the south-west corner, there is a single surviving <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulberry_tree.html" title="Mulberry tree">mulberry tree</a> from the plantation installed by King <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I of England</a> when he unsuccessfully attempted to breed <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silkworm.html" title="Silkworm">silkworms</a> in the Mulberry Garden on the <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> site. (This was not the site of today's Garden; it was located closer to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Park_46b1.html" title="Green Park">Green Park</a>.)</p>
<p>Like the palace, the Garden is rich in works of art. One of the most notable is the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo_Vase_46a8.html" title="Waterloo Vase">Waterloo Vase</a>, the great urn commissioned by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> to commemorate his expected victories, which in 1815 was presented unfinished to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_62b2.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">the Prince Regent</a>. After the king had had the base completed by sculptor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Westmacott_2bfc.html" title="Richard Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a>, intending it to be the focal point of the new Waterloo chamber at Windsor Castle, it was adjudged to be too heavy for any floor (at 15ft high and weighing 15 tons). The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Gallery%2C_London_89f8.html" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a>, to whom it was presented, finally returned it in 1906 to the sovereign, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a>. King Edward then solved the problem by placing the vase outside in the Garden where it now remains.</p>
<p>Also in the Garden is a small summerhouse attributed to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Kent_9c49.html" title="William Kent">William Kent</a> (circa 1740), a helicopter launching pad, and a tennis court where <a href="../../../b/j/%C3%B6/Bj%C3%B6rn_Borg_3b7a.html" title="Björn Borg">Björn Borg</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McEnroe_e772.html" title="John McEnroe">John McEnroe</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steffi_Graf_6fce.html" title="Steffi Graf">Steffi Graf</a> have played.</p>
<p>The Garden is regularly surveyed for their <a href="../../../m/o/t/Moth.html" title="Moth">moths</a> and occasionally visited by the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_Upping_408d.html" title="Swan Upping">Queen's Swans</a>.</p>

<p>Since the millennium the Garden has become a focal point for national celebration, with the public invited in for the first time during the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II_32e1.html" title="Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II">Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II</a>. The Queen hosted two exceptional events, a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prom_at_the_Palace_274e.html" title="Prom at the Palace">Prom at the Palace</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_at_the_Palace_66ca.html" title="Party at the Palace">Party at the Palace</a> on 1 and 3 June 2002 respectively. The Garden was transformed into a huge outdoor theatre to accommodate the all-star casts. Joining the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Family_5f5c.html" title="Royal Family">Royal Family</a> were thousands of guests on the lawn, tens of thousands on the streets and in <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Parks_e98d.html" title="Royal Parks">Royal Parks</a>. The audience was vastly extended through live BBC transmission. On 25 June 2006, as part of the Queen's 80th Birthday celebrations, there was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Party_at_the_Palace_b3c0.html" title="Children's Party at the Palace">Children's Party at the Palace</a> starring popular British actors and celebrating literacy, drama, and imagination.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace Garden was one of three royal sites excavated over four days (25-28 August 2006) by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Team_bfdc.html" title="Time Team">Time Team</a> of archaeologists led by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Robinson_f690.html" title="Tony Robinson">Tony Robinson</a>. The results were televised, with some live streaming.</p>
<p>Timed to help celebrate the 80th birthday of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> (along with many other events ongoing throughout 2006), this marked Time Team's 150th dig. For the first time, the Queen gave permission for trenches to be dug in the grounds of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Holyroodhouse_f14f.html" title="Palace of Holyroodhouse">Palace of Holyroodhouse</a>, Edinburgh. The Big Royal Dig is an example of the Queen opening up her homes for greater access to the public, as she did during her <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Jubilee_Weekend_048d.html" title="Golden Jubilee Weekend">Golden Jubilee Weekend</a> in 2002 and throughout 2006 for her birthday.</p>
<p>The archaeologists had an unprecedented opportunity to probe the geophysics and history of three royal residences over a four-day period, with teams working concurrently in the three locations.</p>
<p>Once trenches were opened in the Garden, the team managed to uncover the original <a href="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_14_buck_maps3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_14_buck_maps3.html" rel="nofollow">ornamental canal</a> constructed by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wise_dd04.html" title="Henry Wise">Henry Wise</a> which ran westwards from the West Front of Buckingham House, built in 1703. A surviving contemporary letter from the Duke of Buckingham to the Duke of Shrewsbury was instrumental in determining the canal's dimensions and thus the site for excavation. This <a href="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_13_buck_maps3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_13_buck_maps3.html" rel="nofollow">graphic reconstruction</a> attempts to digitally reproduce Buckingham House, built by the Duke of Buckingham in 1703. (The view is from the Garden side towards the West Front, i.e. looking at the rear of today's Palace).</p>
<p>Tony Robinson hoped to unearth evidence of Parliamentarian fortifications and a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redoubt.html" title="Redoubt">redoubt</a> from the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">Civil War (1642-1651)</a> in the Garden.

During the Civil War, Goring Great Garden, as the Garden was then known, had been the scene of defensive Parliamentarian earthworks - a situation whose irony Robinson savoured, given the current Royal ownership. Anticipating some richly embarrassing finds, the television coverage featured a reenactment of a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundhead.html" title="Roundhead">Roundhead</a> (i.e., Republican) march on the Garden lawn.</p>
<p>In the event, no trace of Civil War Parliamentarian defenses was found.
