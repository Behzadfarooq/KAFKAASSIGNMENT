<p>The history of the group stretches all the way back to 1923. On 24 March of that year, the Army authorized the unit on the inactive list as the <b>8th Pursuit Group</b>. For the next eight years, however, the group consisted only of a name on the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Service_fc94.html" title="U.S. Army Air Service">Air Service's</a> and the the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Corps_56f8.html" title="U.S. Army Air Corps">Army Air Corps'</a> list of units available for activation, with no personnel assigned. Activation of the group finally came on 1 April 1931 at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langley_Air_Force_Base_ec9b.html" title="Langley Air Force Base">Langley Field</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>. Initially, the group had two flying squadrons assigned, but both operated from other bases. The 36th Pursuit Squadron flew from <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfridge_Air_Force_Base_afaf.html" title="Selfridge Air Force Base">Selfridge Field</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, while the 55th Pursuit Squadron operated from <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mather_Air_Force_Base_cbec.html" title="Mather Air Force Base">Mather Field</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. In June 1932 the group reorganized. It gained the 33rd and 35th Pursuit Squadrons, activated at Langley, while the 36th PS moved from Selfridge to Langley to join the rest of the group. At the same time, the 55th PS transferred to the 20th Pursuit Group, leaving the 8th with three squadrons.</p>
<p>At Langley the group trained in such aircraft as the PB-2A, P-6, and P-12. Over the next several years, the group transitioned to such newer aircraft as the P-35, P-36, P-39, and P-40. Significantly, on 11 October 1940, the 8th Pursuit Group participated in a test designed to compare the take-off runs of standard Navy and Army aircraft. On that day, 24 P-40s from the 8th Pursuit Group launched from the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Wasp_%28CV-7%29_04b3.html" title="USS Wasp (CV-7)">USS Wasp</a>, an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a>, and returned to Langley Field. That experiment, the first time that Army planes had flown from a Navy carrier, foreshadowed the use of the ship in the ferry role that it performed admirably in World War II.</p>
<p>In November 1940, the 8th Pursuit Group moved to <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchel_Field_4473.html" title="Mitchel Field">Mitchel Field</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, where it became responsible for the air defense of New York City. The 33rd Pursuit Squadron transferred to another unit in Iceland in August 1941, leaving the group with two flying squadrons, the 35th and 36th.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckboard1_drafts_1805.html" title="Edit section: 8th Fighter Group">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">8th Fighter Group</span></h3>
<p>Ten days after the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the 8th Pursuit Group received orders to relocate to the Pacific Theater. At the end of January 1942, the group acquired the 80th Pursuit Squadron as its third combat component and began its journey into war. After traveling by troop train across the United States and crossing the Pacific Ocean aboard the former <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> troop transport <i>Maui</i>, the group arrived at its headquarters location, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane%2C_Australia_c09e.html" title="Brisbane, Australia">Brisbane, Australia</a>, on 6 March 1942. The transit to Australia had involved only personnel and support equipment, and the 8th PG received P-39s and P-400s (a slightly inferior export version of the P-39) after arrival.</p>
<p>The three combat squadrons operated from forward bases in New Guinea. Dedicated mainly to air defense, the group occasionally attacked ground targets, flying its first offensive mission on 30 April 1942, by strafing aircraft and fuel dumps at Lae and Salamaua.</p>
<p>The Air Force redesignated the group as the <b>8th Fighter Group</b> in May 1942, with similar redesignations for its squadrons. In September of that year, the group headquarters moved to Milne Bay, New Guinea. Rampant malaria, with over half the group's personnel affected, forced a move in February 1943 to Mareeba, Australia, for rest and recuperation. During these early operations, the group and its squadrons concentrated on defense of Australia and Allied territory in New Guinea, but occasionally conducted offensive operations. Despite numerous problems in these early stages of the war with Japan, the 8th overcame adversity and performed well, earning its first Distinguished Unit Citation.</p>
<p>The group returned to action in April 1943, moving to Port Moresby, New Guinea. Before the move, the 80th Fighter Squadron re-equipped with the P-38 Lightning (below). For a time the 80th conducted most of the group's missions, as the P-39 aircraft of the 35th and 36th Fighter Squadrons were in poor condition. Both of these squadrons transitioned to the P-40 by June, and then began to conduct escort missions in New Guinea. Later in the year, the 36th Fighter Squadron replaced its P-40 aircraft with the P-47 Thunderbolt. Thus, for a time all three of the group's squadrons operated with different aircraft. In 1944 the P-40 and P-47 squadrons converted to the P-38, bringing the group back to a single aircraft type. In this phase of the war, the 8th covered landings and supported offensive ground operations in New Britain, New Guinea, and Hollandia, with the group moving forward to different bases as territory was captured from the Japanese. Later in 1944, the group supported operations in the Philippines, earning a second Distinguished Unit Citation when, armed only with machine guns, the Lightnings of the 8th Fighter Group strafed a Japanese naval task force for three hours, halting the ships until bomber aircraft from more distant bases could attack the task force. Despite the fact that the group did not have time to load bombs on its fighters and used only .50 caliber bullets on the mission, the 8th managed to sink one of the Japanese ships.</p>
<p>After moving to a base in the Philippines in December 1944, the group spent the next several months conducting offensive operations against Formosa and the Asian mainland, as well as flying escort missions in the area. Moving to a base in Ie Shima in August 1945, the group flew several missions against the Japanese island of Kyushu before the war ended. On 14 August 1945, the day of the Japanese surrender, the 8th’s 35th Fighter Squadron shot down the last enemy plane of the war. During its involvement in World War II, the 8th Fighter Group participated in nine campaigns, and its pilots shot down 446 enemy aircraft, creating 24 aces. These included Major Jay T. Robbins, with 22 kills, and Majors Edward Cragg and Cyril F. Homer with 15 kills each. Major Jay T. Robbins, 80th Fighter Squadron, was the 8th Fighter Group’s highest scoring ace of World War II with 22 kills. He is pictured here with his P-38L, nicknamed Jandina IV. In January 1944 he became commander of the 80th Fighter Squadron and in September 1944 became deputy commander of the 8th Fighter Group. The aircraft’s name Jandina is a combination of Major Robbin’s first initial and his wife’s first name, Ina. After the war, the group moved to Fukuoka, Japan in November 1945 as part of the occupation force. In early 1946 the group converted to the P-51 Mustang. Over the next few years, the group operated from several different bases, providing air defense for Japan.</p>

<p>The history of the 8th Fighter Wing began on 10 August 1948, when the Air Force established the unit, making it available for activation. The wing existed only on paper awaiting assignment of personnel and equipment. The actual activation took place the next week, on 18 August 1948, at Ashiya Airfield, Japan. On 18 August 1948, the Air Force activated the 8th Fighter Wing. The 8th Fighter Group was assigned as a subordinate component of the wing. In the Mustang—redesignated from the "pursuit" P-51 to the "fighter" F-51—and later in the F-80 Shooting Star, the 8th provided air defense of Japan. On 20 January 1950, the wing designation changed to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing. Soon another war would begin.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckboard1_drafts_1805.html" title="Edit section: Korean War combat operations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Korean War combat operations</span></h3>
<p>On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting a war that would last three years. As the war in Korea began, the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing was the first fighter wing to fly combat missions, providing air cover for the evacuation of Americans from Korea on 26 June, the day after the invasion. In these early operations, the wing flew the F-80 Shooting Star jet fighter and propeller driven aircraft such as the F-51 Mustang and F-82 Twin Mustang.</p>
<p>The wing had various squadrons attached to it during the first months of the war in addition to the 35th, 36th, and 80th Fighter Squadrons. This first aerial victory of the Korean War went to 1Lt William G. Hudson, of the 68th Fighter All-Weather Squadron (attached to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing), in an F-82. Later the same day, 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron F-80s scored the Air Force's first confirmed kills from jet aircraft. In August, the wing briefly reverted to the F-51 Mustang, returning to the F-80 in December 1950. Throughout the war, the wing principally conducted air-to-ground operations, providing close air support to United Nations ground forces and attacking targets such as supply centers and transportation assets. One of the wing's flyers, Major Charles J. Loring Jr., was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after he intentionally dove his crippled F-80 into an enemy anti-aircraft site on Sniper Ridge in November 1952.</p>
<p>The wing finished the war flying the F-86 Sabre and became responsible for air defense over South Korea. Its wartime participation in Korea earned the wing two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations and ten campaign streamers, while the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group separately earned a Distinguished Unit Citation. During the war in Korea, the 8th shot down 18 enemy aircraft, most in the earliest days of the war before the wing's mission changed to air-to-ground operations.</p>

<p>The wing relocated to Itazuke Air Base, Japan, in October 1954, where it remained at Itazuke for the next ten years. On 1 October 1957, the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group inactivated, with the flying squadrons then assigned directly to the wing, at which time the history and honors of the group were bestowed on the wing. Less than a year later, on 1 July 1958, the Air Force redesignated the wing as the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing. During its tenure at Itazuke, the wing flew several different aircraft, including the F-86 Sabre, F-100 Super Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger, and F-105 Thunderchief. All of the wing's components except the headquarters inactivated on 18 June 1964, and by 10 July the wing moved without personnel or equipment to George Air Force Base, California. Here the 8th absorbed the assets of the 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing. In the transfer, the wing gained all new personnel and units: the 431st, 433rd, and 497th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. For the next year and a half, the wing trained at George in the F-4C Phantom II and participated in various exercises and inspections before deploying to Thailand in December 1965.</p>

<p>The 8th Fighter Wing was stationed at Ubon Airfield, Thailand throughout its involvement in the Vietnam conflict. Combat operations varied over the years. The wing at times concentrated on combat air patrols and other times flew interdiction, ground support and armed reconnaissance missions. In 1967 the wing flew mostly air-to-air missions against enemy MiGs.</p>

<p>During the war in Southeast Asia, political restrictions gave the North Vietnamese Air Force a distinct advantage over the U.S. One of the restrictions forbade U.S. air forces from bombing North Vietnamese air bases in and around Hanoi and Haiphong. This restriction essentially gave the North Vietnamese a safe haven for their MiG fighters. Because U.S. forces could not fire on the MiGs parked on airfields, the North Vietnamese could pick their fights. Communist targets usually consisted of aircraft like F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers that had to drop their bombs before they could defend themselves against an air threat. In fact, MiG pilots usually harassed the F-105 pilots just enough to get them to drop their bombs prematurely. The MiGs would then retreat to the safety of their airfields when the F-105s turned to fight. The MiGs also avoided confrontations with the powerful F-4 Phantoms. With the North Vietnamese using these tactics, MiG kills became few and far between. The situation became even more critical with the addition of the MiG-21 to the North’s arsenal.</p>
<p>U.S. planners wanted to trick the North Vietnamese into committing their MiG-21s against American forces on equal ground. In concert with Seventh Air Force planners, Col. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Olds_86ec.html" title="Robin Olds">Robin Olds</a>, commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, devised a plan to draw the MiGs into a fight against F-4Cs armed for air-to-air combat—wolves in sheep’s clothing so to speak. The Phantoms would simulate F-105s by flying at the same altitude, speed, and route. The fighters would also use F-105 call signs, tanker rendezvous points, and would even make false radio calls to trick communist ground controllers. To complete the illusion, the F-4s were modified to carry electronic countermeasure pods used only on F-105s until that time. Crews trained three days for the mission.</p>
<p>The wing brought a lot of experience to the fight. Col. Olds carried 12 enemy kills from World War II to his credit and the Vice Commander, Col. Vermont Garrison, also had the distinction of being a World War II ace. Col. Garrison had also earned 10 kills during Korea making him a triple ace.</p>
<p>In the final pre-flight brief on New Year’s Day 1967, Col. Olds told his pilots, “All right you wolf pack, let’s go get them.” On 2 January 1967, seven four-ship flights from the 8th began converging on the North Vietnamese airfield of Phuc Yen. The wing’s flights were stretched in a long line with five minutes separating each flight. The spacing allowed sustained coverage of the enemy airfield for 55 minutes—the fuel endurance of the MiG-21.</p>
<p>In addition to crews from the 8th, F-4s of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing flew into the area from <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Nang_Air_Base_5468.html" title="Da Nang Air Base">Da Nang Air Base</a>. Intended to prevent the MiGs from fleeing to China as the 8th attacked, the 366th returned to base due to cloud cover over the target area. The 8th continued with the mission. With a heavy cloud deck obscuring the ground, the first four-ship flight, Olds flight, arrived over Phuc Yen Airfield at 15:00.</p>
<p>According to plan, the MiGs took the bait. Col. Olds’ flight scored three kills. Ford flight, led by Col. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_%E2%80%9CChappie%E2%80%9D_James_9076.html" title="Daniel “Chappie” James">Daniel “Chappie” James</a>—the 8th’s deputy commander for operations and later the Air Force’s first black four-star general—arrived five minutes later and scored one kill. Rambler flight scored another three kills five minutes after that. Later flights recorded no kills as the North Vietnamese realized what was happening and fled the area. The cloud deck also prevented the F-4s from pursuing the MiGs to low level.</p>
<p>In 12 minutes, the 8th recorded seven confirmed and two possible kills without a single loss. One Phantom sustained damage when it flew through the debris cloud from an exploding MiG. The results of the operation would have been much more impressive had the weather been clear. Regardless, Operation Bolo established US air superiority over the North. In fact, four days later, the 8th, pretending to be a weather reconnaissance flight, shot down two more MiG-21s, forcing the North to temporarily ground its fleet. The 8th Tactical Fighter Wing had destroyed nearly half of North Vietnam’s most advanced fighters in only five days.</p>
<p>Following Operation Bolo, the 8th began referring to itself as the Wolf Pack. Their reputation soon grew as their continued success in air-to-air missions prompted units throughout the Air Force to also refer to the 8th as the Wolf Pack. The 8th finished the war as the leading MiG-killer, logging 38.5 confirmed MiG kills. In fact, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> once referred to the 8th as the “world’s largest distributor of MiG parts.”</p>
<p>The wing was also successful in several other areas. On 23 May 1968, the Wolf Pack made the first-ever combat drop of the <a href="../../../p/a/v/Paveway.html" title="Paveway">Paveway</a> <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser-guided_bomb.html" title="Laser-guided bomb">laser-guided bomb</a>. Later on 10 and 13 May 1972, the wing destroyed two seemingly-indestructible North Vietnamese bridges—the Paul Doumer and Than Hoa Bridges—in North Vietnam using laser-guided bombs. Hundreds of sorties over several years by a variety of U.S. aircraft had failed to put these two key targets permanently out of commission. Wolf Pack F-4s completed the job in just two days.</p>
<p>Throughout the war, the wing flew the F-4 Phantom, first the C model and later the F-4D and F-4E. In addition to the main force of F-4 fighters, at various stages of the war the wing also had squadrons flying AC-123 Black Spot and AC-130 Spectre gunships, F-104 Starfighters, and B-57 Canberra bombers. From 1965 until it left Ubon in 1974, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing earned 16 campaign streamers, three Presidential Unit Citations, six Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Combat V device, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckboard1_drafts_1805.html" title="Edit section: Kunsan, Korea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kunsan, Korea</span></h3>
<p>Although the 8th ceased combat operations in August 1973, it remained at Ubon until September 1974, maintaining a combat-ready force in the region. On 16 September 1974, the 8th moved to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. This move took place without personnel or equipment, and the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing absorbed the assets of the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing. The 3rd moved without personnel or equipment to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. With the move, the 8th was reunited with two squadrons that had previously been associated with the wing, the 35th and the 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. Again the wing flew the F-4 Phantom, providing air defense over South Korea. Following the "tree-cutting incident," an August 1976 border confrontation involving the murder of two U.S. Army officers by North Koreans, tensions rose between North and South Korea. In response, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing was placed on heightened alert and the 12th and 67th Tactical Fighter Squadrons from Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, temporarily joined the wing at Kunsan, bringing the strength of the 8 TFW to four squadrons of F-4 fighters. In September the tensions eased and the two augmenting squadrons returned to Kadena.</p>
<p>On 1 October 1978, the wing gained a third flying unit, the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, based at Taegu Air Base, South Korea. Operations continued unchanged for the next few years, until the wing transitioned from the F-4 to the newer F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Wolf Pack’s transition from the F-4 to the F-16 began with the arrival of the wing’s first F-16 on 29 May 1981. The wing’s first F-16 sortie was flown the following 18 September and, by 19 July 1982, the conversion of the 35th and 80th Fighter squadrons was complete as the last F-4 departed Kunsan. This aircraft conversion made the 8th the first active-duty overseas F-16 wing. On 1 January 1982, the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Taegu inactivated.</p>
<p>For the next ten years the wing used the F-16 to maintain combat readiness for the defense of Korea. While the overall mission remained unchanged, the wing reorganized on 3 February 1992, becoming the 8th Fighter Wing. Further, the wing adopted a new organizational structure. Under the former tri-deputy system, the wing commander had three deputy commanders, one each for operations, maintenance, and resources. The squadrons remained directly to the wing.</p>
<p>In 1992, the wing adopted a multi-group structure. This reorganization re-activated the <b>8th Operations Group</b> and created the 8th Logistics, 8th Support, and <b>8th Medical Group</b>s assigned directly to the wing, with the squadrons now assigned and reporting to the groups. In 2002, the wing reorganized under the "Combat Wing Organization" concept. This reorganization redesignated the 8th Logistics Group as the <b>8th Maintenance Group</b> and the 8th Support Group as the <b>8th Mission Support Group</b>. The 8th Operations and Medical Groups remained unchanged, and the squadrons continued to be assigned to their functionally aligned groups.</p>
<p>On 17 November, the 35th Fighter Squadron received its first Block 40 F-16s. The new aircraft carried Low-Altitude Navigation &amp; Targeting Infrared for Night (<a href="../../../l/a/n/LANTIRN_63ef.html" title="LANTIRN">LANTIRN</a>) pods. The 35th completed its conversion in February 2001. The combination of LANTIRN and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night-vision.html" title="Night-vision">night-vision</a> goggles has allowed the Wolf Pack to take the fight into the night.</p>

<p>Headquarters Far East Air Forces (HQ FEAF), the organization responsible for awarding victory credits during the Korean Conflict, required proof of the destruction of enemy aircraft before issuing general orders to confirm claims. This proof usually consisted of witness statements, gun camera film, or the sighting of aircraft wreckage…. Following the policy used for apportioning victory credits in World War II, FEAF divided into fractions each credit awarded to more than one flyer. For example, if two fighter pilots shot down the same airplane, each received a half credit. Korean victory credits were never divided between more than two men.2 NAME RANK UNIT KILLS A/C DATE Dewald, Robert H 1Lt 35 FS 1.0 IL-10 F-80 27 Jun 50 Hudson, William G. 1Lt 68 FS 1.0 Yak-11 F-82 27 Jun 50 Little, James W.

<p>“Evaluators considered an enemy aircraft destroyed if it crashed, disintegrated, lost a vital flying component, caught fire, or was abandoned by its pilot. Confirming evidence consisted of written contemporary testimony of one or more witnesses, gun camera film from the time, or the sighting of enemy aircraft wreckage immediately after the event…. During the conflict in Southeast Asia, Air Force Chief of Staff John D. Ryan directed that each member of a two-man crew receive one full credit for the destruction of a hostile aircraft. Up to four men (two 2-man crews) could each receive one full credit for destroying a single enemy airplane. This liberal method of apportioning credit departed from the World War II practice of dividing credit into equal fractions among those responsible. It more closely resembled the World War I French and American systems of awarding whole credits to everyone involved in a victory. Totalling the Southeast Asia victories will therefore not produce the number of enemy airplanes destroyed in air-to-air combat.”3 Unlike during Korea, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing flew two-seat aircraft in Vietnam. Both crewmembers in the F-4 Phantom received a full credit when they shot down an enemy aircraft, instead of splitting the credit between them. The unit, of course, received only one credit for each enemy aircraft. The only partial credits occurred when two separate fighters shot down the same enemy aircraft. In these cases, all involved crewmembers received a half credit. In the following list, the crew positions, in parentheses, follow the names. For the first several years of the Vietnam conflict, the F-4 crew consisted of an aircraft commander (the front-seater), and a pilot (the back-seater). Later, the term "weapons systems officer", or "WSO" (pronounced “wizzo”), replaced the designation "pilot" for the back-seater.</p>
