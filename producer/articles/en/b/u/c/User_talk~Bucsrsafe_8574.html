<p>Hey man, let me tell you right now. From experience I know this. You have to be careful with the Nash page, Bryant page, ballhog, etc. I just logged on for the first time and I see downwards and his ridiculous comments accusing you of being a sockpuppet of me. That is what this site is all about. They are too biased here. It is run by the biggest nash fans. You can just see how the article was even before I came on here. Just be careful. My friend did the same and he got blocked for a week. Something needs to be done here. wikipedia is also europe name and lots of canadians and british are here too so they crave nash. <a href="../../../h/g/a/User%7EHganesan_583b.html" title="User:Hganesan">Hganesan</a> 18:46, 3 June 2006 (UTC)hganesan</p>

<p>It's hard to point out exactly where to look on the discussion page, but just start reading through the whole thing and you'll see a number of editors express that individual matchups against other players don't belong on the page. Also, when you use the words "some" or "some people" without providing sources, it is considered " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" rel="nofollow">Weasel Words</a>" <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 00:22, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>i understand that, but i dont really see why individual matchups if relevant like against billups and kidd cannot be put on the page when they show that nash is not at his best when he comes up against other elite point guards. please explain because i think it should be there in some capacity. if its ok for people to write about when nash dominates other players, why not when other players dominate him???
<dl>
<dd>I don't think its ok for people to write about Nash dominating other players in individual matchups and I don't think anyone has done that. If you can find a source from a notable columnist talking about how Nash gets dominated by other elite players, then it would be notable enough to go in the article. Otherwise, it seems like Original Research, which is not allowed. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 00:58, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well the whole article is about how nash is so good as a player and does so well, there should be something about how one of his weaknesses seems to be him underperforming against some elite players and his weak defense. 2 or 3 lines is not enough in my eyes to look at the main weakness of his game, given that the rest of the article is about his qualities as a player. i reckon it should be included and you dont need critics to tell you a fact that billups and kidd dominated his this season.
<dl>
<dd>You do need critics in order to show that this is a notable criticism that alot of people have and that it's not just something you made up. For example you can do a Google search for "Nash" and "no defense" and get a number of hits about his bad defense. So that's something we can and should talk about. Like I said in the discussion page, though, we can't go through and talk about what Nash did in every single game against certain players or the article would get to a ridiculous length. If you can find some notable stuff about his bad defense to add, that would be fine. The problem is that most columnists don't like to criticize Nash, but I'm sure there's some stuff out there. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 21:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who are you to decide that it's not a valid source? It's the most statistically sophisticated look at defense available. It shows that Nash is not the best or the worst. It's orders of magnitude more valid than a silly Espn.com ranking of point guards.</p>

<p>If as you now claim, your only objection is that the article doesn't give a precise place for Nash, then why did you criticize the source. And if I find his precise rank, I guess you'll have no objection to including it. And why didn't you go to the discussion page to suggest removing it?</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Animal_ede3.html" title="User:The Animal">The Animal</a> 19:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>yes i will because the reliability of the source is sketchy. also you dont consult to remove, you consult to put it on in the first place. yes try and find his position, then we will look at it. my suspicion is that among starting point guards, he is pretty low. also, its a good thing to find stuff about Nash's defense because it is undermentioned in my view. BUCSRSAFE.</p>
<p>Are you really unfamiliar with 82games.com and <a href="../../../a/p/b/APBRmetrics_b6c2.html" title="APBRmetrics">APBRmetrics</a> in general?

<p>yes i am unfamiliar with it because it is not a legitimate, well thought of sports site like foxsports, espn or cbs sportsline. if they published a report like that, then it would be absolutely fine. BUCSRSAFE.</p>
<p><br />
You should look into <a href="../../../a/p/b/APBRmetrics_b6c2.html" title="APBRmetrics">APBRmetrics</a>. I believe you would actually find some sound support for some of your opinions on Nash. I probably don't care enough to continue trying to post content on Nash, but for what it's worth (very little to you, I'm sure), your online etiquette is quite lacking.</p>

<p>yeah i will look into it. why is my online etiquette bad? honestly, if there was a position i would probably support you, just the point that he is not in the top 10 or the bottom 10 which solely consists of bench players is not really relevant. BUCSRSAFE.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say thanks for helping out earlier with the reverts, and sorry you got blocked. The way to avoid that is just to revert once or twice at most. It's tempting to keep doing it but as you can see, it probably won't end well for you. Other people will come in to help (as you and others did), and if it persists, it's usually easy to get an admin involved. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 01:11, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you can quote a published source that mentions Nash's defensive deficiencies, then you can restore some of what you recently added to that article. As it stands, however, your edit is nothing but POV and original research. I do agree with you, to an extent, but you need to cite an authoritative source to demonstrate that it <i>is</i> a commonly held opinion about Nash.</p>
<p>BTW, a low steals average does not necessarily mean that a player is a bad defender, so I wouldn't use that argument in the future. Lots of players get high steal totals because they take foolish chances on the defensive end. And just because someone hasn't been named to the All-Defensive team doesn't mean he's a <i>bad</i> defender. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 02:25, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
