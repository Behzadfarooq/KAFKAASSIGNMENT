	    <p><b>Andrew L. "Buckshot" Roberts</b> was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_bison.html" title="American bison">buffalo</a> hunter and <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboy.html" title="Cowboy">cowboy</a> whose last stand at Blazer's Mills near <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%2C_New_Mexico_2fd5.html" title="Lincoln, New Mexico">Lincoln, New Mexico</a> is a part of frontier legend.</p>
<p>Although the huge majority of famous gunfights that took place in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_West_9e02.html" title="Old West">Old West</a> have been exaggerated beyond the realms of credibility, the fight at Blazer's Mills is one of the few where reliable sources have described a feat of profound ability and toughness. Despite his toughness, Roberts died at Blazer's Mills, following a shoot-out with the Regulators, who believed that Roberts had been involved in the murder of their boss, John Tunstall. They famously included <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_the_Kid_ccc3.html" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a>, who played a part in that fight. It was, however, Charles Bowdre who fired the fatal shot which killed Roberts, although Roberts would shoot dead one Regulator, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Brewer_fa31.html" title="Richard Brewer">Richard Brewer</a> at the same location.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckshot_Roberts_4685.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Little has been verified of Roberts' life. He is believed to have been an associate of "Buffalo" Bill Cody, and may have been involved in a shootout with the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Ranger_Division_b0e2.html" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Rangers</a> at this time. He earned his nickname due to a serious injury. Having been shot, there was still a load of buckshot embedded in his right shoulder, indicating that it is likely he was involved in at least one violent encounter. The wound impaired the movement in his right arm, which he could not raise above his <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelvis.html" title="Pelvis">pelvis</a>. It is therefore literally true that he shot from the hip.</p>
<p>He was known as a quiet, secretive man, who rarely, if ever spoke of his past, though he was reportedly not a man to upset. A stubborn loner, he preferred to ride a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mule.html" title="Mule">mule</a> than a horse. He was short and stocky in appearance. He worked for Jimmy Dolan, thus, when the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County_War_63c3.html" title="Lincoln County War">Lincoln County War</a> broke out he became a target of those loyal to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tunstall_301e.html" title="John Tunstall">John Tunstall</a> and Alex McSween. Roberts was determined to have no part in the violence that engulfed Lincoln County at this time, and refused to fight for the Dolan-Murphy gang<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. One such loose bunch allied to the Tunstall-McSween cause were the Regulators, who carried a warrant for Roberts's arrest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckshot_Roberts_4685.html" title="Edit section: Blazer's Mills">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blazer's Mills</span></h2>
<p>Buckshot Roberts wanted no part in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County_War_63c3.html" title="Lincoln County War">Lincoln County War</a> and made plans to leave the area, selling his ranch and waiting for the check from his buyer. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, Roberts rode his mule into Blazer’s Mills, a sawmill and trading post located on the Rio Tularosa. Looking to collect his check, he was shocked to discover that the entire upper echelon of the Regulators were eating lunch in a nearby building. They had left the area around <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%2C_New_Mexico_2fd5.html" title="Lincoln, New Mexico">Lincoln, New Mexico</a> after killing Sheriff William Brady just three days earlier. One of them, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Coe_1542.html" title="Frank Coe">Frank Coe</a>, sat with Roberts on the steps of the main house and tried to talk him into surrendering. The old gunman refused, believing he would be killed by the vengeful cowboys.</p>
<p>Regulator chief <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Brewer_fa31.html" title="Richard Brewer">Richard Brewer</a> grew impatient with the stand-off and sent a few of his men outside to take Roberts into custody. At the sight of the armed, quickly walking cowboys, Roberts jumped up, aiming his Winchester. Both he and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Bowdre_d1cf.html" title="Charlie Bowdre">Charlie Bowdre</a> fired at the same time. Roberts was struck in the stomach while his shot hit Bowdre’s belt buckle, severing his gun belt and knocking the wind from him. Dangerously wounded, Roberts kept pumping bullets at the Regulators as he retreated to the doorway. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Middleton_%28cowboy%29_d24b.html" title="John Middleton (cowboy)">John Middleton</a> was seriously wounded in the chest. One slug grazed <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Gordon_%27Doc%27_Scurlock_a928.html" title="Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock">Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock</a> and another struck <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Coe_f59d.html" title="George Coe">George Coe</a> in the right hand, costing him his thumb and trigger finger. Once the magazine of Roberts’ rifle clicked empty, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_the_Kid_ccc3.html" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> dashed from cover to finish off the wounded gunman, only to be knocked senseless by the barrel of the Winchester.</p>
<p>Barricading himself in the house, Buckshot Roberts ignored both his painful wound and the Regulators’ gunshots, arming himself with a single-shot Springfield rifle and readied himself. Stunned by the turn of events, the Regulators tended to their wounded and tried to get Roberts to come out. Frustrated that none of his men dared to approach the fortified adversary, Dick Brewer circled around the main house and took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where the wounded man was. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the log pile, sighted in and opened fire when Brewer put his head up again, striking the cowboy in the eye.</p>
<p>The Regulators, demoralized by their casualties, pulled out and left the area. Buckshot Roberts died the next day and he and Dick Brewer were buried side by side near the big house where the gunfight occurred.</p>
