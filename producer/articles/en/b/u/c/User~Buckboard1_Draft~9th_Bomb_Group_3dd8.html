<p>Originally created as the 9th Observation Group on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, as part of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Service_fc94.html" title="U.S. Army Air Service">U.S. Army Air Service</a>, the 9th was organized on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, at <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchel_Field_4473.html" title="Mitchel Field">Mitchel Field</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. The squadrons assigned to the group were the 1st and 5th Aero Squadrons (Observation), both re-designated bomb squadrons in March 1935.</p>
<p>The 1st Squadron was the first squadron organized in the air force, and the oldest, formed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">March 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, at <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_City%2C_Texas_fc9b.html" title="Texas City, Texas">Texas City, Texas</a>, as the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Aero_Squadron_c36c.html" title="1st Aero Squadron">1st Aero Squadron</a>. It served in both the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Villa_Expedition_4e5d.html" title="Pancho Villa Expedition">Punitive Expedition</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> in 1916-1917 and in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, with seven <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_streamer.html" title="Campaign streamer">campaign streamers</a>. The 5th Squadron was organized in 1917 at <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Field_ebb2.html" title="Kelly Field">Kelly Field</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, and served as a flying training unit. From June to September 1921 both squadrons served as part of the <i>1st Provisional Air Brigade</i>, organized by Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_L._Mitchell_a8a2.html" title="William L. Mitchell">William L. Mitchell</a> to demonstrate aerial bombardment of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a>.</p>
<p>From 1923 to 1929 both squadrons of the 9th were reassigned to higher echelons, but remained in actuality a part of the group. The 99th Observation Squadron, organized at Kelly Field in 1917 and earning four campaign streamers in France, was added to the 9th Group on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9.html" title="November 9">November 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, and on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, all three squadrons were assigned permanently. These squadrons used the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airco_DH.4_7f96.html" title="Airco DH.4">DH-4</a> for its observation airplane between 1922 and 1928, and the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_Falcon_9bd2.html" title="Curtiss Falcon">Curtiss O-1B Falcon</a> from 1928 to 1935.</p>
<p>The Air Service had become the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Corps_56f8.html" title="U.S. Army Air Corps">U.S. Army Air Corps</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>. In early 1935 the Air Corps was re-organized, with all combat groups being centrally controlled for the first time, under a new command organization called General Headquarters, Air Force. The role of observation as the primary function of the air arm had been strongly de-emphasized in the creation of eight new groups between 1927 and 1932. With the creation of GHQAF it was further de-emphasized and the 9th was converted into a bombardment group and made a part of the 2nd Wing, responsible for the air defense of the East Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>The group's designation was changed to the 9th Bombardment Group on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, the 9th Bombardment Group (Medium) on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, and the 9th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. During the period 1935-1940 the 9th Bomb Group trained aircrews, took part in maneuvers, and participated in air shows, equipped with <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keystone_B-6_db2f.html" title="Keystone B-6">Keystone B-6</a> (1935-36), <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_B-10_e426.html" title="Martin B-10">Martin B-10</a> (1936-38), and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Aircraft_Company_819e.html" title="Douglas Aircraft Company">Douglas</a> <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-18.html" title="B-18">B-18</a> aircraft (1938-1942).</p>
<p>The 9th moved to Rio Hato, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panama</a>, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, to serve as part of the defense force for the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_ac67.html" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>. The 44th Reconnaissance Squadron stationed at Albrook Field, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canal_Zone_b596.html" title="Canal Zone">Canal Zone</a>, was attached to the 9th on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. In addition to 5 additional B-18's it provided a single <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-17_Flying_Fortress_variants_e16c.html#B-17B" title="B-17 Flying Fortress variants">B-17B</a> to the group.</p>
<p>The 9th Bomb Group relocated in a series of moves to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> bases to conduct <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisubmarine.html" title="Antisubmarine">antisubmarine</a> patrols. The 1st Bomb Squadron moved to Piarco Airport, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad.html" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">April 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>; followed by the 5th Bomb Squadron to Beane Field, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Lucia_02d8.html" title="Saint Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>; the group headquarters squadron to Waller Field, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad.html" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a> (where it was joined by the 1st Bomb Squadron); the 44th Recon Squadron to Atkinson Field, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Guiana_1cac.html" title="British Guiana">British Guiana</a>, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>; and the 99th Bomb Squadron to Zandrey Field, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surinam.html" title="Surinam">Surinam</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>.</p>
<p>The 44th Recon Squadron was formally assigned to the 9th Bomb Group on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">February 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, and redesignated the 430th Bomb Squadron on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>. The group's Headquarters Squadron was disbanded on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. The 1st Bomb Squadron changed stations to Edinburg Field, Trinidad, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_23.html" title="August 23">August 23</a>, and the group was assigned to the Antilles Air Task Force on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, where it continued antisubmarine patrols and conducted reconnaissance of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_French_366a.html" title="Vichy French">Vichy French</a> fleet at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinique.html" title="Martinique">Martinique</a>.</p>
<p>The 9th Bomb Group's assets were transferred to the 25th Bomb Group and it was returned without personnel or equipment to the US in October 1942, where it was reconstituted as part of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Air_Force_School_of_Applied_Tactics_b7e3.html" title="Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics">Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics</a> (AAFSAT) at <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCoy_Air_Force_Base_3fc3.html" title="McCoy Air Force Base">Orlando Army Air Base</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The group's squadrons were assigned as school squadrons, with the 1st located at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooksville%2C_Florida_c3f5.html" title="Brooksville, Florida">Brooksville Field</a>, the 5th at <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCoy_Air_Force_Base_3fc3.html" title="McCoy Air Force Base">Pinecastle Field</a>, and the 99th at Montbrook Field.

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the 9th Bomb Group was established on paper at <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalhart%2C_Texas_406a.html" title="Dalhart, Texas">Dalhart Army Airfield, Texas</a>, as part of the 313th Bomb Wing.</p>
<p>During April the key personnel of the new group (including group commander Col. Donald Eisenhart and Deputy Group Commander Lt.Col. Henry Huglin) assembled at Dalhart, forming the command and operations cadres, and were transferred with the group to <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCook_Regional_Airport_9e9e.html" title="McCook Regional Airport">McCook Army Airfield</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. After a brief period establishing the units at McCook, the cadre of group and squadron operations staffs went by train to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Air_Force_School_of_Applied_Tactics_b7e3.html" title="Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics">AAFSAT</a> in May for the 4-week training course in organizing and conducting combat operations with very heavy bomb group units. While the cadre was at AAFSAT, an influx of new personnel continued at McCook.</p>
<p>After the return of the group and squadron cadres in June 1944, the squadrons organized new combat crews and the group conducted an intensive program of ground and flying training using B-17 aircraft to practice takeoffs, landings, instrument and night flying, cross-country navigation, high altitutde formation flying, and bombing and gunnery practice.</p>
<p>The 9th Group had been forced to use B-17's in its training because the development of the B-29 as an operational weapon had been plagued since an early flight test on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, resulted in an engine fire, culminating in a massive emergency modification program in the winter of 1943-44 ordered by <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Arnold_7002.html" title="Henry H. Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, Chief of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Forces_974c.html" title="U.S. Army Air Forces">Army Air Forces</a>, and nicknamed the "Battle of Kansas". In particular the program sought to resolve a spate of problems with serious engine fires and faulty gunnery central fire control systems. All B-29s modified in this program were diverted to the 58th Bomb Wing to meet <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s commitment to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> to have B-29's deployed to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Burma_India_Theater_8af9.html" title="China Burma India Theater">China-Burma-India Theater</a> in the spring of 1944, leaving none available to equip the 12 new groups being formed in the 73rd, 313th, and 314th Wings, including the 9th Bomb Group.</p>
<p>The 9th Group received its first training B-29 on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. After four further months of training Col. Eisenhart declared the unit ready for movement overseas, and its ground echelon left McCook for <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, Port of Embarkation on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, traveling by the troopship U.S.S. <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Henlopen_1929.html" title="Cape Henlopen">Cape Henlopen</a></i> to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariana_Islands_3bc5.html" title="Mariana Islands">Mariana Islands</a> on a voyage that required thirty days. The ground echelon of the group debarked at <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinian.html" title="Tinian">Tinian</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a> and was assigned a camp on the west side of the island between the two airfields.</p>
<p>The air echelon of the 9th Bomb Group began its overseas movement in January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> by sending the combat crews to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herington_Municipal_Airport_4575.html" title="Herington Municipal Airport">Herington Field</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, where over a three-week period they accepted 37 new B-29's. The first bombers left their staging field at <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mather_Air_Force_Base_cbec.html" title="Mather Air Force Base">Mather Army Airfield</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, and proceeded individually by way of <a href="../../../h/i/c/Hickam_Air_Force_Base_ab98.html" title="Hickam Air Force Base">Hickam Field</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwajalein.html" title="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> to North Field, Tinian, with the first five arriving on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. The last of the original 37 airplanes to reach Tinian arrived on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a> by which time the group had already flown its first combat mission.</p>

<p>The 9th Bomb Group was one of four of the 313th Bomb Wing stationed at North Field as part of XXI Bomber Command, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_Air_Force_8a27.html" title="Twentieth Air Force">Twentieth Air Force</a>. It was assigned the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_identification_aircraft_markings.html" title="Unit identification aircraft markings">group identification tail marking</a> of the letter "X" above a small black <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangle.html" title="Triangle">triangle</a> symbol, both placed above the aircraft's tail fin serial and victor number (a one- or two-digit number assigned an airplane to identify it individually both within the group and squadron). The group carried this marking until April, when the 313th Wing changed its marking to that of a 126-inch diameter circle in black to outline a 63-inch high group letter.</p>
<p>The 9th Bomb Group conducted four training missions against the Japanese-held <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maug_Islands_256a.html" title="Maug Islands">Maug Islands</a> in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Marianas_66db.html" title="Northern Marianas">Northern Marianas</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_27.html" title="January 27">January 27</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">29</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">31</a>, and <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>. Its first combat mission took place on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> with 30 aircraft bombing a Japanese naval airfield located on the island of <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moen.html" title="Moen">Moen</a> at <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truk.html" title="Truk">Truk</a> atoll (now known as the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuuk_Islands_eba9.html" title="Chuuk Islands">Chuuk Islands</a>). Flown by day at an altitude of 25,000 feet, it was in actuality a further training mission, encountering no opposition.</p>
<p>The second group mission was a pre-invasion bombing of <a href="../../../i/w/o/Iwo_Jima_cb0c.html" title="Iwo Jima">Iwo Jima</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a>, one week prior to D-Day for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Detachment_8873.html" title="Operation Detachment">Operation Detachment</a>. The capture of Iwo Jima had as its objective an emergency landing field for <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_Air_Force_8a27.html" title="Twentieth Air Force">Twentieth Air Force</a> bombers attacking <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and a base for <a href="../../../p/-/5/P-51.html" title="P-51">P-51D</a> and <a href="../../../p/-/4/P-47.html" title="P-47">P-47N</a> fighters to fly escort and strafing missions.</p>
<p>Its first mission to the Japanese home islands was the 9th Bomb Group's fifth, flown <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">February 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. Again a day mission flown at high altitude, the target was the port facilities of <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. That same day Col. Eisenhart was made Operations Officer of the 313th Bomb Wing and succeeded in command of the group by Lt.Col. Huglin.</p>
<p>Unlike their counterparts in the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Air_Force_f1db.html" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_Air_Force_ba44.html" title="Fifteenth Air Force">Fifteenth Air Forces</a>, B-29's of the Twentieth Air Force did not assemble in defensive formations over friendly territory before proceeding on the mission. On daytime missions to Japan (which because of the seven-to-eight-hour flight time to Japan from the Marianas almost always resulted in night takeoffs) B-29's took off from Tinian's multiple <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runway.html" title="Runway">runways</a> to shorten group launch times.</p>
<p>To conserve fuel and engine stress when the aircraft were at their heaviest, the bombers flew individually at low altitude, usually climbing to bombing altitude only in the last hour before rendezvous (dictated by weather conditions encountered). After <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a> bombing alitudes rarely exceeded 20,000 feet, reducing the amount of climb required to assemble and further conserving fuel and engine life. Flight profiles were carefully calculated during mission planning and recorded as detailed performance tables, specifying power settings and fuel consumption rates, and carried by the flight deck crews during the mission.</p>
<p>At a designated rendezvous point off the coast of Japan, lead B-29's (using colored-smoke generators to identify themselves) flew circles of a mile or more radius, at different altitudes and in different directions for squadrons within a group. Aircraft formed on the leader as they arrived, and it was not uncommon for formations to include aircraft from other groups that had been unable to locate their own group formation. If the mission plan called for a wing assembly, the lead group flew to a second assembly point and flew one large circle, measured in minutes and not distance, to allow following groups to join up. The formation stayed together only in the target area, breaking up again and reducing altitude to return to base (or Iwo Jima) individually.</p>
<p>Night missions had similar profiles to and from the target, except that aircraft did not assemble in the target area but bombed individually, guided by their own navigation systems and by the glow of fires started by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathfinder.html" title="Pathfinder">pathfinder</a> aircraft. Also, bombing altitudes were rarely higher than 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>On the group's seventh mission, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">-10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, XXI Bomber Command radically changed tactics at the direction of its commander, Maj.Gen. <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_LeMay_3832.html" title="Curtis LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a>, attacking Tokyo's urban center <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Tokyo_in_World_War_II_7d2b.html" title="Bombing of Tokyo in World War II">by night with incendiary bombs</a> and at altitudes of only 6,400 to 7,800 feet, resulting in one of the most destructive attacks in history. The mission resulted in the first two losses to the group when B-29's from both the 1st and 99th Bomb Squadrons were forced to crash-land at sea after they ran out of fuel while returning to Tinian. The crew of the 1st BS B-29 was rescued, but three members of the 99th BS crew were killed, including the Group <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">Radar</a> Officer.</p>
<p>The Tokyo fire raid was the first of five flown between <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, resulting in devastation of four urban areas (Tokyo, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagoya.html" title="Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osaka.html" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>, and <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe.html" title="Kobe">Kobe</a>) and extensive civilian loss of life. The 9th Bomb Group had its first bomber shot down on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a> Kobe mission, and its second on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, attacking the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsubishi.html" title="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi Aircraft</a> factory at Nagoya (ironically the same crew that had ditched on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>).</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a> the 9th Bomb Group began a week of night missions sowing both acoustic and magnetic aerial <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_mine.html" title="Naval mine">anti-shipping mines</a> in Japanese harbor approaches and <a href="../../../i/n/l/Inland_Sea_c2d4.html" title="Inland Sea">Inland Sea</a> ship passages, with a mission to block the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimonoseki_Straits_b49f.html" title="Shimonoseki Straits">Shimonoseki Straits</a>. Attacks in April were a combination of night and medium altitude day missions against the Japanese aircraft industry, and beginning <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, three weeks of daytime attacks against Japanese airfields on <a href="../../../k/y/u/Kyushu.html" title="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> launching <i><a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">Kamikaze</a></i> attacks against <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. naval</a> forces at <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okinawa.html" title="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>.</p>
<p>The 9th Bomb Group was awarded a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Unit_Citation_5511.html" title="Presidential Unit Citation">Presidential Unit Citation</a> for the mission of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a><a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">-16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. The group attacked the industrial area of <a href="../../../k/a/w/Kawasaki.html" title="Kawasaki">Kawasaki</a>, Japan, a target judged to be "an important link in the component productive capacity...upon which industries in Tokyo and Yokahama depended" (from the citation). "Because of its strategic location between two heavily-defended areas, the objective was strongly guarded by masses of defenses both on the flanks and in the immediate target area, making the approach, the bomb run, and the break-away from the target extremely hazardous." The 9th Group, dispatching 33 aircraft on a "maximum effort", was the last group over the target. Japanese <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft.html" title="Anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> defenses had by then determined the bombing altitude and direction of attack and the 9th Bomb Group experienced close coordination between Japanese search lights and anti-aircraft guns while over land, and accurate fire from flak boats on ingress and egress to the target area. 56 Japanese fighters were reported by returning crews, including a number of <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">suicide planes</a>, with 2 claimed as shot down. The 9th had four B-29s shot down and six others severely damaged.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the 9th Bomb Group resumed mine-laying operations which continued through <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, for which the group was awarded its second Presidential Unit Citation. Flying at night at 5,500 feet in what the citation stated was "the second most heavily-defended zone in Japan", the group sowed 1425 mines in 209 sorties with a 92% accuracy rate, primarily against the Shimonoseki Straits and harbors on <a href="../../../k/y/u/Kyushu.html" title="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> and the northwest coast of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honshu.html" title="Honshu">Honshu</a>. During the mining campaign the 9th lost one B-29 on a takeoff accident on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a> and a second in combat on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a> the 9th Bomb group began a grim campaign of night incendiary raids against the remaining urban areas of Japan not previously attacked that continued to its final mission, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.</p>

<p>In all the 9th Bomb Group flew 71 combat missions, three show-of-force flyover missions after the cessation of hostilities, and one mission to drop medical and food supplies to liberated <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners-of-war.html" title="Prisoners-of-war">prisoners-of-war</a>. Total combat sorties for the group were 2,012, of which 1,843 were against the Japanese home islands. The group logged approximately 28,000 total hours of combat flight time and dropped approximately 12,000 tons of bombs and mines.</p>
<p>Of the 71 combat missions, 27 were incendiary raids, 14 mining operations (with 328 total sorties), 13 against airfields, 9 against aircraft production, and 9 against other industry or targets other than the home islands. 39 of the missions were flown at night, and 32 by day. Only six of the 71 combat missions were flown above 20,000 feet altitude.</p>
<p>The group began combat operations with 37 aircraft and ended them with 50 B-29's, with an average of 47 on hand and 33 in commission at any one time. A total of XX B-29's were assigned to the group while it was stationed on Tinian, of which XX were transferred to other groups. Of the remainder, XX were shot down in combat or lost on return because of battle damage, XX were lost after running out of fuel, 1 crashed on takeoff, XX were written off, and XX were declared "war-weary" and retired from combat operations while being carried on the group inventory.</p>
