<dd>I'm in favor of removing the reference to Brian Carrol, unless someone can provide a reliable source for it.

<p>To RickK, let me first explain a few things: I'm a Buckethead fan, and it pains me to see erroneous information on a site like this that is community-run and in some sense, very pure. I'm not a longtime member of this wiki community, so I was not entirely sure how it worked. All I knew was that if there was something wrong, that I, as a user, could change it. What happened last night was a mix of miscommunication and confusion. I had entered in those changes, but kept noticing that they kept reverting back. I thought that it had something to do with my cache, or perhaps with wiki's servers, or I don't know what. I just knew that my changes weren't taking hold. That's why I kept trying to change it. I didn't know you were online at the same time changing it back. You say on the "protected pages list" you asked me to explain these changes, however I never saw those msgs. You can blame that on me being a novice wiki user. I still don't see where those msgs are. In any event, I did try to contact you through your own talk page because I didn't know how else to reach you. You don't have an e-mail address with which I can contact you either. All I did was try to explain the changes that needed to be made. But now you have protected the page, and the wrong information is still on the page. The information that needs to be changed is the same as what was indicated above by user wapcaplet. The only thing I really tried to change was his name, because if you're a Buckethead fan, you'll know that he's an extremely private and shy person who does NOT want his name, whether correct or not, to be known in public. As a fan, I am just trying to protect his privacy in whatever way I can. I hope you see this, and I hope you make these changes. I wasn't trying to start an edit war. If what has transpired isn't considered correct wiki etiquette, I apologize for my ignorance. However I still think the changes need to be made, because what's on there is based on hearsay, and some of the rest of it is just factually incorrect. BTW RickK if you read this, please e-mail me at bucketbot19 at yahoo dot com. I'd like to resolve this.</p>
<p>The only thing I repeatedly asked for was an explanation for the deletes, which you declined to do. Now that you have explained, I have no problem with the edits. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">Talk</a> 04:51, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd call them authentic as far as authenticity on the Internet goes.. Then again it's possible he just spread a fake name around&#160;:) // <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGargaj_5184.html" title="User:Gargaj">Gargaj</a> 01:39, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Buckethead chooses not to reveal his real name, and we should respect that. Since he chooses not to reveal his name, there is actually no way of knowing what his real name is, short of finding his birth certificate. Buckethead is a great artist, and his wish to remain anonymous should be granted. *Lizz*</p>
<p>I think the reference to Brian Carroll should be deleted, since it's completely unsubstantiated. At the very least, it should be clearly explained as a conjecture. Perhaps this whole debate could be summarized. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocinante9_7653.html" title="User:Rocinante9">Rocinante9</a> 16:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>IMDB Lists his real name as Brian Carroll, but they could be tainted by false sources. As usual. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.176.85.30 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.176.85.30.html" title="User talk:66.176.85.30">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.176.85.30_6cfd.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.176.85.30">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>An interview with Ozzy Osbourne also cites his (first, at least) name as being Brian <a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=31127" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=31127" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Heh, as I'm writing this, someone's just changed the name from Ben whatever back to Brian Carroll. As it stands, I'd say Big B's real name is Brian Carroll. That's the only name I've ever heard attributed to him outside of Buckethead and Death Cube K.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ozzy Osbourne: "I tried out that Buckethead guy. I met with him and asked him to work with me but only if he got rid of the fucking bucket. So I came back a bit later and he's wearing this green fucking Martian's-hat thing. I said, 'Look, just be yourself!' He told me his name was Brian, so I said that's what I'd call him. He says, 'No one calls me Brian except my mother.' So I said, 'Pretend I'm your mum then!' I haven't even got out of the room and I'm already playing fucking mind games with the guy. What happens if one day he's gone and there's a note saying, 'I've been beamed up?' [Laughs] Don't get me wrong, he's a great player. He plays like a motherfucker!"</i> -- <a href="../../../x/3/j/User%7EX3J11_085b.html" title="User:X3J11">X3J11</a> 00:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it should be noted in the article that Buckethead was named the 8th fastest guitarist in the world by Guitar One magazine.</p>
<p>I believe this article is lacking the great intellectuallity and genius of Buckethead, maybe you should add his background (where the buckt came from, his obssession with robots and chicken coops.</p>

<p>Bucket head also appears in The DJ Qbert animation movie Wave Twister for a brief 10 seconds.</p>
<p>im not a fan of bucket head but he always managed to pick my curiosity also when i saw him in that movie.</p>
<p>So maybe you guys want to add that as a fact in the article.</p>

that's not kabuki mask he wears. Kabuki uses no masks of any sort. it's a regular white mask.</p>

<p>Brian Carrol. Yeah right. Why would PFunk end up with a no name kid. No way. It is for sure Steve Vai.</p>
<p>You have no way of knowing that....he may not be Brian Carroll, but he's probably not Steve Vai either. Everyone should just respect Buckethead and stop discussing his identity. That's not what's important about him. It's his musical ability that we should be focusing on. *Lizz*</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seriously, do you have any proof it's Steve Vai? For one thing, Steve Vai isn't that tall. His hands are not that big. His playing style is completely different. Unless Steve Vai grows 10 inches when he puts on a mask, it's not him.</dd>

<dd>Big B's not Steve Vai. I'm a longtime fan of Vai, and while many guitarists are capable of easily switching sound, tone and style with their playing, there's certain little things they do that are a signature of their playing style that make it uniquely theirs. Buckethead sounds nothing at all like Vai. With a bit of effort, I'm pretty sure one could prove that they were playing at different places at the same time anyway.</dd>
<dd>Compare here <a href="http://www.vai.com/News/tourdates.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vai.com/News/tourdates.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and here <a href="http://www.livedaily.com/news/Buckethead_fills_up_on_more_concert_dates-10435.html?t=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livedaily.com/news/Buckethead_fills_up_on_more_concert_dates-10435.html?t=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>... in short, on Oct. 29 of this year, Buckethead was playing in Anaheim, CA at the House of Blues, while Steve Vai was in Wallingford, Connecticut at the Chevrolet Theatre.</dd>
<dd>The only name I've ever seen attached to him is Brian Carroll.</dd>

<p>His name is Brian Carroll. With 2 r's and 2 l's. YOu can tell Buckethead is not Steve Vai because of the way Vai uses vibrato.</p>

<p>It is obviously a Kabuki mask or a plain white mask, it isn't a Michael Myers mask because is doesn't have eye brows or the full face type of the slasher film character's. <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlame_d625.html" title="User:Vlame">Vlame</a> 03:20, 1 June 2006 (UTC) Vlame</p>

<p>IMHO the whole height issue is silly and should be deleted. So what if he's 7 feet tall with the bucket on? That doesn't make him 6'9". From the photos I've seen, I'd estimate the bucket adds at least 6 inches, which makes him no more than 6'6". Also ignored is the likelihood that he's wearing platform shoes, which could easily be 3-4" or more. So it's a non-issue. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocinante9_7653.html" title="User:Rocinante9">Rocinante9</a> 16:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes he does Killridemedly. -kylej 23:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No he doesn't kylej Buckethead wears mostly Converses. But they are not high tops. The Chucks i saw him wear at a concert were normal, as in that they werent high-topped, or platform shoes. I was literally 3 feet from his shoes.</p>

<p>The main reasons everyone thinks it is a Michael Myers mask is because when Buckethead signs autographs, he wears a Michael Myers. I have no source except for a picture of me with Buckethead from a concert. The main reasoning in my opinion for the different mas is because if he wore the other mask, people could easily pull it off. Permission to mention that he changes masks for autographs?

<p>There is not much comprehensive information about Buckethead's guitars through out the internet. Besides his customized white Les Paul, Buckethead owns many, many guitars. I'll try to summarize his guitars from his early days.</p>
<p><b>Black, Jackson?</b>&#160;: this was seen used in the footage from his DVD Young Buckethead.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MuPkOUB5CQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MuPkOUB5CQ" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HSH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios<br />
Bridge: Floyd Rose tremolo<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: no<br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>Blue, ESP MII</b>: Used throughout his concert in the Wetlands. This guitar seems to be smashed and broken and never used again as seen in a binge clip.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoxZ29v0ng0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoxZ29v0ng0" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HS<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios or Duncans.<br />
Bridge: Floyd Rose tremolo<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: no<br />
Inlays: squares? ESP model on 12th fret.<br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>Jackson Flying V, (mahogany)</b>: One of his less used guitars. Not much is known except that the pickups are Dimarzio's. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/buckethead_JacksonV.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/buckethead_JacksonV.jpg" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios<br />
Bridge: Floyd Rose tremolo<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: yes<br /></p>
<p><b>Jackson Flying V, (KFC)</b>: Again, almost identical to the brown flying v except it lacks the Floyd Rose bridge. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/16498904.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/16498904.jpg" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios<br />
Bridge: N/A<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: yes<br /></p>
<p><b>(psychedelic) Jackson?</b>: This guitar has never been played live as far as I know. But it seems to be used during the Praxis days with Brain, and Bootsy. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/dont_link_to_it1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/dont_link_to_it1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HSH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios or Duncans<br />
Bridge: Floyd Rose tremolo.<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: no]<br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>Ibanez Flying V X-series</b>: This guitar was used mainly during the Praxis years. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/Buckethead.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/Buckethead.jpg" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzios<br />
Bridge: Floyd Rose tremolo.<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: no<br /></p>
<p><b>Steinberger SG</b>: a cheaper version of the Gibson SG. This guitar was rarely seen with Buckethead. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/buckethead_GibsonSG.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a250/fobbyboy/buckethead_GibsonSG.jpg" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>Pickup Configuration: HH<br />
Pickups: Dimarzio/neck, original bridge<br />
Bridge: original bridge<br />
Momentary switch/Kill switch: no<br /></p>
<p><b>Takamine electric/acoustic</b>: Used mostly during his Colma tours back in the late 90s. Big B occasionally uses it during recent tours for a few songs. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ4KRkR-cr8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ4KRkR-cr8" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
