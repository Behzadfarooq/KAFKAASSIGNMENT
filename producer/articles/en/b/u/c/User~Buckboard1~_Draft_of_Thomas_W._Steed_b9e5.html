	    <p><b>Thomas Webster Steed</b> was a professional U.S. military officer in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Corps_f227.html" title="United States Army Air Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a>. During World War II he commanded the <a href="../../../4/5/6/456th_Bomb_Group_e4b8.html" title="456th Bomb Group">456th Bomb Group</a> (Heavy) throughout its combat service, one of only three bomb group commanders to train a group, command it overseas, and return it to the United States.</p>
<p>Steed was born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">October 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, at Mineral Bluff, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fannin_County%2C_Georgia_de3b.html" title="Fannin County, Georgia">Fannin County, Georgia</a>. His family later moved the to nearby <a href="../../../e/t/o/Etowah%2C_Tennessee_1fb8.html" title="Etowah, Tennessee">Etowah, Tennessee</a>. Steed was educated in the public schools, and attended both Tennessee Military Academy and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a> before entering the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Military_Academy_177e.html" title="United States Military Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1923 on a senatorial appointment. His initial efforts were unsuccessful and he was dropped from the Academy for academic deficiencies, particularly in required <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>, during the second half of his <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plebe.html" title="Plebe">plebe</a> year. Steed moved to New York City and worked as a digger in the building of the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_Street_Tunnel_62ce.html" title="14th Street Tunnel">14th Street Tunnel</a> under the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_River_6749.html" title="East River">East River</a>. Steed was reinstated in the autumn of 1924 as a plebe and successfully completed the four-year course as a member of the Class of 1928. Nicknamed "Sadie" and "Red", he was a popular cadet though older than most of his peers.</p>
<p>2nd Lt. Steed underwent flight training at the primary school, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks_Air_Force_Base_e1f5.html" title="Brooks Air Force Base">Brooks Field</a>, and advanced flying school, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Air_Force_Base_e18b.html" title="Kelly Air Force Base">Kelly Field</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, receiving his wings in March, 1930. His first unit assignment was with the 99th Observation Squadron at <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchel_Field_4473.html" title="Mitchel Field">Mitchel Field</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, from April, 1930 to December, 1932. In addition to the limited flying, he performed collateral duties as mess officer, armament officer, and squadron adjutant, and attended Cooks and Bakers Training School at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Slocum_d2ec.html" title="Fort Slocum">Fort Slocum</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>
<p>From January 1933 to April, 1936, Lt. Steed was based at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Field_dedc.html" title="Clark Field">Clark Field</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Islands_44d4.html" title="Philippine Islands">Philippine Islands</a>, with the 3rd Pursuit Squadron. In 1934 he flew escort for the first non-stop flight from <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>. Steed was promoted to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_lieutenant.html" title="First lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> in October, 1934.</p>
<p>In May, 1936, Steed transferred to the 32nd Bombardment Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_Field_90b6.html" title="March Field">March Field</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. He remained with the group to August, 1942, also serving in the 93rd Bombardment and 38th Reconnaissance Squadrons. He also had temporary duty as a student at the Air Corps Tactical School, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_Field_210b.html" title="Maxwell Field">Maxwell Field</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, in 1939.</p>
<p>While assigned to the 19th Bomb Group he received promotions to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> (June 1938), <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> (February 1941), <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_colonel.html" title="Lieutenant colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> (January 1942), and to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a> (March 1942). Major Steed received the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_91e6.html" title="Distinguished Flying Cross">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> in May, 1941, as a member of the first flight of B-17s from <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Air_Force_Base_adcb.html" title="Hamilton Air Force Base">Hamilton Field</a>, California, to <a href="../../../h/i/c/Hickam_Air_Force_Base_ab98.html" title="Hickam Air Force Base">Hickam Field</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.</p>
<p>From August 1942 to July 1943 Colonel Steed was assigned as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_staff_%28military%29.html" title="Chief of staff (military)">Chief of Staff</a> 4th Bomber Command, Headquarters <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Air_Force_9d7b.html" title="Fourth Air Force">Fourth Air Force</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, receiving the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Merit_56bc.html" title="Legion of Merit">Legion of Merit</a>. From this assignment he was selected to command the <a href="../../../4/5/6/456th_Bomb_Group_e4b8.html" title="456th Bomb Group">456th Bomb Group</a>.</p>
<p>Colonel Steed took command of the 456th at <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_Airport_9f3a.html" title="Boise Airport">Gowen Field</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>. In five months of training he supervised the development of the group from a small cadre of transferred personnel without equipment to a unit of 2,300 officers and men and 61 <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-24_Liberator_9446.html" title="B-24 Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers. Included in the training period were four changes of station that forced a reduction of phase three training, normally three months in length, to a month at <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwards_Air_Force_Base_d770.html" title="Edwards Air Force Base">Muroc AAF</a>, California.</p>
<p>At Muroc the 456th had only half the number of aircraft it required for training and was unable to secure equipment for high altitude bombing and gunnery practice which were necessary to prepare the crews for combat. When the Preparation for Overseas Movement inspectors asked Colonel Steed to certify his group as ready for combat, Colonel Steed replied that, as a professional airman, he could not comply. According to the group history of the 456th, Steed added that he knew the group would be sent anyway, that its members wanted to get into combat, and that the 456th would "fight one hell of a war." Despite efforts to have him change his position, the 456th was sent overseas without POM certification.</p>
<p>The 456th, based at Stornara, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, was assigned to the 304th Bomb Wing, headquartered at <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerignola.html" title="Cerignola">Cerignola</a>, as part of the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_Air_Force_ba44.html" title="Fifteenth Air Force">Fifteenth Air Force</a>. There it flew 249 combat missions from <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> to <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, with Steed as its only commander. The 456th achieved the only 100% bombing accuracy on a mission (and only the second in Europe) by the Fifteenth Air Force on its final mission. The group earned two Distinguished Unit Citations and seven campaign streamers. Its members were awarded one <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_f9eb.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, 19 <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Stars</a>, 215 <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_91e6.html" title="Distinguished Flying Cross">Distinguished Flying Crosses</a>, over 2,000 <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Medal_e5a6.html" title="Air Medal">Air Medals</a>. Colonel Steed was personally awarded the Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, seven Air Medals, and three <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commendation_Medal_e3da.html" title="Commendation Medal">Commendation Medals</a>.</p>
<p>While at Stornara, Colonel Steed met and married his wife, Julia, a captain and army nurse with the 34th Field Hospital, Cerignola. Colonel Steed returned to the United States in May, 1945.</p>
<p>His post-war assignments for the USAAF and after <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> the USAF were:</p>

In 1950 Colonel Steed had been severely injured during a training flight in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> when a crewman went berserk on the flight deck of Steed's aircraft. During an attempt to subdue the airman Colonel Steed was struck on the head with the wrench, causing a bone splinter that forced his early retirement.</p>
