<p>I have added a point to help emphasise the importance of boundary conditions, so hopefully readers will appreciate that it is of critical importance to correctly judge the boundary conditions of a real life structure if they hope to achieve any accuracy in their structural analysis.

<p>1. that elasticity and not compressice strength . . .</p>
<p>In my opinion the above sentence is nonsense. Since a high value of E (Young's modolus, modulus of elasticity) signifies a high "compressive strength" (just as it signifies a high "tension strength").</p>
<p>Stiffness is not the same thing as strength. The sentence makes sense to me: E is in the equation and there's no strength/maximum stress term to be found. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpindustrious_75ff.html" title="User:Spindustrious">Spindustrious</a> 16:16, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<pre>
   A short column under the action of an <b>axial load</b> will fail by direct compression but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by buckling (bending), the buckling effect being so large that the effect of the direct load may be neglected. 
</pre>
<p>I'm not sure this statement is correct. Any beam, regardless of the length, will fail in direct compression if the load is axial. A beam which fails due to buckling must have eccentric loading conditions in order to generate the bending moment required to buckle the beam. Axial loads provide no moment arm and therefore will never buckle a beam. In the real world, it is extremely difficult to create a true axial force and as a result it would appear that long columns fail under an "axial" load when in truth the load will be found to be eccentric due to some imperfection in the test.</p>
<p>The short of the long of it is that I don't think that the above statement is technically correct, and it might need a slight revision, perhaps something along the lines of:</p>
<pre>
   A short column under the action of an <b>eccentric</b> load will fail by direct compression <b>before it buckles</b> but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by buckling (bending), the buckling effect being so large that the effect of the direct load may be neglected.

<dd>Generally you are right but what you need is a <i>load with infinitely small eccentricity</i> (not exactly the same as <i>eccentric load</i>). I think that your proprosition could create some misunderstandings. Anyway <i>before it buckles</i> addition sounds reasonable and I will include it into the text. --<a href="../../../n/k/_/User%7ENk_5884.html" title="User:Nk">Nk</a> 12:06, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Alangstone is missing the point: consider a perfectly straight beam with a perfectly axial load. Of course buckling could not actually happen in those conditions. What theory says is that, if there is a arbitrarily small deviation in the shape of the beam (not in the direction of the forces applied), if the compression exerted is smaller than the critical value given in the text, the deformation of the beam is stable and will not grow catastrophically due to the axial load. However, if the compression exerted is larger than the critical value, then it can be shown that an arbitrarily small deviation of the beam shape will grow catastrophically due to axial load because the problem becomes unstable. Since, in real life, beams cannot be perfectly straight, buckling always happens over the critical value in absence of other stabilizing factors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the comment above. The theory mentioned (the Euler buckling equation) is the result of the first eigensolution of the differential equation that relates lateral deflection (ie-buckling) to an applied compressive load. To set up the equation, you must assume that the load does not act through the center of gravity of the section, but rather through a slight eccentricity, which generates a moment. Then you equate that moment to the restoring moment caused by the material stiffness. At some critical value of the load, the restoring moment will exactly counteract the applied moment, increase the load and the member will buckle. The argument made above suggests that a deviation in shape will result in buckling. This is true under 2 cicumstances:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, if the change in shape also means a change in center of gravity then by shifting the center of gravity, but leaving the load to act along the same line, you have in essence created a slight eccentricity and therefore also a moment. If the moment exceeds the restoring moment -- buckling occurs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, if the change in shape does not result in a change of the center of gravity, but it does reduce the material stiffness (think of a cone shaped column vs. a cylindrical column with the same radius - both have their center of gravity acting in the center of the circle, but the cylinder is stiffer because it has more cross-sectional area at any given point), then provided the load is slightly eccentric and that the column buckles, what you have done in this case is changed the problem such that the column is no longer a <i>short</i> column, but is now an <i>intermediate</i> or <i>long</i> column. Either way, the definition of a <i>short column</i> is that it will crush before it buckles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I do agree that my original proposed change was flawed, I find that NK's reasoning is more valid that the one above. That being said, this isn't an engineering textbook, its an encyclopedia. I think that NK is right that if we introduce the concept of eccentricity it will confuse the issue for non-technical readers, thereby defeating the purpose of the article. Personally, I'm happy with the way it reads right now. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlangstone_0916.html" title="User:Alangstone">Alangstone</a> 00:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment on the following excerpt:</p>
<pre>
 "If the load on a column is applied through the center of gravity of its cross section it is called an axial load."
</pre>
<p>I am aware that "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_of_gravity.html" title="Center of gravity">center of gravity</a>" --U.S. spelling--is commonly used interchangeably with "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Centroid.html" title="Centroid">centroid</a> of cross section." People may understand the intent given the context of the discussion, but, considering that this is an encyclopedia, it seems that the technically correct term should be used. The need for this change is possibly made more urgent by the article on "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_of_gravity.html" title="Center of gravity">center of gravity</a>," which makes no mention of the misnomer.</p>
<p>To be clear, the centroid is the geometric center of an area (for buckling, we are interested in centroids of <i>areas</i>). The article on "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Centroid.html" title="Centroid">centroid</a>" seems quite good so no need to reproduce it here. Centroids do not require a knowledge of the volume or the density distribution in the column, nor of the gravitational field in which the column resides. Perhaps if the buckling article discussed the buckling of columns under their own weight, then these other terms would be relevant.</p>
<p>The center of gravity on the other hand, while a mathematically similar concept, does involve the length of the beam, the density distribution, and the variation of the gravitational field. It, however, does not generally have any relationship to the issue of buckling.</p>
<p>So here is a proposed improvement to the above quote:</p>
<pre>
 "If the load on a column is applied along its centroidal axis it is called an axial load."
</pre>
<p><b>Would this change add value to the article?</b></p>
<p><br />
On a related note, I have long wondered how "<a href="../../../m/o/m/Moment_of_inertia.html" title="Moment of inertia">moment of inertia</a>" became synonymous with both "second moment of mass" and "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_moment_of_area.html" title="Second moment of area">second moment of area</a>." The "moment of interia" article does identify usage of "moment of inetia" for the the latter term as a misnomer. <b>So given the widespread use of the phrase "area moment of inertia," would it still be helpful to replace it with the (perhaps less familiar) more technically sound "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_moment_of_area.html" title="Second moment of area">second moment of area</a>?"</b> That article is quite good also.</p>

<p>In the article it is stated: "Examination of this formula [the Euler load] reveals the following interesting facts with regard to the load bearing ability of columns: that elasticity and not compressive strength of the materials of the column determines the critical load."</p>
<p>On this backgriound I am wondering why in Codes of Practice such as BS 5950 the load-carrying capacity of members in compression is dependent on material strength and not Young's modulus? The article does hint at a number of possible reasons ("a number of empirical column formulae have been developed to agree with test data" and "buckling will generally occur slightly before the theoretical buckling strength of a structure due to plasticity of the material"), but it would benefit the article to devote an entire section to this question. Does anyone know the answer? Is it already in the article? --Ahnielsen 21:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't want to start a revert war here, so I will explain why I am changing the opening paragraph back to the prior edit.</p>
<p>1) a member that fails as a result of buckling will fail at a <b>lower</b> load than the ultimate compressive strength of the material. It is _not_ possible for the member to carry a load above the ultimate compressive strength, as it would have failed in direct compression once the load reached ultimate. I tried to disambiguate this by adding the word "ultimate" into the opening sentence.</p>
<p>2) I have removed the sentence that read "If the actual compressive stresses were lower, it would not exceed the design requirements." This statement is not accurate. Just because a column is subjected to a load below critical for buckling, it does not necessarily mean that the member meets design requirements - there are other possible failure modes that must be considered which can occur well below the buckling load. (ex - Connection failure) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlangstone_0916.html" title="User:Alangstone">Alangstone</a> 03:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Happened across this page while looking for information on buckling of curved columns... While I'm sure Mr. Roland's neck is quite long and slender, and his head is sufficiently massive as to cause buckling in Earth's gravitational field, I'm not sure that this information is encyclopedic.

<p>A quick question on something that I have difficulty in finding anywhere in internet. What relationhsip is there between the change in length of the column, and the force applied, before the maximal load is applied? Foe example, I applied a force to a carbon fibre tube (thin walled and long), which caused it to bent. The force needed to start it bending was close to 20kg. As I increased the force slightly, it bent more. At about 22kg it was bent like a "U" and then broke. Or am I too deep in the dark to see that it is already answered? Harry Marx</p>

<p>Where does this formula come from? Doing some quick back of envelope equations seems to imply to me that it should in fact be pi^2 / 4 (~2.47) rather than 2.5. Is this an unnessesary approximation, or am I mistaken?</p>
