<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 13% for major edits and 11% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 122 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>. Thank you, and happy edits, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">Mathbot</a> 12:04, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think your suggestion is an excellent one--and made most courteously. I'm guilty more of spot-editting than anything else--See one mistake, quick correct it, then another, and another, and before you know it--twenty entries. I need to learn to use the sandbox more, too. Thanx for the encouragement and the critique. Buckboard 10:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's wonderful to see how polite you are with bots, considering that they can't get insulted. Also I appreciate the opportunity to learn from other people's oversights.

<p>I followed a link on this article and noticed that you recently did some clean up on Lakota. Your user page notes that readable English is one of your passions, so I thought I'd mention this article to you. Portions of the Little Hawk article seem almost like a transcription of an oral history. Neat information, but hard to follow. I thought maybe you'd enjoy taking a look at some point. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELookNorth_51b3.html" title="User:LookNorth">LookNorth</a> 22:34, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanx for the suggestion--I will see what I can do, if anything.--Buckboard 07:22, 14 March 2006 (UTC) See the article--I don't believe it was an oral history at all, but an attempt to substitute Little Hawk for Crazy Horse in a copyrighted article featuring the latter--and the article's author may not have been familiar with English idiom. The only way to know for sure is for me to check sources I have on Crazy Horse and his family.--Buckboard 09:57, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.</p>

<p>Hello Buckboard1, I run the <a href="http://www.powell-pressburger.org" class="external text" title="http://www.powell-pressburger.org" rel="nofollow">Powell &amp; Pressburger Appreciation Society</a>. People have debated long and hard as to whether Vicky jumps or falls. Dramatically it makes more sense if she jumps. It was the shoes that led her to her doom. I'll also have to correct that reference to a "neighborhood theater". It may not look much, but it was The Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill and was one of the major places to see ballet in London just after the war. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveCrook_7256.html" title="User:SteveCrook">SteveCrook</a> 20:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The lady that winced at the bad record changeover is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Rambert_c1e5.html" title="Marie Rambert">Dame Marie Rambert</a>. The joke is that the posters mention the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra_ac1b.html" title="Royal Philharmonic Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, but don't mention that they'll only be on record. However, regular patrons would know that there's no room for a full orchestra in there. Powell also said that he made the shot of the exterior of the theatre in the rain because that's how he always remembered it. It was an important place though, the home of the first ballet company in the UK, even before Sadler's Wells. Many famous names like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Ashton_0ac6.html" title="Frederick Ashton">Sir Frederick Ashton</a> started off at the Mercury. And of course (in the film) it's at the Mercury that Lermontov sees Vicky giving her all, even in such surroundings, before she realises that he's there. It's that which convinces him that she's right for the part in the TRS ballet. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveCrook_7256.html" title="User:SteveCrook">SteveCrook</a> 16:55, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The main one missing in your Powell &amp; Pressburger education of their Technicolor films seem to be the best of the bunch (IMHO), <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Matter_of_Life_and_Death_%28film%29_142d.html" title="A Matter of Life and Death (film)">A Matter of Life and Death</a>.

<p>I'd like to write an article on the the 101st operation in the A Shau Valley (Apache Snow) that culminated in the 8-day (or 10-day) battle on Dong Ap Bia. It's my opinion that history has been adjusted a bit in current writings about this battle. I'm new and have not written or edited an article so this will take a little time.

<p>Buckboard, I sense in you a person who is truly proud of being a Native-American. I believe that we can only honor ourselves if we honor those who came before us. That's why I wrote a "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hispanic_Medal_of_Honor_recipients_2aa1.html" title="List of Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients">List of Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients</a> article (or list). Have you ever thought about doing the same for the Natiev-Americans who have been awarded the MoH? I know that it would be a great thing to do and maybe you can do it. Poeple should know about the great contributions and sacrifices that Native-Americans have made to society. Just a thought. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">Tony the Marine</a> 19:34, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks I can put the GANominee tag on it again if you don't mind getting beat up on the article; I think it would give you the diretion to fix up the article or you can tag it for peer review by typing yes in the proper row.

<p>Hi Buckboard. In answer to your question, yes, Lilley was the 1890 coach, just as Ohio State's official list says. I believe Jack Park claimed Ryder was the 1890 coach based on an error in an article (available in University Archives) originally written for a 1964 football program.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuckboard1_e160.html" title="Edit section: WP:TGS and Userboxes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/g/s/WP%7ETGS_438a.html" title="WP:TGS">WP:TGS</a> and Userboxes</span></h2>
<p>The basic reason for the German solution is that somebody griped that userboxes were taking up too much space in the Template-space, so someone else suggested that instead of just removing all userboxes other than the babel ones, we could just move the boxes to userspace and create redirects. I'm not sure of the logic behind it or how it actually makes a difference...but apparently it does. So, that lead to what is now called <a href="../../../t/g/s/WP%7ETGS_438a.html" title="WP:TGS">the German Solution</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that you use the <i>move</i> function to move all of the history and data on the userboxes to some user's personal space on WP. Move also creates redirects automatically, so the user pages that already point to the boxes don't change in appearance. I think the final step of the process is to use auto-wiki-browser or some other scripting tool to then change all the links on the user pages to point to the userspace and then get rid of the redirect, but I'm not sure on that. So, to actually answer your questions: no, the userbox will not disappear and your user page will not change its look. Hope that addresses your concerns, if not, drop by my talk page and ask whatever you want. <a href="../../../z/4/n/User%7EZ4ns4tsu_4a2c.html" title="User:Z4ns4tsu"><font style="color:#1e90ff;font-weight:bold">z4ns4tsu</font></a>\<sup><a href="../../../z/4/n/User_talk%7EZ4ns4tsu_3fb6.html" title="User talk:Z4ns4tsu"><font style="color:black;">talk</font></a></sup> 02:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I won't revert your edit. The word elite is probably what bothered you in the first place and if you look at the wiki definition of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elite.html" title="Elite">Elite</a> it fits JV44. You may consider the word a value judgement - but it is not. That group of pilots was purposely gathered together to use new equipment, the Me 262. Perhaps there is another word that would describe them differently. That they the top pilots (as measured by air victories or whatever you want to call it) is historical fact. I don't see the reason with your comments regarding Erich Hartman. There is no question that war is evil. Hitler was evil. That is definitely the POV of most people. <a href="../../../m/f/i/User%7EMfields1_d689.html" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> 10:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No apologies needed, I understand what you are talking about. It is a difficult thing on Wikipedia to write articles objectively, and at the same time does Wikipedia ignore certain things?

<dd>Hey, thanks for the explanation--very good to know!

<p>Buckboard, you recently have begun changing the labels on USAAF and USAF wings, now listed under "Badges," from "decoration" to "insignia." Perhaps now would be a good time to question the proper terminology when discussing Air Force wings. Apparently, the U.S. armed services don't use the same terminology. The Navy, for example, is said to differentiate between a "badge," which is worn beneath ribbons, versus qualification "insignia," such as submariners' dolphins and aviators' wings, or ratings. I don't know what USAF regulations say about this subject, but it would be coincidental if the Navy and Air Force agreed. Without knowing more about official USAF terminology, I'd be inclined to use the generic term "military award" when describing current USAF wings now listed under "Military badges of the United States." Can you shed some light on this subject? Thanks for your substantial and superb additions to USAF history and the histories of its predecessor organizations. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Bethune_8dc6.html" title="User:Jack Bethune">Jack Bethune</a> 16:30, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re your last. I'm not in a hurrry. It is a big area. Just wanted to keep you in the picture. I've not yet gone to any sources I'd consider really authoritative or complete, just what's to hand. My thinking is, if you can find some of the best known—like those I mentioned, like the Hat in the Ring—we can date, authenticate, &amp; post them. (I'm looking at the Wikimedia Commons' Spads &amp; wondering if I can ID the outfits.) If I can find anything on the history, I'll add it, but to start with, a few notable examples &amp; a brief description of some of the uses would suit me. BTW, I'm thinking it should be a bit broad, including the likes of USN tail art. Any comment?</dd>
<dd>Re Taj. Is there another one?&#160;;) Y, you got it. Came to blues pretty late (after Stevie Ray's death...), but man, am I glad. If you can get acccess to it (shortwave?), listen Sat nites to CBC radio (2300 local, here), a program called "Sat Nite Blues", 2hr some of the best stuff you want to hear. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 20:23, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to let you know I haven't given up, here's some more leads:</p>
<p>Because of it being used on a commercial product (Rickenbacker car) the Adjutant Genral instructed the 94th. Squadron of the Army Air Forces to discontinue its use, and the Indian Head (of the 103rd.

<p>The F-5s used by DACT/Red Flag had a tiger's head on the fin (<i>Weapons &amp; Warfare</i>, volume 8, p881)</p>
<p>Some USN F8C-4 Helldivers (with red tails) had black top hat on red ring outlined in black. (volume 8, p882)</p>
<p>Georg von Hantelman of Jasta 15 in WW1 flew a Fokker D.VII with lozenge-camo wings &amp; white skull &amp; crossbones. (volume 9, p979)</p>
<p>Ki-48-I Type 99s of 8h Light Bomber <i>Sentai</i>, 3d <i>Chutai</i>, had tails decorated with two vertical diamonds &amp; 6 "feathers" (3 either side the stacked diamonds) (<i>Weapons &amp; Warfare</i>, volume 14, p.1604)</p>

<p>Thanx for the recognition. My "secret", if there is one, is that I write the articles in a sandbox on my user page and polish them up before posting them--much like writing a term paper, although that sounds pretty pedestrian. It's easier to footnote that way, and usually other details come to light during the cleanup process--holes I spot in the article, data I left out, and so on--that surprise even me. That makes it fun, and to me fun is the key to good writing. The key to a good article, though, is having good followup editors. I'm a dunce when it comes to uploading images--although I do pretty fair in Wikipedia commons--and the photographs others add are invaluable, as are their suggestions.--Buckboard 06:46, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, somebody beat me to the category of military brat, but I went through last night and updated all of the brats on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_military_brats.html" title="List of famous military brats">List of famous military brats</a> to have the category on their page. Well, the category has already been nominated for deletion. The reasoning is because it is a "non-neutral" term and parental occupation is irrelevant. Thus, I'm letting people who have contributed to the Military brat article know so that they can support the category.

<p>Just saw your edit changing characterization of NSAWC from a "center of excellence" to conducting "all facets of air combat training". I changed it somewhat as NSAWC is not responsible for all facets of air combat training in the Navy model. Unlike the Air Force, the Navy has grouped "type" airraft at relatively fewer master jet bases and provided Type Wing Weapons Schools under command of local Type Wing Commodore (Adversary support comes from CVWR-20, but used to be from same Commodore when those units were active duty). The weapons schools provide the first exposure to unit level/graduate training as a unit works up to combat readiness for deployment. Only after finishing lectures and flying in their syallabus do the units assemble as an air wing drawing in squadrons from across the country to undergo Carrier Air Wing training at NSAWC. NSAWC also conducts training for individuals selected for TOPGUN or Strike Lead training. All instructors at Adversary units and Weapons Schools undergo training at NSAWC and coordinate with NSAWC for standardization purposes hence its official designation as a "center of excellence" and my purpose in characterizing it as such.

<p>Saw your addition on whether Olds purposefully offended scoring a fifth kill over Vietnam. I believe that is exactly what happened and he knew it was his last flying assignment and would be yanked out of cockpit and his leadership role. After becoming a general and seeing poor performance in 1972, he volunteered to return as a colonel to help revive the spirit he created in 1966-67. What a guy! Glad you added that fact!

<p>Hi. We've crossed paths before, I think on the MOH FARC. Anyway, I see you put a lot of work into this article. I did a little on it. I think with an expanded lead and several more inline citations, it'd make GA. Thorsness knew <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Thomas_Coker_7956.html" title="George Thomas Coker">George Thomas Coker</a> in the camps in Vietnam. I wrote Coker's article and I personally know Coker, he's a good friend of mine. Anyway, do you happen to know a way to contact Thorsness?

<dd>Thorsness is no longer listed as an officer or on their Board of Directors, but I still believe this would be the place to start: <a href="http://cmohfoundation.org/index.html" class="external text" title="http://cmohfoundation.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation</a>.

I keep rereading that book along with a couple of Cozzens later works. I like the word "imperious" for Benny. Are you a fan of Cozzens or is it just this work due to military history interest&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, both. My first Cozzens read was <i>The Just and the Unjust</i>, which I read for a Lit course years ago. I kept the book and re-read it from a whole new perspective about fifteen years later after I had become a cop. Then I found <i>GoH</i> at a garage sale (not a first edition, but a 50's hardback). Cozzens can be a challenge at times--when he explicates on the thought processes of his characters, with lots of subordinate clauses (and parenthetical modifiers), and thoughts within thoughts--I often have to read them aloud to get sense of them--but that's more me than Cozzens. He uses dialogue well--not snappy banter which doesn't mean anything but real speech that at the same time advances the plot--and drops bits of humor in a timely fashion ("3 dits, 4 dits, 2 dits, dah, Ocanara, rah rah rah"). I'm halfway through my latest reading of Guard of Honor, but like everything else I do these days, I suaully check to see what wiki has on it!--Buckboard 09:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
