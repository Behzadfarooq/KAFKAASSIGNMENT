<p>Barnes (named after <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, the 15th <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, and the only president to be an acrobat, hence the homage) is an orphan, the son of a soldier killed in training at Camp Lehigh just before the United States' entry into <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As a result, he is unofficially adopted by the camp as a mascot. Nicknamed "Bucky," he takes to wearing a uniform and becoming savvy with the ins and outs of military life, even though he is a teenager. It was at Lehigh that he meets and befriends Private Steven Rogers, who by all appearances is the clumsiest soldier in the camp. This was at the same time that reports of the then-mysterious <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a> begin to appear in news magazines, and Barnes eagerly devours the accounts of this new hero.</p>
<p>One night, however, while peeping on Rogers changing in his tent, he sees that his friend was changing into the uniform of Captain America. Barnes makes a deal to keep the secret of Rogers' <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_identity.html" title="Secret identity">dual identity</a> if he can become his <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidekick.html" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a>. Rogers agrees and trains Barnes appropriately. Together, Captain America and Bucky fight <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> both at home and abroad, as a duo and as part of the superhero team known as the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invaders_%28comics%29.html" title="Invaders (comics)">Invaders</a>. Barnes also teams up with the sidekicks of other heroes in a group called the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Allies_e488.html" title="Young Allies">Young Allies</a>. Additionally, Bucky was <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retconned.html" title="Retconned">retconned</a> in 1976 as the organizer of the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashback_%28literary_technique%29.html" title="Flashback (literary technique)">flashback</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> superteam the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Legion_5276.html" title="Liberty Legion">Liberty Legion</a>, set between the formations of the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invaders_%28comics%29.html" title="Invaders (comics)">Invaders</a> and the post-war <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Winners_Squad_9be7.html" title="All-Winners Squad">All-Winners Squad</a>.</p>
<p>In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Zemo_8451.html" title="Baron Zemo">Baron Zemo</a> from destroying an experimental <a href="../../../u/n/m/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle.html" title="Unmanned aerial vehicle">drone plane</a>. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. They reach the plane just before it takes off. Bucky unsuccessfully tries to defuse the bomb, and it explodes in mid-air. The young man is apparently killed, and Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">North Atlantic</a>. Rogers' body, preserved in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspended_animation.html" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a> in a block of ice, is only found decades later by <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">The Avengers</a> (<i>The Avengers</i> #4, March 1964).</p>

<p>In 2005, issues of <i>Captain America</i>, series writer <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Brubaker_519f.html" title="Ed Brubaker">Ed Brubaker</a> returned Bucky from his seeming death near the end of World War II. He additionally revealed that Barnes' official status as Captain America's sidekick was a cover-up. According to this plot revelation, Barnes began as a 16-year-old operative trained to do things regular soldiers and the 20- to 21-year-old Captain America normally would not do, such as conduct covert assassinations. The night before the infamous incident with Zemo, the villain and his troops tortured Barnes while Captain America was forced to watch. During the drone-plane explosion that had apparently killed Barnes, the young man's arm was pinned to the plane — at odds with Captain America's memory of Bucky choosing to stay with the drone and attempt to defuse it. This is presented as a rationale for the Winter Soldier's biomechanical arm.</p>
<p>According to the file on the Winter Soldier, after the plane exploded, a cold-preserved body (minus an arm) was found by General Vasily Karpov and the crew of a Russian patrol sub. The recovered young man was revived in Moscow, though as a result of the explosion, he suffered brain damage and amnesia.</p>
<p>Programmed to be a Soviet assassin, he was given the code name the <b>Winter Soldier</b> and sent on covert missions through the years, becoming increasingly ruthless and efficient as he killed in the name of the state. The Winter Soldier's only sign of reluctance was in America in the 1970s; after killing his target, he suffered a breakdown and went missing for days.</p>
<p>The Winter Soldier was kept in stasis when not on missions, and as a result has aged only a few years since the closing days of World War II.</p>
<p>In the present day, the Winter Soldier catches the attention of Captain America when the Soldier seemingly kills the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Skull_e882.html" title="Red Skull">Red Skull</a> and Jack Monroe (Nomad) under orders from former Soviet general <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksander_Lukin_42eb.html" title="Aleksander Lukin">Aleksander Lukin</a> (Karpov's former protege). The Soldier's objectives are to retrieve the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Cube_b0ef.html" title="Cosmic Cube">Cosmic Cube</a> for Lukin and to play mind games with Captain America. He follows both orders, launching a terrorist attack on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>. The attack kills hundreds of people, charges the Cosmic Cube, and gives Captain America his first visual of the Winter Soldier.</p>
<p>The Winter Soldier kidnaps <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Carter_dd6f.html" title="Sharon Carter">Sharon Carter</a>, and when Captain America rescues her, she tells him she caught a glimpse of the Soldier and that he looked like Bucky. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Fury_36c8.html" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a> and <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> confirm the Winter Soldier's existence, but could not ascertain his identity.</p>
<p>When Lukin grows paranoid over the power of the Cosmic Cube, the Winter Soldier is ordered to bury the Cube in an underground facility in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>.

</div>
<p>Upon making it to the facility, Captain America fights the Winter Soldier, but urgently tries to make him remember his past as Bucky. Eventually, Captain America is able to gain the Cosmic Cube and tells him, "Remember who you are". Regaining all his memories, the Soldier becomes overcome with guilt over his actions, takes back the Cosmic Cube, and teleports himself to his and Steve Rogers' old Army base, where he breaks down and cries.</p>
<p>After the concluding issue was released, Brubaker confirmed in an interview that he intended no loophole involving Captain America using the Cosmic Cube to restore the Winter Soldier's memories:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Newsarama</b></i>: "But playing devil’s advocate — asking the Cosmic Cube to help you is very "monkey's paw" at best ... the Winter Soldier could have been, in reality, someone named Comrade Pitor Nikoli, created just to demoralize Cap, but with him wishing it to be so with the Cube, couldn't Cap just have willed the Winter Soldier to be Bucky, and so he was?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Brubaker</b></i>: "That wasn't how I looked at it. Look at what he said — "Remember who you are". He didn't say, "Become who I think you are". Or, "Be Bucky". It was very straightforward. Which is more the tragedy, since Bucky immediately has this immense guilt for everything he did as the Winter Soldier." <a href="http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=b58bf0b3f4ac23ca6c67b76bfc0cf995&amp;threadid=58008" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=b58bf0b3f4ac23ca6c67b76bfc0cf995&amp;threadid=58008" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a></i> #38 (March 2006), <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Samurai_506b.html" title="Silver Samurai">Silver Samurai</a> revealed/suggested that he believed the Winter Soldier helped Wolverine escape from the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a> facility years before when Wolverine first had <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a> grafted to his skeleton.

<p>In <i>Captain America</i> #18, the Winter Soldier is seen in London, knocking out a mugger who stole a woman's purse and reading a newspaper that mentions the arrival of Lukin in one week. Captain America later says he's convinced The Winter Soldier is out to kill Lukin.</p>

<p>Fearing that the deaths of Captain America and Bucky, if revealed, would be a blow to morale, President <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S.

<p>In 1953, an orphan named <b>Jack Monroe</b>, who idolized Captain America and Bucky, discovered that his history teacher also had a similar passion, to the extent of undergoing plastic surgery to make him look like Steve Rogers and assuming his name as well. In addition, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Director_0cbb.html" title="Grand Director">"Rogers"</a> had discovered, in some old Nazi files stored in a warehouse in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the lost formula for the Super-Soldier serum that had given Captain America his abilities. The two used the serum and began to fight <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communists</a> as Captain America and Bucky (<i>Young Men</i> #24, Dec. 1953).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "Rogers" and Monroe were unaware of the stabilizing "Vita-Ray" process used on the original Captain America. As a result, despite their bodies being enhanced to peak human efficiency, they slowly grew <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoid</a> and dangerously insane. By the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist. In 1955 the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> managed to hunt them down and placed them in suspended animation. The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, going on another rampage, and would be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after (<i>Captain America</i> #153, September 1972).</p>

<p>The original Bucky Barnes was trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand fighting techniques as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout.</p>
<p>As the Winter Soldier, Barnes has superhuman strength and reaction time in his cybernetic left arm. In issue #16, he used the arm to take down a spider machine that was terrorizing Pilsburg, Iowa.</p>
<p>Of the various Buckys, only Monroe and Hoskins had augmented strength and reflexes. Fred Davis, Rick Jones and Rikki Barnes were merely highly skilled in acrobatic fighting techniques. The baby Bucky obviously had no training.</p>

<p>Bucky used to be notable as one of the few <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book_deaths.html" title="Comic book deaths">comic book deaths</a> that stuck. A frequent aphorism among comic book fans, known as the Bucky Clause, was that "No one in comics stays dead except Bucky, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Todd_d1c6.html" title="Jason Todd">Jason Todd</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Ben_ea70.html" title="Uncle Ben">Uncle Ben</a>."<a href="http://www.passfailstudios.com/index.php?id=27" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.passfailstudios.com/index.php?id=27" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Ironically, all three have recently been brought back to life in their respective universes within the same real world year, although Uncle Ben turned out to be an alternate Ben from another reality. The clause is now "No one in comics stays dead except Uncle Ben."</p>
<p>Bucky's death has also been used to explain why the Marvel Universe has very few kid sidekicks, as no responsible hero wanted to endanger a minor in similar fashion.
