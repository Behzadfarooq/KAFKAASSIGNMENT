<li>Not all of Bucketsofg's edits are bad, and he is certainly not the worst offender in the Marsden entry. That pride of place would go to departed Wikipedia admin Homeontherange <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Homeontherange" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Homeontherange" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Bucketsofg is notable because has an ongoing campaign to discredit former Canadian MP <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmant_Grewal_ed13.html" title="Gurmant Grewal">Gurmant Grewal</a> and anyone associated with him. (Bucketsofg takes control of the Grewal article July 17, 2005, his first day on Wikipedia, and reverts most attempts to change it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gurmant_Grewal&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050625180804&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gurmant_Grewal&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050625180804&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.) Grewal may well be a great target for investigative journalists, but that is not Wikipedia is supposed to be about. The Bucketsofgrewal (Bucketsofgrewal.blogspot.com) blog is written anonymously. He also owns and uses bucketsdata.wordpress.com as a data repository to link to. I believe it's rather unethical, cowardly and more than a bit creepy that someone spends so much time and energy researching Grewal and writing about him anonymously. Bucketsofg's first edit, in June, 2005, was to the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmant_Grewal_ed13.html" title="Gurmant Grewal">Gurmant Grewal</a> entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060204152046&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Bucketsofg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060204152046&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Bucketsofg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and, in fact, he did little else until early this year, when he moved on to Marsden and other projects.

Yes, I had/have an investigative blog dedicated to the Grewal tapes that gained some attention last year. The blog is/was, self-confessedly, original research, something that I've consciously avoided on wikipedia. The assertion that my edits to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> are part of a campaign against Grewal and his associates is untrue and not consistent with the facts. Firstly, Marsden had no involvement in Grewal tapes and as far as I remember she is nowhere mentioned there; second, there are many individuals more closely associated with Grewal whom I've never edited in wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>His first edit to Marsden is to change her description from "blunt conservative" to "controversial conservative" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41074037" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41074037" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<li>Here, he removes the fact she was a catwalk model, which may or may not be notable, but is certainly as notable as many other parts of the entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41078778" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41078778" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

</li>
<li>He gets back to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grewal.html" title="Grewal">Grewal</a> stuff here, suggesting the fact Marsden worked in Grewal's office while facing very minor charges (re-routing e-mails and sending too much candy) is "controversial" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50883872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50883872" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Most of his edits will be done in a similar, incremental but determined way. Here, he agrees to use original research from his blog on the Gurmant Grewal entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bucketsofg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41256215" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bucketsofg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41256215" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

That I linked to the text of an article so that people could read it in context to make sure that I had not misrepresented its contents? That IanKing had made an argument about IMDb on talk that might be easier to assess as a blog post rather than a wikipedia-talk page?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>By February he was busy on Marsden and the entry for Ezra Levant, editor of the Western Standard, a magazine he has mocked on his own blog, www.bucketsofgrewal.blogspot.com but that suffices as his source for Marsden. In the title <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=54066416" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=54066416" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, the Western Standard calls Marsden a "fraud artist", an allegation that certainly does not come from any criminal charges and is not even made in the Western Standard article. Surely that should have raised a red flag.

But here he uses IMDB as a source on how often Marsden has appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and changes "frequent" guest to "occassional" guest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41196196" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=41196196" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

In anycase, this is what Donnelly said and this is introduced by "Donnelly appealed the ruling and went public with his side of the story. He denied any … He claimed…". Marsden's explanations of all these points come in the next paragraph. (One could add that the photographer who took the pictures later told reporters that Marsden had told him that she was interested in someone who didn’t seem to reciprocate and photos might help her win him over--but this section is too long as it is.)</dd>

<li>Marsden has a reason for sending Donnelly a Playboy magazine subscription, but Bucketsofg adds another quote out of context: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41265775" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41265775" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.

Yes, Marsden later gave a reason--the one found in the quote, in which she admits to the subscription and explains it. Out of context? More context could be added, but it would probably make Marsden look worse: the quote is from her (later leaked) testimony to the harassment panel hearing her complaint against Donnelly; it came a couple months after Marsden had denied being behind the subscription in her response to Donnelly's complaint, her words being: "Playboy subscription (!). When I saw this item I have to admit that must have laughed for about a minute. It provided excellent comic relief to a serious situation. I can guarantee that I am not responsible for this."</dd>

<li>When Ceraurus trimmed back the harassment material, Bucketsofg added more: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41376132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41376132" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Marsden refused to go into an arbitration, a decision that Bucketsofg starts using against her here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marsden-Donnelly_harassment_case&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44373472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marsden-Donnelly_harassment_case&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44373472" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and Bucketsofg doesn't bother to give the explanation Marsden made in that article.

That Donnelly's lawyer had objected to the proceedings and had given this advice is well corrobated. Nor is the advice inexplicable: this is what the Globe and Mail wrote in a lengthy article placing the Donnelly case in the problematic context of what university sexual harassment procedures were at the time: "Mr. Donnelly was not Ms. Marsden’s coach at SFU, the alleged harassment took place off campus, after hours and was a criminal offence rather than a civil one. That’s why Mr. Donnelly’s first lawyer wrongly advised him that the university didn’t have jurisdiction and he should withdraw from the process. Big mistake. By boycotting his employer’s disciplinary process, Mr. Donnelly has paid with his job." This is something Bourrie/Ceraurus never accepted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41092598" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41092598" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, dismissing it as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41092598" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41092598" rel="nofollow">"lame excuse"</a> and something that he later tried to remove as Ellis<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59189661" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rachel_Marsden&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59189661" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.</dd>

<li>Bucketsofg was a very active editor on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> last winter. During that edit war over the Marsden article, <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECeraurus_5025.html" title="User:Ceraurus">User:Ceraurus</a> was permantly banned for edit warring. Bucketsofg has a pattern of provoking edit wars, documenting the misbehavior that results, then using them, via administrator notice boards, to affect bans.

It is rather difficult to evaluate what I'm being accused of here without some diffs. But it is important to note that Ceraurus was <i>not</i> banned for edit warring.
