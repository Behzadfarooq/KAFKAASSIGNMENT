<dd>"it was originally a fortress, erected on the site of the Daco-Roman Thyanus"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I couldn't find any clue about a Roman fortress near Bucharest in any other source than 1911 Britannica. Anyway, it sounds like a Bart Simpson joke made up by the Britannica encyclopedists: "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=thy" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=thy" rel="nofollow">Thy</a>-<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=anus" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=anus" rel="nofollow">anus</a>"&#160;:-).</p>
<p>Was Bucharest erected on the site of Daco-Roman "Yourass"? <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> 07:52, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Uranus Hill is one of the names of the hill torn down to build the Casa Republicii / Palatul Parliamentului / Casa Nebunului. (p.s. I don't know which has more names, the building or the hill it replaced). <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Joe</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Joe Mabel: Removing anon contribution: "In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Bucharest's GDP per capita was around $19,000." Simply wrong: number way to high &amp; a city doesn't have a "GDP".</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the number is not too high according to <a href="http://www.anchete.ro/articol.php?limba=ro&amp;ID_articol=627" class="external text" title="http://www.anchete.ro/articol.php?limba=ro&amp;ID_articol=627" rel="nofollow">this article in Romanian</a>. And AFAIK, GDP can be calculated for a region or even a city. After a google I found <a href="http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact55.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact55.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> a UK government page with GDP statistics for areas in Cornwall. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 09:05, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting, on a few counts (I'd never heard the term GDP applied except at a national level, but "produsul intern brut" is certainly an equivalent expression). Hard to say what to make of the refeerenced article, though. It's all percentages, no hard dollar/euro figures. GDP for Romania gets tricky, because the exchange rate is so extreme: if you denominate GDP in dollars or euros, it is perhaps one quarter of what it is if you denominate in ability to buy goods and services locally. Still, this number seems awfully high: even using a cost-of-living-based GDP, I've never seen a number for Romania that was even a third of this, and I have doubts whether the GDP in Bucharest is really three times that of the rest of the country as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No question, though, that "apropie de 50 la suta din media UE" means "about 50% of the EU median", which probably would be in the range of the $19,000 figure given. Still, if Bucharest is at 50%, and the rest of the country ("fara a lua in considerare Bucurestiul") is at 22-23%, that would mean that even outside Bucharest the per capita GDP is about $7500, again a much higher figure than I've ever heard elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The GDP figures varies because of the method they are calculated. It seems that here around in wikipedia, the CIA factbook figures are used and there it says that it's $7600 ("purchasing power parity"). <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ro.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ro.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<dd>The weak status of the Romanian leu in international exchange rates makes it difficult to compare economic product of Bucharest to that of the European Union countries.</dd>

<p>This does not make any sense to me.

<dd>Because the domestic purchasing power of the leu greatly exceeds its foreign-exchange purchasing power. Thus a Romanian earning an annual income that has an international exchange value of US$3000 has a tremendously higher purchasing capacity than that number suggests to someone in, say, France. Different calculations of Romanian GDP vary by as much as a factor of four, depending on whether they are evaluating in terms of international exchange rate, domestic purchasing power, or some combination of the two. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:02, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking not from any specific knowledge of Romania in this respect, but from general world patterns, relatively prosperous cities almost always pay disproportionate taxes. At the other extreme, peasant farming contributes modestly to the GDP, but hardly at all to the tax base. It is also possible that, because most multinationals in Romania are in the capital, they are paying even more disproportionate taxes. It's also possible, depending on the tax structure (which I don't know much about) that certain industries concentrated in the capital are disproportionately taxed. There could be other factors like that. I'm not saying that the statement in the article is correct, only that it's plausible. Anyway, since there are clearly several of you with native Romanian involved, I leave it to you to pick apart the cited source. I was just attempting cleanup on what was already there. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:41, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Well, my aim is to get this article up to featured status (this is my second attempt, after the <a href="../../../c/%C4%83/i/C%C4%83ile_Ferate_Rom%C3%A2ne_37f9.html" title="Căile Ferate Române">Căile Ferate Române</a> article, which is currently featured. I think this article does need citations, I'm working on that now. As to grace notes, what specifically do you mean? I agree that the article doesn't really talk about the city's lifestyle or character. Is that a standard section in city templates? Secondly, I think we need a few more photos in the Law and government section - at least a photo of the City Hall or Prefecture, and of a Bucharest surface transport vehicle (preferably a nice-looking one, either bus, tram or trolleybus) in the Transport section. The Image Gallery should be expanded a bit with miscellaneous photos. My next article to work on will be <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Bucharest_87ca.html" title="Transport in Bucharest">Transport in Bucharest</a>, though I'm waiting for the formation of the Bucharest Metropolitan Transport Board (early 2006?) before that can get up to featured status. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 02:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not like the flavor of the place is a separate section, it's a matter of threading it through the article.

Or a section like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html#Seattle.23Annual_cultural_events_and_fairs" title="Seattle">Annual cultural events and fairs</a>: superficially almost a list, it manages to suggest many aspects of the city's life and its diversity. You could probably do something similar in Bucharest by talking about, for example, the diversity of the city's public markets, or its street food, or its parks, or the differences between the northern and southern parts of the city, or the changes to the look of the city as small businesses and advertising signs returned in the wake of the 1989 Revolution, or the repurposing of many communist-era buildings, or even stray dogs, homeless children, and <i>aurolaci</i>. Or the streets themselves, ranging from wide boulevards to lanes more suitable for walking, some well-maintained and some with potholes that could swallow a child, some modern, others cobbled… Not that one can get all of this into an article, but one can get some of it. (On the Seattle article, BTW, I'm frustrated that performing arts and sports keep wanting to grow at the expense of neighborhoods or politics. Then again, we've probably "incubated" dozens of articles in that Seattle article and then moved them elsewhere. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The Jews and Armenians do have a longer history, but they no longer many in Bucharest: Armenians were assimilated easily since they shared the religion with Romanians, while the Jews moved to Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. The Jewish quarter was between Unirii and Nerva Traian (where it is the Jewish Theatre). <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 10:45, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Don't forget the Gypsies, either, probably the city's most visible ethnic minority. As for the Jews, the Armenians, and (I would add) the Turks and possibly even the Greeks: not only minorities that are still present in large numbers are significant in writing about a city.

<li>In the transport section, we should add information about roads and all that (traffic jams, etc).</li>
<li>Other things you mentioned: differences among the different parts of the city - would Geography be a good section for this? As to Bucharest's urban problems, where should they be put?

<li>Agreed with the last statement. Still, we can certainly mention size of police force (unusually low, I believe). Yes, Geography would be good for the variety. As for urban problems: I don't have an instant notion of where to put them; maybe history, which allows them to be tied into the events that caused them? For example, the wild dogs can be mentioned in terms of the clearing of land for the Centru Civic, which almost everyone seems to agree played a large, possibly determining, role in that problem. As for homelessness, it probably belongs in demographics. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:14, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>For the gallery, it would be good to get a few Romanian Orthodox churches and a good photo of the Hanul lui Manuc (maybe inside the courtyard? the one at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanul_lui_Manuc_4bec.html" title="Hanul lui Manuc">Hanul lui Manuc</a> is a bit too bland to be worth using here). Also, at least one public market (certainly Obor market, but I bet someone who is in Bucharest with a digital camera could also get a great picture at Pantelimon or any of the others), maybe the Odeon Theatre (a beautiful building), and probably at least one modern, upmarket store or hotel. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:59, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To do</span></h2>
<p>The following things still need to be done before peer review (I'm writing this down for me to get organised and for you to know what's happening):</p>
<ul>
<li>Requested media - I've looked all over Flickr for the photos needed for this article and I've mostly found wonderful photos that I've included. However, there are some photos not available anywhere under a free license that are very important to the article. So, the following media are needed:
<ul>
<li>A photo of the Bucharest Prefecture, City Hall and sectorial town halls (any of these would do, all three would be best)</li>
<li><s>A pronunciation recording of Bucureşt in Romanian</s></li>
<li>A supermarket or a shopping centre to put in the Economy section (a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrefour.html" title="Carrefour">Carrefour</a> would do)</li>
<li>The files Jmabel talked about: a picture of the Obor Market and a theatre</li>
<li>Just a note - the photos should be nice and show the subject favourably&#160;:)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If it's sunny, I'll try to go on Monday and take a few pictures, Teatrul Naţional and the City Hall (it's next to Cişmigiu). The Prefecture is located in the same building as the City Hall. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 21:24, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>Architecture section to discuss the different architectures of the city</s> Done.</li>
<li><s>Information about roads in the Transport section</s> Done.</li>
<li><s>More high schools in the Education section</s> Done.</li>
<li>Information about differences between different areas in the Geography section (i.e. the character of different districts). <s>Where should the Gardens section be integrated?</s></li>
<li><s>Integration of Sights &amp; landmarks into other sections (this section should disappear)</s> Done.</li>
<li>Stuff about urban issues, what Jmabel proposed - police force, crime, homelessness (where do other cities talk about this stuff? - UPDATE: it should go in Law &amp; Government, as well as information about courts)</li>
<li>More info in the Demographics section - see FA city articles</li>
<li><s>Just a question - doesn't the Culture section seem a bit like a travel guide?</s></li>
<li>Another note - I don't think this article needs a gallery. It's much better to integrate photos and then make a link to Commons (which is there). If we just use the gallery for miscellaneous photos, people who go straight to the gallery just to get a general glimpse of Bucharest will see photos that will be nice but will showcase quite unimportant, miscellaneous aspects of the city. So - any photos that people now think "they're nice and should really be in the article" - if they don't fit into any existing section, then a new section or paragraph should be created somewhere to accommodate that photo.</li>
<li>Finally, we need a Bucharester to verify all the information and add to some of the remaining sections to make them more well-rounded.</li>
<li>Finally finally, we need more references and notes.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
<p>When we say "96.1% of the population are Romanian Orthodox", is that only counting those who profess a religion?

<dd>In Romanian censuses, "religion" is considered by most as the second field of "ethnicity" field. So, while around 25% of Romanians go to church weekly (in Bucharest it's probably more like 10-15%), in the census we only have 0.1% atheists.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 10:02, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, what Bogdan says is very true. Many Romanians state they are Orthodox because they see that as a <i>national</i> attribute rather than a purely religious one. Most Romanians are, however, passive adherents - i.e. they paint eggs at Easter, call each other for their saints day, have their wedding in a church, but they don't pray, go to church or even believe in God. As Bogdan says, it's only about 25% of Romanians that actually believe in God <i>and</i> go to church often. People actually declaring they are atheist is very rare (Personally, I declared "atheist" in the census), because Romanians unfortunately see not being Orthodox as not being <i>Romanian</i>. Therefore, we should probably find sources giving church attendance rates or surveys/polls, whatever, to gauge the rate of actual attendance and things like that. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 12:01, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the Roadnetwork</span></h2>
<p>Here are some point which could be included in the Road network subsection at Transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bucharest has almoast a round shape, centered at Romania's KM 0 near the University square and a radius between 10-12 km (the highway towards Piteşti starts at Km 11.4, because the numbering is made from the city centre - Km0).</li>
<li>Main access points:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>North</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>N1 - Through Băneasa from Ploieşti on DN1</li>
<li>N2 - Through Bucureştii Noi alongside the main railconection to Ploieşti on DN1A - the old road</li>
<li>N3 - the road from Târgovişte DN7 (I think also through Bucurestii Noi )</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>West</li>
</ul>
<dl>

<li>East</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>E1 - Through Titan Highway A@ from Constanţa</li>
<li>E2 - Through Colentina from Urziceni (???)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There is one main axis North-South going through the center from N1 to S2 almoast in a straight line.</li>
<li>An East-West axis is not so clearly defined.</li>
<li>There is an almoast complete NortWest to SouthEast axis along the Dambovita River.</li>
<li>There are 2 incomplete rings one internal and one external:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The internal ring is made up of a complete arch from North to South on the East part between "Victoriei" Square and "Sudului" Square (Market, Comercial center) (Iancu de Hunedoare Bvd, Stefan cel Mare Bvd, and Mihai Bravu Bvd (the longest boulevard in Bucharest and most likely alsi in Rom)). On the West part the arch is cut by the raillines serving Gara de Nord and also between the Soseaua Viilor and Soseaua Progresului (Nicolae Titulescu Bvd, Sos Orhideelor, Sos Grozavesti, Sos Geniului ,Sos Progresului,Sos Viilor, Serban Voda Bvd,Tineretului Bvd). There are planned projects to close this arch (Basescu's passage from Basarab and a cut through an industrial area at the end of Sos Progresului). The ring is made up of boulevards from 2 to 5 lines on each direction</li>
<li>The external ring is made up of an (not so much due to recent developement) exterior road with two lanes, one on each direction, incomplete between W2 and S1 (I think, not sure). The ring is mainly used by trucks on transit which are not alowed in the city so it is generaly either full of potholes, either crowded on the North section where the quality is better. It exist a plan to upgrade it to a 2 lines on each direction (highly unlikely to be finished in the next 5 years).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Inside the inner ring the N-S axis is made up of Magheru Bvd, Balcescu Bvd, Bratianu Bvd and Cantemir Bvd. Along tis axes lie the main squares in Bucharest: Victoriei, Romana, Universitate and Unirii. Two E-W axes exist, one crossing the University Sq, the other crossing the Unirii Sq.</li>
<li>Outside the inner ring there are about 20 main boulevards disposed radialy. Secondary boulevards connect these main boulevards spaning betwen 2 till 5 consecutive main boulevards.</li>
<li>One of the most crouded sections is the West to Nord link connecting the crowded Western quarters (Militari-Drumul Taberei) with the North buissness area. The road system is cut by the main railway line in Bucarest and both the Gara de Nord with only two link points: The Gara de Nord area, extremly crouded and having narrow boulevards, and the Podul Grant bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about all I can say about the road system. About the traffic, I have to search some statistics but the number of cars is between 600.000 and 800.000 daily inside the city.</p>

<li>That's probably too much detail on individual roads for this article, but it looks like the bulk of an excellent satellite Street layout of Bucharest article to write and link to. Also, Calea Victoriei and B-dul Unirii deserve more prominent mention, not because of transportation but because of their resonance in the city's history. (I suspect that there are others comparably historically important that don't leap into my mind right now.) In this article, I'd want to see more about when the boulevards were built than the kind of detail that is better conveyed by a map. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:20, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Orioane, thanks <i>very</i> much for that information. The reason is - after Bucharest, I'm going to work on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Bucharest_87ca.html" title="Transport in Bucharest">Transport in Bucharest</a> article. So, all of that detailed road information should go there, and it should form a very nice article, along with the current information on public transport. In the actual article, we should write a summary of main roads and their positions, about ring roads, about national roads/expressways that link Bucharest to the other parts of the country, how it's the main road hub of Romania, etc. Also, as Joe said, stuff about secondary roads and lanes, and their surface conditions. Then, also numbers of cars. Bucharest's shape and midpoint should be put in the Geography section. Jmabel - I don't think it's important to know about the history of the boulevards in the Transport section&#160;:) And we should also mention the Bucharest-Danube Canal currently in planning/construction.

<dd><i>Modern Bucharest developed around the first paved road, the "Podul Mogoşoaiei", a long road, built by the prince Constantin Brâncoveanu to link his estate at Mogoşoaia with the center of the then small town. It was built around the year 1700 and was paved with planks of oak wood. For a long time, this remained the main street in Bucharest everithing else developing around it. When the new king, Carol I came, he found a city of small and narrow streets, so that after the independence of 1877 a new city emerged around the old road, renamed "Calea Victoriei". Other streets, or "poduri" as they were known, were renaimed to commemorate this event and those names are still present. On the left side the new names are Calea Plevnei for the old Podul de Pamint, Calea Grivitei the old Podul Tirgovistei, Calea Dorobantilor the old ulita Herastraului, Calea Mosilor the old Podul de Afara and on the right side Calea Serban Voda is the name of the old Podul Beilicului and Calea Rahovei the old Podul Calicilor. The road alongside the river - splaiul Dimbovitei is renamed splaiul Independentii.</i></dd>

Thus appeared betwen 1890 and 1894 the Elisabeta bulevard and a new tramway was built runing from the Controceni area to the Obor area. As the city got crowded and the number o automobiles increased it was the turn of the North to South axis to evolve. Betwen the wars the north side of the city was enhanced, the wide boulevards Kisselef and Aviatorilor beind enhanced after the opening of the Herastrau Parc. Also, from the Victoriei Square, a new row of wide boulevards was built parralel to the calea Victoriei up till the Uniri Square creating a new centre for the city.</i></dd>

After the earthquake of 1977 a new massive project destroied almoast all the old city centre situated on the right side of the river, thus creating the Centrul Civic alongside the Victoria Socealismului boulevard (now Unirii boulevard), a boulevard longer and wider than the famous Champs Elysees in Paris, running from east to west.

However, your information is very interesting and it needs to be linked from the article somehow. A lot of it would be very useful in the History section, especially the last part. Actually, I think it should be all integrated in either the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bucharest_55d5.html" title="History of Bucharest">History of Bucharest</a> article or the summary of that article, which is in the History section of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucharest.html" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>.

<p>I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean. if it means the largest city between the longitudes of Berlin and Istanbul, it's wrong, as there's Athens, which is larger (about 3 million city proper / 5 million metropolitan area) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 23:28, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that's true. In fact, Bucharest can only be considered the largest city of the EU accession countries, that's about it. Athens is larger, so Bucharest is second in Southeastern Europe. If we want to maintain old definitions and say it is the largest in Eastern Europe (which has been said, before&#160;:), then Kyiv is larger. I'd say a more relevant statement, upon EU accession, would be that it's the 6th largest city in the EU. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 23:37, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The historical city centre and Lipscani - it's still listed at Sights &amp; landmarks, a section which shouldn't exist, and there are nice photos of this area (esp. Str Şelari)</li>
<li>The palaces of Bucharest - Creţulescu and Cotroceni particularly</li>
<li>The Museum of Romanian History, which is currently mentioned at Traditional culture but doesn't really belong there</li>

<p>Generaly this section is better now, so congratulations Ronline!!. I still have some ideeas, which I'll add here to comment upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the historical architecture:
<ul>
<li>There is nothing about churches and there used to be plenty of them - that is the oldest architectural element still in existance - a typical Bucharest Church is either Byzantine, or greek or Brancovenesc style, of small size. Today some small old churches still exist such as the Stravropeoleos Church, those two on the Calea Victoriei - in front of the Bancorex building and in teh Revolution Sq, the one near the Hospital in Universitatii Sq.
<ul>
<li>Colţea is the one in Universităţii sq, Creţulescu in Revoluţiei Sq (this one is in a very good shape and has an excelent position), the other one is Zlătari Church. --<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioane_5651.html" title="User:Orioane">Orioane</a> 00:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The center - around Calea Victoriei was mainly made up of imposing buildings most of which still exist: The Revolution Square with the Royal Palace (1930s architecture - IMPORTANT not to be forgot), The Atheneum, The Univerity's library; elswere on the CV: The CEC building, The Museum of History, the Military Circle, The Telephones Palace; elswere on the centre: The Justice Palace, the Univeristy, the City Hall. We should choose some of these buildings and add them also.</li>
<li>The outskirts - were still small houses but each of them had a small "à la mode" architectural element such as (ro:ghips) ornaments, or a small glass cover in the shape of a shell above the entrance (these were very popular) and one cen see many examples on the smaller streets on the east of the centre (Traian Street, Mantuleasa Street etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the communist period:
<ul>
<li>There were some positive additions up until the 70s: The Opera, The National Theatre, the Intercontinental Hotel, The Sala Palatului.</li>
<li>Up until the beginning of the 80s the <i>blocuri</i> quarters had quite a pleasant structure with lot of green spaces between the buildings, but then other buildings were built to "better occupy" the space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now:
<ul>
<li>There is an article about Bucuresti Mall which can be linked.</li>
<li>The most important landmark buildings are: Bancorex Building (the one on the first picture), BRD-GSG Building in the Victoriei Sq, Reiffeisen Building in the Aviatorilor Sq, the Chamber of Commerce Building (for Ronline- the one in the picture with the ship) all of them more than 15 stories tall and other office buildings such as Opera Center, Europa House etc. Also ABN AMRO is in the same building as the WTC so it shouldn't be there!!!</li>
<li>The Mariott Hotel - the good taste, practical use of a communist centrul civic type building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>Thanks for the info. I will integrate it in the Architecture section. Another thing - information about climate should go in the Geography section, as should information about variation in the city (i.e. income variation and characteristics between different districts/areas of the city) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline: National Day of Romania 1 December</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">16 years of freedom and loving it!</a> 04:17, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would definitely mention Stravropeoleos Church, which is a a gem and very central.</li>
<li>I've heard that Creţulescu may not have a good foundation in its current location, and may be in danger from the next earthquake,does anyone one know more?</li>
<li>I concur on the buildings on Calea Victoriei. The CEC building is particularly magnificent, probably worth a photo if someone wants to snap one. Calea Victoriei itself probably deserves an article, which would let us go into much more detail about a lot of notable buildings.</li>
<li>Question: this is probably more for the <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systematization.html" title="Systematization">Systematization</a> article than for this one, but do any of the native speakers have a come of <i>Biserici osândite de Ceauşescu, Bucureşti, 1977-1989</i> (Editura Anastasia, 1995)? I have a copy, but I'm afraid it is a very challenging read for me. It is very comprehensive on its topic, and has a lot about systematization beyond just what happened to churches. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:20, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know about the Creţulescu church, It was heavily restaurated in recent years, and I think it was finished after 2003 but I can't remember exactly. The problem anyway is with the whole centre, and I don't know how many buildings will survive a 6° Richter one. Generaly the buildings are clasiffied and the most endangered ones are marked with a Red Dot - I don't know if this should be added&#160;:). About the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calea_Victoriei_6745.html" title="Calea Victoriei">Calea Victoriei</a> I propose to start an article now and to make a TODO list. --<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioane_5651.html" title="User:Orioane">Orioane</a> 10:05, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
<p>Here's some ideeas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical Continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold windy winters.</li>
<li>Due to its position in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Plain_5d21.html" title="Romanian Plain">Romanian Plain</a> usualy winters are very windy, but due to urbanisation, the wind speeds are lower than outside the city (but still strong). Temperatures are generaly under 0C but also due to urbanisation it rarely drops under -10C.</li>
<li>In the summer temperatures of over 25C are usual, with extremes up to 30-32C, but with low himidity. Also due to urbanisation, in the city centre during daytime, higher temperatures are normal (35-40C and more).</li>
<li>Precipitations in the summer and in the winter are generaly rare, but the quantities are important.</li>
<li>Late springtime and early autumn are the most pleasant periods, with lower temperatures (around 18-22C). Precipitations in the springtime and autumn are more common but the quantity of rain per time period is smaller (Help here, I don't know how to express this in a better way).</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about all I can say from personal experience. --<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioane_5651.html" title="User:Orioane">Orioane</a> 18:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Districts Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>Ideeas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The North of the city is considered the most desirable and it is generay a villas region or small (rarely over 4 floors) appartment buildin. - Băneasa, Floreasca, Dorobanţi.
<ul>
<li>Here can be added also there is the Cotroceni area - in the centre.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The "Centrul Civic" area is a very desirable area due to the great surface of the appartments and the proximity to the city centre.</li>
<li>Then comes the west and the south area of the city which are considered of higher standards due to the presence of large parks, the reasonable quality of the appartment buildings and good public transport connections: Titan, Colentina, Tineretului.</li>
<li>Next there are medium desirable areas situated in the East and the South of the city, which are very crowded - Militari, Crângaşi, Dristor, Vitan, Sebastian, Pantelimon, 1 Mai - or further away from the Centre - the extreme south part: Brâncoveanu, Piaţa Sudului - or with bad public transport connections - Drumul Taberei.</li>
<li>The ill famed areas: Ferentari, Rahova and most of the peripheries.</li>
<li>The city centre is somewhere in the middle - prices are very high, superbe positioning, but appartment quality is very low because most buildings are old and some of them are prone to colapse at a strong earthquake, the area is crowded and there are little or no green spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it. Mabye we could search some statistic data somewhere. --<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioane_5651.html" title="User:Orioane">Orioane</a> 23:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not quite - there is in the East side of Calea Victoriei mainly only Cismigiu, but on the West side, which is considered also the Centre there are parks like Gradina Icoanei (behind the Anclican Church) or in front of the St George Church - at the end of Lipscani St - although it's crouded but it also counts.&#160;:D --<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioane_5651.html" title="User:Orioane">Orioane</a> 09:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review</span></h2>
<p>Although we are still improving the article, and should continue to do so, I think it might be time to place it on peer review; in particular, it will be useful to get comments from people who have never been there. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One remark I want to make as we head toward FA: Yes, this is a little on the long side, but I think it is turning into a really excellent article, and I think it merits its length. It's really hard to see anything that could beneficially be cut, although perhaps <i>something</i> could be refactored to an article in its own right. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm, difficult to cut something. Mabye "Treaties signed in Bucharest" could be, because except the one from 1913 the rest don't have a huge international importance. And also hitory could be a little more condensed, for example the Centrul Civic reference could be removed because it already is more detailed in the Architecture section. Also the list of airlines could be removed because if we state that Bucharest is a big city, it is certain that the most important airlines will flow there. We could say something like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The city is served by two airports: Henri Coandă International Airport (formerly Otopeni) and Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (formerly Băneasa). Henri Coandă is the biggest airport in Romania and the main hub for the national operator TAROM. Daily flight connects it to the most important european airports. The smaller Aurel Vlaicu Airport is used for charter flights and low cost carriers.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also we could merge the two road transport paragraphs like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The city's municipal road network is centred around a series of high-capacity boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts. The main axes: north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast and the ring roads, one internal and one external, support the bulk of the traffic. The city's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. Every day, there are more than one million vehicles travelling inside the city.[7] This has resulted in potholes appearing on many Bucharest roads, particularly secondary roads, this being identified as one of Bucharest's main infrastructural problems. In recent years, there has been a comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure and according to the general development plan, nearly 2000 roads are expected to be repaired by 2008.[8]</i></dd>

<dd>Sorry for not writing here recently - I've been involved at Talk:Moldovan language, in that interminable dispute, and I've been on a dialup connection in the past few days. Now, everything's fixed. So - I don't think anything should be condensed as of yet, though I think Orioane's idea about the Transport section is good - it should probably be condensed further, especially the roads section, with the current detailed version moved to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Bucharest_87ca.html" title="Transport in Bucharest">Transport in Bucharest</a> (I think it's already there).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Justice, crime and police</span></h2>
<p>I think one of the only remaining parts that needs to be added is one about justice. This should be put at the end of the Law and government section and should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>information about the courts of Bucharest (the municipal courts, the sectorial courts, any specialised courts, as well as national courts located in Bucharest - Curtea de Casaţie, etc)</li>
<li>information about police in Bucharest - the number of police officers, the way in which the force is organised, different institutions (Jandarmeria/Politia Comunitară, etc), who manages the police (municipality? sectors?)</li>
<li>information about crime in Bucharest - overall level of crime (which is quite low), main <i>types</i> or crime (as far as I know, petty crime is fairly abundant), geography of crime (i.e. where crime occurs, what areas of the city)</li>

<li>There are tribunals in each sector, but I am not sure if there is one at the city level (I think not - never heard of one). Also, there is a military tribunal, a civil and military court of appeal (Curte de Apel), and also the main national institution like as you said Inalta Curte de Casaţie, or Consiliul Suprem al Magistraturii are based in Bucharest.</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>The main headquarters of Romanian Police (IGP - Inspectoratul General al Politiei) are in Bucharest (that bulding underneath the Bancorex Tower on the first photo). There is the Bucharest Police on the Stefan cel Mare Boulevard which is responsable for the whole Bucharest (crime, special divisions etc), and there are small police stations (Sectii) throughout the city (proximity police and <i>evidenta populatiei</i>). The road police (Politia Rutiera) is a separate entity, and has recently been divided according to the sector division (funny thing, Universitatii square belongs to 4 sectors and depending on which side one makes an accident he has to go to a different police road section). Each sector has under its administration the Community police (think that the City Hall does not have that) and the Jandarmerie is under the dirrect authority of the Internal Affairs Ministry and is organised at the city level, the same as in every county.</li>

<ul>
<li>Pickpoketing is common on the buses and tramways during rush hours, especialy on the crouded periphery lines. Beggars are quite frequent and there are quite a lot of childrens begging (there are speculations about the existence of professional underground networks). During nighttyme recenly illegal roadraces have appeared on the periphery boulevards. Police have managed recently to fight against some crime clans - Camataru, etc. but generaly organised crime keeps a very low profile (not like Bulgaria). There are ocasional turbulences in the quarters with a great number of roma population (Ferentari, Giulesti and the outskirts) but usualy police acts very quicly and there haven't been mass confruntations in recent period. Institutional corruption is the biggest problem, and it is considered somewhat higher than the rest of the country.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>
<p>Buna ziua to all Romanian readers. I just wanted to make one point about a change I made to your site: Communist style architecture - does not exist in any shape or form. Architecture is attributed to races, nations, cultures, and individuals, not political movements. The basic box-design of buildings seen in Bucharest were mostly built after World War II and the reason was to house the people of Bucharest who lost their homes during the war. It is interesting to note that it is not only in Communist countries that you had this phenomenon; all over Germany every town there are large sections of residential blocks, many of which much weaker and uglier than those in Bucharest. The whole of East and South-east London STILL looks like a 1946 lego-set for many people with the misforture of taking an overground train through Plaistow, West Ham, Stratford, Peckham and Southwark. The list is endless. I know a fair bit about the Communism of Romania and like anywhere else, people were not thrown out of homes and shifted to these apartments, as as for the design, well that just continued to get better with the years. 70's buildings are better than 50's, and 80's better than 70's. I adore Bucharest and although I am not a communist, I'd hate to see the reputation of Bucharest fall into the hands of Anti-Communists who will do all they can to critisize Romania from 1945-89. They were the ones who invented the term 'Communist Architecture' throughout the socialist world. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECeltmist_2b05.html" title="User:Celtmist">Celtmist</a> 31.12.05</p>
<p><br />
You're mistaken in a number of assumptions -First&#160;: architecture is driven by symbols, motives and ideas, like every other art around (as architecture is as much art as is science). When an entity is the only permitted generator and regulator of allowed ideas and is in control of all the symbols, such as a totalitarian regime is, you may consider that that entity is the generator of that art - that's why it's correct to say "communist architecture", "stalinist architecture", "nazi architecture". Even more, in such a regime ideology itself engulfs all other aspects of life, becoming the sole force that drives society - all other entities but the ruling one (say cultures, individuals, nations, races, organizations) exist either only in name (and identify in and through the identity of the ruling entity) or are illegal and therefore irrelevant. I've heard the phrase "communist architecture" a number of times in professional studies and research papers (although I am no architect, nor am I professionally linked to the field of architecture) and it refers to the general approach to architecture in the Communist Bloc starting 1956-1961 (destalinization) and ending with perestroika - it's also known as "Khrushchev's architecture". It's in no way a derogatory term, it's simply designed to distinguish and name this style in building and to associate it to the school of thought that gave it birth (bureaucratic communism). You are right in assuming that one of the considerations when designing the blocks and setting the GOST standards in the USSR where of a very practical nature - that is, housing as much citizens in as little space and with as little spending per housing unit, in a non-car public transport environment - and that this hypothesis also existed among western architects in the 1940's and 1950's - and therefore there are some slightly similar outputs - but there's where the similarities END. For example, you say that much of the blocks were built in the aftermath of World War II - that's NOT TRUE. Bucharest suffered little destruction in World War II (it was hard to reach, and Ploieşti, 60 km to the north was a far more important target - only around 25 buildings were struck by bombing - notably the old National Teathre). What was built between 1945 and 1955 was almost entirely of monumental nature (<a href="../../../c/a/s/Casa_Sc%C3%A2nteii_b8f5.html" title="Casa Scânteii">Casa Scânteii</a>, a snowcone skyscraper similar with Warsaw's Palace of Culture or Moscow's University or Hotel Ukraine) or semi-luxury housing for the mid party apparatus or officers (on a very, very small scale - a few villas and 3 stories blocks near the Military Academy, a showcase neighborhood of around 20 blocks in Vatra Nouă/Bucureştii Noi). All these buildings followed very high specs in construction. The housing crisis was solved simply - nationalization of homes and setting up of communal housing (yes, throwing people out of their homes) - a room for two or three persons. This housing crisis reached peak in 1960, so no World War II to blame here! After 1960, with sprawling urbanization and industrialization, this was no longer possible, and Romania, as well as other East-Central European Countries copied the housing projects of the Russians, they fitted the regime best - both cheap to implement, respecting the practical issues, and befitting the ideological profile required - simple surveillence (one very small hallway for the whole block, administrator rooms next to the hallway), ideological conformity (all looked the same - at least on the outside). Much of these buildings, however, are not the concern of the article - most were built in the suburbs, over former agricultural fields. And architects tried to make the best out of the situation - even coming with interesting solutions (such as in Drumul Taberei or 1 Mai). Again, you are mistaken that they became better and better through the years, the opposite was the case - the largest and most comfortable apartaments were built amongst the first (1 Mai and Dinicu Golescu in 1960-1962), with the later (1975-1979) being the worst (they were built at an ever faster pace, and with fewer and fewer available material - check Pantelimon, Rahova, Ferentari and compare the confort of the projects - both when they were built and now). After 1980, however, Ceausescu wanted to redesign the entire city, and began demolishing and bulldozing much of the center of the city (including heritage buildings and yes, throwing people out of their homes AGAIN) and building blocks to a very ornate (and many would say kitsch) style, completely different from the previous architecture (including from the former communist architecture). This was called <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systematization.html" title="Systematization">systematization</a>, and between 50.000 and 150.000 people were thrown out of their homes between 1980 and 1989 and relocated in new blocks to make way for the "Casa Poporului, Bulevardul Victoriei Socialismului and Centrul Civic". So please, do not make assumptions where you have no information. --<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanthar_3681.html" title="User:Xanthar">Xanthar</a> 21:14, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I 90% agree with what Xanthar just wrote; I would point out, though, that similar government-built housing from the same era exists, for example, in the U.S., the UK, France, etc., and much of it is inferior to what is in Bucharest; and that one can even find commercial developments that are rather similar (Co-op City in the Bronx, Lefrak City in Queens, for example). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No assumptions were made; I knew what I was talking about. I accept that I was not totally familiar with everything you said (you, who wrote the long paragraph), but I do know for a fact that there were many buildings built in the early 80's in Bucharest which were nicer than the existing buildings constructed 20 years earlier. When I find out the name of the area, I'll let you know. So Bucharest did not suffer much carnage in WWII, I am happy for you. London did, but even where it didn't, much of the same thing happened there. I currently rent a 14th floor flat in a complex built in 1951 in an area called Putney overlooking rows and rows of other cardboard block crumbling erectings. If communism is why you have it in Bucharest, what do you call this architecture in London? and that of Paris? Barcelona? Munich? Hamburg? Nowhere escapes it. I did not know that people lost their homes to be pushed into these blocks, I knew that in Socialism many people lost land and businesses but I did not know that losing plain old houses came with it. I'll take your word for it - either way, IF there is any such thing as Communist architecture, then this can only be the official buildings such as a presidential palace, ministry of health headquarters, but the ones used may have been Pre-war buildings. I guess I live in capitalist architecture!!! By the way, just because many people still call it 'Communist architecture' doesn't mean that it is. To me, housing apartments are housing apartments, not Ceausescu-ite, Austro-Hungarian Habsburg Stalinist Napoleonic etc.<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECeltmist_2b05.html" title="User:Celtmist">Celtmist</a> 06-01-06</dd>

<dd>Anittas, it's not the city's fault. It was Ceauşescu's policies which resulted in these things being widespread across the country, and I can ensure you that in other cities of Romania there is the same problem, just on a smaller scale due to a smaller population. As to other European cities - the problem is there, it's just not as visibile. Reports by the Council of Europe put Bucharest as ranked somewhere in the middle in terms of street children. The problem is that the street children do live worse lives in Bucharest, due to the aurolac and lack of shelters. Yes, it's a problem. But both the article and the Municipality of Bucharest deal quite significantly with this issue. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:18, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree that the lack of shelters is the striking part of this, and in that respect Bucharest is pretty bad. I doubt that the sheer number of homeless children is any larger than the number in an American city of the same size, but the lack of indoor sleeping facilities or even an organized camping situation is atypically bad for a city that is even moderately prosperous. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:04, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
