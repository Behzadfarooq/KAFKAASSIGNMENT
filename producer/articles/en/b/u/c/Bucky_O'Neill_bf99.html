<p>Bucky was born on February 2, 1860, either in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, or <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, although he sometimes listed Ireland as his birthplace. This last is doubtful since his parents had been in the United States since the 1850s. During the Civil War, his father, John, served as a captain in the 116th Pennsylvania Volunteers of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Brigade_5371.html" title="Irish Brigade">Irish Brigade</a>, and was severely wounded at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fredericksburg_aa81.html" title="Battle of Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>.</p>
<p>In 1879, Bucky left home, heading for <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Territory_7e22.html" title="Arizona Territory">Arizona Territory</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Tombstone" id="Tombstone"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky_O%27Neill_bf99.html" title="Edit section: Tombstone">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tombstone</span></h2>
<p>In 1880, Bucky settled in <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone.html" title="Tombstone">Tombstone</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. During this time the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earp.html" title="Earp">Earp</a> Brothers, the city policemen, and the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clanton.html" title="Clanton">Clanton</a>-McLaury Gang, a group of rustlers and murderers, were at war with each other. Bucky joined up with the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone_Epitaph_bc23.html" title="Tombstone Epitaph">Tombstone Epitaph</a>, and being a pro-Earp newspaper, Bucky frequently talked with, and became a casual acquaintance of the Earps. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a> the war escalated.

Only Wyatt remained unharmed. <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ike_Clanton_569e.html" title="Ike Clanton">Ike Clanton</a>, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claibourne ran away from the battle.</p>
<p>Bucky O'Neill may have been the man to report on the scene, or he may not have. Bucky left Tombstone shortly after, heading for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescott%2C_Arizona_8aa1.html" title="Prescott, Arizona">Prescott, Arizona</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky_O%27Neill_bf99.html" title="Edit section: Prescott">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prescott</span></h2>
<p>Bucky O'Neill arrived in Prescott in the spring of 1882. There he rapidly progressed in his journalist career. Starting as`a court reporter, he soon founded his own newspaper called Hoof and Horn, a paper for the livestock industry.</p>
<p>Bucky became captain of the Prescott Grays, in 1886, and witnessed the hanging of murderer Dennis Dilda, which was an embarrassing event for O'Neill. The Grays were the Prescott region unit of the Arizona militia, now known as the Arizona <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>, Bucky O'Neill married Pauline Schindler. They had a son, but he died shortly after being born premature.</p>

Bucky O'Neill and the Prescott Grays stood honor guard for the event. When the trap dropped, Bucky fainted. He wouldn't get over the incident until 1891. Bucky wrote a story called ''<i>The Horse of the Hash-Knife Brand."</i> In it, a member of a posse admits to nearly fainting at the hanging of a horse thief.</p>

<p>In 1888, while serving as <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavapai_County_1f0e.html" title="Yavapai County">Yavapai County</a> judge, Bucky was elected the sheriff, running on the Republican Ticket.</p>
<p>The most famous incident in O'Neill's lawman career happened on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>. 4 masked men robbed the Atlantic and Pacific passenger train, in Diablo Canyon. A four man posse, made up of Bucky O'Neill, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Black_cf4b.html" title="Jim Black">Jim Black</a>, Carl Holton, and Ed St. Clair, was soon formed and they took off after robbers. On March 21, O'Neill and his posse caught up with the robbers. After exchanging rifle shots, the posse captured the 4 men. During the fight, no men were injured, but O'Neill's horse was killed.</p>
<p>The 4 men were William Sterin, John Halford, Daniel Harvick, and J. J. Smith. All 4 were sent to the <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yuma_Territorial_Prison_4241.html" title="Yuma Territorial Prison">Yuma Territorial Prison</a>, but were pardoned 8 years later. In 1898, William Sterin enlisted in the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Riders_7059.html" title="Rough Riders">Rough Riders</a> under the name Henry Nash, posing as a school teacher from <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawberry%2C_Arizona_d33e.html" title="Strawberry, Arizona">Strawberry, Arizona</a>. Little did Bucky know, that one of his sergeants was an outlaw whom he had arrested.</p>
<p>After his term was up, Bucky was elected unanimously Mayor of Prescott.</p>

<p>In 1898, war broke out between the U. S. and Spain. Buckey soon enlisted as Captain of Troop A in the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Riders_7059.html" title="Rough Riders">Rough Riders</a>. Along with Alexander Brodie and James McClintock, Bucky tried to make an entire regiment made up of Arizona Cowboys. Eventually though, only 3 troops were authorized.</p>

<p>The Rough Riders landed at <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daiquir%C3%AD.html" title="Daiquirí">Daiquiri</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>.

Upon seeing this, Bucky jumped in the water in full uniform, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabre.html" title="Sabre">sabre</a> and all. At a time when Negroes were disliked by white men, this was unheard of. None the less Bucky searched for the men for 2 minutes, before having to come up for breath.</p>

<p>Bucky was, unfortunately, involved in an incident of friendly fire. Bucky saw several men, who he believed were Spaniards, across the road from him during the battle. He shouted "Hostiles on our right, fire at will!" Bucky learned after the firing ceased, that the men he exchanged shots with were Cuban rebels.</p>
<p>Bucky soon led his troop to the Spanish flank, and captured it. The victory gave the men all the hope they needed on winning the war.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky_O%27Neill_bf99.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, at about 10 o'clock in the morning, the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Riders_7059.html" title="Rough Riders">Rough Riders</a> and the 10th cavalry were stationed below <a href="../../../k/e/t/Kettle_Hill_8270.html" title="Kettle Hill">Kettle Hill</a>. The Spaniards, who were on top of the hill, poured down on the Americans with machine gun and <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauser.html" title="Mauser">Mauser</a> fire. Buckey O'Neill was killed in action.</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt wrote about the death of O'Neill: "The most serious loss that I and the regiment could have suffered befell just before we charged. Bucky O'Neill was strolling up and down in front of his men, smoking his cigarette, for he was inveterately addicted to the habit. He had a theory that an officer ought never to take cover - a theory which was, of course, wrong, though in a volunteer organization the officers should certainly expose themselves very fully, simply for the effect on the men; our regimental toast on the transport running, " The officers; may the war last until each is killed, wounded, or promoted." As O'Neill moved to and fro, his men begged him to lie down, and one of the sergeants said, " Captain, a bullet is sure to hit you." O'Neill took his cigarette out of his mouth, and blowing out a cloud of smoke laughed and said, " Sergeant, the Spanish bullet isn't made that will kill me." A little later he discussed for a moment with one of the regular officers the direction from which the Spanish fire was coming. As he turned on his heel a bullet struck him in the mouth and came out at the back of his head; so that even before he fell his wild and gallant soul had gone out into the darkness."</p>
