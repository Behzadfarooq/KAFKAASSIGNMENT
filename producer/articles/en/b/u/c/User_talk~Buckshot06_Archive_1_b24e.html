<p>Welcome to wikipedia but I see that you are adding incorrect categories to articles. There is no need for the Air Force unit category as the articles already have a category that is a subset of that. They are redundant and will need to be removed.

<p>Hello - thanks for the message. You're correct - just rewrite it in your own words and you'll be fine.</p>
<p>I somehow have a nose for sniffing out copyvio... I looked at the website you referenced because I was sure it was in the public domain, but it says (link is at the bottom of the page, under 'Crown Copyright') that people can download to a file or printer, but all other use is copyrighted. That conflicts with US government work product, which is entirely in the public domain. We get lots of nice <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> pictures that way, 'cause they technically belong to us (Americans) anyway.&#160;:-D Happy editing - <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 08:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Buckshot just want to say you're doing great work on modern British units. I work on their WWII history but know quite a bit about the British Army today. If you need a hand with sources or links to back up information you have just ask I might be able to help. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 16:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello mate. Do you mean the 5th Brigades (plural)? How many pages are there? By the way if you want to leave a message for someone use the discussion page and sign your name using the shift button and 4 tiles (that is the little squiggly thing on the hash key normally above the shift key). I do not know there real names! Hope you understood that. Doing that will leave a signature of your user name so others can identify you.</p>
<p>Back to the brigades though they are in a bit of a mess hey. What's happened is that the only list of British Army brigades has been with their WWII titles (<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Brigades_in_World_War_II_676b.html" title="British Brigades in World War II">British Brigades in World War II</a>). I reckon we should create a list of the modern British Army brigade names, as they are used today. It would aid people using Wiki from the outside. The same problem exists for the WWI brigades. The other thing we could do is as you and I are doing already; amalgamate the different pages and have their whole history on one page, but I reckon that could get pretty big in the long run. What do you think? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 14:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ahhh. I see what you mean. You were talking about the divisions. Same problem applies. People have already merged 5th Divisional titles from different periods and put them under one name. Not good. What we have to do here is create three separate pages. The division during each war had complex histories, and then followed by it's post WWII history would make that one hell of a big page. Is the 5th Division in existence right now? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 14:49, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, no. Check out some of the US divisions - United States 1st Infantry Division for example. Long, detailed articles about the whole history of the Div without swapping through two or three pages. I think that's the model to follow, and its a logical expansion for what I've been doing with some of the regional brigades. I really think this is the way to go. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 21:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi I'm back. I see what you mean about US divisions. For the World War II and onward divisions i see no problem and think it's a great idea but be careful with the World War I divisions. They have there own task force and they might get a little touchy! The problem is that the divisions between the two wars are extremely different, they do not have continuos histories, except of course for the regular divisions. 5th Division is looking better. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 11:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Funny man. Thats good i like it. I had a great holiday thanks, first time in that part of the States. Great people in New England. Well as far as I know the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Army</a> divisions from 1914-1918 were disbanded within a couple years of that war, but the 1st Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in 1920. The 2nd Line was reconstituted in September 1939 in reaction to the declaration of war. When the 2nd Line was reformed they were a little different from their WWI predecessors. Slightly different names and the regiments aasigned were different. Don't take this as gospel I'm still looking for information on them myself. You still having fun on Wiki? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 20:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What i was thinking though was that as a unit in existence we should use it's present emblem at the top and place past emblems at the parts where that history is told, if you know what i mean? I'm definitly coming round to your way of thinking with an entire history of a unit. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 11:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went looking for it yesterday, found one but not in the public domain will try again now. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristan_benedict_03c1.html" title="User:Tristan benedict">Tristan benedict</a> 09:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the nice note regarding the Iraq and Afghan order of battle pages. I'd like to come up with a way to show the order of battle for all previous rotations as well, OIF and OEF, so your thoughts are welcome. As far as putting dates on formation changeovers, that's a good idea but I'd like to see an example of how you'd do that. Again, thanks for the compliments and I welcome any help you can give.

<li>Hi Buckshot06, thanks for adding the command and control section to the Iraq order of battle page. I added some more information to flesh it out and changed the style to make it conform to the the rest of the page. I hope it's OK with you.

<p>Thanks Buckshot for your contrib to the <a href="../../../2/d/_/2d_Battalion%2C_135th_Aviation_Regiment_1074.html" title="2d Battalion, 135th Aviation Regiment">2d Battalion, 135th Aviation Regiment</a> article. I appreciate another set of eyes. Two questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) Would you please look at the command structure represented there in the milinfobox? I'm fairly certain that it is out of date, as I believe it was more current during the five months training stateside in Texas. I know the 2/135th reports to the 36 CAB, but now that the unit is in Iraq, I suspect the upper part of the chain of command is incorrect? If you know how the 36th CAB is tied in, I would appreciate it if you would modify the article.</li>
<li>2) Great work on the <a href="../../../m/n/f/MNF-Iraq_680c.html" title="MNF-Iraq">MNF-Iraq</a> effort. Despite several searches on WP, I was not previously able to locate such an effort. Every time I searched for <a href="../../../o/i/f/OIF_9b5f.html" title="OIF">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a>, I get linked to a big debate (and questionable on NPOV) of Iraq War. I could never seem to find a more detailed, an d neutral, military history of units going into and out of Iraq. So the question is: Is there a standard way to represent in unit articles a link to the MNF-Iraq article? If so, feel free to make the addition.</li>

<p>Keep up the good work. I have fond memories of my week on holiday with frequent evenings at the Dundry <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_British_Legion_584b.html" title="Royal British Legion">Royal British Legion</a>, and my introduction to <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skittles.html" title="Skittles">Skittles</a> and a large group of fine folks.

<dd>Buckshot, thanks for your updates and work on the organization of the 2/135th. In response to my query, I received an email from the First U.S. Army Public Affairs office saying that "...related to the 36th CAB, but they are under the C2 of MNF-I." I don't know how to interpret 'C2 of MNF-I.' Do you? I can send you the email if that will help. N2e 04:04, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Buckshot, in response to your question on my talk page, I asked for more info, using exactly the text you suggested. Here is what I got from the LTC in the PAO (Public Affairs Office?) in response: "...MNC-I and MNF-I are two different echelons of command. MNC-I works fpr MNF-I and handles the tactical day-day fight against the enemy. The 36th CAB works directly for MNC-I." I hope this provides you with what you needed.

<p>Meh, just removing the unsourced material is perfectly appropriate; it's his responsibility to provide sources if he wants it to stay.</p>
<p>If you have further trouble with the article, I would suggest leaving notes with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Maritime_warfare_task_force_d455.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Maritime warfare task force">Maritime warfare task force</a> and/or the <a href="../../../s/h/i/WP%7ESHIPS_5d21.html" title="WP:SHIPS">Ships WikiProject</a>; there will usually be someone around who'd be willing to help out a bit. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:52, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Task forces don't have coordinators, per se. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a>, one of the project's Assistant Coordinators, is a member of the task force, but I'm not sure that his interests include Soviet ships. (More generally, there's nothing special about getting a coordinator involved here, as it's not a really complex disagreement; this is such a violation of basic policy that any outside editor ought to be sufficient in keeping the stuff out of the article until some references are forthcoming.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:57, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Creating a new task force is actually somewhat more complicated than that—there's lots of places where its name will be used in templates, for one thing—so I'd much prefer if we could decide on a name first and do the page shuffling after that. (There's also a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_War_of_the_Pacific_d6e3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject War of the Pacific">Wikipedia:WikiProject War of the Pacific</a> that can get absorbed into the same task force, incidentally.) The discussion of what the best name is has sort of died off and moved on to debating the Russian task force; but (assuming you're actually interested in participating), you can bring up the question again and we'll hopefully settle on the scope in short order.

<p>Please feel free to remove anything that's been created; we try to keep the list more-or-less current, but it's a massive task trimming things out consistently, and any help would be very appreciated!</p>
<p>I'll try to go over the article in detail again tomorrow, but, from a quick skim, it seems to be much improved. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 05:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a lot better than it was before. Aside from fleshing out the sections that still have those "Expand this section" tags on them, there are three points that I think could use improvement:
<ul>
<li>Reduce the use of bulleted lists in favor of prose or tables, as they tend to raise hackles at FAC.</li>
<li>Avoid making definitive statements about the future (e.g. "They will remain, to some extent, a military liability..." → "They are expected to remain, to some extent, a military liability...")</li>
<li>The "Bibliography" section should be titled "References" if the works were actually consulted as sources and "Further reading" otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to help out, but my Ukrainian isn't perfect, so it would take some time. I'm also busy in real life. I also want to devote some time to "<a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a>" this week, since it's an official collaboration. But I could start translating the article a section at a time.</p>

<p>You classify <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Frinovsky_cb70.html" title="Mikhail Frinovsky">Mikhail Frinovsky</a> as a Military history.</p>
<p>Mikhail Frinovsky is not military figure. He didn't serve one single day in the army, neither as a private nor an officer; being a party political supervisor -"comissar"- doesn't count.</p>
<p>However he was a distinguished murderer, a "Deputy High Hangman" (until he reached his expiration at 1939), and as the great majority of these maniacs, he wore military outfit with a "Comandarm 1st class", an equivalent of 5 stars general, but this is not a military issue.</p>
<p>Two only things connect him with the red army: it was he who <b>personally</b> managed the great purge in the red-army top ranks in 1937-1938. And, when his own end was near, he was appointed "People's Comissar, Military Navy affairs". This does not make him a general either. It was just a Stalin's famous method to uproot a too powerful enemy and force him as far as possible from his devotees, so to make his liquidation easier. A some kind of home arrest, 600 km (the baltic or the Black sea) to 5000 kilometers (the Pacific ocean) from home&#160;!</p>
