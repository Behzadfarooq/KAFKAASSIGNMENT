<p>The allegation "The city has quite a large number of beggars and homeless people" deserves careful examination.</p>

<dd>All large cities have "many" homeless people. <a href="../../../m/%C3%A9/d/M%C3%A9decins_sans_Fronti%C3%A8res_26ab.html" title="Médecins sans Frontières">Médecins sans Frontières</a> estimates that Bucharest has 5,000 homeless people. <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/docs/news/03/03110701/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ifrc.org/docs/news/03/03110701/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> But let's put this into perspective: Los Angeles has about 90,000 homeless people <a href="http://www.bringlahome.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bringlahome.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Moscow 60,000, Budapest 10,000. <a href="http://www.fides.org/eng/approfondire/2004/bstrada_01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fides.org/eng/approfondire/2004/bstrada_01.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 13:20, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent arguments&#160;! I tried to find out qualified statistics on homelessness on FEANTSA site <a href="http://www.feantsa.org/code/en/hp.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.feantsa.org/code/en/hp.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - unfortunalely real statistics are for members only.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, estimations which you delivered are plausible. Here are two in addition: Prague - 4-5000 Sweden - 17800</p>
<p>And here are simple proportions of homeless persons to hundred inhabitants (cities population according to <a href="http://www.citypopulation.de/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citypopulation.de/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>)</p>
<p><br />
Los Angeles 2,35%</p>
<p>Moscow 0,59%</p>
<p>Budapest 0,58%</p>
<p>Prague 0,3%</p>
<p>Bucharest 0,26%</p>
<p>Sweden 0,19%</p>
<p><br />
However you consider it, asserting that beggars and homeless are in <b>"quite a large number"</b> is semantically vague and confusing and statistically not sustainable.</p>
<p>A more appropriate phrase could eventually be: <i>compared to other capitals, B. has a relatively moderate proportion of homeless people. Beggars are either moderately visible</i> . ....or somewhat alike</p>
<p><br />

<dd>I assume that the 5,000 identified by MsF would be homeless in the narrowest sense: lacking anywhere indoors to sleep from night to night. It would not include squatters, "couch-surfers" (to use an American term), etc. Do I understand correctly?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, my own impression in 2001-2002: more beggars than a comparably Western European city, about the same number as a comparable American city, but far more child beggars than I had seen in either the U.S. or Western Europe. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:29, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since begging is quite a volatile (urban) phenomen, there are no reliable estimations on this. Referring to the <i>visibility</i> of a phenomen or behaviour - as I previously suggested - is not a very good idea either.</p>
<p>What certainly can be said about homelessness in B. is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>it is by no means higher than in other European capitals</dd>
<dd>hits especialy minors</dd>
</dl>
<p>B. also has a relatively large social category of poor and very poor, who are not homeless</p>

<p>This to me sounds like POV language. If it said that the city is, by economic standards, the most important city, then perhaps it would've been okay; but otherwise, I don't agree with the wording. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 23:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bucuresti is Romania's capital, it is by far the biggest city in country and as you yourself admitted, certainly the most important by economic standards. Thus I don't see the statement as reflecting a POV, merely a (to me pretty obvious) fact. - <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnclation_5bb1.html" title="User:Anclation">Anclation</a> 17:19, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't say by economical standards. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 17:34, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I know, it says that it is the most important city of Romania, period. Indeed, I just explained to you why I considered this to be accurate. If you don't agree, please provide arguements, and remember that by "most important" one doesn't automatically say it is the best, most beautiful or the worthy capital of Romania. - <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnclation_5bb1.html" title="User:Anclation">Anclation</a> 17:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree because when it says that it's the most important city of Ro, it make it to sound as if it's the most important city when it comes to everything: economy, culture, education, tourism, research, and industry. I don't know if it is, but take Galati for instance: it's the most important city that produces steel. See, Bucharest is not the most important city in everything. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 19:14, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But Bucharest actually is the most important city in economy, culture, education, tourism, research and industry. Maybe in the 19th century, Iaşi had more influence on Romanian culture, but those days are long gone.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, you're interpreting both NPOV and the meaning of the word "important". Let me remind you the meaning of the word:
<dl>
<dd><i>im·por·tant - adj. Strongly affecting the course of events or the nature of things.</i> (dictionary.com) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 21:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm, I'll think you'll have a hard time arguing that Bucharest is not Romania's most important city overall. Of course, certain cities are more important in certain domains - one can argue that Constanţa is the most important port, Galaţi is the most important steelmaking town, etc, but Bucharest is the most important city overall. This is not only by economic standards, but also culturally, educationally, demographically, etc. Nearly 10% of the Romanian population lives in Bucharest, and the next largest city has a population nearly seven times smaller. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 10:55, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The city of Bucharest was just a chain of villages. These villages got some significance under Vlad III Dracula, as he upgrated the fortress that was to protect these villages. He prefered to stay in Bucharest, at times, as it was closer to the Ottoman Empire. He also fortified the Snagov island and the monastary, where he committed horrible acts of evil. In his third reign, he moved his headquorters from Targoviste to Bucharest. He died in late December 1476 and 513 years later, another evil Wallachian would die by the hands of his own people. What I'm getting at is that your city was born of evil, fed by evil, and is now evil. I think the city and its people are cursed. You are, however, master thieves. I'm not talking about the thieves that rob tourists and other hardworking citizens, nor am I talking about your politicians that have robbed the country and denied a reunification with Republic of Moldova. I'm talking about you stealing by legal ways. When the Two Principalities united, both regions were meant to develop at an equal pace. You, however, stole the de-facto capital of Iasi to Bucharest. Afterwards, you sent Cuza into exile and everything since then has gone wrong. You shameful beasts! You developed your own backyard while letting an entire historical region fall in decay. That historical region would've developed more on its own than under your corrupted leadership. But this is not what bothers me most. What bothers me most is that you, Tatars or whatever you are, think too highly of your selves. And why? Look in the mirror from time to time. You brag about your kids winning mathematic olympiads, as if you're saving the world from starvation. You're a people with no virtue. Your accent is ridiculous and you think that you are more Romanian than others. Your snobbery disgusts me! Anyway, I hope Steaua will win over Middlesbrough. Some Bucharestneans are okay, but most of you are idiots.

<dd>Chinese people say that same thing about Shanghai. Many provincial French say the same thing about Paris. Antagonism for people of the capital city is a trend in most countries of the world, particularly those where the capital is by far the largest and most important city. I'm not from Bucharest, so I don't have a personal interest here, but I think, as I said before, that what's good for Bucharest is good for Romania, and that hence any internal conflict just makes the entire country weaker and doesn't reflect well on any of us. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 10:58, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, interesting observation. I also recall that a few years ago there was a story in the media about how Bucharest was the most crowded city in Europe and that indeed it had more than 3 million people. However, I haven't found any sources for this in any other place, and it is very unbelievable that only a bit more than half of the population were counted in the census. From the trends, Bucharest's population is actually declining than growing, though this may have changed a bit after 2002. But I think the population of the Municipality is no more than 2.1-2.2 million at most. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 00:47, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for removing that. Statements like that actually make me very angry, particularly this idea of "poor". What is "poor" meant to mean anyway? You hear a lot of people arbitrarily saying "that's a poor country" or a "poor city". But "poor" without any further explanation basically refers to low-income countries and perhaps to some lower-middle income countries. Romania is an upper-middle income, and thus cannot be objectively classified as poor on an international scale. In fact, "rich" would probably be a more accurate description if we're really into seeing the world in a rich-poor binary system. With a GDP per capita more than double that of Romania, Bucharest is hardly "poor". We can say that the city is "relatively poor by European Union standards", but that's about it. Conversely, we could say that the city is "relatively wealthy by regional standards". I fail to see the point of such a comparison. Finally, though, I don't think that statement was intentional propaganda or an "Anti-Romanian" attempt. It's just that people have some stereotypes about the city dating from the 1990s which they can't get rid of. But it's proven statistically that the number of beggars is less in Bucharest than in other cities, and uncollected rubbish is more of a problem than in other European capitals, but far less of a problem than in the rest of the world.

<dd>if u consider all articles about Romania, u will notice that, in the article about Dacia, these propaganda(or victims of propaganda) editors wrote "Trajan resolved to crush dacians once and for all", in the Roma people article they put an image with people wearing what i identified as romanian national costumes, and entitled "Roma in Transylvania", the Vlad Tepes article bears the title "Vlad Dracula" and anecdotes about him were presented as facts and he is referd to throughout the article as Dracula, in WW 1 Romania attacked the Central Powers from the back, and as soon as Romania was cornered cowardly signed a Peace Treaty that soon as situation changed and Central Powers weakened again, broke it, Transylvania is evidenced allover romanian articles as "Region Transylvania" and localities are situated "in Transylvania Region" instead of "Counties of Romania", when Transylvania has no actual administrative regional status, and there is more i cant remembere everything, but the overall image is a distortion of information about anything romanian as a result of Propaganda (may be it from other media channels) or with the intent of Propaganda <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 08:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that POV articles should all be corrected to conform to NPOV, but that this should also be done not in a pro-Romanian nationalistic way, as is too often the norm here. The Trasylvania issue is a bit different, and is actually used by a lot of Romanians, even though I don't particularly favour it. If you look over at the Romanian Wikipedia, you'll see that the articles on all localities start with "XYZ este o localitate în judeţul X, Transilvania, România". So it's not really any "external anti-Romanian propaganda". Plus, I really don't see how using Transylvania as a regional division is anti-Romanian. Sure, it has no administrative status, but it still is a cultural-historical (and geographic) region, and it's very much used by Romanians. In fact, regions are often used much more than counties in a cultural sense, since counties are quite arbitrary divisions. Most people I know describe a certain city as being in "Moldavia" or "Oltenia", and a person as being "oltean" or "moldovean" or "dobrogean" rather than "from Tulcea County" or "from Prahova County". So, these historical, informal regions are still somewhat important. I haven't seen any articles which say "Transylvania Region", with Region in capital letters, most of them just say stuff like "Oradea is a city in Bihor County, Transylvania, Romania", and I think that's OK, because it gives the reader much more information than just saying "Bihor County, Romania". Finally, I don't think there is a particular anti-Romanian bias in Wikipedia, since some articles are actually POV towards Romania, and articles about other countries are also affected by POV against them. We should seek to correct this, but also take into consideration the fact that the Romanian POV is usually not NPOV either. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 08:46, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i think the persons who listed Wallachia or Moldavia as a location for a place in Romania tried to balance the excessive use of Transylvania as a location for places in Romania. i think that an adviced editor of an encyclopedia (say an editor of Britannica) would not have any hesitation in ordering the information according to an encyclopedic behaviour. one that does not mix ancestral <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacia.html" title="Dacia">Dacia</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> provinces with a modern location. since wikipedia lacks expert (or at least advanced) contributors, such erroneus/anarchic behaviour (that i considered to be a responce to propaganda vis-a-vis to Transylvania) keep lingering on wikipedia <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 13:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't looked into the case in depth, but I've been here for quite a long time, and I remember that when the county and city articles were first created, the regions were there first. I don't think they were added later to counterbalance the Transylvanian issue. And the regions of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia aren't only historical regions, they're also in contemporary use for cultural reasons. I'm not a particularly big fan of them myself, but you have to acknowledge that they're still there, and still used by Romanians as regional divisions, and hence can't just be removed and forgotten about totally. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 14:10, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>as far as I know there is no <i>regional division</i> of Romania named Wallachia or Transylvania. An encyclopedia does not <i>forget</i> that there was a Principality of Wallachia or Transylvania; mentioning of Transylvania or Wallachia will be made in the History/Other informations paragraph about that location anyhow. there is no official document mentioning Wallahia (Tara Romaneasca) or Transylvania (Ardeal) as locations for any place in Romania. That the Romanian Weather TV Programs present the weather on a map with <i>historical regions of Romania</i> that doesnt make Britannica or Romanian Official documents state that "<i>Bucharest is a city in Wallachia region, in Romania</i>" (that would be laughable) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 16:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in line with the discussion above, everybody just take a look at the formulation in this ROmanian related article in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harghita#Demographics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harghita#Demographics" rel="nofollow">Harghita article</a> - "<i><b>84.6% (276,106) of its population is Hungarian, making it the county with the highest proportion of Hungarians in Transylvania</b></i>". for the editor who formulated this proposition, Harghita is a county of Transylvania inhabited by Hungarians who are majoritary, they are not <i>hungarian ethnic minority</i> and they dont live in Romania. if this isnt an irredentist POV/<a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a> formulation, then i am not a dacian&#160;:)) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 16:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion, I think you're seeing things that aren't there. The sentence you cited is perfectly factual and is not written in any particular POV. I suppose it would be better to add "ethnic Hungarian" instead of "Hungarian", and I suppose that it would be more relevant to add that Harghita has the highest proportion of Hungarians in <i>Romania</i>, not just Transylvania, but these are really very minor edits that to most readers wouldn't affect the meaning in the slightest. I don't see how it implies that Transylvania is majority-Hungarian (is this what you mean?). <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 02:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>as i see Propaganda, "<i>using true information, but selected information, incomplete information, can manipulate the image that one builts based on those informations.</i>" saying <i>"Harghita has highest proportion of Hungarians in Transylvania"</i> leaving <i>"ethnic minority"</i> and <i>"Romania"</i> unmentioned, the image that is built is "<i>there is a country Transylvania that has a Hungarian population</i>" <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 13:04, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An infobox is for a quick summary of the most important facts. Accordingly, I've cut this long list of external links from the infobox. By the standards of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, I don't think some of them belong in the article at all—most of this would be more appropriate to WikiTravel; the link about the airport certainly belongs, if anywhere, in the article on the airport—so I have brought them here rather than add them to the External links section. If someone thinks a few belong in the External links section, fine, but do remember that Wikipedia is not a web directory.</p>
