<p>It is wrong to classify Bucknell as belonging to a fictious organization, and writing that it, in the minds of many, is comparable to certain institutions is not encyclopedic.</p>

<p>Also, though I have visited Bucknell, and found its campus to be beautiful, isn't that a point of view (mine). Instead, you could include pictures of the campus. This article could be improved by making it more in-depth. I think Trinity College's wiki is a good example of where this should be headed.</p>

Legend has it, that if a couple kisses here at sunset they will get married someday.

<p>from the <b>College Prowler</b> guidebook, <i>Bucknell University - Off the Record</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I went to college here, and I never heard that. It does give a beautiful vantage of the sunset, however. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyhead</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 23:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I had never heard of that either. Oddly enough, the legend is true for me. Of course, it is a nice quiet place to watch a wonderful sunset. Given that a staggering amount of Bucknellians wed other Bucknellians, this is not a surprise to me. 151.198.54.151 18:22, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like there are several of us watching this page pretty carefully. I've been adding to the links at the bottom for a pretty specific reason, and would like to see them returned. Some programs here at Bucknell are not particularly well known. Links included on Wikipedia are often picked up and propagated on the web, leading to better scores for particular google searches. This is why links to the the performing arts and environmental programs are important to have here. That and they really don't hurt anything. So if no one objects, I'm going to put them back.</p>
<p>Also, the Department of Theatre and Dance and the Department of Music are the correct names, meaning the comma version is not. Benthos</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I made that change (commas), due only to standard grammar concerns, not intimate knowledge of those departments. If it misrepresented the departments' names, my apologies. Feel free to fix. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> 02:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No problem, I realized after commenting that I had written "programs" not departments. Your edits are fine with me. Benthos 04:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Couple points. One, what's the justification for including certain links and not others? If we have one departmental link, should we have them all? If we have one program link, should we have them all? Is not having them all biased?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would be great to have links to all departments. I don't want to put them up though, so if you do, I won't complain. That's the beauty of this site - if people want to add information on their idosincratic interests, they can. The world can catch up later. We could propose to Bucknell PR people to take control of the Wikipedia page, but that would be a shame... Benthos 04:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the External Links are supposed to be <i>helpful</i>, not raise awareness on little-known programs or help increase page hits. Why link to a little-known department? It's probably obscure for a reason. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 01:36, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What's up with being a smart aleck about this? We've got some world class people at Bucknell in a lot of places (e.g., Jackson Hill in Music - Grammy award nominee.) Trying to let the world know that our strengths are not just in Engineering and football - oops, women's track - is hardly a sin. I think the links are useful and important and if you want to delete them, I'll just keep adding them back. My apologies for being too honest about my motives. Benthos 04:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So why, then, do we link to some pages, but not others?</dd>
<dd>Here's my question about some of the links. What's <i>so</i> amazing about the Theatre and Dance Department, and Music Department, that they're linked, but <i>not</i> links to all the engineering departments, which are even better known <i>and</i> have notable faculty as well? Why is the environment center linked when it's simply not a <i>huge</i> deal, especially when compared to other on-campus resources? Why is the basketball team's page not linked?</dd>
<dd>If they're linked for good reason, fine—but "raising awareness" and page hits is not a <i>good</i> reason and is not Wikipedia's mission. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 18:29, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of the academic info already comes off dangerously close to sounding like a prospective student brochure, that is, advertising. I object to any calculation that involves page rank, etc., which informs the content here (I wouldn't mind the page rank to be good, :-), but I am not willing to sacrifice the integrity of WP to do it; there are policies against that, and for good reason.) How about the main link (www.bucknell.edu) and then a liink to the pages with all the links of individual departments? Or if not on one page, perhaps to a page with links to all the Schools? I firmly believe cherry picking departmental links makes the article look foolish, and would object. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> 02:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I feel somewhat the same way. My rationale for removing the External Links was that the link to the main site is already provided in the infobox; from there, an interested person can access any part of the site they wish. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 05:52, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See my comment above. Every college entry on Wikipedia that I examined in a small sampling a minute ago has "cherry picked" links. The integrity of Wikipedia is not at stake here, the entry is not compromised, the links ARE helpful, and so on. Benthos 04:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)Benthos</dd>

I'm not familiar with this site i.e. I could not determine what was intended, nor how/where to find the new links. Were link locations, page names changed? Are some specific pages relocated etc. ?? I was not equipped to properly identify and repair these problems.</p>
<p>A utility to verify links on the article would be helpful. Does anyone know of such a tool?</p>
<p>I will gladly assist with these corrections, but persons with more understanding of these links (than I have) needs to be involved.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChauqg_97f7.html" title="User:Chauqg">Chauqg</a> 13:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can offer some aid, as I am actually a web developer at Bucknell University, and thus intimately familiar with the site (I did, in fact, help move some of the pages). Basically, the University got a new content management system that changed all of the page URLs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be a good time to clean out some of the external links, though. Do we really need so many links to individual departments? Seems like the links to the main page would suffice. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 16:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
