<p>Hi Buckets. First, kudos on dealing with MB, whose occasional legitimate criticism has been marred by repeated tendentious attempts (WS circulation, claims that the TO Sun is larger than NP, hazing, disputing Grewal, Boyd, Claude Marsden, et cetera ad nauseam) polish Marsden's image and delete relevant, though unflattering, information. I've cleaned up the reference to the Dennis Miller show--she was on his 2004/05 CNBC talk show, not the HBO program Dennis Miller Live, which ended in 2002.</p>
<p>I am not convinced of the IMDB entry's reliability. Marsden's resume, both the one referenced on the page and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030805044156/http://www.angelfire.com/bc/rmarsden/whois.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20030805044156/http://www.angelfire.com/bc/rmarsden/whois.html" rel="nofollow">an archived version from August 2003</a> from the Wayback Machine claims that she worked at 20/20 in 2000, while the IMDB entry states that the episode she helped prudice aired in June 2003. In addition, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010721220728/http://www.rachelmarsden.com/" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010721220728/http://www.rachelmarsden.com/" rel="nofollow">archived version of her homepage from 2001</a> has a link to an entirely different 20/20 story than that in the IMDB entry. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanking_466f.html" title="User:Ianking">Ianking</a> 01:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Ian, for your kind words. (I know your blog a bit.) I admire MB's passion and independence, but once he digs in his heels on something he can be a handful. On IMDb, what you say strikes as entirely plausible. Getting to the bottom of all this is quite interesting. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 02:37, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further to that, Marsden claimed to work as an assistant to Connie Chung (mentioned both in her resume and in Brian Hutchinson's NP article from August 2003) when at ABC. Chung <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669173,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669173,00.html" rel="nofollow">left ABC for CNN in January 2002</a>. The other oddity I find in Marsden's IMDb entries is that she is the only guest listed on three of her O'Reilly appearances. I would think (and there may be transcripts out there to help) that far more notable guests appeared on those broadcasts, but no one has added them. I suspect that Marsden or her fans (of which MB is one) have been feeding data to the IMDb about her appearances. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanking_466f.html" title="User:Ianking">Ianking</a> 03:35, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bucketsofg/Archive 1. I noticed you added an entry to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_Progress_5531.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in Progress">Vandalism in Progress</a>. That page is only for very specific cases, as described by the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_investigation_Help_7459.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for investigation/Help">page's guidelines</a>.

Many alerts that are incorrectly placed on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_Progress_5531.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in Progress">Vandalism in Progress</a> are never dealt with, simply because they become old before an administrator gets to them.

<p>I notice you have added some votes in the Articles for Deletion, without stating a reason.

<p>I've moved some of the older, crufty talk on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> to an archive page in order to make the page a bit more manageable. If you've found some resolved discussions from pre-March 1, please move 'em to the archive. Incidentally, the WP custom is to add new items on the talk pages at the bottom (the "+" tab on each page will set up a new item automagically) rather than at the top of each page. Beats bouncing around the page in a spaghetti-like fashion when some people add new stuff at the top, and others at the bottom.

<p>Hi Bucketsofg - it's probably better if you contact <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">User:Kahuroa</a> rather than me wrt trying to fix those articles. He's the one who knows about Polynesian mythology - the reason I was the one who nominated the articles was that Kahuroa didn't know how to link AFD votes into one batch (which now seems to have been a mistake anyway&#160;:/. I know a little Polynesian mythology, but not enough to be able to point out the flaws in articles about minor characters from Samoan myth! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:52, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if I pulled the nom, I don't think that prod could be used - the rules at WP:PROD seem to suggest that once something is on afd it can never be prodded. What would be best would be to pull the nom and then resubmit all th nominations individually, which I'll suggest doing at the afd page. Unfortunately time is a major constraint for the next couple of days, so I'm not sure whether I'll be able to do this, but we'll see how it goes. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:32, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great idea - I think that the 'in Poly Myth' at the beginning of these articles is misleading. Lets get rid of it as we edit.

<p>Hi again - I'm going ahead with the split of the afds - a dozen at a time. I'll put them <i>all</i> on AFD - any which seem to be good enough to survive can always be pulled from there, and it makes sure I'm less likely to miss any of them (it's a <i>long</i> list!). I'm starting at the end of the alphabel, so all the ones beginning with T-W should be appearing first. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Buckets, could you take a look at the articles <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahu-ike.html" title="Mahu-ike">Mahu-ike</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manawa.html" title="Manawa">Manawa</a>. I came across these while rewriting and verifying <a href="../../../a/u/a/Auahi-Turoa_96ce.html" title="Auahi-Turoa">Auahi-Turoa</a>. They all come from the same ultimate source, Best, see my ref for Auahi-Turoa. I have brought Auahi-Turoa back into line with Best, the other two I haven't particularly changed. Manawa especially can be merged into Auahi-Turoa or made a redirect to it or something. Mahu-ike tho also relates to your article Mahuika and you might want to merge some of it into that, if so, just use the wording in Auahi-Turoa which I have now verified. We'll need to investigate the redirects to Mahu-ike as well. (Best gives Mahuika thruout, so Mahu-ike has been added in as an error along the way, altho Mahuike is correct in some trads, just not this particular story.) Let's know what you think <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 11:33, 2 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Hi there. Thanks for the help with the etymology question, and thanks also for the link to that dictionary. I had seen it before, but I think I'm having a bit more luck now trying to pin stuff down. Especially stuff like <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemais.html" title="Ptolemais">Ptolemais</a>. Do you know the best way to reference a source like that? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great. Thanks. Do you know how to reference that dictionary? Would I have to pick one of the dictionaries at the Perseus website, or just reference the website as a whole? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohi.html" title="Rohi">Rohi</a> - I have found another source for this in Best and have been able to divide it up into culture areas. Could you take a look at items 4 and 5 on the contents list? I wasn't sure what to do with item 4 ie the stuff not mentioned in Best, and 5, the reference to Craig since I don't know what he covers or if he assigns it to any culture area. I'll leave that to you if I may. I will try also to hunt out the material cited by Best since those are probably the ultimate sources for this.

<p>Buckets old mate. I see you have started an article "Mataerepo", an alt. name for Whaitiri. I thought the name was odd - never seen it before - am familiar with Whaitiri being <i>Matakerepō</i> = <i>Mata</i> 'eyes' + <i>kerepō</i> 'blind' - has Craig made a mistake here? On the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Talk%7EMataerepo_51bd.html" title="Talk:Mataerepo">Talk:Mataerepo</a> I have posted the full text of Tregear's entry on the subject. No word erepo in Māori. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 05:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>have done a bit of work on this, see my ravings on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Talk%7EMataerepo_51bd.html" title="Talk:Mataerepo">Talk:Mataerepo</a>. Upshot is that I have found a good published text of a Tawhaki story which mentions Matakerepō. She does not equate to Whaitiri in that text. I propose I hunt out the last of the sources mentioned in Tregear, and in the meantime do a rewrite. How's that sound? <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 05:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
