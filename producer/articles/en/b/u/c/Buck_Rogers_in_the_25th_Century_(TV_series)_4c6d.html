<p>The pilot film was first shown in cinemas in Spring 1979. Good box-office returns led NBC to commission a full series, which began on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> with a modified version of the theatrical release, which trimmed or altered some racier scenes — including a popular reference by Twiki to his "freezing his ball bearings off" — and omitted the death of one character — Tiger Man, Ardala's henchman — who would later appear in several episodes of the series. There was also footage added to replace the censored scenes, including Buck's exploring his new quarters, and his first conversation with Dr. Theopolis regarding the nature of Anarchia.</p>
<p>The production obviously used recycled props and costumes from <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%281978_TV_series%29_f35c.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)">Battlestar Galactica</a></i> (1978). For example, the control sticks used in the starfighters in this series were the same as those used in <i>Battlestar Galactica'</i>s older version Viper craft. The Earth starfighters were <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_McQuarrie_212b.html" title="Ralph McQuarrie">Ralph McQuarrie</a>'s original vision of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Viper_cda8.html" title="Colonial Viper">Colonial Vipers</a>. The same props were later used in the opening credits of the TV Show, <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_This_World_%28television_series%29_d200.html" title="Out of This World (television series)"><i>Out of this World</i></a>.</p>
<p>The new series centered on Captain William Anthony "Buck" Rogers, played by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Gerard_774c.html" title="Gil Gerard">Gil Gerard</a>, a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_e341.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> pilot who commands Ranger 3, a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_shuttle.html" title="Space shuttle">space shuttle</a> that is launched in 1987. Due to a freak combination of gases that Ranger 3 encounters in deep space, he is frozen in space for 504 years and is revived in the 25th Century (in the year 2491). There, he learns that the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> was rebuilt following a devastating <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_war.html" title="Nuclear war">nuclear war</a> in the late 20th Century, and is now under the protection of the Earth Defense Directorate.</p>
<p>The series followed him as he tried to fit (not always successfully) into 25th-Century culture. As there were no traceable personal records for him, he was uniquely placed, due to his pilot and combat skills and personal ingenuity, to help Earth Defense foil assorted evil plots to destroy Earth. In many respects, the new Rogers was more similar to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man_a7fa.html" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">Col. Steve Austin</a> than to Nowlan's original character. Rogers is aided in his adventures by his friend and semi-romantic interest, Colonel <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilma_Deering_903d.html" title="Wilma Deering">Wilma Deering</a>, played by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Gray_5398.html" title="Erin Gray">Erin Gray</a>, and his comic sidekick robot, <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twiki.html" title="Twiki">Twiki</a>, voiced by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Blanc_2b48.html" title="Mel Blanc">Mel Blanc</a> (who had previously voiced <a href="../../../d/a/f/Daffy_Duck_146b.html" title="Daffy Duck">Daffy Duck</a> as <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_Dodgers_63e8.html" title="Duck Dodgers">Duck Dodgers</a> in spoofs of the early Buck Rogers and other <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> serials).</p>
<p>Twiki, a small robot or "ambuquad," tended to express himself with the exclamation "biddi-biddi-biddi" followed by a 20th-Century cliché or catchphrase he had picked up from Buck, or one he already knew from before he met Buck. Dr. Theopolis, a computer, was a large disk with an illuminated face; he was usually worn by Twiki, and was considered one of the planet's scientific leaders. During the first season, Rogers and Deering took their orders from Dr. Elias Huer, played by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_O%27Connor_%28actor%29_fb3f.html" title="Tim O'Connor (actor)">Tim O'Connor</a>, the head of the Defense Directorate. Some episodes also depicted Huer as the leader of the entire planet. One notable character from the comic strip omitted from the series was that of "Black Barney".</p>
<p>The pilot film depicted human civilization as insular and restricted to a few <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domed_cities.html" title="Domed cities">domed cities</a>, its capital referred to as the Inner City. Travel beyond the Inner City was hazardous, as the rest of the planet was said to be a wasteland inhabited by violent mutants.</p>

<p>The movie was originally slated for release for September 1978 according to director <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Haller_483a.html" title="Daniel Haller">Daniel Haller</a>, in an interview for Fantastic Films Magazine, Sept '79.

<p>The series showed a more positive picture of future Earth. The Inner City was renamed New Chicago, and it was established that human civilization had spread once again across the planet, and also to the stars. After the movie pilot, little reference to barren wastelands was made; in several episodes Buck ventures beyond the dome of New Chicago with no hazards encountered. As opposed to the isolationist planet seen in the film, Earth is shown to be the center of an interstellar human-dominated government, sometimes called "the Federation", other times "the Alliance", with its capital at New Chicago. Travel between the stars was accomplished with the use of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Stargate (disambiguation)">stargates</a>; these devices were only shown as a diamond-shaped quartet of stars that shimmered when a vessel was making transit. To portray futuristic-looking buildings on Earth, the show used stock shots of the remaining national pavilions of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expo_67.html" title="Expo 67">Expo 67</a>, particularly the French and British pavilions as well as shots of the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonaventure_Hotel_08fe.html" title="Bonaventure Hotel">Bonaventure Hotel</a> in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/u/a/Juanin_Clay_0da8.html" title="Juanin Clay">Juanin Clay</a>, who played Marla Landers in the first season episode "Vegas in Space", was originally cast as Wilma for the television series before Erin Gray decided to return. In the first season Buck had a different girlfriend every week. Producers demanded that Wilma have blond hair. Repeated dye jobs were needed to lighten Erin Gray's brunette locks to an appropriately bright yellow. During the final episodes of the first season, Gray was allowed to return to her natural hair color, and Wilma was dark-haired thereafter. A relationship between Rogers and Wilma was hinted at, but rarely expanded upon. His best-known enemy during the first season was Princess Ardala of Draconia, played by <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Hensley_dca2.html" title="Pamela Hensley">Pamela Hensley</a>, whose desire was to conquer and possess both Earth and Buck Rogers.</p>
<p>Although popular with viewers, the first season failed to receive much critical acclaim; it was seen as being too light-hearted and comic bookish. One vocal critic of the series was Gerard himself. He pushed for more serious storytelling and conflicted with the producers over the show's tone. "He was a smart-ass" says Gil referring to Buck on some of the lines he should have said during the first season, he continues "Dr Huer is trying to tell him about an assignment and all Buck is doing is making one wisecrack after another".</p>
<p>The series had an overall budget of $800,000 per hour of air time according to <i>Starlog</i> #32.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Rogers_in_the_25th_Century_%28TV_series%29_4c6d.html" title="Edit section: The second season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The second season</span></h2>
<p>Production of the second season was delayed by several months due to an actors' <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strike</a>. When production resumed in the fall of 1980, the format of the series was changed. Buck, Wilma and Twiki joined the crew of an earth spaceship called the <i>Searcher</i> which was seeking the lost "tribes" of humanity who had scattered in the decades after Earth's 20th century nuclear war (borrowing a theme from <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_a415.html" title="Battlestar Galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>). The characters of Dr. Huer, Dr. Theopolis, and recurring villain/love interest Princess Ardala were eliminated and replaced by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admiral Efram Asimov, the commander of <i>Searcher</i>, a descendant of the famous science fiction author <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk_%28birdman%29.html" title="Hawk (birdman)">Hawk</a>, a half-man, half-bird character.</li>
<li>Dr. Goodfellow, an eternally curious scientist.</li>
<li>Crichton, an officious know-it-all robot whom Twiki considers his son (and who refuses to believe that lowly humans could ever have created him).</li>
</ul>
<p>Mel Blanc left the series at the start of the season and another actor began to perform Twiki's voice; Blanc returned for the final half of the season.</p>
<p>Gerard was successful in scaling back the humor in the second season in favor of more serious episodes, with a few exceptions. Buck and Wilma became more serious characters taking part in plotlines that might have been holdovers from <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. One change that was considered an improvement was Buck and Wilma's relationship became more romantic during the second year, though most romantic activity took place off screen.</p>
<p>Moreover, the second season deals with serious issues such as <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_%28social_science%29.html" title="Identity (social science)">identity</a>, the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Self (philosophy)">self</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>. It also draws very much on <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a> as an inspiration as exemplified by the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk_%28birdman%29.html" title="Hawk (birdman)">Hawk</a>'s <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birdmen.html" title="Birdmen">people</a> which are a variant on the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_people.html" title="Bird people">Bird people</a> known from many mythologies around the world and makes special reference to the <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moai.html" title="Moai">moai</a> of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Island_8966.html" title="Easter Island">Easter Island</a> and by Pangora the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a>.</p>
<p>Ratings dropped significantly after the season premiere. Citing cost concerns, NBC cancelled the series at the end of an eleven-episode strike-abbreviated season, though the ratings were still considered strong by comparison to other series.</p>

<p>A North American DVD set of the complete series was released on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.

While the new footage lasts less than five minutes in total, it was not included in the DVD release. It is shown when the series is syndicated. The footage is not completely absent from the DVD, however, as it can be glimpsed during the opening credits of the season finale, which contains extra scenes.</p>
