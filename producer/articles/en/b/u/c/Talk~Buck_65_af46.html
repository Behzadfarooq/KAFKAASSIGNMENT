<p>It seems rather silly to request a citation proving he is on the Vice Records single when Wikipedia lists him as being on there. That article should do. I provided the Feist video and an album review.

<p>Damn that was a lot of work. I redid and expanded the bio, structured it, etc. The albums should all be reviews, seperate from this, with graphics. The reviews are reviews, not encyclopedic. They all need to be re-written.</p>
<p>But its a long way from done. Future topics can include - how unbelieveably important Bucks Language arts were to intelligent or underground HH, how fans of that work are by and large not happy wiht his last two records.</p>
<p>And all the darn reviews moved OUT.</p>

<p>There are a lot of claims in this article about the artist's fame, but little in the way of references proving this.

<p>While I'm happy to see a Wikipedia entry for Buck 65, there are a few things I might be able to add and/or clean up.</p>
<p>First, I have great faith in his story about being scouted by the majors to play baseball. It might sound a bit far-fetched in a way, but he was talking about this as far back as the release of Game Tight. I reviewed his album back then and part of the press package was a photocopy of an early form that had his baseball coach grading him on each aspect of the game. While that doesn't guarantee the rumours are true, it does add some credence to them, as does his constant references to baseball. Unfortunately, with the scout having died and not mentioning it to anyone else as his little secret, it's pretty much Buck's word against the world. And sadly, he is known to make up stories, such as where the name Buck 65 comes from.</p>
<p>On that topic, there is no way the name Buck 65 came from a 65 Buick, especially the one he's been telling more recently regarding being named by an auctioneer. Buck was rapping under the names Haslam and Stinkin' Rich long before he started using Buck 65 as a rap name. So, the fact that an auctioneer taught him to rap and gave him the name 65 Buick (which later got distorted on a show flyer to Buck 65) is preposterous. If the name ever came from a 65 Buick, it would have had to have been his father's car. However, he humbly admitted in an interview back in 1995 to Boognish fanzine (you can find the interview in the Boognish section of www.handsolorecords.com) that it wasn't very exciting but he was named Buck since he was a young child and that he added the 65 because his weight was 165. To add to that, Sixtoo took his name from his height. It all fits together, eh?</p>
<p>Also, Chin Music was Buck's first solo release, but prior to that he was working with Haltown Projex as one of the founding members, which also included Witchdoc Jorun, Bonshah, Badi (aka Tallisman of Plains of Fascination), Bonshah, Project KVA and Shingai. They released a bunch of songs on Jorun's Haltown Meltdown tapes and were supposed to have released a debut cassette but I'm not sure if that ever came out... When he was working with Haltown Projex, he was going by the name of Haslam. He also recorded a few solo tracks under that name. When the group disbanded because everyone wanted more control, Haslam took the name Stinkin' Rich and put out Chin Music.</p>
<p>Finally, nothing is mentioned of Buck's association with Hand'Solo Records. After Game Tight was released on Murderecords, Buck started working with Hand'Solo Records a bit. The first release from Hand'Solo Records was Bassments of Badmen (1996), a compiliation which featured a few tracks from Stinkin' Rich. These were the first tracks where he actually started referencing his production monicker Buck 65, releasing the tracks as "Buck 65 featuring Stinkin' Rich." It wouldn't be until the first Sebutones record that he started using Buck 65 as his MC name. After his appearances on Bassments of Badmen, he released a 12" with Hand'Solo Records for his trilogy of tracks "The Wildlife" (1998). This 12" was also listed as "Buck 65 featuring Stinkin' Rich." Around the same time, the Sebutonedef 12" dropped and the Stinkin' Rich monicker was phased out. In 1998, Buck 65 also released a couple of exclusive tracks on Hand'Solo Records' Cock Dynamiks sex compilation, one under the name Uncle Climax, an old track as Stinkin' Rich, and a collaborative track with Tachichi using the name Uncle Climax. The Cock Dynamiks compilation was re-released in 2005 on CD from Hand'Solo Records and is still available.</p>
<p>So, hopefully some of this information will help to fill out this entry a little more accurately. I've added a few small bits of info already, but I'm not confident with my skills at wikipedia editing to attempt any bigger changes.</p>
<p>If anyone is willing to make the fixes, there's the info...</p>
