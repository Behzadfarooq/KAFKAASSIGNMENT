<p>Thanks for the laugh. ^_^ Devious. I also have a question about warning templates, you are one of many editors I've seen lately using vandalism warning templates that are very different from the ones on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7Evandalism_1173.html" title="WP:vandalism">WP:vandalism</a> page. Where did you find them? Are they admin-only or something? -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 04:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hehe, yeah. That practical joke rocks.&#160;:) And about the templates, I used to have self-created warning templates because I was bored with the default ones, but I've since changed back due to some formatting errors on mine. However, I still use {{<a href="../../../f/i/n/Template%7EFinal_warning_d741.html" title="Template:Final warning">final warning</a>}} quite often, simply because it looks cooler. And no, I wouldn't know anything about admin-only things because I'm not an admin (although I'd love to be one, to fight vandals more efficiently). --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #3366FF;">Buchanan-Hermit™</span></a>..<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buchanan-Hermit_9eb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 8px; color: #669900;">CONTRIBS</span></a>..<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><span style="font-size: 8px; color: #669900;">SPEAK!</span></a>. 04:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi there! I just wanted to talk to you about this IP address, and the amount of vandalism that it has (unfortunately) been doing. I'm a pupil at the school in question, and it saddens me to see this kind of behaviour against Wikipedia going on.</p>
<p>Since you appear to be a well-respected community member (and somebody who looks like a great candidate for the mop), I'd like to point you in the direction of a few websites and email addresses; the school <a href="http://www.keaston.bham.sch.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.keaston.bham.sch.uk/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the <a href="mailto:enquiry@keaston.bham.sch.uk" class="external text" title="mailto:enquiry@keaston.bham.sch.uk" rel="nofollow">email address</a> of the reception, and the <a href="mailto:emmersonj@keaston.bham.sch.uk" class="external text" title="mailto:emmersonj@keaston.bham.sch.uk" rel="nofollow">email address</a> of the system administrator. Feel free to send emails about the vandalism that has been going on, as it's very easy for them to find out who did it and punish them accordingly. If action is taken against the IP address by an admin, I'll let them know of these addresses too.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I'm sorry that your time has been used up dealing with petty vandalism... -- <a href="../../../g/t/d/User%7EGtdp_20a2.html" title="User:Gtdp">gtdp</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/t/d/User_talk%7EGtdp_508d.html" title="User talk:Gtdp">(T)</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gtdp_a289.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gtdp">(C)</a></sub> 16:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey - I expanded the CST article and removed the stubs. Was that very wrong of me?

<dd>Nah, that was fine, now that it has enough info to be considered a "real" article. I started the article not knowing much about VST at all (besides the location and the fact that I pass by it on campus daily), so it's good that you expanded on it. Good job.

<dd><i>Fair use images should</i> only <i>be used in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine.

<p>Welcome, Buchanan-Hermit/Archive 2, to <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a>, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> member association! As you might know, all the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Members_96ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Members">Esperanzians</a> share one important goal: the success of this encyclopedia. Within that, we then attempt to strengthen the community bonds, and be the "approachable" side of the project. All of our ideals are held in the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Charter_5155.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Charter">Charter</a>, the governing document of the association.</p>
<p>Now that you are a member, you might be interested in some of our <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Programs_cd31.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Programs">programs</a>. A quite important program is the StressUnit, which seeks to support <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Alerts_64a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Alerts">editors who have encountered any stress</a> from their Wikipedia events, and are seeking to leave the project. So far, Esperanza can be credited with the support and retention of several users. We have a <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Calendar_59ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Calendar">calendar</a> of special events, member birthdays, and other holidays that you can add to and follow.</p>
<p>In addition to these projects, several more missions of Esperanza are in development, and are currently being created at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Possibles_0c06.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Possibles">Esperanza/Possibles</a>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take an active voice in the running of Esperanza. We have a small government system, headed by our Administrator general, <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Celestianpower</a>, and guided by the Advisory Committee , <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf">KnowledgeOfSelf</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Titoxd</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a>. The elections have ended.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, concerns, comments, or general ideas, Esperanzian or otherwise, know that you can always contact me via <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Master_of_Puppets_3bea.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Master of Puppets">email</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_of_Puppets_098b.html" title="User talk:Master of Puppets">talk page</a>. Alternatively, you could communicate with fellow users via our IRC channel, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" rel="nofollow">#wikipedia-esperanza</a> (which is also good for a fun chat or two&#160;:). I thank you for joining Esperanza, and look forward to working with you in making Wikipedia a better place to be!</p>
