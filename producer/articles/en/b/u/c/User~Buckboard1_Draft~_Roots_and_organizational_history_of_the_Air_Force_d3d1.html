<p><b>Training history and movement overseas</b></p>
<p>The group and its four squadrons were activated without personnel or equipment on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, at <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendover_Air_Force_Base_f7d8.html" title="Wendover Air Force Base">Wendover Army Air Base</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, the location of the group was changed to <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_Airport_9f3a.html" title="Boise Airport">Gowen Field</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise.html" title="Boise">Boise</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, where a cadre of 66 officers and 237 enlisted men was assigned, transferred from the 29th Bomb Group at Gowen. Colonel Steed, formerly <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_staff_%28military%29.html" title="Chief of staff (military)">chief of staff</a> of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Air_Force_9d7b.html" title="Fourth Air Force">Fourth Air Force</a>, took command on the same date. While at Gowen A.A.B., and at its next two stations, the 456th received additional personnel drawn from the 18th Replacement Wing at <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City_6042.html" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>, and the 470th Bomb Group, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Home_Air_Force_Base_031b.html" title="Mountain Home Air Force Base">Mountain Home AAB,</a> Idaho. The air echelon (consisting at that time of key flying staff and four aircrews) was sent to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Air_Force_School_of_Applied_Tactics_b7e3.html" title="Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics">Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics</a> in <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, for a four-week course of specialized cadre <a href="../../../t/r/a/Training.html" title="Training">training</a> in field operations and combat <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactics.html" title="Tactics">tactics</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, 1943, the group's ground echelon moved to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruning_Army_Airfield_7703.html" title="Bruning Army Airfield">Bruning Army Airfield</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, where it remained until <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_8.html" title="October 8">October 8</a>. The air echelon joined the group at Bruning in mid-August and received four B-24D aircraft for familiarization flights.</p>
<p>The air echelon left Bruning on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, 1943, for <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City_Municipal_2_Airport_ce9c.html" title="Salt Lake City Municipal 2 Airport">Kearns A.A.B.</a>, Utah, and on September 29 moved by train to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwards_Air_Force_Base_d770.html" title="Edwards Air Force Base">Muroc A.A.B.</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, where it would remain until its designated overseas deployment date of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>. The ground echelon followed on October 8. By November 1, to train approximately 70 crews, the 456th had received only 28 aircraft, all old and half of them grounded for maintenance or lack of spare parts. The shortage of aircraft hampered the training efforts not only of its flying personnel but also its maintenance units.</p>
<p>The 456th received only a minimal amount of unit training in navigation, high altitude bombing, and gunnery, but its most serious training deficiency was a lack of high altitude formation flying using heavily-loaded aircraft (as it would in combat). In all the group received only three of the normal six months of unit POM ("Preparation for Overseas Movement") training.</p>
<p>Despite the group's lack of preparation, and the refusal by Colonel Steed to certify its combat readiness to POM inspectors, the 456th's air echelon was ordered to discontinue training. The ground campaign in Italy had captured <a href="../../../f/o/g/Foggia.html" title="Foggia">Foggia</a> and its network of potential airfields, and seven groups of Liberators originally slated for the Eighth Air Force, including the 456th, had been diverted by General Arnold to the new bases then under construction.</p>
<p>The air echelon was ordered to fly its training aircraft to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Air_Force_Base_adcb.html" title="Hamilton Air Force Base">Hamilton A.A.B.</a>, California, beginning <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, 1943, while the ground echelon entrained for movement to a port of embarkation. At the time of its deployment, the 456th had reached its full strength of 377 officers and 1,627 enlisted men.</p>
<p>At Hamilton Field the air echelon received 61 new B-24H Liberator bombers over a period of several weeks. Traveling individually between December and February, the aircraft flew to Italy using the South Atlantic Ferry Route, established by <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_Airways_1e3c.html" title="Pan American Airways">Pan American Airways</a> in the 1930's: <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Beach_78d8.html" title="Palm Beach">Palm Beach</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>; <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>; <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad.html" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>; <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belem.html" title="Belem">Belem</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natal.html" title="Natal">Natal</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>; <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakar.html" title="Dakar">Dakar</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_West_Africa_a6a0.html" title="French West Africa">French West Africa</a>; <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrakech.html" title="Marrakech">Marrakech</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca.html" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Morocco_6b72.html" title="French Morocco">French Morocco</a>; <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oran.html" title="Oran">Oran</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>; and <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunis.html" title="Tunis">Tunis</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunisia.html" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, where it waited while construction was completed on its airfield. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, at Dakar, one of the 456th's aircraft exploded while taking off, killing nine of the ten crew members.</p>
<p>The ground echelon arrived at Camp Patrick Henry, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, underwent final processing, and sailed in a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convoy.html" title="Convoy">convoy</a> from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_News_8b0b.html" title="Newport News">Newport News</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">December 15</a> aboard three <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_ship.html" title="Liberty ship">Liberty ships</a>. The convoy passed through the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strait_of_Gibraltar_2fb0.html" title="Strait of Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, 1944, divided into two sections, and reached the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> ports of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranto.html" title="Taranto">Taranto</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">January 19</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_23.html" title="January 23">January 23</a>, the ground echelon traveled by open truck in wet, freezing weather to the new base (code-named "Newbox") on the Tavoliere near the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic_Sea_c752.html" title="Adriatic Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, eighteen miles southeast of <a href="../../../f/o/g/Foggia.html" title="Foggia">Foggia</a>. The airbase was constructed on an estate called <i>Incarnata Farm</i> ( <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=41_16_N_15_44_E_" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=41_16_N_15_44_E_" rel="nofollow"><span title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for 41Â°16â€²N 15Â°44â€²E">41Â°16â€²N, 15Â°44â€²E</span></a></span>), less than a mile north of the village of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stornarella.html" title="Stornarella">Stornarella</a> and approximately two miles southwest of the larger town of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stornara.html" title="Stornara">Stornara</a>; it received the name of the larger city as its location. Stornara airbase was centered in a cluster of airfields of its parent and newly-activated 304th Bomb Wing and two other heavy bomber wings of the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_Air_Force_ba44.html" title="Fifteenth Air Force">Fifteenth Air Force</a> surounding the city of Cerignola.</p>
<p>Staff officers immediately began requisitioning farmhouses for administrative buildings and setting up tent encampments in nearby <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive.html" title="Olive">olive</a> groves for the living quarters. With some improvised improvements, the 456th lived in tents throughout its fifteen months at Stornara (for several months, the ground crews lived in infantry shelter halves until a sufficient number of <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad.html" title="Squad">squad</a>-sized tents became available). Stonara's single <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runway.html" title="Runway">runway</a> was 4,800 feet in length and oriented north-to-south, with <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxiway.html" title="Taxiway">taxiways</a> on either side and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revetment.html" title="Revetment">revetments</a> for 62 aircraft placed along them. The runways and taxiways were covered with steel matting called <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marston_mats.html" title="Marston mats">pierced steel plating</a>, or PSP.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a> the 456th group headquarters reached Stornara and activated the base. The group's bombers began arriving from Tunisia on February 1. On a training familiarization flight on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a> another B-24 was lost, crashing into a mountain while flying in clouds, killing all aboard including three aircraft commanders.</p>
<p><b>Combat operations and tactics</b></p>
<p>The 456th Bomb Group flew its first combat mission on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, less than two weeks after reaching Italy. The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Fifth_Army_38c4.html" title="U.S. Fifth Army">U.S. Fifth Army</a> had conducted an amphibious landing at <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzio.html" title="Anzio">Anzio</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a> to outflank the German <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Line_a2fc.html" title="Gustav Line">Gustav Line</a>, and the German Army had begun counterattacks against the beachhead. The 456th was tasked to attack a German <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_post.html" title="Command post">command post</a> near <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grottaferrata.html" title="Grottaferrata">Grottaferrata</a> and encountered no opposition, but when the group reached the target area, they found it completely obscured by clouds and returned without dropping their bombs.</p>
<p>Continuing poor weather conditions prevented further missions for another week, during which time the group continued flight training in combat formations. The 456th employed the six-<a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_box.html" title="Combat box">combat box</a> tactical formation favored by the Fifteenth Air Force to maximize defense against intercepting <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighters</a> (for a detailed description see <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_box.html#Fifteenth_Air_Force_formations" title="Combat box">six-box formation</a>). When the weather cleared on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, the 456th repeated its earlier mission to bomb the command post at Grottaferrata. Although judging the results of bombing as successful, the 456th was engaged by nine fighters and severe <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flak.html" title="Flak">flak</a>, suffering its first combat losses as two bombers were shot down.</p>
<p>On six of its first ten missions weather conditions were poor and no bombs were dropped. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a> the group was one of several which bombed <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Cassino_3751.html" title="Monte Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> in support of Fifth Army operations. The second unit of the 456th dropped its bombs in error on Allied troops, for which the deputy group commander was removed.</p>
<p>The 456th struck its first <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic target</a>, the aircraft engine plant at <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr.html" title="Steyr">Steyr</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>, and on April 12 encountered its first severe air combat with German fighters. Over 100 intercepted the mission to the airfield at <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_V%C3%B6slau_269f.html" title="Bad VÃ¶slau">Bad VÃ¶slau</a>, Austria, and in a 40-minute battle shot down three Liberators. Four more were lost to 65 fighters on an <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a> mission to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucharest%2C_Romania_22f1.html" title="Bucharest, Romania">Bucharest, Romania</a>. The missions to Romania ushered in a campaign by Allied strategic bombers against oil production, concentrating on the refinery operations at <a href="../../../p/l/o/Ploie%C5%9Fti.html" title="PloieÅŸti">PloieÅŸti</a>. The 456th made the first of ten attacks on PloieÅŸti on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_5.html" title="May 5">May 5</a>, losing three aircraft, including one when a crewman bailing out of a stricken bomber knocked part of the wing off another in the same formation.</p>
<p>The 456th earned the first of two <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Unit_Citation_15f7.html" title="Distinguished Unit Citation">Distinguished Unit Citations</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a> for a mission to bomb the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henschel_%26_Son_7db9.html" title="Henschel &amp; Son">Henschel &amp; Sohn</a> aircraft factory at <a href="../../../w/i/e/Wiener_Neustadt_c9f3.html" title="Wiener Neustadt">Wiener Neustadt</a>, Austria, for attacking despite severe losses (five shot down and the remaining 26 damaged) after the other groups on the mission turned back because of bad weather. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, returning from a mission in which they were unable to bomb, two Liberators collided in mid-air directly over the base, killing all but one of the 20 crewmen aboard and dropping live bombs on the field.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the 456th Bomb Group began flying a four-box 40-aircraft diamond formation to concentrate its bombing pattern for greater accuracy. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, the group earned its second DUC on a mission to bomb the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Oil_d4bf.html" title="Shell Oil">Shell Oil</a> <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refinery.html" title="Refinery">refinery</a> at <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. 31 aircraft bombed the previously-untouched refinery at mid-morning and three minutes after bomb release, before reassembly in the new formation, were attacked by 50 <a href="../../../m/e/-/Me-109.html" title="Me-109">Me-109s</a> and 10 <a href="../../../f/w/-/FW-190_c4ce.html" title="FW-190">FW-190s</a> of Luftwaffe <i>gruppe</i> JG.302 and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_Air_Force_13b1.html" title="Hungarian Air Force">Hungarian Air Force</a> 101 Puma Group. The second box of the 456th bore the brunt of the attacks, with the 744th Bomb Squadron losing six of nine bombers in the target area and a seventh damaged beyond repair. 36 airmen were killed or missing and 24 captured, the largest single-day loss for the group.</p>
<p>Beginning <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a> the first crews of the 456th completing the 50 missions required for a combat tour by the Fifteenth Air Force began returning to the United States. The last crew among the original 68 to be lost in combat went down on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>.</p>
<p>The last of 19 missions against Romanian oil production occurred <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>. Missions continued against oil and synthetic oil production facilities at Odertal, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>; <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floridsdorf.html" title="Floridsdorf">Moosbierbaum</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Austria; <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brux.html" title="Brux">Brux</a>, <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>; and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Blechhammer</a>, Poland, with 26 bombers lost on 23 missions. Bombing of German lines of communication, particularly <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshalling_yard.html" title="Marshalling yard">marshalling yards</a> and railroad bridges, remained a priority to the end of the war.</p>
<p>After August 1944 the 456th did not lose another aircraft to fighter defenses, but losses continued to accumulate from anti-aircraft fire. In the remaining nine months of operations 43 bombers were lost, most to flak. Three or more bombers were lost on five missions, including <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">November 11</a>, when three planes crashed into the Adriatic after being recalled from a mission. In February, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the 456th began flying two missions per day, termed Red and Blue.</p>
<p>The last combat loss in the group occurred on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a>, 1945, at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a>, Austria. The following day, while General of the Army <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_H._Arnold_7002.html" title="Henry H. Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, commanding general of the USAAF, was visiting the base, the 456th flew its last mission of the war against a transportation depot at Tarviso, Italy, and scored a bombing accuracy of 100%. General Arnold was also present at Stornara when news was received of the <a href="../../../v/e/_/VE_Day_06de.html" title="VE Day">surrender of Germany</a>.</p>
<p><b>Statistical summary of operations and further history</b></p>
<p><b>Bombing summary</b>: At the close of the 456th's European operations, its group statistical officer issued a summary of its combat operations. During its 249 bombing missions, the 456th flew a cumulative total of 7,272 <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortie.html" title="Sortie">sorties</a> and dropped 13,939 tons of bombs on <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers.html" title="Axis powers">Axis</a> targets. 45% of this total was dropped on <i>lines of communication</i> targets, 18% on <i>oil production and storage</i>, 14% on <i>airfields</i>, 12% on <i>industrial infrastructure</i>, 6% on <i>troop concentrations</i>, and 5% on <i>targets of opportunity</i> or <i>other</i> types. The 456th had the highest average percentage of bombing accuracy within the 304th Bomb Wing and progressed from an average of 20.1% accuracy (bombs falling within 1000 feet of the aiming point) in its first full month of operations to 71.9% during its last full month of operations. This accuracy average was higher than all but one Eighth Air Force group.</p>
<p><b>Maintenance summary</b>: The 456th averaged a maintenance rate of 83% for daily availability of aircraft for mission assignments, again the highest within the 304th Wing.</p>
<p><b>Summary of losses</b>: The 456th had 111 bombers destroyed or written off as salvage during its overseas assignment. Of this number, 89 were destroyed in combat (19 shot down by fighters, 55 by flak, and 15 by unknown means), with 74 of those crashing in Axis-controlled territory, 9 in the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic_Sea_c752.html" title="Adriatic Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, 2 in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, 3 in <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a>-controlled territory in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and one on the island of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vis_%28island%29.html" title="Vis (island)">Vis</a>. 13 aircraft were destroyed in non-combat related accidents: 3 in flying crashes, 2 on take-offs, 3 on landings, 2 in a mid-air collision over the base, and 3 in accidents while on the ground. 9 battle-damaged aircraft were written off as beyond economical repair. 36 of the original 61 bombers were destroyed and all but one of the rest taken out of service as "war weary".</p>
<p>3,267 aircrew served in the 456th Bomb Group during the war. 1,079 or 33% were aboard aircraft destroyed. 331 airmen were killed in action, 206 remain missing in action, 271 were made prisoners-of-war, 6 were interned in Switzerland until the end of hostilities, 108 evaded capture and returned to duty, and 49 returned to base. Of the 108 evadees, 9 evaded capture in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, 10 in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, and 89 in <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. 26 of the original 68 combat crews and 17 of the first 27 replacement crews were shot down.</p>
<p><b>Post-War USAF History</b>: The 456th was returned to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schilling_Air_Force_Base_c920.html" title="Schilling Air Force Base">Smoky Hill AAF</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salina%2C_Kansas_3bb3.html" title="Salina, Kansas">Salina, Kansas</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, for conversion to a <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29_Superfortress_ad11.html" title="B-29 Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> group and operations against <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. The war ended before the conversion was completed, however, and the group was inactivated on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, 1945. The 456th was re-activated three times as part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a>.
