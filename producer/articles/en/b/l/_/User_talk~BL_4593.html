<p>On the issue of Palestine, I have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much of the British Mandate became Jordan, Israel, West Bank, and Gaza (respectively)? (I'm guessing, from sheer ignorance, that Jordan got about 60%, Israel 25%, West Bank is 10% and Gaza is 5% -- but I'd like to know, so I can put it in the article.)</li>
<li>Who regards Jordan as part (or not part) of Palestine?</li>
<li>Who considers Jordan a "Palestinian state", and why?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Who considers Jordan not to be a "Palestinian state", and why?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks I did. Seems like I was definitely wrong.</p>
<p>BL, I was merely holding a position based on what I have read on this subject, based on the belief that my sources were accurate and unbiased. Don't all of us operate in this way? If it so happens that these sources are shown to be inaccurate and biased, then I simply will no longer support claims to accuracy on these issues. As I respect science and history as sacred domains, I try to keep an open mind. As it happens, I have been reading what you and Zero0000 have uncovered and discussed, and have done so with an open mind. I thus am willing to change my mind on this subject, and I defer to your findings on this topic. So relax, I now agree with you. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:51, 10 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, I haven't heard any response from you, which is a little surprising since this topic seemed very important to you. But if you still are interested in this topic, let me know what you think about this excerpt on the issue of Arab population growth in Palestine; it is from <i>The Encyclopaedia Judaica</i>, Keter Publishing. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, Wikipedia is a mere past-time to me and currently I mostly have more important/funnier things to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ISRAEL, STATE OF: ARAB POPULATION</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In 1917, at the time of the British conquest of Palestine during World War I, the country's Arabic-speaking population numbered less than 600,000 persons; in 1947 it was estimated at 1,200,000. This enormous increase, by more than double in 30 years, was accompanied by steady progress in health, education, and standard of living. These achievements were partly due to the more efficient administration introduced by the Mandatory government, which improved security, consolidated land tenure and lessened the power of local autocrats, paid more attention to the needs of the villagers, expanded health and educational services, fostered agriculture, and abolished conscription. In the main, however, Arab progress-far superior to that registered in the neighboring countries, where Britain and France had introduced similar administrations-was</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Adjacent Arab countries did not develop as quickly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>connected with the growth of the Jewish community and its efforts to develop the country. This is shown by the comparative vital statistics, percentage of school attendance, and number of doctors, nurses, teachers, and so forth. Tax revenue</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Zionists brought a lot of capital to Palestine but don't forget their... uhm.. "ethnocentric" policy of only hiring Jews and not selling land to Arabs. But as most Jews settled in urban areas they were obviously gave a boost to Arab farmers markets. Also the Brittish built a lot of schools and stuff and other Arab countries also invested in Palestine.</dd>
</dl>
<p>received from the Jews by the Mandatory government enabled it to improve its health and education services for the Arabs. The Jews introduced better transportation and more modern banking and production methods; they provided an expanding market for Arab agricultural produce, as well as a convenient labor outlet. Their public services, which were partially at the disposal of the Arabs, stimulated them and the government to create similar facilities for the Arab population. Thousands of Arab immigrants, mostly illegal, entered the country throughout the period....</p>
<dl>
<dd>...The first official census in 1922 counted some 752,000 inhabitants, of whom 83,790 were Jews. Of the 668,258 non-Jews, 78%-589,177-were Muslims; there were 71,464 Christian and 7,617 Druze and others. In March 1947 the non-Jewish population was given as 1,319,434: 1,157,423 Muslims, 146,162 Christians, and 15,849 others. (The figures for Arabs in 1947 were, apparently, inflated because of the institution of rationing in 1942 and the consequent reluctance to report</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't buy this. There was no census made after 1931. The population data after that year are based on demographic studies which the institution of rationing should have no impact on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>deaths.) Most of the Christians were also Arabs, but their total included a substantial number of English, other Europeans, and Armenians as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the Arab growth was a result of the extraordinary natural increase, due to the fall in the death rate and the rise in fertility, while the birthrate remained stable. Natural increase rose from 23.3 per thousand in 1922-25 to 30.7 in 1941-44. Fertility, as measured by the average number of children born to a Muslim mother, rose from 6.1 in 1927-29 to 8.1 in 1942-43...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...Improvements in health conditions by the drainage of swamps, better sanitation, and modern medical methods were largely responsible for almost halving the infant mortality rate among Muslim children and raising the average life-span by more than ten years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...Part of the increase in Arab population, however, was due to migration. In the 20 years between 1922 and 1942, 20,015 Muslims, 15,645 Christians and 336 others (excluding Jews) were officially registered as immigrants to Palestine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True true. But at the same time there was emmigration which this text doesn't tell us about. <a href="http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/e3ed8720f8707c9385256d19004f057c?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/e3ed8720f8707c9385256d19004f057c?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>is an orginal source which to me seems very reliable so I don't know why to look any further than that? That report states that the there for each year between 1920-1930 was a larger emmigration than immigration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since there was considerable unrecorded movement of laborers across the borders, especially from Syria, the actual number of immigrants was undoubtedly much larger; it has been estimated as high as 100,000.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By whom? 100,000 people would have made footprints in the archives. The number is either a extremely gross overestaminate or a blatant lie. <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 01:50, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the point is that they <i>did</i> make footprints, and the article refers to them. And other historians I have read have said the same thing on this issue. By the way, the man quoted is a respected historian; please don't attack him in this way. I think it is a problem that you reject all other demographic studies other than those that are a census. That is not valid methodology; historians and sociologists often use many other techniques to, fairly accurately, infer population size and growth. Your rejection of reports other than a direct census is a rejection of a mainstream historical technique. So I still agree with you that Arab immigration into Palestine is a lot less than I had earlier been led to believe; I still hold by my retraction of my earlier position. However, I am also fairly sure that it is not anywhere as small as you say. The report I quoted above seems well researched. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:03, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BL, I'm curious why you re-instated the troll comment about jews ruling non-jews on the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsrael_a5cf.html" title="Talk:Israel">talk:Israel</a> talk page. Going by the edits of that user on other pages, it wasn't a serious comment but something put on to deliberately provoke a reaction. Various pages linking to Israel or Jews have been targeted by a series of IPs in the 67 and 68 range, some provocatively hostile to Israel, some so sychophantically (may not be the right spelling but fuck it, I'm too knackered to care!&#160;:-) ) pro-Israel they are unambiguously phoney. As you know, the Israel page and one or two others are like tinderboxes just waiting for someone to cast a match onto them. Whatever about rows over real comments, I thought it unwise to leave a crude piss-take that some people might believe was real and get angry over. We have had enough trouble on that page without phoney wind-up comments triggering off rows.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 05:34, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I couldn't find another sysop around and I've been dealing with this asshole for a while so I can spot his distinctive use of language (even when he pretends he holds diametrically opposite viewpoints) a mile off. I caught him up to his usual bs (he added in the following to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> - <i>Jews are very nice people, and it is extremely unfair that so many different cultures from different parts of the world, at different periods of human history, have said similar things about this nice peopel. Terrible attributes like stinginess, tight-fistedness, money-grabbing, greedy, conspiring, networking amongst themselves to the detriment of their host nation, living parasitic lives among the Goyim, and other unfair attributes of the sort, are just false and unfair accusations, probably out of jealousy because the Jews are so good-looking that the lowly Goyim have always been jealous of this nice shadow nation.</i>) so had to intervene, just as I have over trolls trying to put in anti-Palestinian rants or adding in pro-Israeli slants to Current Affairs.</p>
<p>I've reported his behaviour in detail on the wiki-list with a request for people to decide what to do; Jimbo is talking about having to block his whole IP range if this nutter does not stop. I've also put details on the vandalism page. I do agree that <i>normally</i> talk pages are sacrosanct, but trolls are the exception. This is a four-times blocked user who is only trying to cause trouble. Trolls have their comments routinely deleted on sight. I have removed everything he has done under his latest IP and reverted all edits made under different identities. The bottom line is to get it through to this asshole that he can try all he wants to trigger off rows, but that nothing he contributes will be left for long enough to allow his stirring of trouble to suceed. So either he starts acting like you and everyone else and behaves contructively or he gets to make no contributions, period. Doing blacket reversions using stops trolls in their tracks; it soon dawns on them that every minute they spend adding crap to wiki is a waste, as it is binned as soon as they save it. Even king troll, Michael, only comes on in spurts now and again, rather than every day, now that he realises that his hours of hard work trolling are reverted in minutes, his new articles deleted on sight, etc. And DW actually went away for a while (though it seems that he had returned lately). Even Adam Rinkleff has finally got the message and gone. Unfortunately allowing trolls space doesn't work. They just keep behaving the same way. Right now this nutter is left with only one alternative; if he <i>wants</i> to contribute then he has to stop the bullshitting and behave himself. Otherwise he is simply wasting his own time with nothing to show for it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 06:17, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, BL. I lived in the Old City for seven years, so I know the gates pretty well, but unfortunately, I don't have my written sources with me here to look up precise information. One thing to keep in mind is that there were several periods in Jerusalem's history, each of which had different gates to the city, and there were also gates to the Temple Mount. In biblical times there were five gates to the Temple Mount, but now there are something like 15 (I don't remember the exact number and I could be wildly off). Tadi was definitely a Temple Mount Gate: you can still see a tiny piece of it at the southern extreme of the Western Wall Plaza (under the slope leading to the Moghrabi Gate, which leads to the Temple Mount). I will see if I can find some more information. BTW, the current walls were built by Suleiman the Magnificent, though there are older strata (Byzantine, Herodian, and even Hasmonean--in the southeast corner of the Old City you can see the "seam" where Herod extended the Temple Mount. Jaffa Gate was built on the site of earlier gates, including a Herodian gate by what is called Phasael's tower (there were three towers there). THe wall alongside it was breached in 1902 to allow Kaiser Wilhelm II to make a pilgrimage with his entourage. Since then, they also tore down the Ottoman clock tower over the gate. I will add a bit here and there, but you seem to be doing a great job on your own. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>

<p>I enjoyed reading your astute comments on the privatization page. A while ago, I added content to the privatization page, specifically the theory behind it. While I agree that it's generally valid theoretically, your points are often correct in practice.</p>
<p>Since it seems that you're also interested in economic policy, you might want to take a look at some content that I added a while ago to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_post-communist_Russia_8708.html" title="History of post-communist Russia">History of post-communist Russia</a> article. It's the best example on Wikipedia, of which I'm aware, of an in depth look at privatization in practice. Specifically, you might be interested in the sections on the three stages of privatization in Russia and the next section on the so-called "virtual economy" (a term coined by economists Clifford Gaddy and Barry Ickes in reference to post-Communist Russia). Since it's a long article, you'd be able to find these sections by clicking on the link in the pop up table of contents box at the top; the sections of privatization are under the broader heading of "democratization and its setbacks." (Just to make a brief note about the structure of the article, the content doesn't really separate sections on economic restructuring and democratization, since they're so intertwined in a country remaking both its economic and political institutions.)</p>
<p>The sections that I'm recommending bring up all the sharp insights that you made (i.e. that design is more important than the mere transfer of ownership). Here, I'll just summarize the points made in the Russia article. State monopolies were rarely restructured before privatization. Thus, there was little competition over price and quality for consumer demand. In turn, there were few incentives to invest capital to salvage inefficient value-losing enterprises. Thus, efficiency (in terms of minimizing costs per unit of output) rarely improved. Instead of channeling investment into privatized enterprises, asset stripping (facilitated by capital market liberalization) was the common result. Moreover, despite sweeping openings, capital markets (i.e. the mechanisms to channel private savings into Russian companies) remain week.</p>
<p>It would be great if your interest in the articles on post-Communist Russia were aroused since I cannot find anyone interested in this subject. This is baffling since it is such a contentious topic. In academic literature (and especially within Russia), reform strategies, the sequencing of reform, and the pace of reform in post-Communist Russia remain contentious topics, argued often with great personal bitterness. After all, many prominent former Soviet specialists in the West were very active in the design of new economic and political institutions in Russia. Subject to harsh retrospective criticism, many economists at the US Treasury Department, IMF, World Bank, and top US universities have become very defensive. It's still a heated subject in the top journals, academic literature, and major periodicals on Russia and economics.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry if my comments were a bit on the lengthy side. Don't feel compelled to redirect your attention to post-Communist Russia if you're uninterested. It's only my guess that you would be from your insightful comments. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 06:03, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW, since you are frequent contributor to Palestinian-related articles, I'm sure that the loss of the great scholar Edward Said isn't news to you.

<p>What is a "night wather state"? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<p>I meant night watcher state. Such a state contain a state apparatus that only has the basic functions it need to survive. Those functions are: protection for individuals, protection for property and some form of self-protection. In Swedish it is called "nattväktarstat" I don't know how to translate it properly. <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 23:18, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>And wouldn't such a state have a "free market"? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<p>Such a states markets would quite possibly have few regulations, but what has that got to do with it? <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 23:54, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is a free market not defined, in essence, by having few regulations? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<p>Yes. Free market = unregulated. However a "free market" doesn't have the attributes liberalists tries to attribute to it, like competition, therefore the term is quite ambigous. <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 00:08, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why shouldn't the wikipedia state the "liberalists" (this is a poor word to use) believe that a free market has competition? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></p>
<p>Yes. But it should also state that their opponents believe that to be rubbish. <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 00:50, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>YES! I mean NO, I have nothing against that. In fact my intention was to list exactly which groups that was responsible.

<p>I have no idea. The additions the anon did may not be the most NPOV of edits I've seen, but the information gets thousands of google hits. The user is the same that Tannin temporarily banned a week ago for those particular edits. I tried to talk it out on the talk page, but to no avail so an hour later I reverted it to the anons edits but noone seems to be interested in neither discussing the issue or reverting anymore so there the page is.

Along these lines, we therefore accept that a user like Leumi inserts given POVs That being said, I would argue that these should be clearly labelled, and I am hoping that contributors like you will help us with these formulations.

<dd>I was also surprised on going to <a href="../../../j/d/b/JDBC_type_4_driver_200c.html" title="JDBC type 4 driver">JDBC type 4 driver</a> to see a VfD notice, and found nothing on the deletion page.

<p>Why reasoning was as follows: I looked at vfd and became somewhat aggrevated when I saw those fine articles listed. So I wrote something inflammatory about how bad it was that someone had listed those pages. Then I realised that if I removed them from vfd I would save everyone the trouble of voting because I was sure that they would not get deleted anyway. So I'm sorry if I stepped on anyones toes but you <i>are supposed</i> to edit boldly.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 16:04, Feb 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>On Hagana/h, the canonical transliteration would now be Hagana, however this is an example of a common word with a traditional transliteration that is widely known, namely Haganah. So on reflection I think it is best to go with tradition and use Haganah. On your other questions, I'll reply after I read a new source that I just found. A thought for the interim: the units of the Arab Legion inside Palestine before May 14 were officially on secondment to the British Army. Life wasn't meant to be simple, nor was history... --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 11:31, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like you to reconsider <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_numbers_Deletion_466a.html#Vote_on_inclusion" title="Talk:List of numbers/Deletion">your vote on the inclusion of articles about numbers</a> on Wikipedia. I am not opposed to number articles <i>per se</i>, but I am opposed to the trivial cultural properties which have been heaped upon many of these articles.</p>
<p>My rationale is that numbers are such a fundamental part of human culture, an article that lists <i>all</i> these associations would have proportions probably larger than all of Wikipedia taken together. To give you an example, Google returns 209,000,000 hits for the number 100 alone.</p>
<p>Please take a look at <a href="../../../1/_/%28/1_%28number%29.html#Other_fields" title="1 (number)">1 (number)#Other fields</a>. This is the type of lists I am referring to. Right now the article arbitrarily lists a few things where the number one has some significance: a DVD region, a personality test, a slang term (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not.html" title="Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a dictionary), American currency, a single dial code, several roads ...</p>
<p>If you think this information is valuable I am probably wasting my time. But I hope that after looking at several of these pages you will agree that these kind of lists make a joke of Wikipedia. They will always be arbitrary, they will always be in violation of the rules of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> (list repository, dictionary), and they will seriously damage our reputation.</p>
<p>If you see a compromise option which is not currently included in the poll, please add it. But please do not give these triva lists your rubber stamp of approval.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 11:14, Feb 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the moment in <a href="../../../k/f/a/Kfar_Kassem_massacre_f7b5.html" title="Kfar Kassem massacre">Kfar Kassem massacre</a>, Shadmi is sentences before being found guilty. That's not likely.</p>
<p>""the order was not of a kind that did not conform to the spirit of the times" is a direct quote from Morris, <i>Israel's Border Wars</i>. The two negatives cancel: the order conformed to the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Does Jiryis say what Shadmi's actual fine was? It can't have been one agora because the agora was not legal tender until 1960. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 03:38, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about how my nomination of you went at votes for admin. I'm really disappointed that there were so many unfair misgivings about the nomination. IMHO, you fit the profile of the model admin. Moreover, I'm wondering why you were not promoted to admin status, given that you won the vote by 11 to 10.

<p>Copyediting: You created the original copyediting page, and now after several users' contributions I'm trying to clarify whether the entry should really be under copyediting (I think probably so) or copy editor or what--see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Talk%7ECopy_editing_3dae.html" title="Talk:Copy editing">Talk:Copy editing</a>.

<p>Hi BL, the options listed are "keep the current format" and "make it the new format". I support a third option, "try Eloquence's proposed change", which is not listed under the vote. I would happily support your change for a trial period of thirty days, but Eloquence's proposal addresses a more pressing issue, the "consensus v.s. vote" question, so I want his proposal tested first.
