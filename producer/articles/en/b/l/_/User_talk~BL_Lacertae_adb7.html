<p>Hi! I noticed you added a British Government Stub to the O.H.M.S. page that I created. I'm not sure that this is entirely appropriate, as the endorsement is used by many other countries (eg Australia, Canada etc). jmd 23:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a new user, and since you've got a bit more experience, I'm going to generally defer to you on this AfD thing. I have a particular interest in the kind of philosophy that the subject of this article wrote about, encountered his journal publication in an academic context, and reflected that since the publication was considered important enough to consider at an undergraduate symposium, he might be included in WP. I added this article on the subject with the hopes that someone more familiar with the ideas of the subject would be able to expand the article.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure if, all that said, the article STILL isn't worthy under deletion policies. I realize that undergraduate research/thought, even when it's pretty worthy, is still difficult to consider "notable" in all but exceptional circumstances. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 02:50, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I had removed the israel-geo-stub from various Israel geography articles since some users have decided that it is POV. The new icon for this stub does not include the 'disputed territories' of the <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> / <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_and_Samaria_1107.html" title="Judea and Samaria">Judea and Samaria</a>, and is somewhat misleading for locations that are/were in these areas. I would prefer if the isr-geo-stub were a full map of Israel, or a simple flag since these <b>are/were</b> Israeli locations (if someone wants to argue that these aren't/weren'tIsraeli territories), but this issue has not been deicded yet. Please see: <a href="../../../i/s/r/Template_talk%7EIsrael-geo-stub_056c.html" title="Template talk:Israel-geo-stub">Template talk:Israel-geo-stub</a>.

<p>In a few places now (<a href="../../../w/i/t/Withypool.html" title="Withypool">Withypool</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Moors_Way_3ea9.html" title="Two Moors Way">Two Moors Way</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampford_Peverell_5380.html" title="Sampford Peverell">Sampford Peverell</a>) you've either changed a UK-geo-stub to Devon-geo-stub, or removed the UK-geo-stub when both were present. My thinking is that having both stubs is more useful—people might not see that a stub needs improvement if it's just pigeonholed under Devon, whereas they might be looking (more broadly) for UK stubs to fix, for example. I reverted the change to Two Moors Way, but after noticing that this is a consistent change, I wanted to ask you the reasons for you edits. Is there a protocol or style thing about multiple stub categories that I don't understand?

<p>Hi there! just a heads-up - noticed that you put an lgbt-stub on Gay Press Organization, but it didn't work because it's got to be LGBT-stub, not lgbt-stub. fixed it, so don't worry, just thought i'd let you know so you don't have to go back and change any others. i don't know if it's possible to put in a redirect, cos i'm pretty new, but let me know and i'll do one! cheers -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem">ConDem</a> 01:47, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again. Thanks for your response. I did think about the links to local pubs, but decided to include them based on the guidelines that:-</p>
<p>1) The links add meaningful content that is not suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. (Icons regarding facilities offered, types of drink offered, photographs etc). I'm not sure Wikipedia wants an individual page for every pub in the UK/World, but nonetheless it does add to the information on a given locale or, in this case, River.</p>
<p>2) The site is an open directory. Users can update the information any of the pages.</p>
<p>3) The site is non-commercial. It's my site, started as a hobby way back. The idea is to add information about pubs for everyone (especially travellers and tourists) to use. Pubs are my special interest subject (what does that say about me?). Needless to say there are no fees etc involved.</p>
<p>4) The site is NPOV. Although I encourage users to add whatever information they can, I have a strict editing policy so that 'the best pub in Glasgow' or whatever, gets removed. The idea is to state facts rather than opinions.</p>
<p>5) If I'm honest, I don't have time to add all the information on my site to Wiki, but I do feel the info adds to an understanding of a given locale. Also, when my site is updated, as it frequently is, any links on wiki automatically go to the latest information. By the way, there are plenty of pages within my site that would add NO value to wiki, so clearly there's no reason to link to those (where the information is patchy or out of date).</p>
<p>All that said, I am clearly biased! The world of pubs is clearly where I can add most to wiki, but if experienced users like yourself feel this goes against what wiki is about, you just need to let me know. In that instance I'll try and add info where I can, but avoid the links.</p>
<p>Would very much welcome your guidance on this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<dd>Hi once more. Thanks for a very thorough response. I think with any future entries, I'll make my judgement as to whether any link really does add something to the article. Then, if an editor disagrees with me, we can discuss it. That's what I love about WP, it's truly democratic!</dd>

<dd>Can I ask a stub question? I've just added a stub on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winterbourne_Viaduct_924b.html" title="Winterbourne Viaduct">Winterbourne Viaduct</a>, an architecturally significant viaduct/bridge near Bristol. Now, I've put that its a Gloucestershire location stub; but I was wondering what the guidelines are for other stub categories. I'd like people who are knowledgable about viaducts, railway crossings, architecture etc. to be able to expand this, but I'm not sure how many and which stubs I should add? Sorry to be a pain, but once I get the hang of it, I won't bother you so much! <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncshine_d626.html" title="User:Duncshine">Duncshine</a> 09:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>to rant: "to speak or declaim in a violent, loud, or vehement manner". yup - ranting. my vote simply makes it clear that this article is not encyclopedic. it might be useful in one of wikipedias sister projects but it doesnt belong here in that form. and did you or did you not claim that my comments were "very clumsy"? did you or did you not attack my knowledge of the subject area based on my lack of edits to other wikipedia mathematics articles? both <i>ad hominem</i>, personal attacks. <small><i><a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="#990000">BL Lacertae</font></a> - <font color="#555555"><strong class="selflink">kiss the lizard</strong></font></i></small></li>
</ul>
<p>I <b>did not</b> claim you lacked knowledge of the subject based on a lack of edits. What makes you think I did? I merely <b>asked</b> what experience you had.</p>
<p>My "very clumsy" remark was about those particular comments of yours.</p>
<p>Although I have never said before that you are not knowledgeable in mathematics (I don't know what makes you think I said that) I will now say something on that: I think if you knew much about the subject, you would not be saying that "if there was a similar mathematical proof presented that any x was greater than any y it would not be encyclopedic either" --- as if such a thing would necessarily be comparable.</p>
<p>I haven't launched any ad hominem attacks. An ad hominem attack looks like this: "Ronald Reagan is a Republican, therefore his argument makes no sense." I never said that any particular fact about you implies your arguments make no sense.</p>
<p>And why would you consider it a personal attack if I say only that a particular thing you wrote was clumsy? That's about one thing that you wrote, not about you as a person. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:58, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I merely <b>asked</b> what experience you had.</i> And the point of that question, if not to suggest to readers that i did not know about the subject, was what, precisely? Couple that with the suggestion that my comment was clumsy, and there is the clear intention of showing that my knowledge of the subject is inferior to yours. is that in any way a defence of the article on its merits? no. it is an attack on my ability to judge the worth of the article. <small><i><a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="#990000">BL Lacertae</font></a> - <font color="#555555"><strong class="selflink">kiss the lizard</strong></font></i></small> 00:15, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I changed stubs in the articles about Kosovo cities. In fact I changed 3 different stubs into one: "Serbia-geo-stub", non-existing "Kosovo-geo-stub" (but it was in the articles) and "Euro-stub", into one singe "Geo-stub". I think that "Geo stub" is the best solution here until the final status of Kosovo is not defined to prevent further disputes about this. You said that "Geo-stub is only used now as a temporary holding template until things are sorted further", so in the case of Kosovo we can use it as a temporary holding template until the final status of Kosovo is known. However, it is only my suggestion since I will not change anything about these stubs in the future. If you want to change "Geo stubs" into something else, please do it, I will not object. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="red"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 13:37, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>See why I changed that into "Geo-stub":</p>

</ul>
<p>And he will also change the "Serbia-Montenegro-stub" which you posted into non-existing "Kosovo-stub", thus, the articles then will not have stubs at all. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="red"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 13:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, thank you to collaborate to an Italian commune geo stub. However, I ask you to check other communes entries which has been just expanded to see what would be the standard form of the article (examples: <a href="../../../a/c/q/Acquapendente.html" title="Acquapendente">Acquapendente</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molfetta.html" title="Molfetta">Molfetta</a>). This is why often you'll see History - Main sights - Transportation sections without any text below... they're an invitation! Further, if you've time, you could add the infobox to articles without or even the footer for the province communes. Data can be copied exactly from the corresponding article from it.wikipedia.org, ismply formatting them for the English version. Ciao!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for destroying the Historical London travel guide before my friends added content, I guess the era of (1) discussing before acting and (2) not worrying about stubs before they get content are over. Both of these used to be Wikipedia policy, but I haven't been paying close attention in recent years to how Wikipedia has changed. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_Lindahl_6d2c.html" title="User:Greg Lindahl">Greg</a> 06:15, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it didnt seem like a very encyclopedic thing (or likely to become one). the article already had a merge notice on it and there was no dicussion saying it shouldnt be merged. as it was there was so little there anyway that anyone reading the article would have thought "is that it?" it made far more sense for it to be part of the history of london article as the merger notice proposed. so there was an opportunity for discussing before acting but noone seemed keen to save it, and even a stub has to have some content - this had none. <small><i><a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="#990000">BL Lacertae</font></a> - <font color="#555555"><strong class="selflink">kiss the lizard</strong></font></i></small> 12:10, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just a note- as far as I know, it isn't necessary to list a page on AfD in order to contest a prod- I believe usually the onus is on the user who added the PROD tag to do so. I do agree that the wording on Proposed deletion is a bit ambiguous. Of course, you can list on AfD in order to gain additional community support for your position, and this may be your intention? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to add to the comment above: perhaps you are confused as to the nature of the prod template. Prod is essentially a "weak delete" which works only if no objections are raised. To override a prod you have only to remove it. Moving a prod to AFD is both unneccessary and wasteful. Thank you for your time. Fake User 06:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thanks to both of you but im only doing what it says at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>:</dd>

<pre>
Remove the {{<a href="../../../d/a/t/Template%7EDated_prod_1581.html" title="Template:Dated prod">dated prod</a>}} tag from the article, and optionally  
try to address the concerns of the tagging editor;  
OR
2.      Alternatively, nominate the article for an Articles 
for deletion debate.
</pre>
<p>so according to that if i remove the prod tag and dont try to address the concerns of the editor i have to nominate the article for an afd debate. <small><i><a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="#990000">BL Lacertae</font></a> - <font color="#555555"><strong class="selflink">kiss the lizard</strong></font></i></small> 08:42, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify that, and without meaning to arouse any confusion- you are well within your rights to move a PRODD'ed page (that you want to keep) to AfD if you see fit to do so, although this happens very, very rarely, and some voters may question whether it's worthwhile. It's a bit harsh to state that such an approach is unecessary and wasteful- you may feel for example that the most honourable and sensible way to settle an intractable dispute is to list the page and let the community decide, or you may want additional feedback as to article quality from third parties to crystallise a position that you are unsure about. There's no reason to avoid AfD if you feel there is a genuine reason for doing it, although obviously it might be considered a bit odd to nominate an article for deletion that you actually want to retain- and of course there is always the possibility that the article may actually be deleted against your wishes! It's always best to contact the editor who left the PROD tag first and try and discuss it sensibly, which may turn up a solution. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 08:47, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It might be a good idea to leave a message at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> talk and get some clarification. You certainly haven't done anything wrong btw- in fact it's admirable in my view that you stuck to policy even though it meant nominating articles you want to keep for AfD.<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 08:53, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello BL,</p>
<p>When I created the article, I at first used the Derbyshire Location stub but then changed it. The reason is that each of the villages (<a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockbrook.html" title="Ockbrook">Ockbrook</a> and Borrowash) is a location and deserves its own article. As a pair, they are not a location but a civil parish and (a somewhat mismatched) administrative area.</p>
<p>This being so, the Derbyshire Locations stub doesn't seem quite right.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If theyre both in derbyshire then they should get the derbyshire-geo-stub - thats the way geo-stubs work. the england-geo-stub is for places that are in several counties like <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestral_Thames_bf56.html" title="Ancestral Thames">Ancestral Thames</a> and the UK-geo-stub is for ones dealing with the whole UK. <small><i><a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_Lacertae_bf5a.html" title="User:BL Lacertae"><font color="#990000">BL Lacertae</font></a> - <font color="#555555"><strong class="selflink">kiss the lizard</strong></font></i></small> 23:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm. I was thinking more along the lines of there being a need for a derbyshire-admin-stub, or similar. But that's probably a bad idea. In fact, come to think about it, the article may not be a stub at all as there's probably little else to say about it...

<p>ok thanks mate I wasn't sure. Thanks for the tip. I have found there are millions of uncovered places in Canada so I will be expanding and will categorize correctly! <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Janderson_0c19.html" title="User:James Janderson">James Janderson</a> 19:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BL Lacertae, would you please be interested in mediating a dispute that involes deletion of pertinent information from the Wikipedia articles? If you would consider being a mediator, I will fill you on the details. Please respond on this your page. Thank you, Barefact</p>

<p>I have added a "{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}" template to the article Leeds-Bradford, suggesting that it be deleted according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">proposed deletion</a> process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>). You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the <code>{{dated prod}}</code> notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion process</a>, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> or it can be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner"><b><font color="red">L.J.Skinner</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner"><font color="green"><i>WOT?</i></font></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_lewisskinner_f7ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/lewisskinner"><font color="blue"><i>I did</i></font></a></sup> 20:44, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
