<p>I've changed Northumerland back to Northumbria. It is not correct correct to say that the Northumbrian Smallpipe is primarily played in Northumberland. Northumbria and Northumberland are different places. Northumbria includes many places including Northumberland. I live in Sunderland and know of Smallpipe players. Also Sting uses the smallpipe in his Fields of Gold song. He was born in Newcastle which is not in Northumberland. The name is Northumbrian Smallpipes, not Northumberland Smallpipes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Eponymous one (<a href="../../../e/p/o/User_talk%7EEponymous_one_d970.html" title="User talk:Eponymous one">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eponymous_one_7da5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eponymous one">contribs</a>) 17:38, 28 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>According to the rail atlases I have to hand, the station name was Cockermouth in 1890, but Cockermouth for Buttermere in 1955. I don't know when it change, but I've left the station name as you edited it, i.e. Cockermouth. I have, however, removed the link to the town - I'll be creating a page for the railway station in the near future, and this will link to the town.--<a href="../../../t/i/v/User%7ETivedshambo_1e23.html" title="User:Tivedshambo">Tivedshambo</a> 16:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Murdos you have already mentioned in the article, legit source.</p>
<p>The Corbett Tops are hills in Scotland between 2500ft and 3000ft with 30m drop; they can be found at <a href="http://www.mountaindays.net/mountains/area.php?defn=5" class="external text" title="http://www.mountaindays.net/mountains/area.php?defn=5" rel="nofollow">this website</a>. I think the list was compiled by Clem Clements.</p>
<p>The Graham Tops are hills in Scotland between 2000ft and 2500ft with 30m drop. They can only be accessed if you become a member of <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rhb/" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rhb/" rel="nofollow">the rhb group</a> - given your CV you would probably benefit from doing so.

<dd>Thanks Mark. While these are all published sources of a kind (though I'm not sure if the RHB group is admissible), it looks as if the complete list of Scottish Hewitt-status hills qualifies as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">new analysis or synthesis of published data</a> and is therefore ineligible for Wikipedia. We can report on lists that have already been published, but not make up new ones of our own, even if they are simply existing lists joined together.

<p>The trouble is that there ARE lots of other possibilities for FRCC - which will duly arrive now that there is a stub. So I think it's best to recognise that and have a disambig forn the beginning.</p>

<p>I see you removed reference to the name "Charles Quint," saying, "delete irrelevant sentence - Charles Quint is just his French title." I know that this is what he is referred to as in French, but a) he is also sometimes called this in English, especially when spoken of; and b) it's not obvious why this title is particularly French. "Charles Cinq" or "Charles le Cinquième" would seem like the French version of "Charles V." "Quint" seems to be an archaism which is normally used in French <i>only</i> for Charles V. (The example given for the meaning of "Quint" in French in the wordreference dictionary is a sentence about Charles V.) Also, French was his native language. The use of "Charles Quint" seems to be fairly ubiquitous (there's a beer called "Charles Quint," for instance, and a tennis club in Brussels), and I don't see why it's not worth mentioning. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for the delay in replying - I've put it back with an appropriate qualifier. I'm still not convinced it's used that much in English; a Google search mostly yields pages related to the Low Countries that have quite possibly been influenced by the name of the beer! Interesting about the usage in French though, I hadn't considered that. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 09:01, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll repeat that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. "Islands of the North Atlantic" and "British Isles" are just 2 different terms that different people use to denote the same island group. The Wikipedia article on that island group, for better or for worse, is called <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. The only justification for having a separate article is if there's too much information on the term "Islands of the North Atlantic" to include in either <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> without overbalancing either article. My opinion is that there isn't, as I tend to favour long and comprehensive articles over short and insubstantial ones, but others may disagree; that's what we ought to be debating. If we have a separate article for each widely used term with political overtones, shouldn't <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malvinas.html" title="Malvinas">Malvinas</a>, or <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_of_Ireland_42cd.html" title="North of Ireland">North of Ireland</a>, be separated? --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 18:09, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My comment may have been unsourced, but so is the whole article at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroud.html" title="Stroud">Stroud</a>! I won't reinsert it, but -- as you are a resident and I'm not -- perhaps you might have more ideas than I do about how to draw attention to Stroud's distinctive nature. It is much more well-known than other towns of its size (e.g. Dunblane). Not to mention that is like saying <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Programme_3772.html" title="The Today Programme">The Today Programme</a> is a radio show -- those who haven't heard of it won't realise from that brief mention how influential it is.

<dd>Certainly most of the article is unsourced, but most of it is at least <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> (I won't say all). I think my main problem with your addition was <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">peacock terms</a>: "punches above its weight in terms of its cultural clout and presence in the popular imagination" doesn't really tell you anything about the place -- it's far more encyclopedic to say <i>why</i> it's important. More importantly, it's virtually impossible to verify that a place is better known than other places of the same size, unless surveys have been done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly see your point however -- the article doesn't really do enough to explain why Stroud is distinctive, though the bit beginning "Visitors and locals say that there is a unique and 'laid back' air to the town" is a start. Perhaps you would be able to quantify why you think it punches above its weight? How about "it is noted for its alternative and laid-back atmosphere" in the lead section? Which is probably a better claim to fame than steep streets and cafe culture, at least. Of course it should still be supported by a reference ideally, but there's a better chance of finding one. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 22:05, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a pleased visitor rather than a committed and knowledgeable local, I'll have to leave this question to others.

<p>Hi, I notice you reverted the anon user's edits re the "common misconception" about Ben Nevis being the highest mountain in the UK. Must admit I saw that and was slightly surprised to find out there was a 3000m mountain in the UK!! You are correct of course with this; however, his other edit that the Ben is the highest in the British Isles, is technically correct. As the British Isles is more geographically significant than the UK in terms of natural features, I wonder if that part of his edit should stand?

<dd>I tend to avoid using the term '<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>' on Wikipedia where possible, as it is somewhat contentious in certain quarters. See the article for the reason why, or explore the many pages of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles</a> if you've got a spare week or two! I don't have any problem with the term myself, and agree that the British Isles are more significant than the UK in geographical terms, but "United Kingdom" has the advantage of being a sovereign state, well known worldwide, unambiguous and not subject to neutrality disputes. It's a fair bet that if "British Isles" remained in the article it wouldn't be long before someone came along and changed it to "Great Britain" or even "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain and Ireland</a>". Come to think of it there are probably those who would claim (especially on the aforementioned talk page) that South Georgia is "a British Isle"... --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 21:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a lot of turkeys! (Not you <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalsteadk_f45b.html" title="User:Halsteadk">Halsteadk</a>! See below.) I just had a look at my old chum <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Nevis_baa0.html" title="Ben Nevis">Ben Nevis</a>. I have two suggestions and a question.</p>
<p>Suggestion 1) The north face is also one of Scotland's foremost venues for winter mountaineering on snow and ice, and holds snow until quite late in the year; <strike>and</strike> in a good year routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks, I hadn't spotted that. I intend to expand the climbing section soon, if I can, and I'll address grammar at the same time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Suggestion 2) 'Miscellany' rather than 'Trivia'. If it's trivial it shouldn't be there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that would be a better name; the reasoning behind <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/g/WP%7EOMG_aa45.html" title="WP:OMG">WTF</a>??

Calling it "Miscellany" still gives it the potential to attract, well, a miscellany of facts that ought to belong somewhere else.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have not simply edited the page as this is where my question comes in. I think it is a 'good article' but I don't feel fully qualified yet to judge if it is a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_article.html" title="Good article">good article</a>. I looked at the candidates page and was expecting to see a vote of some kind, not further bewildering jargon. Does 'Remove it from the list using the edit summary "Passed Article Name"' etc. mean something other than 'I think this is a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_article.html" title="Good article">good article</a>?' It's already been nominated, so it can't be a nomination. I am willing to be helpful but don't want to step out of line. (Nor did I want to edit it in case that precluded being helpful).

<dd>Sorry the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_Candidates_8f1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles/Candidates">Good Article candidates</a> page is a bit impenetrable. Basically there's no voting or discussion; it just takes one person to review the article according to the criteria and pass or fail it. (Obviously the system relies on trust to a fair degree, but it seems to work.) So if you "remove it from the list" etc. you're not just saying "I think this is a Good Article" but "I hereby declare that this is a Good Article" (which involves taking it off the list of candidates and putting a notice to that effect in the appropriate places). Hope that makes it a bit clearer!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding whether or not to edit, "if you have not contributed significantly to this article" certainly doesn't preclude a reviewer from fixing grammar or making minor changes; it just means you shouldn't have written whole paragraphs, I assume. In any case, if you'd like to edit the article I suggest you go right ahead and let someone else do the reviewing.</dd>

<dd>Personally I think it needs a bit of work if it's to pass.

<dd>I have a copy of Murray, W.H. (1977) The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland. London. Collins, which may provide some verification of a few facts and perhaps some additional evocative sentences. I don't want to start making unsolicited edits in the middle of a GA process as I have none of the history of the article. Murray makes the following statements:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From the car park in Glen Nevis "the open slope on your left runs four thousand feet to the summit of Ben Nevis at an angle of thirty-five degrees - the longest and steepest hill-slope in Britain."</p>
<p>"the Nevis gorge is the finest example of its kind in in Great Britain. It is only four hundred feet high, but the immense walls to its right and left are wooded in pine, oak birch and rowan. These sprout in profusion from the crags, giving the rock gorge a Himalayan character not seen elsewhere in this country."</p>
<p>The Steall waterfall "is 350 feet high and one of the three biggest in Scotland."</p>
<p>From the summit, "On exceptional days, Ireland can be dimly discerned a hundred and twenty miles away."</p>
<p>He insists that although it has "aroused much conjecture" the name Ben Nevis "derives from a Gaelic compound word Beinn-neamh-bhathais. 'Neamh' means the heavens or clouds; 'bathais', the top of a man's head (between crown and brow). A free translation is 'The mountain with its head in the clouds'."</p>
<p>"Atmospheric condensation tends to cover the summit with a cloud-cap when the rest of the sky is clear, hence it gets an average of only two hours of bright sunshine per day and an annual rainfall of 157 inches. The mean monthly temperature is half a degrees below freezing point. Snow may thus fall on the mountain at any day or month of the year."</p>
<p>"The summit area has an average of two hundred and sixty one gales per annum. Many of these reach hurricane force."</p>
<p>"The old Observatory near the cliff's edge was built in 1883 .... and closed down in 1904."</p>
<p>I suspect that an early un-referenced version of the article may have been based in part on this book. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 22:10, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The referencing system is not one I'm very familiar with. If each ref has a page number associated with it, this presumably means that each time I mention Murray it needs a separate ref rather than using the &lt;ref name=/&gt; trick. I'll proceed on this basis.

<p>Tha gu math Blisco? (Or something like that.) I noticed your addition to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assynt.html" title="Assynt">Assynt</a> stub and managed to find a reference which I have added. I see you have an interest in the Gaelic pronunciations of Scottish mountains. I recently created an article about <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubh_Artach_ad0a.html" title="Dubh Artach">Dubh Artach</a> which includes some rambling and speculative comments about the derivation of the name which I fear skates perilously close to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Despite my jaunty opening I am by no means a Gaelic speaker, but it seems obvious to me that <i>Dhu Heartach</i> is simply a sassenach's spelling of the sound <i>Dubh Artach</i> when spoken by a native speaker, but I lack any experience of phonetic renderings etc. If you have a moment I would be grateful if you could have a look at <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubh_Artach_ad0a.html#Celtic_Name" title="Dubh Artach">Dubh Artach#Celtic Name</a>. Any edits or suggestions re phonetic spellings in particular are most welcome. The <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacFie_7b2b.html" title="MacFie">MacFie</a>/<a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubthaigh.html" title="Dubthaigh">Dubthaigh</a> reference took considerable effort to sort out, but is probably misleading and I am considering amending it or removing it. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 11:09, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good article – I'm impressed! My limited knowledge of Gaelic isn't much help here, but I've added some similarly speculative comments plus one reference (albeit not exactly a cast-iron one). I'll explain them on the article talk page.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for all this. I have had another go and (I hope) removed the need for {fact} tags. Don't know how I missed the NLB 'the black one of death' idea. No wonder they changed the name!

<p>The article was on the main page for most of Saturday (not nominated by me), everybody else seemed quite happy with it, did small changes and I received some plaudits, until you decided to give it a major overhaul. Thats the reason I was not happy as you had done something similar with Sgurr na Lapaich.

<p>I have known for more than forty years that the Trig point was a few feet lower than the summit, but the fact had slipped my mind at the time of writing because of the illusion when you are up there that the Trig point is higher. It would be interesting to check OS heights, but I expect that they are correct. Is the GPS system very expensive? Dbfirs 22:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW a basic GPS can be got for around £100 I think, but they're not really accurate enough to measure heights to a 2m degree of accuracy - and in any case measuring the altitude and then putting it into a Wikipedia article would violate <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. The OS are probably right, though the 678m height is marked in orange rather than black on the map, so it may not be entirely reliable.</dd>

<dd>Nice article on Baugh Fell. I did a bit of restructuring to present the information in a more ordered way - I hope you approve. I don't know the area unfortunately, and any information I added was based entirely on a reading of the map, but I hope it's accurate! --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 18:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for tidying up. As you will realise, I am just learning Wikipedia rules. I was intending to remove the subjective bits because I noticed they didn't fit in with Wikipedia style. I don't think I can afford the professional GPS systems - they are very much more expensive than the £100 "toys" so I will just accept OS heights. The difference is too small to measure on a clinometer. Yes, your map-reading matches reality. Best wishes, Dbfirs 20:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
