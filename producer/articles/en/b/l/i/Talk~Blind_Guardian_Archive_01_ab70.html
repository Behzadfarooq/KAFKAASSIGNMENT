<hr />
<p>The first poster is right. Blind Guardian is one of the most time-honoured and influential power bands in metal today. The European power metal scene would probably be far less exciting were it not for their existence. It would be a downright lie to say they've been copied as many times as Helloween or Gamma Ray, but I'm sure that plenty of bands have been inspired by them. Just about every European fan of true heavy metal knows not only their name, but also their music. They're far less known to those from outside mainland Europe, but then again heavy metal isn't as popular elsewhere. Child of Bodom</p>

<dd>I'm very familiar with them, and:
<ul>
<li>They do not require having formal editorial boards or processes. (This would disqualify most external links currently on Wikipedia.)</li>
<li>I disagree that Metallian lacks such processes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Consider the facts, according to site:</dd>
<dd>It's the collaborative effort of at least 6 major contributers, going back 18 years. The content includes encyclopedic accounts on about 2000 metal bands, about 5000 album reviews, panel discussions with prominent industry professionals, and numerous band interviews<a href="http://www.metallian.com/interviewarchives.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metallian.com/interviewarchives.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The site's main editor, Ali, is professionally involved in the metal subculture, having been a writer and editor for several metal magazines (including one he co-founded), manager of the band <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kataklysm.html" title="Kataklysm">Kataklysm</a>, and volunteer presenter of a metal show on <a href="../../../c/k/u/CKUT-FM_fe8d.html" title="CKUT-FM">CKUT-FM</a>.</dd>
<dd>Whatever this might make of Metallian, i don't think a "fan site of no merit" and "little editorial process" is one of the possibilities.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, here's a point-by-point breakdown of how the page in question meets the criteria of what to link:
<ul>
<li>Usefulness: It includes information not found in the article, including two interviews with Hansi Kürsch</li>
<li>Tastefulness: Clean presentation, no advertising.</li>
<li>Accessibility: Mostly plain text, without extraneous markup/images.</li>
<li>Substantive longevity: The site has been running since 2002, and the existing content is quite stable.</li>
<li>Neutrality: The site does not push any controversial views (except maybe "heavy metal rules").</li>
<li>Accuracy: To the extent that i can tell, its facts are verifiable and correct, and it does not dabble in much speculation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, none of the criteria for link avoidance apply. (Since these are substantially longer and not overriding, i'll omit the point-by-point breakdown.)</dd>
<dd>If you disagree with me on any of the above points, or think there's any basic tenet that i failed to grasp, please enlighten me. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 04:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wizardry Dragon: In your most recent removal of the Metallian link, why did you also have to go and remove the band's official MySpace page and MusicBrainz entry? Are you aware that the first is mandated by <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and the second is undoing the work of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_MusicBrainz_8c3a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject MusicBrainz">WikiProject MusicBrainz</a>?</p>

<dd>Firstly, i want to re-emphasize what i noted earlier about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: it is a <i>content policy</i>, concerning <i>content</i> added to Wikipedia. It does <i>not</i> concern external links, which have their own set of criteria (<a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>). <small>(WP:V would not automatically disqualify MySpace pages anyway. Like with anything else, their verifiability depends on their content.)</small></dd>
<dd>Secondly, if MySpace pages (or similar things) are the official ones of an article subject, they are specifically encouraged, not discouraged. (Why do you think {{<a href="../../../m/y/s/Template%7EMySpace_b15c.html" title="Template:MySpace">MySpace</a>}} exists?)</dd>

<p>Eagle, Wizardry Dragon: did either of you even read what i've written? I have tried to explain in detail what the links add, and how removing them goes against Wikipedia's established policy, guidelines, and convention, and so far you haven't given any specific objection to my reasoning, nor a rationale for why this article should be an exception to the rule.</p>
<p>I'm trying my best to be reasonable and work towards consensus, but you don't make it easy by repeatedly claiming "link farming" without acknowledging or considering my side of the argument.</p>
<p>So, to repeat my position (in summary):</p>
<ul>
<li>The MySpace page adds a substantial amount of official content (news, tour/show details, competitions, ...) not found elsewhere, including the band's main site. For better or for worse, MySpace has become a significant form of online presence for many artists, which is why it's fairly standard to link to official artist profiles, and why there's even a dedicated template to do so (see its <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7EMySpace_8196.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:MySpace">backlinks</a> and failed deletion <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_19_4dd5.html#Template:MySpace" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 August 19">discussion</a> for examples and rationale).</li>
<li>The link to the MusicBrainz database entry is useful enough that there is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_MusicBrainz_8c3a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject MusicBrainz">an entire WikiProject</a> dedicated to adding them to all applicable articles. You are, quite simply, trampling on the work of these editors.</li>
<li>The Metallian link, which started this whole debacle, is useful for all the reasons already given above, and like the two previous links it is in accord with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">EL</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSTARD_2edf.html#External_links" title="WP:MUSTARD">MUSTARD</a>. A large number of other Wikipedia articles link to online databases like Metallian, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> and the <a href="http://www.bnrmetal.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bnrmetal.com/" rel="nofollow">BNR Metal Pages</a> when their content warrants it: are you advocating removing those links as well?</li>

<dd>Just adding to an already building concensus. Repeating what I've already said in a very clear edit summary...<a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> only allows for 1 fan page of lengthy history and notability and evne then...if it doesn't add anything to the article that isn't already there....it's a no go. And if only 1 fan site is allowed...surely one exists that is WP:EL worthy because metallian is an extremely poor website that doesn't add anything of any quality anywhere in Wikipedia. And, for the record, Encyclopaedia Metallum is just as bad. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFair_Deal_39d8.html" title="User:Fair Deal">Fair Deal</a> 04:22, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About being a poor website: Can please you elaborate/explain?

He has been reverted no less than ten times, and he continues. Heck, even a friendly IP reverted him.

<dd>Wizardry Dragon: I promise, i have no interest in proving points. I only care about this tedious and unpleasant dispute it to the extent that article quality is affected.</dd>
<dd>You make some serious accusations, but:
<ul>
<li>You don't mention that i did not originally add the Metallian link, and that i am not the only one to keep restoring it.</li>
<li>You don't mention that 7 of the 9 times i restored the Metallian link were in response to anonymous, rationale-free deletions (possibly vandalism). I reverted deletions by logged-in users only twice: once with Wizardry Dragon, yourself (after i answered your call to explain myself on the talk page, and waited an entire week for any response/objection before continuing anyway), and once with Eagle 101 (who had also deleted the band's MusicBrainz and (official) MySpace links at the same time). After this, i did <i>not</i> "continue": i stopped touching the article entirely, and turned to the talk page.</li>
<li>Your claim of consensus is based on a dangerously small sample, and for at least two of the links, heavily contradicted by circumstantial evidence (see my summary above).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(On the other hand, i can't refute your wikilawyering point. I don't see anything on my talk page that would qualify, but since it's something i strive not to fall prey to, and know i can't judge on my own, i would appreciate it if you could point me at what you were referring to, in private or on the side.) --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 01:18, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You are more than welcome to open a request, however. That is any Wikipedian's right.

It seems inappropriate that a mediator would be "taking sides" in any dispute resolution, as you seem to have. My only interest is in protecting the integrity of the articles, and of Wikipedia.

MedCab is a mediation facilitator, and I simply feel that this has largely been yourself and Piet against myself, seeing as the ground you seem to have been taken with many of the statements here is his. In fact, it's why Eagle hasn't responded here - what's the point of responding if the mediator appears to have already taken sides? Perhaps this was not your intention, I honestly don't believe it was, at least originally, but as a mediator you should be mindful of appearances, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>By the way, as a friendly notice, I would be careful what you refer to the higher end of dispute resolution - ArbCom - it is not something to be taken lightly, as they are very selective in the cases they take, and do not take to when people are simply passed on with no serious attempts at previous dispute resolution. ✎ <b><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon">Talk to Me</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wizardry_Dragon_5731.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wizardry Dragon">My Contributions</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_Wikipedia_Neutrality_Project_89be.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon/Wikipedia Neutrality Project">Support Neutrality on Wikipedia</a>)</sup> 18:41, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally, I agree with Wizardry about the MySpace link. It doesn't really add any content and the page is poorly designed and has large amounts of Flash. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">•</a> 19:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't really speak for its design (I kinda like it), but everything, and I mean everything, on that site is duplicated on the official site and it's forums. Tour dates, the movies, etc, are all available from the official site and it's associated forums. It does not seem productive to me to have redundant links. ✎ <b><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon">Talk to Me</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wizardry_Dragon_5731.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wizardry Dragon">My Contributions</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_Wikipedia_Neutrality_Project_89be.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon/Wikipedia Neutrality Project">Support Neutrality on Wikipedia</a>)</sup> 20:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly not, I would agree that any more than 3-4 links is generally inappropriate, especially for bands. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">•</a> 22:42, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It looks like we agree on restoring the MusicBrainz and Metallian links, and dropping the MySpace one, then? --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 22:54, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, done.
