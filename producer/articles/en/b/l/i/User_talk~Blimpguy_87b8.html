<p>Blimpguy, do your interests extend to the Zepplin raids of WW1? I'm working on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a> at present, and starting in the middle with the tween wars theorists, but there should be mention of the earliest strategic bombing campaign also. Slip on over and write it up, or if military history is not your thing, just let me know and I'll do it myself (after refreshing my memory - I'm getting rusty and I always try to get my mind around too many subjects at the same time).

<p>Hi Blimpguy,</p>
<p>I see you are an experimental airship designer. I admire you for it. My enthusiasm for lighter than air was greatly increased by reading John McPhee's book, <i>The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed</i> over 20 years ago. It has a lot of history. As I remember, he describes a hot air balloon passenger system that operated for a while in NJ in the 19th century. I know people keep trying to use lighter than air transport. Someone I know was involved a few years ago in a serious, but now cancelled, attempt to develop a fast cargo vessel. Good luck. <a href="../../../a/j/i/User%7EAJim_2216.html" title="User:AJim">AJim</a> 21:40, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Blimpguy- that page is coming to together well! Just as a pointer, its one of the few wikipedia policys not to jump to doing reverts. Also, language like 'Im sorry to say but...' as a phrasing to XX information is common way of nesting a viewpoint to have it sound more objective while simultaneously reducing the risk exposure of stating that viewpoint. I happen to agree the version you mentioned earlier there needed toned down, though I don't apreciate those methods. As a separate matter, and, as Im sure you noticed- wikipedia needs a lot of work in early aviation. Anyway I came across this <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_F._Ritchel_1398.html" title="Charles F. Ritchel">Charles F. Ritchel</a> with no article, apperently he did some work on early airships and thought you might be interested/know of him etc. Well thats all, look forward to reading any of your work on blimps. Good luck! <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyengine5_c699.html" title="User:Greyengine5">Greyengine5</a> 20:21, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings Greyengine5 -- I think there is a misunderstanding. I was very careful not to revert your edits. Morven did it without my knowledge or consent. As for "I'm sorry" -- I wasn't trying to be clever -- but to express genuine sorrow. In the past, every time the page approached neutrality, somebody came through and rewrote it in a very biased way. I was concerned we were headed down the same path.</p>
<p>This time, I think you, I and Jorge Stolfi are very much in agreement on where the article should go and I too am very pleased with the progress.</p>
<p>Re Charles Ritchel -- I don't recall hearing of him. I will keep my eyes open though. Regards <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 16:56, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry if misunderstood there- glad the page has moving away from that as I was not involved with earlier. I can understand why that would be the case though. I will, of course, be watching for any more attempts to engrandize what dumont did, as this is sort of thing is standard fare for early aviation. I tablized the the airplane info to. If you have link with more info that can be added as well that would be nice addtion to (weight, flight distance?, etc). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyengine5_c699.html" title="User:Greyengine5">Greyengine5</a> 23:08, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The information needs to be gleaned from numerous sources. It will be a while before I can add more. I need to get some "real" work done before I can do much more Wikipedia work. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 23:24, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Blimpguy, a question about <a href="../../../g/r/a/Image%7EGraf_zeppelin.jpg_7b31.html" title="Image:Graf zeppelin.jpg">Image:Graf zeppelin.jpg</a> you uploaded some time ago: could you possibly provide some source and licence information? I really like the photo and would be eager to use it in the German Wikipedia, but as consensus there is against "fair use" I can do so only if it is in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> or the like. --<a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.Rohrer_e497.html" title="User:J.Rohrer">J.Rohrer</a> 22:47, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to say that while I'm sure I checked the copyright status, I stupidly didn't record it - or where I got it from.

<p>Hi Blimpguy - I just noticed the way you added the stub information to <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Air_Engineering_Station_Lakehurst_98ee.html" title="Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst">Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst</a>. That's not the standard way templates work - the whole reason for templates is so that you can just type in a couple of words, rather than copying all the formatting. Have a look at how I changed the US-geo-stub you had to a slightly more specific US-northeast-geo-stub <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naval_Air_Engineering_Station_Lakehurst&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=18014154" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naval_Air_Engineering_Station_Lakehurst&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=18014154" rel="nofollow">here</a> to see how they're normally used. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 5 July 2005 13:25 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<dd>Hmm... you're right - there should be something about templates in the Tutorial pages, but I can't see it there anywhere. In any case, all you need is to use double curly-brackets around each suide of the template name, and that will link it. As far as the different stub categories are concerned, there are a huge number of them, and you were pretty accurate... the full list can be found at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Stub_types_99e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 5 July 2005 14:02 (UTC)</i></small></font></dd>

<p>Hi Blimpguy.</p>
<p>I am currently translating from English to French a story in which a lot of terminology about airships is used. So I encounter much trouble (my native language is French, and my background is not technical).</p>
<p>I am currently looking for information about airship vocabulary. Visual information, such as annotated charts with the different parts of the aircraft, would be very useful to me (so I could compare it with French sources). Thus I would be very pleased if you could help me to find such a resource (online or on good old paper).</p>

<dd>Dear Blimpguy, i saw your request on de:benutzer:Stahlkocher diskussion page. btw.: The picture was not tagged by Stahlkocher, but by Thuresson. However, german copyright law is VERY tricky, because it is now mixed up with european law. If the picture your dealing with was <b>published</b> prior 1959 in germany <b>first</b> the copyright will expire 25 years after publication, regarding to the expired KUG. If you did not know the year of puplication, or the photo is published after 1959, it is the best to deal with photos like art, which means public domain 70 years after death of the artist. The Graf zeppelin.jpg, most likely, is a scanned postcard published at around 1930, which means it is in public domain since 1955. But i will not swear.... -- <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStahlkocher1_7d0e.html" title="User:Stahlkocher1">Stahlkocher</a> 16:43, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It looks like you added the phrase "lined with a thin layer of metal" to the sentence that begins "The first hot air balloons were basically cloth bags" in the history section on hot air balloons.

I went by the <a href="../../../l/z/_/LZ_129_Hindenburg_7642.html" title="LZ 129 Hindenburg">LZ 129 Hindenburg</a> article and discovered that it has received a TOP rating in importance yet stands as a B rated article. The article, long and good as it looks, lacks citation. Q: Do you think the article is good, or is it flawed, or does it lack something? Is there anyone among you blimpies who could offer assistance to the article, like good referenced citations, so that it could stand up to a GA, A, or FA rating? Could you suggest biographical materials to use to verify and cite the many remarks in the article?
