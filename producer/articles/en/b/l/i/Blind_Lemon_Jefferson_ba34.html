<p><b>"Blind" Lemon Jefferson</b> (September <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>–December <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>) was an influential <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitarist</a> from <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>.</p>
<p>Despite his commercial success, Jefferson stands alone in a category of his own. His musical style was extremely intense and individualistic, bearing little resemblance to the typical Texas blues style of the 1930's. His singing and self-accompaniment seemed only loosely connected and he appeared to improvise his accompaniment. His irregular vocal style and his freely structured field holler rhythms made the tension between his guitar and his voice wildly unpredictable. He was not influential on younger blues singers as they did not seek to imitate him as they did other commercially successful artists. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> On the other hand, the white North Carolina performer <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Watson_0d35.html" title="Doc Watson">Arthel "Doc" Watson</a> credited listening to Jefferson's recordings as his first exposure to the blues, which would powerfully influence his own style.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson_ba34.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Jefferson is believed to have been born in <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coutchman%2C_Texas_dd25.html" title="Coutchman, Texas">Coutchman, Texas</a>, near <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wortham%2C_Texas_74b4.html" title="Wortham, Texas">Wortham, Texas</a>, the son of Alex and Clarricy Jefferson. He was a great and successful African American singer. It was long believed by most that he was born in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> (although some accounts varied the date by up to ten years) but research a century later revealed a census record that listed his birth record as September 1893. He was <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindness.html" title="Blindness">blind</a> or nearly blind from a young age, possibly from birth; the cause is unknown. It is important to note that there is nothing unusual about his given name "Lemon". Lemon was a common given name at the time of his birth, there being thousands of boys and girls named Lemon in the 1900 census, over a hundred boys and girls in Texas alone.</p>
<p>Where, how, and from whom he learned to play guitar and learned his songs is unknown. Around <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, he began performing at picnics and parties. He also became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns. According to his cousin, Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for <i>Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>They was rough. Men was <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">hustling women</a> and selling <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_liquor.html" title="Bootleg liquor">bootleg</a> and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, Lemon had moved to <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>, where he is reputed to have met and played with <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_Belly_d1c7.html" title="Lead Belly">Lead Belly</a>, as well as gotten (sic) married.</p>

<p>Unlike many artists who were "discovered" and recorded in their normal venues, in December <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> or January <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, he was taken to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically, Jefferson's first two recordings from this session were <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospel</a> songs ("I Want to be like Jesus in my Heart", and "All I Want is that Pure Religion"), released under the name <b>Deacon L. J. Bates</b>. This led to a second recording session in March 1926. His first release under his own name, "Booster Blues" and "Dry Southern Blues", was a hit; this led to the release of the other two songs from that session, "Got the Blues" and "Long Lonesome Blues", which became a runaway success, with sales in the six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>; 43 <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">records</a> were issued, all but one for <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Records_a07b.html" title="Paramount Records">Paramount Records</a>. Unfortunately, Paramount Records' studio techniques and quality were infamously bad, and the resulting recordings sound no better than if they had been recorded in a hotel room. In fact, in May 1926, Paramount had Jefferson re-record his hit "Got the Blues" and "Long Lonesome Blues" in the superior facilities at Marsh Laboratories and subsequent releases used that version. Both versions appear on compilation albums and may be compared.</p>

Label of a Blind Lemon Jefferson Paramount record from 1926</div>

<p>It was largely due to the popularity of artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson and contemporaries such as <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Blake_aaf2.html" title="Blind Blake">Blind Blake</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Rainey_85ca.html" title="Ma Rainey">Ma Rainey</a> that Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s. Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (although there is debate over the reliability of this as well); he was given a Ford car "worth over $700" by Mayo Williams, Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a frequently seen compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of pigeonholing his music into one regional category. He sticks to no musical conventions, varying his <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff.html" title="Riff">riffs</a> and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a "simple country blues singer".</p>
<p>Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, when Williams moved to <a href="../../../o/k/e/OKeh_Records_2f0b.html" title="OKeh Records">OKeh Records</a>, he took Jefferson with him, and OKeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's "Matchbox Blues" backed with "Black Snake Moan", which was to be his only OKeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. When he had returned to Paramount, a few months later, "Matchbox Blues" had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, under <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">producer</a> Arthur Laibly. Once again, Paramount's recording fares badly when compared with the OKeh version on compilation albums.</p>
<p>In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his now classic songs, the haunting "<a href="../../../s/e/e/See_That_My_Grave_Is_Kept_Clean_9299.html" title="See That My Grave Is Kept Clean">See That My Grave Is Kept Clean</a>" (once again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates) along with two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, "He Arose from the Dead" and "Where Shall I Be". Of the three, "See That My Grave Is Kept Clean" became such a big hit that it was re-recorded and re-released in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson_ba34.html" title="Edit section: Stories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stories</span></h3>
<p>As his fame grew, so did the tales regarding his life, often personally involving the teller. <a href="../../../t/-/b/T-Bone_Walker_8f6e.html" title="T-Bone Walker">T-Bone Walker</a> states that as a boy, he was employed by Jefferson to lead him around the streets of Dallas; he would have been of the appropriate age at the time. A Paramount employee told biographer <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Keepnews_46ef.html" title="Orrin Keepnews">Orrin Keepnews</a> that Jefferson was a womanizing sloppy drunk; on the other hand, Jefferson's neighbor in Chicago, Romeo Nelson, reports him as being "warm and cordial", and singer Rube Lacy states that Jefferson always refused to play on a Sunday, "even if you give me two hundred". He is claimed to have earned money wrestling before his musical success, which is further claimed as proof that he was not blind at the time (something of a <i>non sequitur</i>). <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Spivey_a9ec.html" title="Victoria Spivey">Victoria Spivey</a> elliptically credits Jefferson as someone who "could sure <i>feel</i> his way around".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson_ba34.html" title="Edit section: Death and grave">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death and grave</span></h3>
<p>Jefferson died penniless in Chicago in December 1929. The cause of death is unknown, rumours swirled that a jealous lover poisoned his coffee, but a more likely scenario is that he died due to a heart attack after being disoriented during a snowstorm (another scenario is that he froze to death). Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by pianist Will Ezell. Jefferson was buried at Wortham Negro Cemetery (now Wortham Black Cemetery). Far from his grave being kept clean, it was unmarked until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, when a Texas Historical Marker was erected in the general area of his plot, the precise location being unknown. By <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> the cemetery and marker were in poor condition, but a new granite headstone was erected in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>.</p>

<p>Jefferson had an intricate and fast style of guitar playing and a particularly high-pitched voice. He was a founder of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_blues.html" title="Texas blues">Texas blues</a> sound and an important influence on the next generation of blues singers and guitarists, including <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_Belly_d1c7.html" title="Lead Belly">Lead Belly</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightnin_Hopkins_bedc.html" title="Lightnin Hopkins">Lightnin Hopkins</a>. He was the author of many tunes covered by later musicians, including the classic "<a href="../../../s/e/e/See_That_My_Grave_Is_Kept_Clean_9299.html" title="See That My Grave Is Kept Clean">See That My Grave Is Kept Clean</a>". Another of his tunes, "Matchbox Blues", was recorded more than 30 years later by the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a>, albeit in a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_%26_western.html" title="Country &amp; western">country &amp; western</a> version credited to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Perkins_cf54.html" title="Carl Perkins">Carl Perkins</a>, who himself did not credit Jefferson on his <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> recording. Given this influence, it is unfortunate that many of the details of his life remain shrouded in mystery, perhaps forever; even the only known picture of him, shown here, is heavily retouched. However, at the time, "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_music.html" title="Race music">race music</a>" and its white cousin, "<a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillbilly_music.html" title="Hillbilly music">hillbilly music</a>", were not considered to be worthy of consideration as art, rather as a low-cost product to be sold and soon forgotten.</p>
