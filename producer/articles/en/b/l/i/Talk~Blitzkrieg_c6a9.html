<p>Remove reference to shock and awe and effects based warfare. They are sufficiently different from blitzkrieg not to be lumped together.</p>

<p>I have repositioned and change the caption text of jagdtiger. It is obvious that jagdtiger concept was totally opposed to Blitzkrieg needs, and actually it was an answer to the lasts years of war needings.</p>
<p>Any way, if the way of changing this reference is not correct, I would like to apologize. I don't want to be rude in any way.</p>

<p>I have read in a number of places that John Monash in WWI opted for co-ordinated armour and infantry instead of Haig's attritional tactics. The battle of Hamel Hill is a famous example. Also the Battle of Amiens. Furthermore I have read that the Germans based blitzkrieg on the successes of the Australians late in WWI in France. Some have argued that it wasn't invented by Monash, but it was clearly implemented very well by him and should at least be mentioned.Roonz123 05:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Did you have any particular Australian successes in mind or any specific books/sources making the link to the post-WW1 German doctrinal rethink&#160;? Combined arms, as i am sure you will agree, is a long way from 'Blitzkreig'. What evidence is there that Monash's success was down to a 'blitzkreig', i have been unable to find any tactical details of 'Hamel Hill'. Facius 10:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm considering removing or editing the section on the Precursor to Blitzkrieg. Von Moltke's and Schlieffen's plans did not call for a direct strike into Paris. Rather, they planned on battles of annihilation where the opposing army would be surrounded and destroyed, thus leaving the way to Paris or whatever strategically vital point open. This is what happened in the Frano-Prussian war. The German army surrounded and destroyed/bottled up the French armies at Metz and Sedan, then they went for Paris. Therefore, the section about the German army aiming straight for Paris is incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, the term Blitzkrieg was not of German origin. They did not actually start using that term until people outside of Germany did. The Germany tactics in WWII were battles of annihilation aided by mechanization. It was a mix of old and new. Guderian's theories were never actually practiced in their purest forms.</p>
<pre>
   Not too worried about the term. It's current now, so we can use it. But weren't WWI Sturmtrupen tactics a major precursor? The storm-troopers would drive forward as far as possible, bypassing pockets of resistence and cutting deep into lightly-defended rear areas, as I understand. Also, re Liddel Hart, the greatest effect of the attack on the French was that it froze their high command, and they stopped fighting back when they were still, technically, about as strong as the Germans.

<p>Remove section on the meaning of Blitz in German. They are possibly irrelevant and certainly not totally correct. "Blitzsauber", for instance, does not mean extraordinarily clean, it means "sparkling clean" (from the German verb "blitzen", to sparkle, to twinkle). Most German compounds containing "Blitz" seem to stress the "lightning fast" aspect of lightning, e.g. "blitzschnell", "Blitzeis", and of course "Blitzkrieg".</p>
<p>I reverted the following:</p>

<dd><i>Ironically, a French general was the first to suggest Blitzkrieg-style tactics, in which afterwards the Germans adopted and used against them in WWII</i></dd>

<p>I find it difficult to establish the sources for this belief since the 1923 review by the German General staff had these tactics in hand before it would seem that de Gaulle could have had the necessary experiences to make this statement. He may have made the statement but it is the qualification of 'first' that i doubt, unless you mean outside of the German Army. Facius 10:46, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am inclined to leave out the part about De Gaulle and the French general as an inspiration because:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 The type of warfare actually practiced by the Germans resembled the pocket battles and battles of annihilation. These tactics have been used through out history such as Cannae. The modern form of this largely due to Von Moltke who broke away from the use of columns which was made famous by Napoleon. Thus, the type of warfare actually practiced by the Germans in WWII was mostly of German origins.</li>
<li>2 In the English edition of Guderian's, the father of German Blitzkreig theories, book he acknowledges B.H. Liddell Hart as the inspiration. More importantly, both Fuller and Hart predates the works of de Gaulle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I do not think that statement is really accurate. It is sensationalist but not accurate.</p>

<p>I think this page is due for some overhaul. The article tends to lump together manuver warfare with Blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg is a subset of manuver warfare, which has been practice throughout history. The term Blitzrkieg is used to describe a type of warfare whereby the attacker avoids fortifications and strong-points and goes for the enemies' command infrastructures and other strategic locations. The infiltration tactics of the German stormtroopers can be throught of as a predecessor to Blitzkrieg. I think there is a great deal of confusion brought on by the word Blitzkrieg whereby any type of offensive that is fast is considered Blitzkrieg. This is not true. The German offensive of the Franco-Prussian war was relatively fast. Yet, this is not considered Blitzkrieg. Also, other than the infiltration tactics of WWI, there were no elements of Blitzkrieg in WWI. Blitzkrieg was in fact developed in response to the static/positional warfare of WWI. The elements of Blitzkrieg did not start to appear until very late in the war and was used on a massive scale during the final German offensive, Michael. Even during WWII, the early German tactics were not Blitzkrieg. The part about Blitzkrieg being practiced in Poland is simply wrong. It was a battle of annihilation whereby the Polish forces were surrounded and destroy. Blitzkrieg is not the same as these pocket battles. In fact, pocket battles run counter to Blitzkrieg because it requires the army to stay around to annihilate the surrounded enemy, thus losing it momentum. This is sometimes considered one of the reasons why the Germans failed to achieve victory early in the Russian campaign. While some German generals favored heading for Moscow as quickly as possible to disrupt Russian communications, they were often held back by Hitler in order to secure their flanks and destroy surrounded enemies. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 07:13, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While obviously blitzkrieg did not exist before IIWW, it did had some precursors - neither Guderian nor Fuller and Hart he based much of his ideas on invented this concept out of thin air. Blitzkrieg is simply a logical extension of earlier tactics (especially cavalry) made possible by unique tank qualities (high resistance to infantry and other early weapons/tactics). Thus end of pure, Guderian-like blitzkrieg was spelled by the development of efficient, infantry-portable anti-tank equipment (among other things, of course, I am not saying it was the only factor. Counter tactics and extensive use of tanks by other side also had a major impact here). I'd appreciate more info on why Blitzkrieg is a late war tactic though - I was under the impression it was used in the Polish-September Campaign, and became less effective in mid-late war after Operation Barbarossa, not the other way around. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 09:14, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been reading v. Manstein's war memoirs on the Poland and France periods discussed here and he says (p61/62) "Before long the Polish campaign was being described as the blitzkreig - 'the lightning war'. Indeed, as far as its speed of execution and the outcome were concerned, it did constitute something almost unique until the German offensive in the west produced a similar development on an even bigger scale." This suggests to me that he sees the two as very similar in doctrinal terms and that our statement that Poland wasnt blitzkreig may warrant re-examination. Facius 16:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that someone has again added sections saying that Blitzkrieg is similar to "older" styles of warfare. This is not correct. Blitzkrieg is not simply a war of manuver. War of manuver has certainly been on the books for most of history, but the idea of deliberately attacking the rear areas in order to cut logistics and C3I lines could not exist in the past because there was no logisics or C3I.</p>
<p>I've changed the history section to try to make this clear.</p>
<p>Suggest you might find a read of Napoleon's campaigns in Italy that made his name really interesting. From then on this was one of his principles of warfare. Agree with your initial point but to say there were no logistics and C3I is a mite curious. Facius 10:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would suggest that Dr. Robert Citino's work, "The German Way of War" be consulted in reference to this article. Aside from reducing the term "blitzkrieg" (which the Germans themselves never used, and was coined by American magazines), they prefered to use the term "bewegungskrieg", or "war of movement". This perfectly describes the type of tactics employed by the German army during the Second World War.</p>

<dd>During 1936-37 Guderian wrote the book <i>Achtung! Panzer!</i> (Attention! Tank!) detailing the German armored force and his concepts.

<dd>In no source can I find the American Civil War credited as a factor in blitzkrieg. Among military authors blitzkrieg is <i>not</i> understood to mean any kind of sudden war, as you added to the article, but rather the mobile operations that Germany did/tried to conduct during the Second World War. Most broader concepts or histories belong in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maneuver_warfare.html" title="Maneuver warfare">Maneuver warfare</a>. This includes the maneuver theories of the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and United States (including Patton) where they do not directly impact on Germany's execution of blitzkrieg. However, German actions from the time of Frederick the Great and infiltration tactics should eventually be mentioned for the context of German reliance on mobility and small-unit actions.
<dl>
<dd>Well, I know little about ACW and I am not going to defend the entire Prelude.

<dd>On Successors, that information was not accurate. If you can write it, go ahead. Blitzkrieg's influence is very debateable; post-war, the Soviet Union continued with their Deep Operation doctrine, and NATO continued a doctrine of superior firepower and even adopted the Deep Operation (<a href="../../../a/i/r/AirLand_battle_bbcb.html" title="AirLand battle">AirLand battle</a>).

<dd>Well then, can we simply mention that DOd and NATo doctrine were influenced by Blitzkrieg?

<dd>Precursor military doctrine section, mentioning at least some of: <i>he idea of using rapid movement to keep an enemy off-balance is almost as old as war itself. However for the majority of history armies were limited in speed to that of the marching soldier, about equal for everyone involved. This meant that it was possible for opposing armies to simply march around each other as long as they wished, with supply conditions often deciding where and when the battle would finally be fought. Perhaps the most famous example of this ended with the Battle of Agincourt, prior to which Henry V of England avoided combat while marching to Calais to resupply, allowing him to pick the battlefield. Napoleon's introduction of logistics changed the nature of warfare considerably. Now the invading army was not under the same sort of timing pressure to bring the opposition to battle as soon as possible. This allowed his forces to attack where and when they wanted, often giving him the advantage of terrain. It also allowed him to form much larger armies because they were no longer straining the local economies directly. But things didn't really change until the introduction of various forms of mechanized transport, starting with trains. Now the opposing armies were no longer limited in speed, and a war of maneuver became a real possibility. Some train-borne maneuvering took place during the American Civil War in the 1860s, but the sizes of the armies involved meant the system could provide only limited support. In the Franco-Prussian War the Prussian army, knowing that the French could field larger forces, devised a war plan that relied on speed. If, on declaration of war, they could mobilise, invade and seize Paris fast enough, then they would be victorious before the vast French army could form and retaliate. This tactic was used to devastating effect in 1871, when the Prussian forces were able to defeat two large French forces before they were able to join in the field. Given the success they had in 1870s, it's not surprising that the German battle plan for what would become World War I was based on similar concepts. However technology had changed considerably in the four decades, with the machine gun and considerably more powerful artillery swinging the balance of power desicively to the defense. While all combatants were desperate to get the front moving again, this proved difficult. The introduction of the tank in a series of increasingly successful operations pointed the way out of trench warfare, but the war ended before the British plans to field thousands of them could be put into place.</i></dd>
<dd>Successor military doctrines, mentioning some of the following: <i>The possibility of a massive Soviet tank attack on Western Europe using blitzkrieg tactics was the focus of NATO planning in the Cold War. The difficulty was that the standard tactic of trading space for time would have lead to Western Europe being overrun. The solution in the 1950s was a rapid escalation to nuclear war. In the 1960s, the existence of Mutual Assured Destruction made this untenable, and the focus of defense was changed to air land doctrine. The military doctrine of Rapid Dominance or shock and awe is considered by some a modern successor to blitzkrieg. Like blitzkrieg, rapid dominance emphasizes high amounts of communication and rapid strikes using combined arms to create confusion in the enemy. Unlike blitzkrieg, rapid dominance relies heavily on air power, large amounts of central coordination, and focuses on destroying the enemy's command and control structures rather than its supply lines.</i>

<p>I am most intrigued by this mention of Logistics under Napoleon. Can you give sources&#160;? My reading of his huge successes (and I believe his big contribution to the war of manouvre) is that his armies 'lived off the land' so had very small logistics needs. My reading was that he mixed-n-matched his formations to fit the task, had combined arms teams, very flexible manouvre based combat planning and saught to pin and envelop before defeat in detail.

<dd>Indeed, the very term might have two meanings: either the strict, tactical sense of a fast assault by a strong fast (often armoured) unit to the rear of the enemy lines, often with disregard for the flanks, or a strategical, much broader sense which is indeed similar to all kinds of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maneuver_warfare.html" title="Maneuver warfare">maneuver warfare</a>, from cannae tactics through Napoleon Bonaparte to late WWI cavalry and Polish-Bolshevik War tank assault on Koziatyn.

Perhaps, then, the use of blitzkrieg in such manner is not a mistake, but an evolution of the word, which now has 2 correct meanings (1, German tactics in IIWW, 2, fight a quick and surprising war)? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 12:47, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some American commander, notably Patton, had studied the tactics of Guderian and Rommel and adopted them later in WW II (the term they often used was "haul ass and bypass".

<p>I've heard somewhere (probably Discovery) that the main reason the blitzkrieg succeeded is that while the Germans concentrated their tanks, the allieds spread them out among their infantry divisions. Germany had fewer and worse tanks than its opponents both during the invasion of Frane and during the invasion of Russia. T34 was wastly superior to PzIII. Another point not mentioned is the North Afrikan Campaign, that I belive almost drove the British out of Egypt due to the blitzkrieg doctrine. Eventually the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsches_Afrikakorps_b175.html" title="Deutsches Afrikakorps">Deutsches Afrikakorps</a> had to retreat back because their supply lines were overstretched. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestine-info_15f0.html" title="User:Palestine-info">Palestine-info</a> 18:49, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article gives a pretty good summary of the reasons for success. Concentration of tanks was an important one, but the development of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzergruppen.html" title="Panzergruppen">Panzergruppen</a> in which all elements were mobile enough to keep up with the tanks was more important. It was these formations that enabled the swiftness of manouver that sowed confusion and demoralisation in the enemy and allowed the successes of Blitzkrieg.

<dd>Gruppen-level formations were not organized exclusively of panzer forces until later.

<dd><i>While the specific term blitzkrieg refers only to the German operations in the Second World War, blitzkrieg and other doctrines emphasising the use of armoured forces had its post-IIWW successors, just as they had pre-IIWW precursors.

<dd>You need to provide proof for your claims. In this entire argument you have not provided a single reference to support your claims. In contrast, my edits to this article are footnoted and from a 10-item reference section. As I have argued above, the information in that section is inaccurate. Now it is not my job to fix everything, I can sometimes only do the minimum of removing what is false. You, of course, are equally capable of researching and fixing this section. I am tired of your accusations against my edits that are not backed up by any kind of reference whatsoever. As I have said, my additions to this article are documented, while yours are not. That the Soviets adopted blitzkrieg tactics is not argued by any historian I have read, and that is my justification--if you have contrary information, then you need to use a <i>reference</i> and a <i>footnote</i>. Furthermore, the section name of "Successors" is not appropriate, as the Wehrmacht obviously did not use these other doctrines supposedly <i>influenced</i> by blitzkrieg. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 18:53, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Since as far as I can tell 1) this info is correct 2) you don't seem to be reading or replying to most of my comments here 3) you fail to understand the simple text, since nowhere in the text I rescue is it stated that a) soviets used blitzkrieg b) even suggested that Werhmacht used the successor tactics and 4) you are unwilling to achieve *any* compromise and have several times reverted even my minor gramar or copyedit changes, I am afraid I'll have to ask for some kind of arbitration.

<dd><i>German commanders nevertheless were able to work out some potential problems in the chain of command and communications. One issue that became clear was that the terrain often imposed "choke points" where a well-situated strongpoint would stop the movement of the mechanized forces. Normally artillery would be used to deal with fixed emplacements, but artillery moves so slowly that the momentum would be lost. This would result in the development of <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_artillery.html" title="Mobile artillery">mobile artillery</a>, that could accompany the fast tank and mechanized forces, and on closer cooperation between land and air units, so that panzer commanders could request fast bombing mission where artillery was not present.</i>

<dd>Patton is famous for his rapid advance in France, but that wasn't blitzkrieg, that was simple pursuit.

<dd>Patton's movements included fast pursuit, but in many actions he used an armored spearhead to break through, then cut off and disrupt enemy forces prior to their flight. In his comments of the time, quoted in writings about him, he credits reading Guderian and Rommel for his guidance.</dd>

<dd>Saying that operations after 1941 were deterioriating and citing the failure before Moscow etc. is confusing the strategic with the operational. Germany conducted more limited but successful blitzkrieg offensives in 1942, so at the operational level it was still functional. Failure to relieve Stalingrad and Zitadelle are probably the first major and clear defeats of concentrated panzer forces. For this reason, 1941 in the Soviet Union was placed, under <i>Operations</i>, with Poland and France, and not with later operations. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 20:23, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p>Sorry for editing anonymously before, was using a public PC and forgot my PW.</p>
<p>I'm glad you approved of the intro changes 119.</p>
<p>However, perhaps some things should be reworded...while the ultimate desire was to motorise the other army elements (inf, arty, engineers), it remained a minority of german forces that reached this level of mechanisation.</p>
<p>I felt the need to rephrase things that indicated the germans had any substantial technical advantage over the allies in the opening phases, IMO the early german succeses were purely strategical/tactical/doctrinal</p>
<p>I also agree that there is a substancial difference between blitzing and other maneuver warfare (including rapid advances, armor spearheads etc.etc.) IMO blitzing is the use of an armored fist to penetrate the main line and is warefare predominantly by disruption, not only maneuver...which sets it apart from what the russians were doing 43-45</p>

<p><i>While blitzkrieg strategy didn't exist until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, the underlying idea of using rapid movement to keep an enemy off-balance is almost as old as war itself. <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestication_of_the_horse.html" title="Domestication of the horse">Domestication of the horse</a>, development of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> and eventually mechanized transport all led to what would eventually become known as blitzkrieg in the late 1930s.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>How the domestication of the horse, cavalry, and "mechanized transport" (the correct term being motorized transport, as understood when drawing a distinction between motorized and mechanized infantry) <i>all led to</i> a strategy that "the attacker avoids fortifications and strong-points and goes for the enemies' command infrastructures and other strategic locations" (Comatose51's 2004 comment above) requires explanation. This is a completely unsupported assertion which ignores the definition of blitzkrieg and is so sweepingly broad as to be misleading. The French, British, Americans, and Soviets had domesticated horses, cavalry, and motorized infantry, too, yet they did not develop blitzkrieg. The completely unexplained conclusion which the editor draws and the unsupported and unexplained distinctions drawn regarding the importance of domestic horses etc. in blitzkrieg makes those assertions inaccurate to say the least. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 23:45, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is better explained it the main article (thus the main article template with manevrouve warfare link). It is really simple: by introducing units with variable speed (and faster from some other units, i.e. infantry), thus the eventual develppment of a strategy that "the attacker avoids fortifications and strong-points and goes for the enemies' command infrastructures and other strategic locations" became possible. And the fact that Germans developed blitzkrieg before other nations cannot be opposed to the fact that this tactic had its predecessors. Neither Guderian, nor Hart nor others simply woke up one day and said: "Eureka! I invented blitzkrieg from thin air!". This was simply a logical conlusion to earlier tactics and technology development. Other points: I don't mind mechanized for motorised. However, note that as I wrote above, your insistance on a narrow definition of blitzkrieg may be wrong - apparently there is now a second, wider meaning as well. Meanings evolve, face it.</dd>

<p><i>On the other hand, by the late 1930s The Germans had re-organized their Army to include a number of</i> <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzergruppen.html" title="Panzergruppen">Panzergruppen</a><i>, divisions with unprecedented concentration of tanks, infantry in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-track.html" title="Half-track">half-tracks</a> (precursors to modern <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_personal_carrier.html" title="Armored personal carrier">armored personal carriers</a>) and trucks to supply them. It should be noted that half-tracks were fairly rare, and were not employed principally by infantry until after the Polish campaign. German formations reliied on Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, to complement artillery and allow for "breakthrough" attacks even far behind the lines.

<dl>
<dd>Simply contradictory to all references. I paste partially from above: Gruppen-level formations were not organized exclusively of panzer forces until later. The focus on them is, anyway, misleading, because Panzergruppen is not the same thing as any level panzer formation.

<p><i>Armoured forces were first used in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> to break a deadlock of position warfare too lethal to unaided infantry. After many unsuccessful operations, tank forces were employed by the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Powers_9f28.html" title="Allied Powers">Allied Powers</a> at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamel.html" title="Hamel">Hamel</a> in a way that foreshadowed the later use of the blitzkrieg strategy. Some 500 tanks were massed at one point and committed after a coordinated air and artillery bombardment. Light tanks and cavalry achieved a breakthrough to eight miles and caused disruption in the rear areas. Plans were additionally made for a large-scale breakout and exploitation by tank forces, though not implemented because of Germany's surrender.</i></p>
<p><i>However, following the end of the First World War the British, French, and Polish armies did not expand upon the idea of independently operating tank forces. These nations adopted a doctrine of tanks as infantry support weapons. Tank units would be used to punch holes in the enemy lines, through which the mass of infantry could move forward. In this method, tanks would be dispersed among infantry units for primarily <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_support.html" title="Fire support">fire support</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti_tank.html" title="Anti tank">anti-tank</a> duties, an aid to breaking frontlines. Thus, the general concept remained the same as in First World War, and was based upon the assumption that there would be some sort of frontline that the tanks would be used to breach, followed up with a new front developing at some other point. In this doctrine, the infantry retained its position as 'the queen of battle'.</i></p>
<p><b>During the interwar period, theories of mechanized forces were being developed by the British and Soviet militaries. British influence on blitzkrieg is unclear, but not mentioned by historians except when noting that Guderian had translated <a href="../../../j/2E/f/J.F.C._Fuller_893c.html" title="J.F.C. Fuller">Fuller</a> and Hart into <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> in the late 1920s.</b> <i>Fuller argued that if <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized_infantry.html" title="Mechanized infantry">mechanized divisions</a> were let loose in battle, a frontline would never develop: these units would have advanced hundreds of miles before any defense could form. Liddell Hart developed the concepts further, calling it the "indirect approach". In this concept the mechanized forces would attack at a point of least resistance, which they could pick because they would be able to move to any point of their choosing at high speed. The force would then be gathered into a single point (the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_spearhead.html" title="Armored spearhead">armored spearhead</a>), punch through the defenses, and then run into the rear areas. This disruption in the rear areas would greatly reduce the information available to an enemy commander and make them unable to intelligently or speedily act. These mobile forces would be advantaged by effectively blindfolding and paralysing enemy forces. In order to support this sort of warfare, Liddell Hart advocated the creation of units with plenty of trucks, armored cars, and light, high-speed tanks known as "cruisers".</i></p>
<p><b>French influence is not acknowledged, nor is American.</b> <i>Interwar British and French armored development is generally criticized as inadequate or stagnant. Only after seeing German successes with Blitzkrieg, British finally put Fuller and Hart theories to pratical use. During the Second World War, number of lightly-armored and armed cruiser tanks were eventually used by the British Army, notably in the German invasion of France. Examples include the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine_tank.html" title="Valentine tank">Valentine</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusader_tank.html" title="Crusader tank">Crusader</a>, and the final <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cromwell_tank.html" title="Cromwell tank">Cromwell</a>. Germany and the Soviet Union collaborated on a limited scale, in secret and on largely technical matters, at testing grounds in <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan.html" title="Kazan">Kazan</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipetsk.html" title="Lipetsk">Lipetsk</a> beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_5_back"><a href="#fn_5" title="">5</a></sup></span></i></p>

<dd>This is largely irrelevant to the creation of blitzkrieg. As I have argued above:
<dl>
<dd>Among military authors blitzkrieg is <i>not</i> understood to mean any kind of sudden war, as you [Piotrus] added to the article, but rather the mobile operations that Germany did/tried to conduct during the Second World War. Most broader concepts or histories belong in Maneuver warfare. This includes the maneuver theories of the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and United States (including Patton) where they do not directly impact on Germany's execution of blitzkrieg.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Three paragraphs on the development of <i>other</i> militaries <i>which it is acknowledged in the text had no or minimal influence on blitzkrieg</i> logically requires explanation.

<dd>There is an explanation. It was a technological development expanding upon existing maneuver warfare doctrine. My library is a mess so I cannot quickly provide references, but this possibility was seen and commented upon, pre-war, by at least Rommel, Guderian, and Patton. The British did not adopt this offensive tactic at any point during WW II. There is some verbiage in the article that implies the British adopted it. They didn't, in spite of excellent strategic theory provided by Liddell-Hart (still one of the best books I have ever read). <a href="../../../p/m/e/User%7EPmeisel_b223.html" title="User:Pmeisel">Pmeisel</a> 15:03, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not bowing to common usage to point out what will be obvious to most readers--that the term has a broader meanining in the popular vocabulary. It is only a brief mention, and the edit replaced what read like a discussion comment posted in the text. Here is the previous text:
<dl>
<dd>"The term <i>blitzkrieg</i> was coined by Western <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalists</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_September_Campaign_01ad.html" title="Polish September Campaign">German invasion of Poland</a>. Although it is now commonly used in reference to any quick and desicive military action, this is not correct; blitzkrieg is a distinct form of warfare used only by Germany during the Second World War."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If folks want to add a line like "Military historians limit the term to the German military operations of WWII." that would be NPOV. The original text was not NPOV.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 12:20, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I hope my recent change is sufficiently NPOV and satisfies all sides here. Since majority of dictionaries use the broader term, we have to mention it - but one of 3 paragraphs in lead is enough for this. The rest of the article should dicuss German blitzkrieg, although I think when we have good references we could add a section on how the broader meaning evolved (who used it for the first time in that manner? etc.). --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a> 12:46, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IF this has to be NPOVed, the generalised reference is sufficient in that single line. To properly do justice to the word, the "true" definition should be elaborated on not at the expense of some generalised diatribe on maneuver warfare,force concentration, etc that the common use term describes. This isn't Scrabble after all. This is like the semetic debate, the term refers to a specific group of languages while the commmon usage has it frequently specifically relating to Jews...same deal here, you have a precise word that has been generalised. The "true" technical def should be emphasised. panzerjager88</p>

<p>not sure how that section should be reworked.</p>
<p>the british had the cruiser tank concept nailed down a while before bliz ever came around. Remember that they had a good bit of experience with fast tanks exploting through maneuver from WW1 in the form of the Whippet.</p>
<p>Also they used their tanks and thus maneuver to very good effect in north africa against the Italians. Again this was not blitzkrieg, and its presumptuous that this was a only due to a direct influence of german successes.</p>
<p>Remember too that it was the french who had the first mech inf, in the form of the dragons portés and the germans sought to imitate this in a limited fashion.</p>

<p>Okay, I've come in late here. Let me see if I can figure out what the dispute is about.</p>
<p>It states in our article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The term blitzkrieg was first coined by Western journalists during the 1939 German invasion of Poland in reference to the distinct form of warfare used by the Germans in their initial campaigns."</dd>
</dl>
<p>That means, despite the fact that the term is in the German language, it's not a German term; it started as mere journalism. Since then, different historians from different cultures have defined what it means, retroactively.</p>
<p>So, we are arguing about the precise definition of something that wasn't defined by the only people that actually did it, generations after the fact. Isn't this like arguing over how many angels can dance on a pin? There's not enough hard substance to be the basis any conclusive argument. There's no single agreed authority.</p>
<p>I don't see how any claim that blitzkrieg has to be this, or can't be that, or such-and-such led to blitzkrieg, or that such-and-such is derived from blitzkrieg, is anything but POV. In Wikipedia, all we can do is list all these claims in the article. We can't assert any of them to the exclusion of the others.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Some mention NEEDS to be made that on a tactical/operational level the objective of blitz was to affect a rapid penetration of the enemy tactical defenses and move into the enemy strategic/operational depths in order to acheive "operational freedom" to begin the "dismemberment" and collapse of the enemy army via attacks on logistics, communications and complete the material destruction of the enemy troops via encirclement</p>
<p>i also question the idea that a small professional army was a single characteristic of a blitzkrieg minded army</p>
<p>why would you prefer small to large if the same level of professionalism could be acheived...the reality was that the germans could afford to be very elitist and selective at the beginning and far less so at the end...this was relatively independant of the designs or tenets of blitzkrieg</p>
<p>i thus think it is more precise to specify that blitz required an extremly cohesive and technically advanced army, which implied a relatively small size and high level of training...which in turn implied a core of proffessional troops rather than conscripts</p>
<p>panzerjager88</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the size of the army, a professional force of 200,000 men was advocated by von Seeckt to be most of the motorised component of the wartime army. The German General Staff considered Germany to be unable to wage a protracted campaign, and it was intended that this professional and mobile army would be able to win campaigns without mobilisation or using huge resources. This is of course the theoretical or ideal, and noted as such in the article. I'm not sure what description you would prefer? <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 00:54, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
i'm not arguing that a small army was NOT advocated by germany (when it was, due to both fallitic strategic thinking and pragmatic realities) at the start, but that in a section dedicated to a generalist OVERALL theoretical examination of blitz through its "lifetime", its rather silly to innacuralely portray the size and scope of forces based on first estimates. Kursk was in many ways was the final blitz (or attemp at one at least), yet was massive in scale.</p>
<p>I would prefer a description that emphasised coordination, training, cohesiveness and mobility. As well as one that emphasised the tactical/operational goals more explicitly</p>
<p>panzerjager88</p>
<p>This article is, I think overall, very good. Perhaps a bit too long? However it seems to me that the "Etymology and modern meaning" section should be a discussion about just that, discussion of the word "Blitzkrieg" itself.. Starting at "Strategically, the ideal".... until "operated as a combined-arms team" Is well done but it belongs elsewhere. <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKAM_fc6e.html" title="User:KAM">KAM</a> 18:14, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think your point is Blitzkrieg is not a new tactic, doctrine etc, but an after the fact description of the successful result. An analogy would be “the Nelson touch” It is as if a french military historian was to analyze the successful battles of Nelson, breaking down the reasons for his success into elements, then naming the use of these elements “The Nelson Touch”. Part of the explanation of what the French now called “The Nelson Touch” should include the fact that it was not exactly a tactic but elements etc etc. Now, I think that this explanation should go in the Etymology and modern meaning section, It already partly there....“longstanding german principle of Bewegungskrieg”....

<dl>
<dd>No, my points are these:
<ol>
<li>There is a conceptual distinction to be made between <i>Bewegungskrieg</i> and <i>Blitzkrieg</i>, the main difference being that the latter takes the collapse of the enemy for granted and adjusts its operational and logistical planning accordingly.</li>
<li><i>Blitzkrieg</i> <b>was</b> a new tactic, in fact so new it was <i>not</i> the official German doctrine in 1940.</li>
<li>So new in fact that even Guderian didn't propose it before the war; his prewar writings are not about <i>Blitzkrieg</i>.</li>
<li><i>Fall Gelb</i> was not a planned <i>Blitzkrieg</i> campaign.</li>
<li>The official German doctrine was not essentially different from the French, British and Soviet. The Germans mainly differed from the French and Soviets in investing more in trucks and less in tanks.</li>
<li>Fuller and Liddell Hart at some point in their careers advocated <i>Blitzkrieg</i> but their influence before the war was practically nil. All armies rejected their theories, including the German. Although Guderian found their theories very exciting, he too explicitly rejected them.</li>
<li>All these professionals were right: <i>Blitzkrieg</i> should be rejected as a general doctrine: it can only work under very special conditions. Guderian recognised these were present on 14 May 1940 and simply took the opportunity.</li>
<li>Today's common misconceptions about <i>Blitzkrieg</i> should attributed to Liddell Hart: this conceited man deliberately distorted historical truth to improve his reputation, thus creating the <i>Myth of Blitzkrieg</i>.</li>
<li>Read Frieser.</li>

<p>''<i>Following the war, these concepts were modified by the Reichswehr. Its Chief of Staff, Hans von Seeckt, moved doctrine away from what he argued was an excessive focus on encirclement. Rather, von Seeckt advocated effecting breakthroughs against the enemy's centre when it was more profitable then encirclement or where encirclement was not practical. He additionally rejected the notion of mass which von Schlieffen and von Molkte had advocated.</i></p>
<p>The article gives too much credit to von Seeckt's role in the development of Blitzkrieg. While von Seeckt perserved the army and architect its eventual rise with the creation of an "army of 100,000 officers", his role in Blitzkrieg is quite limited. He was not the intellectual forefather of the Blitzkrieg but rather the material forefather. As argued in <i>the German Army 1933-1945</i> by Matthew Cooper, page 119, <i>"von Seeckt remained a conservative by inclination, and was determined to shape the Reichsheer according to the best traditions of the Imperial Army."</i>, namely manuver warfare and the ideas of von Molkte and Schlieffen. However, Blitzkrieg stems from the tactics developed in the later stages of WWI, pioneered by the stormtroopers and their infiltration tactics. These were not the ideas of von Molkte. While von Seeckt might have modified and further qualified the ideas of manuver warfare, he did not break from them. Blitzkrieg was a break from those ideas. Instead of being obsessed with surrounding the enemy, Blitzkrieg aimed for their logistics and command.</p>
<p>Therefore, shouldn't we qualify the section in question. It would be Guderian who would make the actual break and go off in a new direction. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 03:31, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are several notions here that are, I feel, perhaps either confused or factually incorrect:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Von Seeckt basically still supported manoeuvre warfare. True, but then so did everyone else, the French and Guderian included.
<ol>
<li>Right so why are we giving credit to Von Seeckt? He did what everyone else did. Guderian might have still supported manuver warfare but he also help developed what would later become Blitzkrieg. My disagreement isn't over who supported what but what did Von Seeckt do that would give rise to the ideas of Blitzkrieg later on?
<ol>
<li>See my point two: he emphasized flexibility and a higher operational tempo. Such a doctrine is more conducive to the formation and employment of armoured units capable of independent offensive action.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Manoeuvre warfare is a coherent concept. True, but there are also different possible versions of it. The French version was the <i>Bataille Méthodique</i>, not, as caricature has it, some WWI frontal attack but the doctrine that after the breakthrough phase the attacking units must act in closely supervised strict cooperation to ensure the most favourable force ratio and thus loss ratio. This implies the operational tempo is rather low. The French were forced to adopt this doctrine by their desperate manpower shortage. It might be thought that the same motive must apply for the diminutive professional German army, but it was so tiny even methodical battle wouldn't help enough. As Von Seeckt, given the small size of his army, couldn't hope to achieve an overwhelming numerical superiority anyway and certainly couldn't afford to wear it down executing a number of consequent <i>Kesselschlachten</i> , he emphazised freedom of movement and operational flexibility. Of course the difference from the French doctrine was only gradual and the idea had nothing new to it.</li>
<li><i>Blitzkrieg</i> stems from infiltration tactics. Is this true? No. Yes, <i>Blitzkrieg</i> in a way simply <i>is</i> infiltration tactics on the largest possible scale. But it still doesn't stem from them because there is no causal connection, only a formal identity. It wasn't as if sombody studied infiltration tactics and then had the sudden revelation that it could be used on the strategic level also. Nor was there some gradual development from small scale tactics to a doctrine with a larger scope. This wasn't necessary. <i>Blitzkrieg</i> is a technologically enhanced application of age-old principles any fool can understand (hence its present appeal&#160;;o). No special genius is required. However most professional tacticians of the day were a bit more than mere fools. They understood something more: that taking for granted that movement will ensure the collapse of the enemy is perfectly allright on the tactical level, a sound practice on the operational level — but irresponsible foolhardiness on the strategic level. German officers were the most professional of all: neither the official German doctrine nor any German operational plan embodied <i>Blitzkrieg</i> in <i>that</i> sense — as opposed to mechanised manoeuvre warfare in general — until the summer of 1940.
<ol>
<li>A lot of ideas are very obvious once it is discovered. I'm not so convinced that it was so obvious back then when WWII first broke out or before that. I seems like infiltration tactics during WWI was a pioneer in the sense that warfare before that point didn't try to avoid the strong points. Instead, they tried to emphasize a decisive moment. At the very least Blitzkrieg share the same spirit. I don't doubt your assertion that there is no casual link between the two but I think it's worth mentioning because infiltration tactics were new when it was first employed.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 22:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I fuly agree with you on that point.--MWAK 09:05, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Guderian made the actual break. Very, very true. But he made it on 16 May 1940, not earlier. Before the war, despite being a firm believer in mechanised manoeuvre warfare like most tacticians of all nations, Guderian was not a proponent of any "Blitzkrieg". To the contrary, he explicitely rejected the adoption of any such strategic adventuring <i>as a general doctrine</i>. In May 1940 he simply judged that no risk was involved. --MWAK 07:33, 21 August 2005 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>I find that notion rather difficult to believe. It's not as though he woke up one day and said, I'll support Blitzkrieg and gave it a title, right? He laid down a good deal of ground work first before doing that. Blitzkrieg didn't suddenly just emerge out of nowhere but slowly and gradually went off on its own. Whether he supported it whole hearted from the start is not that important. In any case, my point is giving Von Seeckt so much credit is misleading.<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 22:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>But now you seem to consider <i>Blitzkrieg</i> as the inevitable endproduct of some necessary development of tactical evolution. Certainly Guderian laid down the groundwork for the practical implementation of mechanised manoeuvre warfare. Yes, doing so he made it more likely that true <i>Blitzkrieg</i> would emerge. But it wasn't inevitable. Then on 16 May, like many German field commanders, he made the conscious decision to disobey orders. Of course this shows the tactic had a momentum of its own. And obviously he didn't directly endorse any doctrine at that point. Still it was also a moment of revelation to all involved. And Von Seeckt indeed played a very minor role&#160;:o).--MWAK 09:05, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Very interesting discussion. Charles de Gaulle, Hart, Fuller and others all envisioned coming changes in warfare caused by of rapid changes in technology, communications etc. (changes that would later seem obvious) However the German military was more efficiently able to overcome bureaucratic resistance and apply new methods to the battlefield. Von Seeckt’s (crucial) contribution, was the 57 committees, the open war games, free discussion, flattened command structure, creating an environment where new ideas could be tested with minimum politics. Von Seeckt’s own ideas are almost beside the point. <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKAM_fc6e.html" title="User:KAM">KAM</a> 17:24, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Completely agree. His setting up of a learning environment and a systematic review of weapons, tactics and strategy was his contribution. In that environment the later famous figures were able to test and discover as well as train and codify. The ideas were 'everywhere' but the first large scale successful systematic use was in the Army created under the leadership of Von Seeckt. I am confident that almost all of the ideas were not his.

<p>a friend of mine verbally explained to me a soviet strategy in reducing the effectiveness in battling the blitzkrieg. I believe that this strategy is mentioned in the article as "Deep Battle", but is not explained. As my friend explained, the Soviets had many lines of forces setup along the front. as the Germans broke through their lines, that line would fall back. the germans would move up again and would break through this next line, which would fall back as well. eventually the germans faced a huge number of forces and would be overwhelmed. Hopefully my friend was right and this anti-blitzkrieg tactic can be explained in the article (so i can understand it in better detail). thanks kids, <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilter_805f.html" title="User:Kilter">Kilter</a> 05:46, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not Deep Battle, but Defence in Depth. It's what they more or less tried to do in 1942 with some success, what they did afterwards to stem the more local German offensive for the duration of the war and what they <i>should</i> have done in 1941. What they did in 1941, <i>that's</i> Deep Battle: you lure the enemy into the depths of your territory and then you block and surround him with large mobile forces to wipe him out. Not a bad tactic but too difficult for the Red Army to execute so it led to a quick and catastrophic defeat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About Defence in Depth; there really isn't much to understand. Your friend explained it quite well&#160;:o). One minor point however. In practice the first lines are simply sacrificed (of course you don't tell them this beforehand); the trick is to exhaust the enemy's supplies while lengthening his supply lines. Success guaranteed.</dd>

<p><i>Blitzkrieg was an operational-level military doctrine which employed mobile forces attacking with speed and surprise to prevent an enemy from organising a coherent defence. Conceived in the years after World War I, it grew out of the earlier doctrine of "Fire and Infiltration". It was used by the German Wehrmacht in World War II. Operations early in the war—the invasions of Poland, France, and the Soviet Union—were highly effective, owing to surprise, enemy unpreparedness and superior German military doctrines. Methods of blitzkrieg operations centered on using manoeuvre rather than attrition to defeat an opponent. The blitzkrieg thus first and foremost required a concentration of armoured assets at a focal point, closely supported by mobile infantry, artillery and close air support assets. These tactics required the development of specialised support vehicles, new methods of communication, new tactics, and the presence of a decentralised command structure. Broadly speaking, blitzkrieg operations required the development of mechanised infantry, self-propelled artillery and engineering assets that could maintain the rate of advance of the tanks. In combat, blitzkrieg forced slower defending forces into defensive pockets that were encircled and then destroyed by following German infantry.</i></p>

<dd>I've gone through and changed some of the stuff that caught my eye as objectionable - especially continued use of the word "panzer" which is really meaningless in the contexts presented here. I've substituted "armour" where appropriate, and "motorized forces" where I thought it was implied. The two are obviously not the same thing - the article sadly drew no distinction. I also rooted out "Luftwaffe" as it seemed over used. The article reads a bit less like a love letter to 1960s pulp war magazines now but would still benefit from solid sources and citations. I've also lessened use of the word "blitzkrieg" since the article itself is trying to define the word. I've substituted "deep penetration operations", "encirclement battle", "combined arms tactics" etc. where I thought it was implied by 'blitzkrieg' but the words seems to be thrown around a lot in the article without any real definition of what is meant - what I thought the whole point of the article was in any event.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 20:28, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the introduction of the article, it is stated that "One of the defining characteristics of what is commonly known as "Blitzkrieg" is close co-operation between infantry and tanks." However, Erwin Rommel used Blitzkrieg solely with tanks alone while commanding the 7th Panzer, and did not wait for his infantry to catch up. So, does Blitzkrieg require infantry? --218.186.8.12 04:27, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. Every major German (and US, and British, and Soviet) armored formation included a balanced team of Infantry, tanks, artillery, engineers, etc. That is how the age-old concept of combined arms got put into practice in the mechanized age. Tanks (or any other branch) on their own would not last long. The highest level unit at which only one arm is represented is typically the battalion. Even if it goes by a different name in some armies. Formations commanded by Rommel were not exceptions... <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 23:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
