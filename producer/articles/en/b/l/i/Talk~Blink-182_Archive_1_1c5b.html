<p>i think it started with Markus Allen Hoppus and Thomas Mathhew Delonge. They found a drummer who is Scott Raynor, then they get rid of him and got Travis Landon Barkar. Hes an awsome drummer.</p>

<p>Not only that, but in the article the author said that the release of their untitled record brought them back into the hardcore scene, even though they never have and probably never will be a hardcore band. I highly doubt the author of this article even knows what hardcore sounds like, and it needs to be revised. In fact, I'm gonna do that right now.</p>
<p>By the way, the author of this article sounds like they're in 7th grade.</p>
<p>blink-182 hardcore? thats a larf, compare this pop punk to a band like <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Jones_%28band%29_8aab.html" title="Casey Jones (band)">Casey Jones</a> to understand. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenged_Evanfold_75be.html" title="User:Avenged Evanfold">Avenged Evanfold</a> 03:50, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blink 182 are not a Pop Punk Band. Look at it Busted and Son of Dork are pop punk they have the clean guitar, pop drum beats, lyrics about childish attractions for the opposite sex, whilst Blink swear, have fast punk drumming and overdriven guitar, deading and palm muting. Think about it they are Punk Rock like Greenday (who are also not Pop Punk) and Offspring. Paladin91 18:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>when they won the award for best new act or whatever i quote 'thanks guys and just keep on supporting punk rock, thankyou. SO YOU ARE WRONG THEY CALL THEMSELVES PUNK ROCK. - b1link82</p>

<p>i don't think anyone is teeny boopers because they just like what they want to like okay..</p>
<p>The band members aren't necessarily right about their genre just beacause they are the band members. In fact, I think they are less likely to recognise their genre, as bands don't usually listen to themselves an awful lot.</p>

<dd>blink-182 is pop punk as hell. Someone earlier also stated that if he or she calls himself king of the world, it doesn't mean he <i>is</i> king of the world. Even though the blink-182 members might have thought they were punk rock, I see no reason as to why to believe that. Some of their songs definitely has punk rock influence, but this is not enough to label them punk rock. They're pop punk, end of story. --<a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdriaan_1_fe26.html" title="User:Adriaan 1">Scotteh</a> 11:01, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>They are clearly Punk Rock. Although they could have been classified as pop punk during the Take Off Your Pants and Jacket era when describing the band they should be described in reference to their latest album. Their untitlied album was clearly a move away from pop punk using distorted guitar and far darker lyrics and musical sound. Songs like Easy Target, Violence and Stokholm Sydnrome back this up. Untitled is definitely not pop punk. Pop punk involves clean guitar, simple melodies and zero distortian. 09:11, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blink-182 obviously wants to call themselves punk, and they have a right to. Are any of you in succesful bands that make albums as good as "Dude Ranch" or the other albums? No you are not. That's what I thought. Punk is a genre that has changed since it first came around. Blink-182, especially new blink-182, is obviously not like the Ramones, nor are they as new-punk as, say, NOFX. Also, Punk should transcend politics. The topics blink-182 choose to sing about are fine by me as long as they continue to be good. Please, do not compare blink-182 to Avril Lavigne.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Angels and Airwaves</span></h2>
<p>Recently, information has surfaced regarding Delonge's solo album. According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, he registered the name "Angels and Airwaves" on June 24th 2005 and also claimed that "It is so much more powerful, emotional and melodic than Box Car and Blink put together". Many are skeptical regarding the authenticiy of the statement and the project itself and it is confirmed that the supposed Angels and Airwaves website is not official, that's the reason why it is using a UK domain name. Anyway it is assumed that the band's MySpace page has been registered by Geffen. This statement, along with much of the information disclosed about reasons for the break, presents a greater sense of ambiguity.</p>
<p>The domain is registered to David Rossiter, who stated on the supposed <a href="http://www.angelsandairwaves.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.angelsandairwaves.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Angels and Airwaves website</a> this: <i>"Hey guys, I've seen loads of comments on other forums or postings in news articles questioning whether this site is official. No, is the answer, it is not an official website, but it is officially the first fan site for the band! Please join this board and start building up an awesome community. A website will follow shortly, stay tuned!"</i></p>
<p>The whois lookup for the domains "angelsandairwaves.com" and "angelsandairwaves.net" leave Geffen Records as the owner of both of them, since May 11, 2005... so this may have been planned since a long time.</p>
<p>I hope this helps to clarify things a little. Someone please add some of this information to the article. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreedyredbag_765b.html" title="User:Greedyredbag">Greedy</a> 22:32, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feel Sorry For The Youth of Today</span></h2>
<p>This band is far from punk rock, I don't care what google says; only one of you really understood what punk and/or hardcore is. I'm older than most of you probably, take it from someone more experienced. I really feel sorry for the music that young people have to grow up with today; it's boring, there's no edge, no angst, and, I find this most disturbing, safe. People can have many debates as to what a genuine punk sound is, in many ways there isn't one; however, there is one thing everyone in the know agrees about, that's the attiude. And it has nothing to do with how you dress or look, and to many extents, even sound, but moreso what you say and how you act. Prissy, "safe", PC, SoCal boys with nothing to say, or, more importantly, nothing to be pissed off about, or not in the business of pissing other people off are NOT the punk attiude. Gordon Gecko is more punk rock than these guys, and I mean that literally, don't let the wing tips and expensive suits fool you. If you're looking for REAL SoCal punk, pick up an old Circle Jerks album, Black Flagg, Operation Ivy, you want to go real old school, The Germs. I mean it when I say I feel really sorry for young people today. Usually it's the kids looking down at the parents for being "square" or not "hip" or not "getting it"; now the parents will be looking down on their kids for being that. Excercise and open up your brain, I still have faith in some of you; take it from someone who remembers when MTV first aired and watched it "evolve" if you can even call it that, it's a sham.</p>

<p>Granted, I may have got side tracked, but that was my intention; I agree, I think it got lost in my own editorilizing, there just seemed to be a lengthy and very misinformed discussion "categorizing" this band. If you want to categorize this band, it should be pop, or pop-punk at best; taking definitions of what music is from Google I just find absurd. Now-a-days people take the Internet (Google, whatever)as the Gospel of All Knowing Truth and Fact.

<p>~I go to Poway High and I was told that in one of blink's songs (don't remember which one) they allude to a woman named Sally who still works security for Poway High school. She may have been responsible for catching Tom drunk during the basketball game and it is possible that this is who they are referring to in Easy Target. Perhaps you misheard "Sally" as "Holly" or maybe Tom simply mixed up the name when writing his song.</p>
<p>~ no the sally they refer to in the song "I Miss You" refers to Sally from the movie <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>. Mark sings "The shadow in the background of the morgue the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if we want where you can always find me we'll have Halloween on Christmas". Jack has a relationship with Sally in the Movie and the plot of the movie revolves around Holloween being replaced by Christmas. The name is Holly, in both songs.</p>
<p>~ sally could refer to the blink song 'My pet sally'. in the song he refers to sally as 'salamander' which he may have mistakenly called her while drunk. look up the lyrics and interpret them for yourself</p>

<p>I belive that blink 182 are basicly what people say it is "pop/punk".Many people say that there early stuff was more punk and there later stuff were more pop but I disagree. If you listen to flyswatter and buddah... sure songs like alone, point of view, dicklips or fentloozer could be slightly classified as punk (but not proper punk) but basicly cheshire cat, buddah are all about getting girls or leaving relationships. Enema of the state is mostly pop exept for anthem. TOYPAJ (<i>Take Off Your Pants and Jacket</i>) is possibly there most punk album whit songs such as Anthem Part Two, Reackless Abandon, Give Me One Good Reason and Shut Up. The self titeles or untiled whatever you want to call it album is there most differnt music they have made with much more serios songs such as Violence, Stolkholme Syndrome,Go ,Astenia and Easy target, which cannot be clasified as punk or pop. Also adding to this you can notice alot of elements of Angels and Airwaves in Asthenia, Always and Im Lost With Out you. --<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordans_4595.html" title="User:Jordans">Jordans</a> 03:40, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"blink-182 was" vs. "blink-182 is"</span></h2>
<p>Why does someone keep editing this page to change "blink-182 was" to "blink-182 is"? The band is still on hiatus. I sometimes follow the news of blink-182 and there has been no evidence that the band is still together during the hiatus. Singer Tom DeLonge said that he hasn't heard from the rest of the members (Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker) since the day the band went on hiatus. So, that's why we should leave it as "blink-182 was". If anyone changes it back to "blink-182 is", that means the band is no longer on hiatus, but they still are. 65.222.216.15 16:05, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Per Merriam-Webster, <b>hiatus</b> is defined as "an interruption in time or continuity" while the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as an "interruption (or) break in sequence". In each case, the definitions <b>require</b> the continuation of the "pattern" when the hiatus concludes. In my estimation, this means a band on (even an indefinite) hiatus exists until at least one member says it's over; therefore, it still <b>is</b> (and, may I present <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell_Freezes_Over_b741.html" title="Hell Freezes Over">The Eagles</a> ["(The band will perform together) when hell freezes over." <i>—Don Henley, 1982</i>, v.

It should also be noted that "was a ... band" (paragraph 1) and "the current and official rendering of the band's name" (paragraph 3) cannot coexist. <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="color: #161;">Kirk</span></a></tt> <tt><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 9px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a></tt> 17:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Tom DeLonge was #15 on Cosmogirl's top fifty hottest rockers.</li>
<li>Barker started playing the drums when he was four.</li>
<li>An early band containing Mark Hoppus was called The Attic Children.</li>
<li>Before blink-182, Tom was in a band called Big Oily Men, Mark was in a band called the Pier 69, then Of All Things, until he moved to San Diego to start The Attic Children (which later turned into blink, and grew on to become a part of the name of the clothing company, Atticus, which Mark and Tom co-founded), and before the Aquabats and the Vandals, Travis was in an amateur band called Feeble.</li>
<li>When approached on the street by fans seeking insight, Mark Hoppus reportedly has replied with: "I'm the guy with the flat voice in Blink 182. Why are you paying any attention me? I have nothing to offer anyone."</li>
<li>On the inside of the spine on the album Enema of the State you will find the words "Viking wizard eyes, Wizard full of lies"</li>
<li>The song "Dick Lips" was not originally called "Dick Lips". Hoppus was very fond of those two words, and called everybody in the studio that. When the producer came to the studio to ask what the name of the song was. Hoppus and DeLonge both blurted out "Dick Lips". They were going to change the name to better suit the song, but the name stuck with it.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album_cover.html" title="Album cover">cover</a> of <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits_%28blink-182_album%29_4e0e.html" title="Greatest Hits (blink-182 album)">Greatest Hits</a></i> looks similar to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Offspring_3db3.html" title="The Offspring">The Offspring</a>'s <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits_%28The_Offspring_album%29_8cdf.html" title="Greatest Hits (The Offspring album)">Greatest Hits</a>'</i> cover, an apparent <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homage.html" title="Homage">homage</a> to "real punk rock" according to Travis.</li>

<p>Exactly. You never know if one day they settle their differences and getback together.

<dd>This is all just semantics. Indefinite hiatus is essentially just another way of saying "broken up". And on that point, since when is breaking up an immutable binding contract? Countless bands break up and reform all the time.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mark's Interviews</span></h2>
<p>We should really add Mark's interviews in the article because:</p>
<p>1. It's about blink-182 and it's an important part of the article</p>
<p>2. According to Mark blink-182 is now a defunct group</p>
<p>3. The interview had revealed Mark's feelings towards Tom.</p>
<p>So, I think the interviews are required.--<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECory_pratt_e3b1.html" title="User:Cory pratt">Cory pratt</a> 19:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with 24.129.92.210—if there's more than one "correct" way to pronounce the name, its inclusion becomes entirely moot.

<dd>It can be said like that, but the proper way is "eighty". Just like Kerrang! spelling it Blink 182 - just because it does, it doesn't make it right. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamdav86_f6fc.html" title="User:Jamdav86">Jamdav86</a> 21:37, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's why I put the word <b>correct</b> in quotation marks; while "one eighty two" (or, even more properly, "one hundred eighty two") is technically the correct way to enunciate the numerical entity, we're talking about the name of a band. If its members use more than one pronunciation, there is no one "correct" way. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 21:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm still failing to see why having more than one way to pronounce something means that including those pronunciations is moot. There are stil a great many of "incorrect" pronunciations, and this shows which ones are "correct". --OuroborosCobra 04:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It becomes inconsequential. If there's one, and only one, way to pronounce something, according to its originator(s), then it's significant; once more than one is established, particularly if it's numerical (where there're often several alternatives), then it's <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a> at best. <tt style="color:#161;">RadioKirk <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk">u</a>|<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk">c</a>)</small></tt> 04:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issue is that "one eighty two" is the only "correct" way of saying it. "one eight two" and "one hundred and eighty two" are wrong, and that is a well-known fact. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamdav86_f6fc.html" title="User:Jamdav86">Jamdav86</a> 18:00, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Punk?</span></h3>
<p>Is it really honest to call this band punk when you look at their music, politics and commercial drive? Politics eh? <i>Its music man, don't read to deep into it.</i> its punk rock - they say so themselves!!!!</p>
<p>It's sugarcoated mainstream music that tries to portay themselves as punk. Doesn't Ashlee Simpson try to say she's "punk' sometimes too? Hell I could call myself King of the World, would you bow to me then?</p>
<p>Comming from a kid who may or may not be punk rock. You might have a huge mohawk or piercings or such... and you think because of that, you are the punk rock authority. Punk rock was never about how many piercings or tats you can get to make your parents angry, its about the music. blink 182 has their style and its open to those who want to listen to it, if you don't like it, don't whine, whip out a preverbial ramones cd, and relish in the fact that you think your so punk rock. These guys have stuck to their style for 20 years, through fads, trends, and mtv, and are still the cool easy going guys they've ever been, albeit richer. Then again though,your the only person who knows punk rock music, and if it went on the radio, man oh man, you are instantly too cool for them.</p>
<p>I honestly think they're more pop-punk, for one thing the vocals have a more nasal sound then most punk bands and the article itself says "The band is known for its catchy, simple melodies and lyrical toilet humor. Songwriters Hoppus and DeLonge cite <b>pop punk</b> bands such as The Descendents and Screeching Weasel[1] as their early influences, however, the band's songwriting and production are driven by a <b>pop</b> sensibility." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohhny-turbo_f4a9.html" title="User:Johhny-turbo">Johhny-turbo</a> 01:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding this phrase from the article:</p>
<p>"...Travis stated that the "182" was the U.S. radio codeword meaning 'homicide' (apparently confusing "182", the radio codeword for conspiracy, for "187")."</p>
<p>Could someone please clarify what is meant by a radio codeword for conspiracy? Is the word 'radio' referring to U.S. commercial broadcasters? Perhaps it refers to U.S. law enforcement, but 'conspiracy' seems an odd (and rather nebulous) crime to require a code number. Thanks to anyone who might be able to clear this up.</p>
