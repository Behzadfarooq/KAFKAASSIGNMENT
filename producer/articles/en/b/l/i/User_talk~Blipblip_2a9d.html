<p>You might want to try reading the article before making such claims. I changed the opening paragraph to read.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>London After Midnight (otherwise known as, LAM) is a rock music band <b>formed in 1990[1] by frontman and instrumentalist Sean Brennan</b>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup class="noprint Template-Fact">citation needed<i>]</i></sup></span></a></sup> For the majority of the band's history it featured keyboardist player Tamlyn.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally I have only read sources (after researching) which have stated the band have featured Tamlyn &amp; Brennan from 1990. (the year they formed) and then Areklett on bass from 92. You claimed otherwise yet cannot back up what you say, thus the need for the "citation needed" tag.</p>
<p>"Destroyed the bio" haha, you must be joking there? I am <i>the only one</i> who has provided something in the way of a biography... specific festivals the band have played, with whom, their beginings &amp; progression from Los Angeles club level, etc. Even correcting the formating (as I have experience working on band articles here, and know the formating) What have you provided that is biographical?.. a variation which is largely ripped from the band's site.<a href="http://www.londonaftermidnight.com/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.londonaftermidnight.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> With some random praise from certain media sections thrown in.</p>
<p>I don't know, nor care what your problem with Covet &amp; Areklett is. But the information I put is sourced from their official page, you refuted the information and claimed that London After Midnight have stated otherwise in regards to the Covet material. So I put;</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Covet band claim to feature songs which were original planned to be used in London After Midnight (something Brennan denies<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup class="noprint Template-Fact">citation needed<i>]</i></sup></span></a></sup>),</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have actually bent to include your POV, yet you refuse to work with anybody else on a variation, reverting hard work, which is very irritating. The only thing you seem to want to see is an "London After Midnight are TEH_BESTEST_BAND_EVA" article. Please read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy because that is not acceptable by it. It has to be neutral and factual.

<p>Live music is entirely different to what is put out on a record; if you were fetching refreshments for the band as you claim, then you'd know this.</p>
<p>Please show me any pre-1996 reviews which describe LAM as "industrial", there aren't any. There are however, reviews from the release of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psycho_Magnet_494a.html" title="Psycho Magnet">Psycho Magnet</a> onwards which describe the band as so.... the same year <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> released <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist_Superstar_e270.html" title="Antichrist Superstar">Antichrist Superstar</a> and two years after <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Inch_Nails_f615.html" title="Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> released <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Downward_Spiral_26f9.html" title="The Downward Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a> both of which were popular.</p>
<p>Alot of the L.A. scene moved towards industrial &amp; darkwave at this time, I should know. It was not the style LAM experimented with prior to that.</p>
<p>I have read what you said... and all I have seen is somebody claiming to know what they're talking about, yet not proving it. You can't even provide a source for the stuff you claim, you just give a vague destination (which I've searched and found nothing)... unless you can provide a direct link, I'd refrain from acting in a bad faith, smarmy manner while addressing somebody who is trying to improve the article. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 05:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You seem to have misconceptions as to why I would be editing a band page. You do not know whether I like the band or not, you're just being presumptious and taking things I have said out of context. Why would I bother editing an article if I wanted to decrease the value of it?.. simple answer. I wouldn't.</p>
<p>1. I did not say London After Midnight ripped off MM, notice how you skirted carefully around NIN, but OK. Undeniably from Psycho Magnet onwards there were elements of industrial rock in both music and fashion that weren't there before (coincidentally or not, Industrial rock was at its peak in popularity around this time in 96). I don't have objections with you removing those band's names from the article but it is revelant to the article that industrial rock was at its peak in popularity at the time.</p>
<p>And the source you quoted half a sentence from is incorrect. Nine Inch Nails &amp; Marilyn Manson formed in 1989, London After Midnight formed in 1990. (You can find this out merely by visiting their articles)</p>
<p>2. And what is your reason for removing important parts of the band's history? The band started in the goth/death rock club scene in L.A. The club you even mentioned Helter Skelter (where they played their first ever show) is the premier gothic rock club in LA.... what logical reason would you have to blank such information from the article?</p>
<p>They also covered a song from Nightmare Before Christmas, that is uneniable, why remove it from the article? You do not have to revert a whole version of an article just because you have a problem with one sentence.</p>
<p>3. I have read what you have written. I don't see what me being banned once or twice has to do with anything, but whatever. It is not my priority to come up with sources for things <b>you</b> have claimed; that is down to you. If you can come up with a direct source with Brennan saying "<i>London After Midnight is essentially a solo band, with live musicians"</i> then I don't not object to such information being incorporated into the article. I am willing to work with you on this but it is like talking to a brick wall.</p>
<p>And your blanking of Arklette's history in the band is unacceptable. He is a former member, fact. The source I cited for the Covet info was from an official site, fact. If London After Midnight have a different side of the story, then directly source it and include it along side. That is called a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 07:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe it is YOU who has the problem. You're jumping at everything in a parnoid manner, acting like every sentence is aiming to be an attack on that band (which isn't the case at all). You have the nerve to call me a "poor writer" when you refuse to contribute ANYTHING that isn't slanted headily towards praise of said article topic?</p>

<p>Some quick comments because I theoretically am at work now.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please try and find some outside help for the article. I don't think Blipblip yet has a handle on what makes a good article, and he has conflict of interest issues. Deathrocker is perhaps overly aggressive in removing material and has revert limitations. Some other editors would provide additional perspective and could rescue parts of Blipblip's contributions that are worth rescuing.</li>
<li>Bibliographic citations need at a minimum the name of the source (like a magazine), date and page number. Including the article title and author name are preferred, like this: (Jan Wenner, "Rock sucks." <i>Rolling Stone</i>, June 31, 2007, page 44). Linking to the magazine's homepage is of no value—direct link to the article if it is freely available on line, otherwise don't link at all, just give the bibliographic details. Linking to transcripts on another web site is prohibited unless the site has permission to repost the information. Transcripts of magazine articles are probably copyright violations and we do not link to external sites that violate copyright. Again, provide the bibliographic information.</li>
<li>If a magazine publishes an interview, and the band's web site posts the "longer, unedited" version, the parts that are only in the band's version fall under the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Self-published sources</a> section of the reliable source policy.</li>
<li>Blipblip and Deathrocker need to talk about some of the disputed information on the article talk page for others to evaluate and make the edits. I am thinking specifically here about the issue of whether the band is a one-man project (kind of like <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28band%29.html" title="Boston (band)">Boston (band)</a>) or a multi-person band; and the issue of the former bass player. I <i>think</i> it would be acceptable to discuss the issue of the bass player using Brennan and Areklett personal blogs as sources, since they are writing about themselves, but I would like a third opinion on that. In any case, the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a> policy requires that if the issue is dicussed, both sides need to be presented fairly. If an outside reader can detect the wikipedia article taking sides in the matter, that is a violation. It would be better to report what some third party reliable source has to say about the matter, if one can be found.</li>
<li>Deathrocker can not revert the article more than once per day or twice per week, but he can make useful edits that are not reversions. For example, the current version is poorly wikified, and the references need to formatted per <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOTNOTES_8f08.html" title="WP:FOOTNOTES">WP:FOOTNOTES</a>. Some additions that you might disagree with in the long run could still be rewritten for style and tone without removing significant content. And of course discuss it on the talk page. Of course, if the net result of many minor formatting edits is to reduce the article back to Deathrocker's perferred version, or something close to it, that's a revert violation, but he know that. He may prefer to play it safe and see if any outside editors agree with him. (Even people with whom he argues on some topics but who are knowledgable about music might be helpful here--hint hint.)</li>

<p>Saying every band (sorry, “project”) who use elements of DIY or politics is somehow part of punk rock is as ignorant as claiming any band who has ever worn black are goth. It is a music form, with musical characteristics.</p>
<p>Black Sabbath wear black, they're not goth. U2, Kanye West and Michael Jackson are politically involved, they're not punk. The majority of all band's implement elements of DIY when they're starting out. Just most bands choose not to harp on about it like its some big achievement.</p>
<p>Britney Spears' use to drag herself off to talent contests and her mother took her out of town to showcase. They were "doing it themselves" when they were sending out self made video tapes and demo songs out to record companies when she was starting out. Next you'll be trying to claim she is "punk rock" because of this. A musical artist bragging that they've actually had to do something themselves is not a determining factor in what form of music they play.</p>
<p>The 80s stuff you are talking about is hardcore, that is entirely different; different musical characteristics, style of dress, location, ideology, etc, etc. And the 90s stuff you are talking about is even more distant. Punk rock; a movement from New York &amp; the United Kingdom which started in the 1970s and ended in the early 80s, period. Educate yourself please.</p>
<p>On the subject of spelling; I made very few mistakes around 2. (which bots similar to the AntiVandalBot which you trigged earlier, fix) You replaced a misspelled word... with another misspelling. That puts you in no position to criticize on a relatively trivial thing.</p>
<p>How is including information of a cover song the band have created (which was part of a highly popular movie) not relevant?... you’re attempting to cover things up for some unknown reason. Like the band are embarrassed about their past and you want to white wash it for them with an alternative version?</p>
<p>I have read the lyrics to “The <b>Bondage</b> Song”; “<i>take me to <b>bed</b> and rip me apart</i>”... yes, I’m <i>sure</i> with that title and those lyrics, that it has nothing to do with sex. Come on, please be serious here. A drummer and bassist played on Selected Scenes.. search on MySpace group. Brennan and Arklette have both stated they did. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 05:32, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is regarded as inappropriate to edit or remove others comments from a talk page. Furthermore actively erasing non-harassing personal messages without replying (if a reply would be appropriate or polite) can be interpreted as uncivil or even hostile.

<p>ODEN- I have responded to this user with EACH AND EVERY MESSAGE. Try looking at his talk page for proof of this! I removed his messages because he is harassing me and posting stuff that is not true Try reading my responses on his page. How do you archive a page? I don't want his garbage littering my page. Why did you restore lies to the article on LAM? We are supposed to be able to edit the articles for accuracy. Deathrocker continually posts PERSONAL OPINION and stuff that I've shown repeatedly to be false. Why are you allowing this and constantly blanking my edits?--Blipblip 20:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is my understanding that both you and <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> probably have violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Wikipedia's policy on civility</a>, however some of his (and some of your) comments, while uncivil, were also related to article content and not only harassing in nature.

I was unable to determine which comments you removed because you considered them harassing and which ones you removed for other reasons, so I restored the entire talk page.</li>

<p>How was I harassing? By pointing out that he misspelled words? How else am I to communicate these things if I can't tell him he can't spell and has wrong information? I tried to do this civilly and he's been acting like a thug. His history of being banned and disruptive editing continues in this case. This has escalated primarily due to his attitude and refusal to actually understand my edits and additions to the page.</p>
<p>Sorry- I misread the History page. Someone restored Deathrocker's article, I thought I'd read it was you. This person, (perhaps Deathrocker being annoymous?), erased all of my edits, which were very important edits since his is so full of not only misinformation, but spelling and grammar errors. You have 2 edits immediately following that "restoral" so I thought it might be you who did that.</p>
<p>Deathrocker's article contains things that are not true as I've pointed out. Also the wording on some things is misleading. He continually ignores major points like the distinction between LAM being Sean Brennan and the live members (when there are live members) being primarily that, live members. He asserts personal opinion and unsourced claims in his article, etc. Why is this allowed? Why can't I have input in this especially since Deathrocker has repeatedly shown his ignorance of the facts in regard to LAM as I have pointed out?</p>
<p>One thing- I was unaware that you couldn't do what you wanted with your own wiki page. I have seen several that have been very customized. It was my impression that this talk page was sort of like a message center. I deleted the comments for clarity.--Blipblip 23:32, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
