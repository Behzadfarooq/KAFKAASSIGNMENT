<p>Alr8 then, i'll sort dis out...the kooks are an indie band...and there not independent at all! so if u reckon that pop actually means popular anymore...shut up...and finally, if u proper care about this r8 bad to answer me bk, ur r8 sad...get a life</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>The prefix "pop" is short for "popular". There is no dispute about that.</p>
<p>The Beatles are almost definately the most popular band in the history of music. Would you call their music "pop-rock"?</p>
<p>Eminem and Snoop Dogg are also extemely popular. But would you call their music "pop-rap"?</p>
<p>Would you call Tim McGraw's music "pop-country"?</p>
<p>Or Beethoven's music "pop-classical"?</p>
<p>No, you wouldn't.</p>
<p>If there is a Wikipedia page on a musical artist or group, it is most likely at least a somewhat popular artist. So most music is popular in its own right. There is absolutely no need to add the prefix "pop" to a genre to let people know the artist or group is extremely popular.</p>
<p>"Pop" is used to describe status, not musical style.</p>
<p>blink-182 describes themselves as "punk", so they are who we should go by. (See: [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU8Dp6xeUQo" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU8Dp6xeUQo" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] at around the 50 second mark)</p>
<p>If you want to let people know of blink-182's tremendous popularity, that is fine. Just don't include that in their music style. Leave that as "punk rock". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkypunk_f1a9.html" title="User:Hawkypunk">Hawkypunk</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/w/User_talk%7EHawkypunk_d10a.html" title="User talk:Hawkypunk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hawkypunk_04fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hawkypunk">contribs</a>) 06:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The prefix pop in this case refers to the style of music, if we refer to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Punk_1bbc.html" title="Pop Punk">Pop Punk</a> article we will see it says "Pop punk music is more melodic and cleaner-sounding than the original punk rock music of the late 1970s." and refer to the consensus further up the page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blink-182#Pop_punk" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blink-182#Pop_punk" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan027_5e71.html" title="User:Dan027">Dan027</a> 11:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Refferring to other Wikipedia pages gets us nowhere because everything can be edited by anybody. blink-182 calls themselves punk-rock, so we should go by that, not what other people want to call them.

<dd>Pop stood for any popular music in the 1960's but it's evolved to a more distinct genre. Pop-punk is punk sound which has little to no focus on politics and has lighter music. And I don't think they we should go just by what they say, especially since they just said in a passing way and diddn't deny being pop-punk. If a band with say an obvious <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a> sound called themselves <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metal</a> band should we just say their metal because they diddn't mention the black part? And what exactly is your problem with the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_punk.html" title="Pop punk">pop punk</a> article? If it's because anyone can edit it why do you use wikipedia at all then?<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohhny-turbo_f4a9.html" title="User:Johhny-turbo">Johhny-turbo</a> 01:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it that important? "Pop punk" means what it's come to mean, and blink-182 falls into that definition. It's difficult to see striking similarities between sum41 and blink-182, and say The Sex Pistols, Bad Religion or NOFX.Artiste-extraordinaire 18:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes - Due to the only valid primary sources stating they are punk rock. Only secondary sources coming from other listeners ever state they are punk pop. Its fair to say on the article people believe them to be this, but it is false to flat out <b>lie</b> and say they are "pop punk".

<p>PLEASE stop this LIE. Don't call them pop-punk. It's an insult to the band. They refer to themselves as punk rock on many occasions, never as pop-punk. Pop punk is a genre simply made up to insult them, based off a couple of melodic ballads such as atst and wmag.</p>

<p>First of all wikipedia relies on third party information, so if members of the band claim to be of a certain genre it is worthless. Second there are hundreds of sources listing them as pop punk, I only put up 4 as to not cluster up the boards. Third you have made ridicolous statements such as "pop-punk was a genre made up to criticise blink-182" or something along those lines so I don't see how you excpect us to take your opinions seriously.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 05:12, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Firstly pop/punk is not "pop punk" and secondly that page was not created by the band. However I do agree its a more valid source then any produced by you beforehand. I would agree that enema of the state and take off your pants and jacket were pop albums. However, defining blink 182 as uniformally "pop punk" ignoring their eariler albums and their later albums (probably because you and many others just never listend to them) is wrong. It should be changed. The sources i have produced prove this, their music proves it as well. I think a compromise is in order <i>at least</i>. However i do recognise that you are being very stubborn over this issue and refuse to be sensible at this current state of time.

<p>It doesn't matter if the pages aren't created by the band, the fact that the band members were the ocne who made the statements make your sources worthless.

<dd>Ok, this editorial pissing match really needs an immediate cease and desist. Voting and consensus building are not synonymous. Obviously if a couple of google searches yields innumerable "sources" describing the band as either pop-punk or punk rock then there is dissension within the community. Wikipedia was founded on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which doesn't translate to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> in order to support whichever moniker you feel is correct - it means ALL angles and sides needed to be mentioned in the article to achieve non-partisanship. The lead and info box need to be updated to reflect this. Alternatively, a subsection could be created to talk about the genre dispute among fans, the derision associated with the term "pop punk", and band's punk rock roots/influences. <a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisdom89_9409.html" title="User:Wisdom89">Wisdom89</a> 19:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally i think wisdom is right, i've been arguing from his angle for a while now, but dan027 reverts anything i write, i think it may be because he dislikes blink 182, even if i just leave it in note form he still deletes it.

<p>That's all fine but the fact is that the four sources Olir presviously presnted are all inelgible. I'm all for adding some secondary genres to this page, but they have to be sourced, and can't be quotes from members of the band.

<p>You know what you've done, I'm not here for a public row, i'm not here to score points. I just want the genre dispute to be recongnised. However i think it's fair to believe that no fan who has listened to (and owns) all their cds and seen them live would demand they be called "pop punk", bu that can remain my own personal musing. As for the edit, I'm glad we've finally agreed. I'll post it on the talk page when I have enough time. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 17:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm curious what other bands you would classify as punk, and what bands you would classify as pop punk. You seem to have a different viewpoint from everyone else.</p>
<p>I agree with you that some of their songs from their first two albums can be called punk, it seems that the large majority of their catalouge should be considered pop punk.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 18:58, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, on flyswatter they do covers of punk rock bands, for exmaple. Their earlier stuff on buddah and cheshire cat and to some extent dude ranch is faster, harder and more similar from track to track, its punk rock. then i'd say they had two pop punk albums in enema of the state and take off your pants and jacket. Then obviously their final album is alt. rock. Not punk or pop. So with a total of about 2 1/2 albums out of 6 being pop punk i'd say it was wrong to have a sentence saying "blink 182 were a pop punk band". Especially since the band call themselves punk rockers on so many occasions, yet theres no source with them defining themselves as pop punk. So basically, what i am saying is not to label them pop punk as a uniformal description of all their work. Because right now thats what it is saying. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 19:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well green day are listed as pop punk, punk rock and alt. rock. Dookie and american idiot for example are totally pop punk, like blink have toyp&amp;j and eots, yet blink are forceablly labeled as only pop punk, ignoring chesire cat, dude ranch, flyswatter, buddah and the untitled album <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 21:46, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dude Ranch is a pop punk album! Flyswatter is a short demo! And I've yet to listen to Cheshire Cat or Buddha (both of which contain many of the same songs) but I'm pretty sure they're both pop punk as well! I'll give them a listen later today. I also did a search for "Blink-182 alternative rock and found no valid sources.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 05:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the album booklet. Also, the bands they liken themselves to in that booklet are like pink flloyd, and zepplin, etc. Just listen to it if you need proof, to be honest. I propose that the uniformal statement that they are pop punk be removed as it just doesnt need to be there. Then they can be listed as punk rock/pop punk and alt rock. Then later on a paragraph explaining their genre dispute can be written. Right now its a lie, and people read this for facts not opinion based lies made up by dan027 and alex, etc. sorry to name and shame. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 11:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To answer your question read what it says on the page edit:</p>
<p>Please DO NOT include any other releases (example: demos, EPs, compilations, live recordings, etc.) on this section and this is only intended to list the studio albums of Blink-182's discography. The reason why there is a new page for the discography is that the band has put up many releases other than studio recordings, so this clutters up this article.</p>
<p>You can find the demos listed in the article <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink-182_discography.html" title="Blink-182 discography">blink-182 discography</a>.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 05:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not going to repeat much of the rationale behind standardized capitalization, since I have already elaborated on this at length during the move request discussions attached to the precedents I previously named. But since you have brought up the issue of common sense, let's talk about that. To me, it is common sense to...
<ul>
<li>...not just take official or fan-driven, but also independent sources into consideration, when assessing whether an eccentric typeset is used "commonly" or "sometimes". <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=blink-182&amp;srchst=nyt" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=blink-182&amp;srchst=nyt" rel="nofollow">Major newspapers</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_/104-2158656-0631934?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=blink-182&amp;Go.x=11&amp;Go.y=11&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_/104-2158656-0631934?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=blink-182&amp;Go.x=11&amp;Go.y=11&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">retailers</a> and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479757/20031014/story.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479757/20031014/story.jhtml" rel="nofollow">music networks</a> apparently don't care that much, which bears the question why a general-purpose publication like an encyclopedia should.</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<li>...capitalize proper names, which kids in English-speaking countries are taught in kindergarten and most other people around the world during their first English lesson.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>...consider the Wikipedia-wide ramifications before calling for the "occasional exception" from a guideline. Which by the way is a rhetoric I probably get like four times out of five when applying certain guidelines to a pop-culture-centered article - you know, <i>occasionally</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently all this is not common sense to you, hence my common sense now tells me, that we should just agree to disagree. After all, I'm just here to fix a minor style issue ("minor" from aforementioned Wikipedia-wide point of view), not to have my good faith questioned by having conclusive edit summaries on my part denoted as empty "just because" statements in a borderline-3RR revert war. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 03:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I just checked my blink-182 albums and its written as "blink-182". Why should be unmine their naming by effectivly grammar naziing them on their own name whilst writing an article about them. There is no reason for it to ever be written with a b just because "thats what normally happens". Some bands wrte the names WiTh WeIrD choices of case, and you dont see some self important person come and grammar nazi the name, do you?</li>

<dd>Actually, when bands write their names WiTh WeIrD choices of case, most mainstream print sources choose not to follow that lead, and apply standard rules, just like we do in most such articles here. You ask why we would do that? I think the best reason is that we're not trying to assist trademark holders in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_management.html" title="Brand management">brand management</a>, we're trying to convey information. Weird typesettings are a marketing choice, and it's not our place to do their marketing.

<ul>
<li>Also, if we have to conform to some stupid rule that says we should be wrong and put a capital b, why do we say "sometimes typeset" its always typeset as blink 182, never as Blink 182. Only people who have made a mistake write it like that, and that mistake was to capitalise. So i say blank out the "sometimes" as its not true. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/i/User_talk%7EOlir_1de3.html" title="User talk:Olir">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Olir_2121.html" title="Special:Contributions/Olir">contribs</a>) 10:44, March 1, 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I've observed the rule that we should capitalise the b when talking about them, however common sense tells us that the offcial way of spelling it is with a lower case b, thats what you'll find on all the merch, on your albums on your gig tickets on their websites forums etc.<br />
Now, with the rule standing that we capitalise the b when we type the name, someone who doesnt know blink has no idea that the real name is with a capital b. The statement "sometimes" is ambiguous and will lead people to believe that maybe on their albums the b will be capitalised or maybe not, basically that current bracketed statement says nothing. The fact is on anything offcial the b wont be capitalised currently we are not recognisining that. Its cool that we write the article with the upper case B, thats the rule, however we must state that on any real blink 182 stuff, you'll never find a capital b. That does NOT mean we write the aricle with lower case b's everytime we say their name it just means that a minor explanation needs to be put, perferrably in that bracketed space explaining that the lower case b is the correct way. I think saying "offcially" instead of "sometimes" would be a perfect way of saying this.</dd>

<li>thanks for coming to discuss the sources dan. reference 8 is an example of them talking about their punk rock roots, they are making a joke about (as they usually do) it but its a clear stand out reference. They arent trained by a pop punk monk! 9 is also beign used as a reference for pop punk, since it also says they are punk rock i thought why not have this source for punk rock aswell? 10 refers to mark hoppus, a member of blink 182 and finally 11 is tom delonge refering to his roots again, when he was in school he was punk rock, he also wrote cheshire cat, flyswatter, dude ranch and buddah around that time then departed from the roots a little bit, here he acknowledges how they still affect him. it's a perfect source.</li>

<p>This reference does not refer to blink 182 as pop punk at all. If you googled this and automatically added it without checking you wouldnt have known that a customer mentions the word punk pop when describing good charlotte and NFG but refers to blink as "rock". Added to the fact a person like this is not a valid source in the first place, this source holds no ground. I'm sure you can go and find others. Therefore I have removed this as it is not a source. If you wish to argue that this is a source somehow then please leave a reason <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 22:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>What the fuck are you talking about? Look here in the product description:</li>
</ul>
<p>This "greatest hits" collection spans the short career of one of pop-punk's most celebrated outfits Blink 182. The album features tracks from their 1994 debut 'Buddha' through to the more experimental final album, 2003's 'Blink 182'. The album serves as a perfect introduction into the band's hook driven pop-punk which has always involved a large dose of frat-boy toilet humour.</p>
<p>Furthermore I've had to remove soem of your sources for reasons explained on the edit page:</p>
<p>I can see nothing titled Apple Shampoo on this url (blink182.com), if it is something inside the site, please give the correct url.</p>
<p>The give me one good reason thing, is not a valid source, while he calls himself a punk, it does not mean his band plays punk rock music, the two can be seperate.) <a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 23:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ive changed the source to the apple shampoo lyrics as opposed to the website. You can buy it off the website but i guess the lyrics is a better source. The give me one good reason source is a perfect source, delonge calls himself a punk rocker whilst refering to his music and his fans thus <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 23:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The lyrics to a song mentioning a genre do not constitute the band as that genre, furthermore I watched the video from Sydney and they do not refer to themselves as a punk rock band.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again the give me one good reason thing is absolutely not a good source. He calls himself a "punker" which can mean a punk rocker or a punk in general (a menace). Even if he did mean a punk rocker (which he probably did) he himself being one would not automatically make his band a punk rock band.</p>
<ul>
<li>He refers to his genre of music being punk rock, at that time he wasnt in angels and airwaves <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 23:38, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He says punk rock was the only music he LISTENED to, his says nothign about the music he himself played.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are going tp be extremely pedantic he doesnt refer to blink 182 as punk rock although the summation of his rhetoric concludeds that the sum of his work is punk rock. but why delete several other valid sources aswell? thats reidiculous and you should be blocked <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 23:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The problem is we can't jump to conclussions, and it seems like thats all you are doing (for example the video where they mention a punk monk). Please explain how the other sources I've removed were valid, I've already explained why they are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also can you explain how the +44disasters site is a valid source?<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 23:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>thats where you can get the podcast where mark refers to himself as punk rock. I'd also like to add this source where raynor calls blink 182 punk rock: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020602190348/gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asivam/inter3.html" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20020602190348/gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asivam/inter3.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20020602190348/gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asivam/inter3.html</a> however the page is blocked <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 00:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Again the problem is he is not reffering to blink-182 as punk rock. Look we have to reach an agreement and get this page able to be edited again. I propose you take down that plus-44 source and we keep the other current punk rock sources up. Are there any pop punk sources you feel should be removed?00:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>i'd have to listen to the podcast again, which i dont have time to do, its podcast 6, if you could find the reference and type it out here that would be helpful - however in the interest of unlocking the article i'd say remove it and we can discuss it later. however the meaning for give me one good reason should be up there - the meaning for give me one good reason combined with the song provide such a good source i see no reason why it should not be regarded as a good source for wiki readers. as i say pedanticism may lead you to think it isnt a source, but i would say open your eyes, why deny readers this as a reference? its such a good reference, especially for their earlier stuff. apple shampoo also <i>directly</i> refers to blink 182, we need a range of sources, what bettter then a song. Also the you tube video is a valid source, they say they are trained by a punk rock monk, a direct reference to what they believe as their genre, the video was later published on dvd. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 00:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also that "bull shit pop music" quote was taken out of context i believe<a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 01:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll give you the one good reason source in exchange for the plus44 source, and the agreement that from here on in we stop adding sources to the genres, as they are getting too clustered. Deal?<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 01:35, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am unclear as to what sources you are suggesting we keep, could you post them. There is one source about scott raynor that i would like to add. I think about 5 each will do, the current 5 pop punk sources are all 2nd party sources, perhaps add the amazon one instead of the other one you recently posted as the amazon is a better known source. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 15:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, right now the only source that I know is valid for punk rock is the last fm one. The ask Mark and +44disasters sources may be valid as well but I haven't gotten a chance to listen or read them due to their length.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 23:56, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia." is what he is doing. He doesnt find valid reasons to take off sources, doesnt discuss it, only occasionally does he post an unsatisfactory message or two, always acts before refering to the discussion, even when asked because he doesnt like what he sees (he thinks blink are only pop punk, i guess, many fans who only listen to the mainstream stuff think this way) <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 23:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, for about four months, "Blink-182 (album)" was called "(untitled) (blink-182 album)". Now, all of a sudden, it's cited as Blink-182, a self-titled album, for no reason. All of the band members have cited the album as untitled, not self-titled. And what really bugs me is that, in the first sentence: "...is a self- or un-titled album", which is false. I have worked on the article many times, reverted the title, and I'm sick of doing it. References on MTV.com have also said the album was untitled.

<p>I was shocked when I read this. So shocked i couldn't believe it. Then i realised, i shouldnt believe it, because its not true, and i was right. The famous you tube video was taken out of context, he was telling a story about how he was trying to start blink 182 and people told him this, its not at all what he said. Think about it, did he actually say thats what he feels about blink 182? no. Would he ever say that about blink 182? of course not. Find a source to prove me wrong.

I said we should choose 5 sources out of all the valid ones which i have presented (and given reason for 1000 times). But you just wipe them all again and again and refuse to go to the discussion board as you were told to, so i keep having to put them back. Your actions are contradictary of your agreements during the lock. You also keep putting "sometimes" instead of "officially" which i can only presume is you vandalising the page as you havent commented on the discussion which reached a consensus march 3rd. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlir_2f6b.html" title="User:Olir">Olir</a> 20:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You say that most of the sources I've taken down where valid, but I and other editors have on multiple occassions pointed out why they are not valid but you just refuse to listen. Almost all of the sources you had were self-published quotes reffering to an individual song or a distant mention of the word punk. In reference to the agreement, while we both agreed ot cut down on adding more sources, we didn't agree to leave up non valid sources, which seemed to me to go without saying.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 03:42, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

If you're allowing these souces, then this source is allowed too, if you're not then they go.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The Blink 182 band members went to Poway High School. Poway High School's biggest rival is Rancho Bernardo High School (nicknamed RB). R is the 18th letter of the alphabet and B is the second, thus thus 182. It is a possibility that Blink 182 actually means "Blink" RB, where "Blink" might mean "Beep", or something in place of a cuss word, such as "Fuck RB".</p>
<p>Just another possibility that should be added to the article&#160;:) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.197.212.235_6d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.197.212.235">72.197.212.235</a> (talk) 00:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
