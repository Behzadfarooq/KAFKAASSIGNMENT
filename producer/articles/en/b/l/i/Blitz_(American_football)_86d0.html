<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_%28American_football%29_86d0.html" title="Edit section: How blitzing works">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How blitzing works</span></h2>
<p>On passing plays, the offense always has at least 5 men blocking. From left to right, they are: left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, right tackle. Depending on the personnel, formation, and blocking principles the offense uses, they can have a <b>maximum</b> of 9 players blocking on any given pass play (this type of maximum protection is succinctly called "Max Protect"). Since the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">QB</a> is throwing the pass, he cannot block and must have at least one receiver to catch the pass. Assuming the lone <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_receiver.html" title="Wide receiver">wide receiver</a> is covered by a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_back.html" title="Defensive back">defensive back</a>, this leaves the defense 10 players to rush the QB versus the offense's 9 blockers--the offense is outnumbered and at a disadvantage. Because the QB cannot block during passing plays, the defense <b>always</b> has one more man available to rush than the offense can block.</p>
<p>Usually offenses do not max protect often, varying the levels of protection available depending on the play design and the QB's pre-snap read of the defense. The more receivers the offense has running passing routes, the better their chances are of completing the pass. This factor allows defenses to devise and execute a staggering variety of blitz packages between any number of their coverage personnel, trading tight coverage of receivers for proactive aggressive disruption of the play.</p>
<p>By nature, blitzes are risky endeavors for the defense. Since the defense is taking away coverage defenders to rush the QB, there necessarily are holes in pass coverage. The defense does not and cannot cover all offensive players, but rather through the blitz, is proactively involved in rattling the QB, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback_sack.html" title="Quarterback sack">sacking</a> the QB, disrupting QB timing, or forcing him to make an error such as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interception.html" title="Interception">interception</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/m/Fumble.html" title="Fumble">fumble</a>.</p>
<p>The most common blitzes are linebacker blitzes. <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_Back_180f.html" title="Defensive Back">Safety</a> blitzes, when a safety (usually the strong safety) is sent, and corner blitzes, where a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornerback.html" title="Cornerback">cornerback</a> is sent, are less common. Sending a defensive back on a blitz is even more risky than a linebacker blitz, as it removes a primary pass defender from the coverage scheme, but is also less likely to be picked up by the offensive team’s blockers.</p>
<p>There is some confusion among average fans as to what constitutes a blitz. Blitz is colloquially used to describe any time a LB or DB crosses the line of scrimmage when in actuality, a blitz is defined as the defense rushing the QB with more men than the offense has accounted for and can block. For example, if the defense rushes 5 men, that does not constitute a blitz (as a minimum of 5 blockers are on the offensive line).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_%28American_football%29_86d0.html" title="Edit section: Defensive shells and techniques">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defensive shells and techniques</span></h2>
<p>Blitzes are usually run from "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_strategy.html" title="American football strategy">Cover 1</a>" coverage shells which assign one man to guard the entire deep field, though blitzes can be employed in nearly any coverage scheme. Cover 1 is most effective because it allows a larger number of defensive players to tighten down on the line of scrimmage thus increasing the variety of blitzes possible.</p>
<p>Since the main goal is to disrupt the offensive play before it even develops, many blitz packages encourage cornerbacks to play tight man <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bump_and_run_coverage.html" title="Bump and run coverage">bump and run coverage</a> to disrupt the wide receivers' release and prevent them from running their pre-assigned routes. The non-blitzing safety, usually the free safety, has an enormous amount of field to protect and is at a serious disadvantage if the blitz is unsuccessful and receivers threaten his coverage area. As such, he usually works for depth upon the snap of the ball, backpedaling into his assigned zone.</p>
<p>Linebackers are either blitzing or in pass coverage. Blitzing <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linebacker.html" title="Linebacker">LBs</a> can employ various <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunts.html" title="Stunts">stunts</a> to confuse the offense's blockers and break down their protection scheme. Coverage LBs in a Cover 1 scheme will usually have man responsibility on a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_back.html" title="Running back">halfback</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fullback.html" title="Fullback">fullback</a>, or <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tight_end.html" title="Tight end">tight end</a>.</p>
<p>Some defensive schemes employ "key" blitzes where a player will blitz only if his assigned man stays in to block thus keying his action off the action of his man. If his man releases into a pass pattern, then the defensive player will cover him. For example, if weak side linebacker has the fullback as his man, if upon the snap of the ball the fullback blocks, the linebacker will blitz.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_%28American_football%29_86d0.html" title="Edit section: Advantages and disadvantages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advantages and disadvantages</span></h2>
<p>Advantages gained by blitzing are obvious: proactively disrupt the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_positions.html#Offense" title="American football positions">offense's</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">play</a> before it develops and cause enough <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressure.html" title="Pressure">pressure</a> on the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> to force him into a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnover.html" title="Turnover">turnover</a>.</p>
<p>Disadvantages abound in any blitz <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheme.html" title="Scheme">scheme</a> as well. First, the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offensive_linemen.html" title="Offensive linemen">offensive linemen</a> are usually <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trained.html" title="Trained">trained</a> to recognize a blitzing <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player.html" title="Player">player</a> before the snap of the ball. They <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicate.html" title="Communicate">communicate</a> with each other at the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_scrimmage.html" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> using <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_words.html" title="Code words">code words</a> that shift the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">protection</a> to the blitzing player's side thus strengthening their <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocking.html" title="Blocking">blocking</a> front. The <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">Quarterback</a> can also call other players into the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">protection</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheme.html" title="Scheme">scheme</a> with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">audibles</a> if he feels that his current <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">protection</a> is <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak.html" title="Weak">weak</a>. With good <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">protection</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calls.html" title="Calls">calls</a> and fundamental <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocking.html" title="Blocking">blocking</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles.html" title="Principles">principles</a>, some blitzes can be "picked up"--stopped at the point of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack.html" title="Attack">attack</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the tight man bump and run technique typical of blitz scheme cornerbacks can be defeated with aggressive WR release moves. Once this happens the CB is at a disadvantage and must regain ground and position quickly to prevent a catch. If the blitz is picked up, the WR can create enough separation to become open relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Third, if the blitz is picked up, the one deep defender (usually the free safety) has an enormous amount of territory to guard. If two players simultaneously threaten his zone, he must decide which one to cover. The QB can read his reaction and throw to the defender that he does not decide to cover, usually for a big gain.</p>
<p>Fourth, if the pass is caught, there are fewer defenders and larger gaps between defenders, meaning that the receiver can get more yards after catch and possibly turn a minimal gain into a dangerous play.</p>
<p><a name="How_to_beat_the_blitz" id="How_to_beat_the_blitz"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_%28American_football%29_86d0.html" title="Edit section: How to beat the blitz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How to beat the blitz</span></h2>
<p>Offenses employ the above procedures to beat the blitz as well as two other techniques and passing route combinations designed to exploit weaknesses in a blitzing scheme.</p>
<p>One of those techniques is called "throwing hot," which entails intentionally leaving one blitzing defensive player unblocked. The offensive line usually makes pre-snap adjustments so that the "free" rusher is clearly within the QB's field of vision. This limits devastating blind-side hits on the QB by rushers.</p>
<p>The other technique, sometimes used in conjunction with throwing hot, is called sight adjustment. Receivers are taught to run into the empty spot vacated by a blitzing player instead of running their pre-assigned pattern. The QB sees the free rusher or blitzing LB/CB and knows that the receiver will sight adjust accordingly and run a route that takes him into the hole left by the defender.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Offense_b142.html" title="West Coast Offense">West Coast Offense</a> is an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offense.html" title="Offense">offense</a> that focuses on <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball.html" title="Ball">ball</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control.html" title="Control">control</a> and short <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passes.html" title="Passes">passes</a>.
