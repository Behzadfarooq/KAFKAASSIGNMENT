<h2><span class="mw-headline">A note</span></h2>
<p>It is too late for me to add this to my main page, as I'm banned, but I'll add this here. I have edited Wikipedia, on and off, for some time, without disruption, as an anonymous IP. I figured I didn't need to establish a reputation to make common-sense edits. When I ran into <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a> on the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland_Seven_cdbc.html" title="Portland Seven">Portland Seven</a> page, everything changed, and I was suddenly called a "sock" because my IP address changes (inevitable side-effect of DHCP). He called me this enough that I have been banned, though for no reason I can figure out. Some look at my history and say "Your first edits were to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>!" or whatever, but in fact, <i>the reason I got an account</i> was to fight the accusations of being a puppet. Perhaps independent observers can see the circular logic here: 1) edit anonymously -- get called a puppet; 2) complain about this -- get told to get an account; 3) get an account -- get banned! I have recently complained on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> about this, but I will probably just go back to quiet anonymous editing until it happens again -- but this aspect of Wikipedia's "anyone can edit" policy is definitely not as advertised. -- <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlindVenetian_775e.html" title="User:BlindVenetian">User:BlindVenetian</a> 21:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is your first and final warning about editing things to do with <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a>. Looking at your contributions, the vast majority are to articles also edited by <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a>. It quite simple, before you edit a page check if IronDuke has. If he has, then don't edit it. If you do edit pages that IronDuke has, you will be indefinitely blocked. The reason being wikistalking. Find something else to edit, I can help find you something if you wish. Just think about this, it's not a big deal, I said before - there are 1,000,000 other articles to edit. The Wikipedia way is to build an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 10:08, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No but i will point out that you have been asked to be unblocked and direct people to this page.So explain yourself, what other accounts have you used? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 22:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've used a series of anon IPs -- I don't keep track of which ones they are, but (I suppose you'll just block all of these) they include 88.149.150.47, 83.211.48.173, 83.77.214.114, 84.162.18.6, 63.203.204.231, 24.57.143.66 and others.

<p>As long as you do not use them in the next 48 hours i will not block them. I've made a note on the AN for slimvirgin to see. I will not lift the block myself as i don't know the history and have to go to bed now:-(. I have always found slimvirgin to be sensible and reasonable. I expect that she will look at this unblock request when she comes online so here is the chance to leave her a message. I'll look back tomorrow to see how things are progressing but goodnight for now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 22:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BlindVenetian, the reason you were blocked is because of the situation with IronDuke, who has been the subject of harassment for a few months by one or two people using multiple accounts. Your very first edit with this account was to get involved in the situation with IronDuke at <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hawash_0f12.html" title="Mike Hawash">Mike Hawash</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58611317" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58611317" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> so I'm assuming you were <a href="../../../8/8/2E/User%7E88.149.150.47.html" title="User:88.149.150.47">User:88.149.150.47</a>, who posted the complaint. Would you mind explaining how you came to create <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hawash_0f12.html" title="Mike Hawash">Mike Hawash</a> a year ago, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_Hawash&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19894207" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_Hawash&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19894207" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> as you said you did above, and what brought you back to the article after a gap of a year? Also, could you say how you are able to edit from IP addresses all over the world? If you prefer, feel free to e-mail me using the link on my user page. I'm very willing to assume good faith with you, but I'm also certain that the situation with IronDuke has to stop, so your cooperation would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:07, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't seem to make Wikipedia email work, so I'll respond here. You asked <i>"how [did I] come to create <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hawash_0f12.html" title="Mike Hawash">Mike Hawash</a> ... and why ... come back to it a year later"</i> -- not sure how to answer that - I must have either followed a red link or created it in response to some news item I saw. I came back to it later and added what appeared to be mostly uncontroversial information, until I was attacked -- I think the edit logs will show this. You also ask how I <i>"can edit from IP addresses all over the world"</i>. Again, I do travel for my work now, but I have no knowledge of how the dial-up system I use (iPass) chooses where it logs into.</dd>

<dd>I don't see how any of this is relevant. Other than using a dynamic IP address, I don't see what I have done to deserve this treatment.
