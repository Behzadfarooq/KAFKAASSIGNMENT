<p>Blind Brook High School was built in 1973 after the community (which was the unincorporated area of the Town of Rye) wanted to expand the local school district (known as District #5). This push for expansion started after the community became frustrated spending lots of money to send their children to high schools in the local area (Port Chester, Mamaroneck, and Rye Neck are a few). In addition, the Ridge Street School, which housed classes from Kindergarten to 8th/9th grades, was becoming overcrowded and could not accommodate the growing population that would become known as Rye Brook (in 1982). Land was purchased on King Street where the original Blind Brook High School building was built. The High School today stands on the same campus as in 1973.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Brook_High_School_ef18.html" title="Edit section: 30 Years of Blind Brook: 1973-2003">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">30 Years of Blind Brook: 1973-2003</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <b>building</b> was considered modern as it contained 'open classrooms'. This meant that the building contained classrooms that had only two walls around it. This made for an interesting and different learning environment as students walking in the hallways would also be walking through a class. The building also contained, and still does to this day, The Commons, an open area in the middle of the building where students could do work, hang out, or just take a break. BBHS was not built with an auditorium but did, and still has, a LGI, or a "Large Group Instruction" room. School plays were held in the usually cramped space that only holds 100 people. Because of the LGI's small size, band and choral concerts and graduation in the Spring had to be held in the gym. The campus was built with two grass fields, a baseball field and a soccer field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1999, the fast-growing population of the Blind Brook community started to outgrow the original high school building. A parent-school district committee, called, "Let's Bond for our Kids" formed a construction plan and encouraged the community to get involved and vote. The Bond passed by a large margin, bringing construction to the BB campus for the first time since 1973. To create additional classroom space during the construction, the district bought two modular classrooms. These modular buildings are connected to each other, but are not connected to the main high school building. To this day, the modular classrooms, or as they are often called, the portables (even though they can not be moved), are still used for daily classes and are fairly popular among the student body.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The construction project added a Middle School wing, Middle School gym, renovated IMC (library), new Middle School and High School main offices, a 450-seat auditorium, a new front walkway and entrance, a renovated commons area, and high school classroom renovation.</li>
<li>To meet state fire codes, the construction resulted in traditional, 4-walled, closed classrooms. By removing wall-less classrooms, the new classroom setup left some rooms window-less. In addition, the commons had the carpet removed and new, artistic walls were installed. These walls were poked fun at often and seemed very silly in the eyes of students, with statements of "This is a school, not an art museum!" pushing a backlash against the walls. Many wanted the walls removed, though that wouldn't happen until Blind Brook went through its second wave of construction. The new auditorium was also criticized as it was too small and could not fit the entire high school and its faculty in the facility at the same time. In addition, the end-of-the-year graduation would not be able to be held in the new facility as it lacked necessary seating for guests. Graduations are held in the gym as it can accommodate the large amount of guests.</li>
</ul>
<p>2002-2003 brought much change to Blind Brook High School. A new look, new technology, and new traditions changed the style of the culture through the halls of Blind Brook. A (non-merged) football team, albeit at the Junior Varsity level, was created, bringing football to Rye Brook after a long hiatus. Parking issues at the then-IBM building between the High School and the building's owners continued, resulting in tense negotiations between the two groups. Three International Baccalorate classes (12th grade English, 11th grade Chemistry, and Theory of Knowledge) were added to the Blind Brook menu of classes in order to create a more difficult and challenging curriculum, though after months of discussion and debate, the Board of Education voted 4 to 1 against the continuing of the program in March 2003. The end of the school year also brought the resignations of Blind Brook's top administrators, long-time principal Robert Chlebicki and assistant principal Michael Mitchell, leaving a sense of uncertainty to the Blind Brook community.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Brook_High_School_ef18.html" title="Edit section: Blind Brook Prepares for the Future: 2004-To the Present">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blind Brook Prepares for the Future: 2004-To the Present</span></h3>
<p>Blind Brook's administration was still up in the air in 2003-2004 school year as an interim principal was hired while the principal search took place. Anthony Baxter and Jane Wermuth were hired for the positions of principal and assistant principal, respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blind Brook's future curriculum plans were also in limbo after IB was rejected. A new direction plan was put into action by the Board of Education to investigate the AP program and if is was a good fit for BBHS. From 2004 to 2006, Blind Brook added numerous AP classes to the its class offerings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In early 2005, the Blind Brook community continued its fast growth, giving school officials no choice other than expand onto the high school building. A Bond vote was conducted and passed by a high percentage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Construction, however, did not start until late 2005, around October, because of problems with architect plans and a slow permit approval by the State Education Department. In the 2005-06 phase of construction, a new cafeteria, fitness center, science labs, HS and MS classrooms, and new athletic fields were built. Problems arose when students became concerned with the future of the <i>Rock</i>, a tradition Blind Brook students take part in every year as the Senior class paints it. The problem was fixed as the rock was moved out of harm's way. The new fields will feature synthetic grass, giving teams more flexablility in when they can use they fields and how often they do so.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A significant retaining wall malfunction delayed the construction of the lower field as it had to be rebuilt. The manufacturure has announced that the wrong type of stones were chosen for the wall, meaning all retaining walls on the campus must be taken down and rebuilt. This is projected to set the fields project back several months and was finally completed in October, 2006. The company who installed the wall and provides the stones will pay for the damages. The upper field will contain the baseball field and the lower will contain a 6-lane track and a soccer/football field in it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The baseball field, complete with stands, backstop, and sliding-dirt cutouts, was completed in mid-October, 2006.</li>
