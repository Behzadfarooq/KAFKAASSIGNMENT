<p>Shouldn't there only be one page discussing Blind Faith? It seems to me that the history of the band and the album are one and the same. Unlike <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_and_the_Dominoes_c69b.html" title="Derek and the Dominoes">Derek and the Dominoes</a>, only one album was ever released or attempted by Blind Faith. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcuin_9f7f.html" title="User:Alcuin">Alcuin</a> 15:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should probably stay as it is. Every other band has a page for the band and a page for the album. I don't see a reason to break the format.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did it anyway, there was too much duplication of info between the two pages, and all info was relevant to any discussion of either the band or the album. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcuin_9f7f.html" title="User:Alcuin">Alcuin</a> 23:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note also that Blind Faith (the group) released only one album and was actually named after the cover artwork on the album. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZigamorph_d270.html" title="User:Zigamorph">Zigamorph</a> 16:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Expanding the Article into two</i> With the size and quality of the information provided now I would agree that a combination of the articles would be wise but I"m willing to solely add about 4 times the amount of info there and with that much info the page should be more appropriately divided. There is a humongous amount of back-story and history behind the band that I think deserves to be on a separate page and there is also enough information to make a very large album page as well. Also noted like earlier, most bands have one or two albums alone still have a separate page for band and album and I think this band really deserves that distinction as well. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatman2648_01fe.html" title="User:Patman2648">Patman2648</a> 05:39, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I totally agree with what you did with merging them at the time because alone as they stood they had such little information and that way would be the best to view them but hopefully with my new additions they'll be big enough to satisfy most.

<dd>hahahaha, I know! Its the most spacing I've ever seen, hopefully we'll get some Barnstars for the spacing and thank you for the compliment on the looks, I tinkered with the pictures alot so I'm trying to get it pretty. I think its one the best articles I've ever done, I just love Clapton, I also created and wrote 99% of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_%26_The_Dominos_d2ab.html" title="Derek &amp; The Dominos">Derek &amp; The Dominos</a> and added a crapload to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Yardbirds_9c9b.html" title="The Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> the page itself, Clapton deserves my time and I'm happy to give it to him. Hey for the bottom image, the small one, do you like it how it is or would you move to the left or just delete it, I'm not sure and would really like your opinion.

<p>I believe that the "spaceship" the girl is holding is the hood ornament from a Bel-Air.</p>

<dd>I could not get my hands on the image until out of the mist a concept began to emerge. To symbolize the achievement of human creativity and its expression through technology a space ship was the material object. To carry this new spore into the universe innocence would be the ideal bearer, a young girl, a girl as young as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliet.html" title="Juliet">Juliet</a>.

Instead, the model used was her younger sister, who was reported to be 11 years old.

<p>In light of the extensive editing I've done here, I thought a few words of explanation might be appreciated. As I was reading through this section, I couldn't help but be struck by the serious need for punctuation and grammatical fixes. (I am a published writer/editor, and have a good deal of experience doing this sort of thing.) I've done my very best to retain as much as possible of the original wording, style, etc., while improving the clarity, and strengthening the coherence and structure of each of the paragraphs. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 12:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a note at the top of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blind Faith</b> were (!--DO NOT change "were" to "was", it's grammatically incorrect--)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if this is correct. Blind Faith is a group, which is thus identified as a unit. According to the Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, "A noun that is singular in construction takes a singular verb when it is used as a subject...." But perhaps this is a difference between American and British usage. Does anyone have an explanation? <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToyalla_9067.html" title="User:Toyalla">Toyalla</a> 18:57, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your educated guess was quite right. In British usage, "group nouns" (for lack of a better term) are treated as though they were in fact <i>plural nouns</i>. Takes a little getting used to for us Yanks.&#160;:) But given that it's a British group, I think their preference takes precedence. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 20:05, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
