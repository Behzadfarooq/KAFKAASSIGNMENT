<p>Nicole Callahan is the daughter of Stephen Callahan, a former member of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_7.html" title="Team 7">Team 7</a>. Team 7's superiors, the intelligence agency <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Operations_e2bd.html" title="International Operations">International Operations</a> exposed the team to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen-Active_957c.html#Gen-Active_humans" title="Gen-Active">Gen-Factor</a>, a substance that endowed the team with superhuman powers. The survivors from this experiment were codenamed Gen12. I.O. hoped to use them as weapons, but Team 7 turned out to have a will of their own. A couple of years later, I.O. decided that Team 7's children could have inherited their fathers' powers and if they could raise them from childhood, they could ensure their obedience. Most Team 7 members went into hiding with their children. Stephen and his family tried to escape as well, but I.O.'s troops caught up with them in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> and shot and killed Rachel; Stephen's wife. They then shot Stephen and took Nicole and her brother <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threshold_%28Wildstorm%29_4596.html" title="Threshold (Wildstorm)">Threshold</a> with them. Years later Stephen turned up alive, saying that the bullet grazed him and I.O. imprisoned him for years.</p>
<p>Witness to her parents death at the hands of the Black Razors (a group of highly skilled I.O. soldiers), at a very young age definitely changed Nicole Callahan's life. Subsequently, I.O. took in Nicole and her brother, Matthew, to be brainwashed and trained as agents for the organization, but Nicole was always more interested in her own pleasure than obeying orders. Seeing their parents die had damaged both their minds though; Matthew had become a psychopath and Nicole was obsessed with controlling people. During her time with I.O., she was also sexually abused by a Project: Genesis guard named Menlove, further damaging Nicole.</p>

An early portrayal of Bliss.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nicole and Matthew were assigned to Project: Genesis under <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivana_Baiul_08b8.html" title="Ivana Baiul">Ivana Baiul</a> to act as operatives, but Nicole, now calling herself Bliss, was more interested in fooling around with guards and prisoners. When <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen%C2%B9%C2%B3.html" title="Gen¹³">Gen¹³</a> escaped the project, she tried to seduce Gen¹³-member <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnout_%28comics%29.html" title="Burnout (comics)">Burnout</a> rather than fight him. This allowed Gen¹³ member <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Rainmaker_4236.html" title="Sarah Rainmaker">Rainmaker</a> to take her hostage and use her against Matthew, now calling himself Threshold. Project: Genesis was aborted and Baiul fled with Matthew, Nicole and several subjects of the project. Baiul made Cabalitto Island their new base, a place that Nicole hated, because there were no shops or any social activities. She left the island and visited Burnout and Gen¹³ in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, much to the displeasure of Rainmaker. Nicole flirted with Burnout and assisted Gen¹³ in a fight with the Vatican's superpowered humans. She left the group on friendly (if not fully trusted) terms.</p>
<p>Returning to Cabalitto Island, Ivana had trained the Project: Genesis subjects she had taken as <a href="../../../d/v/8/DV8_7ec5.html" title="DV8">DV8</a>. Ivana forced an implanted tracking device on her, using member <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copycat_%28Wildstorm%29_54bc.html" title="Copycat (Wildstorm)">Copycat</a> to do so, but in the process a reptilian intelligence, one of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kindred_%28comics%29.html" title="Kindred (comics)">Kindred</a>, that had been possessing Copycat entered Nicole's mind. Bliss caused Copycat's mind to fragment without anybody knowing. Nicole became a member of DV8 and due to her experience, she had some authority over the other members, acting as field leader whenever Threshold was unavailable. On one of these missions, she met Menlove again and killed him. Nicole tried to control the male members of her team with her powers and sex, even her brother and killed innocent men she had seduced under control of the reptilic intelligence inside her.</p>
<p>When Ivana took control over I.O., she wanted Bliss to run DV8 for her. Bliss didn't agree; she didn't want a deskjob, but enjoyed field work. Soon Threshold turned on the team and wounded Ivana, DV8 fought Threshold off and he disappeared. Now I.O. agent Frank Colby took responsibility for the team and Bliss managed to remain a field agent as she wished.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Bliss started to manipulate DV8 member <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evo_%28Wildstorm%29_dc47.html" title="Evo (Wildstorm)">Evo</a>, pretending to be the only one who cared about him. During this time ex-DV8-members <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frostbite_%28Wildstorm%29_8258.html" title="Frostbite (Wildstorm)">Frostbite</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sublime_%28Wildstorm%29_61e9.html" title="Sublime (Wildstorm)">Sublime</a> had joined up with Stephen Callahan, who had come out of hiding. During one dinner, Stephen revealed to them that Nicole had more potential than Threshold, being able to read and speak at 3 months old. Around the same time Copycat remembered what Bliss did to her and she informed her teammate <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_%28Wildstorm%29_7880.html" title="Freestyle (Wildstorm)">Freestyle</a>, but Bliss imprisoned them both. Sublime, Frostbite and Callahan entered I.O. and freed Copycat and Freestyle. They then fought Bliss, who now displayed telepathy on a level that even Threshold never had and Stephen managed to free his daughter from the possessing entity. Callahan and DV8 then fought I.O. and escaped.</p>
<p>Bliss left with Evo. They went to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> where Bliss started to built her own crime syndicate, using Evo, who had become infatuated with her, as her enforcer. Eventually she sacrificed Evo as a scapegoat. Evo was arrested for the murder of an <a href="../../../n/y/p/NYPD_fb97.html" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> police officer and sent to the Purgatory Max prison for super beings in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, leaving Bliss alone, but with her powers she began to build herself a powerbase in New York.</p>

<p>Bliss' main power is the ability to stimulate a person's neural system to an incredible state of ecstasy or agony, even to the point of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a>. She also possesses some psionic powers such as advanced telepathy and minor telekinesis but only uses them on rare occasions. Her natural ability as a seductress is usually the only power Bliss ever needs.</p>
