<p>Several theories have been advanced as to why the profession of musician is a popular one for the blind. There has long been a folk belief that blind people can hear better than sighted people, and that therefore the blind have an advantage when performing music. Some recent studies have supported this belief. For example, research has shown that blind musicians are more likely to have <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_pitch.html" title="Perfect pitch">perfect pitch</a> than sighted musicians <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn158" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn158" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Similarly, a paper published in <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28journal%29.html" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> in 2004 found that people born blind or who went blind early in childhood were better able to recognize variations in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28music%29.html" title="Pitch (music)">pitch</a> than were sighted people. People who went blind later in life had no advantage over those who could still see. The research team believed that this suggested differences in early <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> development between those with sight and those who lost their sight in their early years. Specifically, they thought that in those blind from childhood the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_cortex.html" title="Visual cortex">visual cortex</a>, usually used for processing visual images, might be used for processing [sound] and other sensory input instead.<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040712/pf/040712-9_pf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040712/pf/040712-9_pf.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> People who are not blind, however, can, using certain software and activities can improve their ear and even attune it to perfect pitch.</p>
<p>Another theory points to the fact that blind people often have limited employment opportunities, in part because many jobs are difficult to do without sight, and in part because the blind often experience discrimination which prevents them from working at those jobs which they could perform. In many cultures, musical performance is one of the few jobs perceived as an acceptable profession for the blind. Thus, according to this theory, blind people have often turned to music because it has been one of the few ways in which they could earn a living. <a href="http://www.icevi.org/publications/ICEVI-WC2002/papers/09-topic/09-quatraro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icevi.org/publications/ICEVI-WC2002/papers/09-topic/09-quatraro.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>These theories are not mutually exclusive, of course: both biological and social factors may be responsible for blind people choosing to become musicians. Indeed, they may reinforce each other. The fact that blind people are perceived as musically talented means that blind children are often encouraged to take up music. This, in turn, adds to the number of blind musicians, which adds to the perception that blind people are musically talented, and so on.</p>

<p>Historically, many blind musicians, including some of the most famous, have performed without the benefit of formal instruction, since such instruction relies extensively on written musical notation. However, today there are many resources available for blind musicians who wish to learn Western <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_theory.html" title="Music theory">music theory</a> and classical notation. <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Braille_5cac.html" title="Louis Braille">Louis Braille</a>, the man who created the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braille.html" title="Braille">braille</a> alphabet for the blind, also created a system of classical notation for the blind called <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braille_music.html" title="Braille music">Braille music</a>. This system allows the blind to read and write music just as the sighted do. The largest collection of Braille musical scores is located at the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a>.<a href="http://www.blindmusicstudent.org/facts.htm#some_facts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blindmusicstudent.org/facts.htm#some_facts" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Outside the U.S., the largest collection of braille music scores is stored at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library_for_the_Blind_a15c.html" title="National Library for the Blind">National Library for the Blind</a> in England. <a href="http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&amp;menu=130002&amp;page_id=50" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&amp;menu=130002&amp;page_id=50" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">Computer</a> technology and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> make it possible in theory for blind musicians to be more independent in composing and studying music. In practice, however, most programs rely on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_user_interface.html" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interfaces</a>, which are difficult for the blind to <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigate.html" title="Navigate">navigate</a>. There has been some progress in creating screen-reading interfaces for the blind, especially for the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> operating system. <a href="http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_guiding_blind/" class="external autonumber" title="http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_guiding_blind/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today there are also several organizations devoted to the support of blind musicians. The National Resource Center for Blind Musicians, located in Connecticut, has an extensive website. <a href="http://www.blindmusicstudent.org/facts.htm#common_situations" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blindmusicstudent.org/facts.htm#common_situations" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> The Music Education Network for the Visually Impaired is a group of students, parents, teachers, and professionals devoted to musical education for the blind. <a href="http://menvi.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://menvi.org/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>No-C-Notes provides an alternative to Braille music notation with its audio music reading transcription method for those with visual impairement or reading disability. <a href="http://www.no-c-notes.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.no-c-notes.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>

<p>The image of the blind musician is an important touchstone in many cultures, even where the influence of the blind on music has been limited. The idea of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>, the blind poet, for example, has had a long existence in Western tradition, even though its basis in truth is uncertain. Similarly, in his book <i>Singer of Tales</i>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Lord_9b0c.html" title="Albert Lord">Albert Lord</a> explains that in <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> he found many stories of blind musicians, but few current musicians who were actually blind. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-674-00283-0</a> Natalie Kononenko had a similar experience in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, though one Turkish musician of great talent, Ashik Veysel was in fact blind. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7656-0144-3</a></p>
<p>The popularity of the idea of the blind musician has inspired several artists. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Singer_Sargent_18e2.html" title="John Singer Sargent">John Singer Sargent</a> painted a 1912 canvas based on this theme.<a href="http://www.jssgallery.org/Paintings/The_Blind_Musicians.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jssgallery.org/Paintings/The_Blind_Musicians.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georges_de_la_Tour_4aa5.html" title="Georges de la Tour">Georges de la Tour</a> has a whole series of paintings devoted to blind musicians. <a href="http://www.adetocqueville.com/cgi-binloc/searchTTC.cgi?displayZop+448" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adetocqueville.com/cgi-binloc/searchTTC.cgi?displayZop+448" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>Though the idea of blind musicians may be even more prevalent than their actuality, it remains true that at many points in history and in many different cultures, blind musicians, individually or as a group, have made important contributions to the development of music. Some of these contributions are discussed below.</p>

<p>Court musician was a traditional profession for the blind in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> in antiquity. The first musician mentioned in Chinese sources, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi_Kuang_45a1.html" title="Shi Kuang">Shi Kuang</a>, was a blind performer in the 6th century BC. The Guilds of Blind Musicians and Fortune-Tellers which were still around in China during the middle of the 20th century, claimed to have existed as far back as 200 BC. More recently, groups of blind buskers have continued to perform in Zuoquan County, and presumably in other areas as well.</p>
<p>One of the most popular musical works in China, "Erquan Yingyue (Moon Reflected in the Second Spring)", was composed in the first half of the 20th century by Hua Yanjun, better known as "Blind Ah Bing." <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/ped/whp/histeduc/mmiles/bpt01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/ped/whp/histeduc/mmiles/bpt01.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/20/content_273460.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/20/content_273460.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_musicians.html" title="Edit section: Kobzars of Ukraine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kobzars of Ukraine</span></h2>
<p>There is a very strong tradition of blind minstrelsy in <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> known as <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobzarstvo.html" title="Kobzarstvo">Kobzarstvo</a>. At least from 1800 to 1930—and probably well before that as well—the majority of <a href="../../../i/t/i/Itinerant.html" title="Itinerant">itinerant</a> musicians in Ukraine were blind. Music was part of the social-welfare system. Those who could not work at other occupations could be apprenticed to become professional bards often referred to as kobzars (both bandura and lira players could be referred to by this title). These wandering blind minstrels were divided into two groups—<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandurist.html" title="Bandurist">bandurists</a>, or <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobzar.html" title="Kobzar">kobzars</a> who played <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandura.html" title="Bandura">bandura</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/r/Lirnyk.html" title="Lirnyk">lirnyks</a>, who played the lira, which was a crank-driven <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurdy-gurdy.html" title="Hurdy-gurdy">hurdy-gurdy</a>.</p>
<p>The kobzars were an important part of oral tradition in Ukraine. According to the ethnographer P. Zhytetsky (in Natalie Kononenko in <i>Ukrainian Minstrels: And the Blind Shall Sing</i>,<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7656-0144-3</a>) kobzars were thought to have been initially sighted <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossack.html" title="Cossack">Cossacks</a>, who were especially associated with <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_poetry.html" title="Epic poetry">epic</a> songs, or <a href="../../../d/u/m/Duma.html" title="Duma">dumas</a>. Kononenko states that lirnyky, on the other hand, were blind church singers organized into guilds who sang religious songs and were often associated with <a href="../../../b/e/g/Beggars.html" title="Beggars">beggars</a>. By the middle of the 19th century, the two groups had merged; both sang many different types of songs, all were organized into the guilds, and all were blind.</p>

<p>The kobzars have a central place in the national identity of Ukraine. Folklorist Izmail Sreznevskyi argued that the initial Cossack bandurist were actual witnesses of the great battles about which they sang. The image of warrior-bards singing <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_epic.html" title="National epic">epics</a> was quite popular, and there became a tradition that the great ancient singers were veterans valorously blinded in combat. This in turn led to the belief that the kobzar tradition had greatly weakened in the 19th century, since the traditional songs were now sung by people who were more like beggars than like warriors. Kononenko points out that there is no factual basis for this image, and her research showed that the minstrel tradition was still very strong and creative up until the 1930s.</p>
<p>Because the art of the kobzars was language secific and included themes dealing with historic subjects of Ukraine's past, the blind singers were often the focus of persecution by occupying powers, according to researcher Mikhailo Khay. This persecution reached a height under <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> in the 1930s, when many forms of Ukrainian cultural expression were crushed by the Internationalist Commuinist government of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Numerous sources claim that there was a massacre of blind musicians during this period, though this has not been confirmed, and most details of the incident (including year, place, and method of execution) are disputed. It is fairly clear, however, that by the end of the 30's traditional blind minstrelsy had largely vanished. Today the traditional repertoire of the kobzars is played by sighted, educated performers. During her research in Ukraine, Kononenko found only one blind folk performer of the old songs, a man named Pavlo Suprun.</p>

The most famous of these blind musicians, Carolan, is still well known for his composition, "Carolan's Concerto." <a href="http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/culture/music/dance/music.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/culture/music/dance/music.shtm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

<p>In 19th century <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> tuners were frequently blind. The first blind <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_tuner.html" title="Piano tuner">piano tuner</a> is thought to be Claude Montal, who taught himself how to tune a piano while studying at L'Institution Nationale des Jeunes Aveugles in 1830. At first Montal's teachers were skeptical, doubting that a blind man could actually perform the necessary mechanical tasks. Montal's skill was undeniable, however, and he was soon asked to teach classes in tuning to his fellow students. Eventually, he also overcame public <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a>, and landed several prestigious jobs as a tuner for professors and professional musicians. Montal's success paved the way for other blind tuners, both in France and in England, where Montal's example and teaching methods were adopted by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Armitage_853e.html" title="Thomas Armitage">Thomas Rhodes Armitage</a>. Today the image of the blind piano tuner is so engrained that people in England sometimes express surprise when they encounter a piano tuner who can see. <a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/history/piano-tuner-history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uk-piano.org/history/piano-tuner-history.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> An organization of blind piano tuners remains active in Britain. <a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/abpt/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uk-piano.org/abpt/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>

<p>Blind musicians have made an enormous contribution to American popular music. This is particularly true in <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospel</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and other predominantly <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> forms — perhaps because <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> added to their disability made it doubly difficult for black blind people to find other employment. In any case, the achievement of blind African-Americans in music is extensive. The first recorded gospel <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctified.html" title="Sanctified">Sanctified</a> <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrelhouse.html" title="Barrelhouse">barrelhouse</a> piano player, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Dranes_6cb1.html" title="Arizona Dranes">Arizona Dranes</a>, was blind, as was <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a>, one of the most important figures in the creation of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul music</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Tatum_57b0.html" title="Art Tatum">Art Tatum</a>, commonly cited as the greatest jazz pianist of all time, was also blind. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wonder_c1f2.html" title="Stevie Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> is probably the most successful blind American musician.</p>
<p>But blind black musicians are still most strongly associated with the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_blues.html" title="Country blues">country blues</a>. The first successful male country blues performer, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson_ba34.html" title="Blind Lemon Jefferson">Blind Lemon Jefferson</a> was blind, and so were many other country bluesmen, including <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Willie_McTell_a466.html" title="Blind Willie McTell">Blind Willie McTell</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Willie_Johnson_fe57.html" title="Blind Willie Johnson">Blind Willie Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Terry_aacb.html" title="Sonny Terry">Sonny Terry</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Boy_Fuller_0ed2.html" title="Blind Boy Fuller">Blind Boy Fuller</a>, to name only the best known. The figure of the black country bluesman became so iconic that when <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Lang_bfcd.html" title="Eddie Lang">Eddie Lang</a>, a white, sighted, jazz guitarist, wanted to choose a black pseudonym for purposes of recording blues records with <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonnie_Johnson_a87a.html" title="Lonnie Johnson">Lonnie Johnson</a>, he naturally settled on <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Willie_Dunn_9c39.html" title="Blind Willie Dunn">Blind Willie Dunn</a>. <a href="http://www.redhotjazz.com/dunnjohnson.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redhotjazz.com/dunnjohnson.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
