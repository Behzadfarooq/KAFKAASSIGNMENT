<h2><span class="mw-headline">Elementary particle collisions</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>This first is that black holes tend to merge when they meet. So a collection of black-hole electrons would be expected to become one big black hole. Also, an electron-positron collision would be expected to produce a larger neutral black hole instead of two photons as is observed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>How would electrons collide, causing problems for this theory? Wouldn't they repel when they were close enough so that they never 'actually' collided, just got close enough for the force to be overwhelming and drive them apart? No ideas on electron--positron collision just yet, but I think electron--electron never happens... right?</p>
<p>Excuse any ignorance in this question; I'm just in introductory electricity and magnetism, with no quantum or black hole physics background besides popsci books. Thanks!</p>
<p>My earlier comment is now being replaced because it did not include enough information. You are correct with your conclusion that same charge electron collisions do not happen. When the electron is analysed as a K-N black hole we find that black hole inertial frame dragging is so extreme that frame dragging reaches light velocity (in the ergosphere region). With this condition an electromagnetic standing wave (moving in a direction opposite to the black hole's rotation) will be stationary when it is observed from a fixed distance. It is confined due to the inertial frame spin. It will appear to rotate only when a time desynchronization effect is caused by a distance change between an observer and the black hole. This rotation can explain the electron matter wavelength (deBroglie wavelength) effect.</p>
<p>When an electron-positron collision event happens, the (opposite) inertial frame dragging effects from the two particles are added (canceled) so that the standing electromagnetic waves are no longer confined. Two packets of electromagnetic wave energy (photons) are then released with opposite linear momentum.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that this hypothetical electron annihilation sequence is closer to being correct than any other that does not include the electron analyzed as a K-N black hole.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 20:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take that back. Sidharth seems to be math-literate, but the abstracts to his papers make outrageous claims. His most popular paper has an impressive 83 citations on scholars.google.com, but closer examination shows that all but about seven of these citations are from other papers he's written. So between outrageous claims and lack of serious citations, I am suspicous of Sidharth. A more credible reference is needed. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:01, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">speculative physics</span></h2>
<p>I am concerned about the Pair Creation part of this article. It seems to be based on the speculations of Don Stevens, which is original research and not appropriate for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There is a legitimate speculation that the electron is a black hole, and which can and should be presented here. For the moment I will just add in ASAP the counter-arguments to the argument that electrons are minature black holes, so as to get some NPOV into it. However, I am both sincere and concerned that this article is not appropriate in its current form. (Maybe all that is needed is to remove Don's research from this.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:55, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is my understanding that the contents of this article reflect the thinking of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Greene_e15e.html" title="Brian Greene">Brian Greene</a>, a pre-eminant physicist, and not the original research of Don Stevens. But I don't know, I have not verified this or actually read chapter 13 or whatever of Brian Greene's book. If this stuff is Don Stevens original research, I'll VfD it in a heartbeat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also removed the comments about Hawking radiation etc. These objections are presumably covered in the micro-black-hole article. Again, the logic here is to report on an interesting speculation of Brian Greene, rather than critique Greene's ability to do rational physics. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:43, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The logic presented is something that Don tried to present to me privately earlier, and has been hyping in the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_dilation_dab9.html" title="Talk:Time dilation">Talk:time_dilation</a> page and a few others. My reading of his writings is that Brian Greene is his inspiration for this stuff, not it's source. My advice is to do your homework and check out the reference(s).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also have run across this speculation many times before. It is not unique to Brian Greene at all, and my suspiscion is that he is just reporting the work of others in his book. It is actually something on which a good Wikipedia article could be written, but this is not it. In the meantime, the objections that I listed are not covered in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micro_black_holes.html" title="Micro black holes">micro black holes</a> article. In fact Hawking radiation is only alluded to, and I also suspect that their idea of a "micro" back holes is something that can be as massive as a mountain if not an asteroid. So I will restore the objections section. (Brian Greene or not, I honestly feel that the objections should be listed. This should be balanced coverage of the topic, not the Brian Greene fan page. I also do not see reporting the problems with a view like this as being demeaning to the proponents.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also be advised that I have been giving serious consideration to VfD-ing this article myself on the basis on its being primarlly Don Steven's original research. If nothing else Brian Greene knows better than to use the second as a value for balancing the units in an equation, as is also done in the article. That may look scientific, but it is nothing more than a giant fudge factor, and therefore quite <i>un</i>scientific. In any case, since you are on the same page as me regarding whether this should be VfD-ed I will leave the research and the decision up to you for now. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:20, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Give Don a week or two to provide a reply and if something accurate is not forthcoming, then VfD it. I am very disappointed. I got suckered because of the combo of a famous name and an interesting idea. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:47, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. You did get suckered. Be aware that there is nothing wrong with Don's underlying thesis, which is that the electron is a gravitationally self-contained particle. For him, the electron as possibly being a black hole in confirmation of this view. So far, so good, but better people than him have tried to solve this riddle and have come up empty. Certainly if anything as simple as what Don is proposing was correct, then it would have been found and analyzed a long time ago.</dd>
<dd>I am willing to be patient as long as you are with me in not tolerating the b.s. I know where Don is coming from and even have some sympathy for him, but this really is the kind of thing that is behind the Wikipedia policy against original research. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:07, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gentlemen, Linas and Ems&#160;: I Apologise for causing misunderstandings. My desire was to stimulate the thinking of other persons with some of my speculations. I believe the math can be defended but I am no match for Ems. If he says this is not right, I will accept this judgement until I can evaluate it further. Delete the article, accept my apology, but don't stop thinking of the electron as a black hole. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a></p>

<dd>Don, even if you could defend your math, it would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and inappropriate for WP. If you truly have interest in this topic,then come up with the precise JA Wheeler reference, and a reference for Eddingon as well, if possible. These ref's may be in Greene's book. Personally, I think the idea is fascinating, but one needs both historical and intellectual accuracy to make it on WP. Based on your comment, I deleted the entire pair-creation section. The section labelled "speculation" contains a list of (mostly?) traditional speculative questions that can be found in traditional books on gravitation. If these could be wikilinked to appropriate WP articles, that would be great. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 16:15, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Beyond that, I will give you one piece of friendly advice: Stick to your original line of the electron being gravitationally self-contained. This electron black-hole business is only one possibility in that regard, and not one that I personally credit.

<p>Ems - Three factors must be applied to the Planck mass to obtain the electron mass value. The first factor is (1/2). The second factor is the square root of (2/3). The third factor is a dimensionless ratio based on a proposed "time dilation limit". The time dilation limit is defined as the square root of (3/2), times (1/ 2 pi) times Planck time (expressed in some time unit) divided by the same time unit. If Planck time is expressed in time units of .0001 Martian days then we must divide by .0001 Martian days in order to obtain a dimensionless ratio. The square root of the "time dilation limit" is the required "third factor". This square root of the limit, is close to 1.025x10 exponent-22. This is usually thought of as seconds per second but could equally be hours per hour or Martian days per Martian day. It is required to be a dimensionless ratio. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a></p>

<dd>The Plank time as expressed in seconds is a different number than the Plank time as expressed in hours or picoseconds.

<p>I think this article is possibly legit, since it does describe the speculation of real theoretical physicists. However, the last section--and in particular the last sentence--sum up what most physicists would think about this idea: it's cute, but there are more or less insurmountable problems with it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Second paragraph of intro</span></h2>
<p>I can't even begin to figure out what this is supposed to mean. It's made clear <i>why</i> the electron being a black hole is appealing from the reasons given. The electron being a black hole would require a unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, but doesn't <i>help</i> unify the two. It also doesn't seem to reduce the parameters in the standard model--why would mini black holes have a particular mass? (Another parameter?) What are the mu and the tau--black holes also? (FYI, the <a href="../../../m/u/o/Muon.html" title="Muon">muon</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tauon.html" title="Tauon">tauon</a> have finite lifetimes, but <b>do not</b> decay in the manner a black hole would.) Finally, the last sentence--"a speculative, principles-based approach" doesn't seem to mean anything, and implies things that aren't true. So can someone explain to me what's going on? Otherwise I will do my best to rewrite the paragraph that justifies the idea is well as possible without being unclear or inaccurate. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 08:10, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>SCZenz: You will also want to see Brian Greene's book "The Fabric Of The Cosmos", 2004. On page 358 he said one goal of string theory is to explain why the electron "weighs in at --(about 10 exp-23) times the Planck mass". On page 351; if spacetime has a grid structure, " there would be no such thing as a distance shorter than the Planck length or a duration shorter than the Planck time". It appears that Greene expected to define a relationship between the Planck mass and the electron mass. This relationship is defined by three factors. The first factor is (1/2) because a maximum energy photon will produce two particles. The second factor is the square root of (2/3) due to the photon energy limit. The remaining factor is a time dilation ratio, equal to 2 pi times Planck length times the square root of (3/2), divided by (0.5) times electron Compton wavelength. This factor is approximately 1.025x10 exp -22 to one.</p>

<p>I have read <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Greene_e15e.html" title="Brian Greene">Brian Greene</a>'s <i>The Elegant Universe</i>, and I have a few comments regarding this issue:</p>
<ul>

<li>He does not discuss electrons specifically--in fact, his black holes become <i>massless</i> particles.</li>
<li>Although he states that this research provides a "a direct, concrete, and quantitatively unassailable connections between black holes and elementary particles," the connection is in a rather limited case (maximally charged black holes). Greene does not define what the overall nature of this "connection" might be, probably because nobody knows yet. (<a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">String theory</a> research into such questions is, no doubt, ongoing.)</li>

Cause that's what happens for compactification; the extra dimensions just collapse and curl up; and maybe Greene is just saying that the "compactified dimensions are just like a black hole", just to put things in layman's terms? If so, then most string theorists will probably agree, as that's basic <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaluza-Klein_b6e1.html" title="Kaluza-Klein">Kaluza-Klein</a> orthodoxy.

<p>The followiig reply is my opinion. I respect other writers who have a different opinion.-- Mention of the Planck mass or Planck energy is appropriate. When a photon has the large energy value, equivalent to (2/3) exponent 1/2, times the Planck mass energy, a limit (maximum) energy density condition is reached. At this level, photon energy can be clearly specified by either the Planck constant and light velocity or the gravitational constant and light velocity. This indicates that no photon can have energy as large as the Planck energy. A fundamental mass particle is expected to have mass energy that relates to 1/2 of the upper limit photon energy. The Planck mass then has only an indirect relationship to a realistic particle mass (or electron mass) value.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 18:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One type of black hole electron interaction can be explained in a direct manner. This is the momentum exchange between an electron and a photon. When a photon passes close to an electron gravitational field, its path is deflected. The electron has a velocity change (kinetic energy change) while the photon has a compensating red shift (or blue shift) change.</p>
<p>When the extremal K-N black hole concept is incorporated, then the only stable state is the minimum mass that is consistant with a unit charge. The black hole electron can absorb a photon temporarily but when it picks up mass, it is unstable and will decay to the stable (extremal) state by radiating excess energy away. In a specific special case it may radiate energy in an electron-positron pair. -- <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 13:57, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Dirac-Kerr electron paper by A. Burinskii (referenced in the article) is directed at the possibility that the electron is a black hole. A quote from page 1 follows:"On the other hand, the treatment of the Kerr-Newman solution as a model of electron have been considered many times -- after the well known Carter remark -- that the Kerr-Newman solution has gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 as that of the Dirac electron". And later: "The Kerr solution gives us a natural description of spinning particle with gravity, and moreover, it hints us at the relation to electron by the double gyromagnetic ratio --".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit needed</span></h2>
<p>The Gravitational radius of an electron shown (10 exp -15 m) is misleading because the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is defined as its "gravitational radius".(See page 820 of book Gravitation by Misner, Thorne &amp; Wheeler.) The gravitational photon capture radius of a black hole is 3Gm/c squared. (See page 677 of book Gravitation&#160;; The orbit of a photon in the equatorial plane of a black hole.) This radius is useful when the electron critical energy density required for collapse is analyzed.</p>
<p>We need to clarify or rename the "re" value. We should then add the black hole electron Schwarzschild radius and the gravitational photon capture radius values. ---<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 15:06, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The gravitational radius definition has been corrected: good work. The Bh electron article quality would be improved if an example is provided where the electron, defined as a K-N black hole, would explain an electron property that is not explained in any other way. The de Broglie electron wavelength property is a good choice. This wavelength property is only observable when the distance is changing between an observer and the electron. The K-N black hole can exhibit a stationary standing em wave that will not appear stationary when distance is changing; when the electron has relative velocity. This is a time desynchronization effect that is not easy to describe. I will offer assistance in writing about this but the article will be better served if additional writers participate. ---<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 15:36, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another electron property that can be explained only with the black hole model is the charge acceleration associated with angular momentum and magnetic moment. When the electron is analyzed as a thin superconducting ring the charge acceleration is (4 pi mc cubed) divided by (h). With gravitational collapse; with conserved angular momentum, the required acceleration can be sustained and can be stable. This may be more appropriate to include in the article.---<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonJStevens_9cb9.html" title="User:DonJStevens">DonJStevens</a> 17:04, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
