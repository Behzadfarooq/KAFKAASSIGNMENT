<p>Dominicans became known in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> early in their history as "Black friars", and their houses or even the districts where they lived were called "Blackfriars". In <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, quite apart from modern Dominican foundations, the name has survived with notable historical associations in several places. The London Blackfriars, which gave the name to a district and to a bridge over the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames.html" title="Thames">Thames</a>, was built in 1278,at the end of <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Street_fda1.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a> and the boundary of Ludgate. It stood on the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames.html" title="Thames">Thames</a> in the southwest corner of the city walls. The Apothecaries Hall stands on the site of the Guest House.</p>
<p>Two General Chapters of the Order, one in 1314 and one in 1335, were held in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfriars.html" title="Blackfriars">Blackfriars</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> was held in the Great Hall of the London <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfriars.html" title="Blackfriars">Blackfriars</a> Priory under <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_II_of_England_c4d9.html" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a> in 1311, under <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a> in 1471, under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> in 1523.

<p>The School Motto is Deus Scientiarum Dominus, "The Lord is an All-Knowing God"; (I Samuel, ii. 3) the opening words of an antiphon in the Office of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertus_Magnus_d8cd.html" title="Albertus Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a>.</p>
<p>Albert was born of the noble family of Bollstadt in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauingen.html" title="Lauingen">Lauingen</a> in <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swabia.html" title="Swabia">Swabia</a> in 1206. In 1244 he entered the Dominican Order. He became one of the most learned men of his time and founded the famous Dominican House of Studies at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> in 1245. His most renowned pupil was his fellow Dominican, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>.</p>
<p>In 1260 Albert was made Bishop of Ratisbon. He died in 1280, and was canonised and made a Doctor of the Universal Church by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XI_7042.html" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a> in 1931.</p>

<p>When Blessed <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juana_de_Aza_cdc4.html" title="Juana de Aza">Juana de Aza</a> (Mother of St Dominic) was pregnant with her second son around the year 1170, in rural Caleruega (in the north of Spain), she experienced a curious dream. In it she gave birth to a dog with a blazing torch in its mouth - signifying, so the legend goes, the sort of man her son, Dominic, would be - setting the world on fire with his dogged preaching of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> faith.</p>
<p>The legend may have been helped along by an early pun. Dominic means "the Lord's man", and in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> Dominicans are "Dominicani". The similar sounding words "Domini canes", however, mean "hounds of the Lord" - and so a long association between the Order and the canine species was begun!</p>
<p>The choice of "The Hounds" as a name for our Blackfriars sporting teams is neither accidental nor arbitrary, therefore. It is a name which grows out of the Order's seven centuries of tradition. It also has the merit of being uniquely our own.</p>
<p>It is a strong name without being excessively aggressive; it denotes relentless pursuit of a goal and yet a certain friendliness too. A hound is "man's best friend", of course. Just the same, we would advise sporting teams who come up against us in our sports gear to remember the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> adage, inscribed above a kennel in <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompeii.html" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>: "Cave canem!"</p>

<p>Blackfriars Priory School holds a unique position in <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Order_2f62.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominican</a> history as the only school founded by the Dominican Friars (Order of Preachers) in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The school started as a day school for boys in 1953, added a Boarding House in the 1960s, and included senior girls on its roll for a few years in the late 1970s. It has now returned to its origins as a day school for boys. Through the leadership of the Dominican Friars, Blackfriars has expanded and improved its facilities over the first fifty years, while still retaining ties and maintaining traditions set by its founding fathers.</p>

<p>Blackfriars was built on the property 'Comonella' which was purchased from the Lewis family by Fr Jerome O'Rorke, Prior of St Laurence's Priory. 'Comonella' is an Aboriginal name meaning 'come on fellow'. The house on the property was called St Catharine's after the wife of a previous owner of the property, Mr James Angus Johnson. Alterations, adaptation and additions to St Catharine's were supervised by Fr Bonaventure Leahy.</p>

<p>Archbishop Matthew Beovich blessed and opened Blackfriars Priory School on 25 January 1953. The school year commenced on 10 February 1953, with an enrolment of 52 boys in five classes. Fr Raymond Maher was appointed Headmaster, with Fr Francis Xavier Brown, Fr Alex Fitzpatrick, Fr Bonaventure Leahy, Fr Basil Predergast and Br Joseph Harnett making up the Dominican Community. John Robbins and John Haimes are acknowledged as the first boys to enter the Blackfriars gate on the first day of school. In 1953 the Science Block opened (later replaced by the Maher Building in 1975) and First expedition to the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outback.html" title="Outback">Outback</a> was conducted which later has become an annual tradition of many students, fathers and other members of the school community.</p>

<p>2003 was the launch of the Jubilee Year and the Opening and Blessing of the refurbished Chapel took place later in the year. Dr Paul Hine is the first non-priest headmaster in the history of Blackfriars. Dr Hine over saw an internal investigation that revealed sexual abuse within the school. A Blackfriar's Priory School teacher has been arrested for sexually assaulting five boys, aged between 12 and 16, over a 15 year period starting from 1975. <a href="http://www.mako.org.au/ausnews324.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mako.org.au/ausnews324.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mako.org.au/ausnews324.html</a>. After a 10 year alleged cover up, it has been revealed that a former bus driver, Brian Perkins, had been binding and sexaully assaulting intellectually disabled children that attended the school. He was also hired by the school either without a background check or despite the fact that he has prior convictions for child stealing. A judge is also on record as saying that Mr Perkins was a man showing a "Gross degree of emotional immaturity, it is clear that [he] would be a most unsuitable person to have charge of a child".
