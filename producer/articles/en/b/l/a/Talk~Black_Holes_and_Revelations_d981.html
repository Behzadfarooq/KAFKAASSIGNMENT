<li>erm, please refrain from calling the administrators 'nazis' please. The song, no matter how brilliant is happens to be (and let's face it, it is), is simply not notable enough in it's present form (as a non-single album track) for it's own seperate article <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarma_Llama_d13e.html" title="User:Karma Llama">Karma Llama</a> 23:24, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>At the risk of pissing off Radiohead fans with administrator attention, if this is the case then why the hell does Kid A get entries for every one of its songs? I think the existence of a song with a particular title is worth noting in Wikipedia, *as long as there is useful information in the article*.</p>

<p>I think the album art is very much in keeping with the Muse album art trend, and by that I mean it's dreadful. The album art for 'Showbiz', 'Absolution' and 'Black Holes and Revelations' all look dreadful, and they'll look even worse in the future. The art for 'Origin of Symmetry' is okay, if only because it's a little less pretentious. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrumnbach_041e.html" title="User:Drumnbach">Drumnbach</a> 10:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Er, everything Muse do is pretentious, that's why I love them so much ... Regardless, I dislike the album art - it's hardly accurate.

<dd>There's also the small issue that there are men sitting round a table. Why haven't their heads exploded from the low pressure, or the men at least collapsed from asphyxiation? Because it's mean to be surreal, that's why. I'm not sure the sky would appear blue with Mars's atmosphere either. Maybe Mars is meant to have spun out of orbit and is on a collision course with Earth? That would certainly be apocalyptic. Then our friends the horsemen could be used to explain this imminent disaster. Makes just as much sense as people's souls casting shadows on the ground, to be honest. Erm. What I meant to say was that this page is for discussing changes to the BHAR article, not for discussion of the album. Any further discussion should be taken to the forums. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 13:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The album art is credited to "the men of mystery"-i presume this is storm etc</p>

<dd>iTunes says its by Storm, the album itself says the men of mystery. Perhaps iTunes just assumed, because the last album was done by him?</dd>

<p>im 99% sure that its a storm album sleeve hey hold on, it says in the description that theres 4 horses on the table, but i only see 3, 2 white, one brown at the right side of the table explanation?</p>

<dd>I would. Of all the professional reviews I have seen, none put an accent on the e. It seems to me whoever leaked it thought they were real good at French. They're not. Although it just occurred to me that the French word is actually spelt probl√©matique. I guess nobody said it was French though, indeed nobody said it had an accent on the e. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 15:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it's not notable. Most albums get leaked prior to release. This one was leaked less than three weeks prior to sale of the first CDs. The date is unverifiable, it can't be linked to and therefore not cited. The Muse management haven't made any public statement which might make this particular leak somehow noteworthy.

<p>Should this article be called "Black Holes <b>&amp;</b> Revelations"? That is what it says on the album cover. The iTunes Music Store says "Black Holes <b>and</b> Revelations" which looks more correct than "And".

<dd>I think we should take that with a grain of salt until at least the Japanese version comes out on the 28th, when someone gets to confirm up front how it's written. Isn't there a problem for MediaWiki software using ampersands in titles, anyway? --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETene_aa9c.html" title="User:Tene">Tene</a> 01:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, only on MuseWiki&#160;;). Tom Kirk has spelt it Black Holes And Revelations several times. However, if it is written with an ampersand on the cover, I would assume it flexible and use lowercase "and" per Wikipedia naming conventions. The ampersand is simply an abbreviation of the word "and" anyway, and the catalog registration will use the word "AND". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 16:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The album notes <b>do</b> contain writing credits, it <b>clearly</b> states on the last page 'Songs by Matthew Bellamy'.

<p><i>The suppoedly Martian imagery is incorrect on technical grounds, however, because</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>The sky is blue. Blue sky on Earth results from Rayleigh scattering of light by dust particles in the atmosphere. On Mars, the sky is pink due to dust comprising iron compounds suspended in the atmosphere.</i></li>
<li><i>The Earth and Moon in the sky are far too large for realism; Mars appears as a small, reddish point in Earth's night sky, and there is no reason to suspect that Earth would appear much larger from Mars.</i></li>

<li>I vote for deleting it. It's hardly encyclopedic information. Besides, give the cover artist some artistic license. I mean, you might as well criticise the Sgt.
