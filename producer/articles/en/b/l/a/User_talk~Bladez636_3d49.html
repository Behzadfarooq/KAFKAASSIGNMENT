<p>I dont know by that with 065 but that is the only function I could list off the top of my head.</p>
<p>You just remembered that? For example, Brittish food is known to be almost uneatable (no ofense, in case you're brittish), so this cousin could make awful food that no one can eat.--<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidasminus_0fe1.html" title="User:Midasminus">Midasminus</a> 18:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im not british but I saw a fan made experiment on Deviantart called chef (063) who she is a pink version of 062 and I thought it could qualify as 065 since 063 is taken by Pufferizer and chef was made before Leroy and Stitch and is non official.<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladez636_3b46.html" title="User:Bladez636">Bladez636</a></p>

<p>I will add drawings to my list they are 100% mine and they will be public domains (of course) or is there something against this as usual.<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladez636_3b46.html" title="User:Bladez636">Bladez636</a></p>
<p>I don't think so, but one tip: don't leave messages to other Wikipedians in your discussion page, but theirs, because they might don't bother reading it (I sometimes do, but that's just because I'm suppost to be doing my homework right now).--<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidasminus_0fe1.html" title="User:Midasminus">Midasminus</a> 11:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>By I dont think so do you mean there isnt anything against it or there are things against it.</p>
<p>I mean I think it's okay to you to put your own images, cause some wikipedians have their photos in their user pages, this must be the same.</p>
<p>OK thats clearer but could you tell me how to upload images and also on my sandbox page could I use your 418 description<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladez636_3b46.html" title="User:Bladez636">Bladez636</a></p>
<p>Yeah you can, thanks for asking. But about upload images, I'm like you, have no idea, but listen; Check some wikipedians that uploaded images (in every image page it's said the user that uploaded it) and ask them in their talk pages.</p>

<p>In the Talk page on List of Experiments in Lilo &amp; Stitch, you asked about how to upload images.
