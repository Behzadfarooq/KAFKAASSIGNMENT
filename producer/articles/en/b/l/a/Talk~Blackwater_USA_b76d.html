<p>before anybody makes anymore changes concerning mercenary and contractors, put down on this page why it should be one or the other. I personally believe they are more like mercenaries and in the traditional sense of the word, they are mercenaries but they are referred to as contractors.</p>
<p>Perhaps we'll jsut call them contractors and put a note saying that while they are called contractors, they are mercenaries or something like that.<a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubbleboys_5847.html" title="User:Bubbleboys">Bubbleboys</a> 22:08, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>they are mercenaries and they are contractors in both senses they are mercenaries because they have units that are paid and combat trained that go in "battle" (some even died in iraq) and they're contractors because they are contracted out by the gov't to do other tasks like logistics/integrated communications stc. they are also able to contract out themselves hopefully this will help you with your disagrement also check out their website [www.blackwaterusa.com]</p>
<p>errm, can someone add more relating to there new found role in helping out with the NO disaster as mentioned here <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/091005A.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/091005A.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/091005A.shtml</a> (very biased) and on there homepage <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com" class="external free" title="http://www.blackwaterusa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackwaterusa.com</a></p>

<p>My father works for the company, so i had the pleasure of touring the grounds. they are trained to protect highly visible VIP's, not "attack" front line enemy troops. This article has a lot of bias, but even bias has its citable sources. Ill see if i can get some good info from my father and maybe hellp make this article betterSponge1354 02:22, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A Mercenary is - Concerning a legal definition of mercenary, the Special Rapporteur's interim report to the General Assembly (A/55/334) provides information on, inter alia: mercenary. The report notes that the currently accepted meaning or use of the term primarily focusses on professional services that are paid to recruit soldiers to intervene in an armed conflict in a country other than their own. So before anyone tries to merge "contractors" with "mercenaries" there should be careful discussion on what services that company, who would be lumped into that category, has provided. SCG International Risk, for example, works only for the US Government and private US corporations.Ghostscg 00:56, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1 Blackwater training centre</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Blackwater training centre is a private security company that specialises in training security personnel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1.1 General</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Founded in 1997 by former US Navy Seal and current CEO Erik Prince the purpose of backwater is to provide additional training to civil and military security personnel as opposed to providing complete security training for a recruit or novice. located in North Carolina Blackwater is the largest training facility in the world at an astonishing 6000 acres with more than 20 target Rangers equipped with computerised target movement systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1.2 Facilities</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The more than 20 target ranges include the world's only privately owned 1200 yard firing range Forsyth rifle training and can be concrete reinforced for 50 calibre or Gatling gun training and is often performed from the side of the recreation helicopter. There is also the "reactive steel" firing range. This range provides pop-up steel plate targets which can be configured to appear in a variety of sequences and timings in day and night scenarios.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the largest firing ranges is the "are you ready high school" contains Hall's, classrooms, mannequins of students and hostile targets for critical incident training that is primarily themed on a high school shooting scenario. The high school consists of video and audio recording for post exercise evaluation as well as moving walls for a variety of floor plans to provide diverse training that forces the students to adapt their skills.</dd>

<p>Someone managed to claim that <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethesda_Softworks_8304.html" title="Bethesda Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a> stooped so low as to include contemporary political satire in their fantasy game <a href="../../../o/b/l/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV%7E_Oblivion_eb46.html" title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion">Oblivion</a>. In this game, there is a mercenary company named the Blackwood Company which pursue unethical acts. What the author failed to realise, is that the company is named after the region in the game in which they base their operations, the Blackwood forest. The fictional world of this forest precedes Blackwater USA by three years. <a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 23:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Blackwater organisation is also named after a geographic trait in the region (Blackwater Creek), the symbol the company uses is also used because there are a number of Black Bears on the property. (Bears paw in the crosshairs.) <a href="../../../i/z/z/User%7EIzzy1985_5f8b.html" title="User:Izzy1985">Izzy1985</a> 23:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure what date should be used for when blackwater was found: the company website uses 1996 as the genesis of the operation, as did the Wikipedia page prior to my edit. During the congressional hearing over Reconstruction is Iraq on Wednesday, the 7th of February, the General Council for Blackwater said the company was founded in 1997. No real concensus on what year to use for foundation. BarabasKid 20:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On a broadcast of Democracy Now, they mentioned that the founders of Blackwater were big contriutors to Bush/ Cheney's election campaign. Do you think this is worth putting in the article? --<a href="../../../j/m/l/User%7EJml4000_597f.html" title="User:Jml4000">Jml4000</a> 23:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is an encyclopedic entry on a company. Do we normally list the campaign contributions on articles about companies? This seems POV to me. — <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinnwood_736d.html" title="User:Linnwood">Linnwood</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinnwood_c0a8.html" title="User talk:Linnwood">talk</a>)</span> 23:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is important if the Company primarily profits from war or armed conflict, especially since they have played major roles in the current war in Iraq. --<a href="../../../j/m/l/User%7EJml4000_597f.html" title="User:Jml4000">Jml4000</a> 04:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>It is important if the Company primarily profits from (Insert Government Action), especially since they have played major roles in the (Insert Government Policy)</i> I mean you could fit that statement to any company that has people who donate to political campaigns. I fail to see how Blackwater USA is diffrent than any other organization (corporation, labor union, charity) in that way. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_Andrew_Miller_93c4.html" title="User:Steven Andrew Miller">Steven Andrew Miller</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteven_Andrew_Miller_23d6.html" title="User talk:Steven Andrew Miller">talk</a>)</span> 07:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is a difference between a company profiting off of say, a highway or school being built by the federal government, and a company that profits off the bloodshed of human beigns. When Dick Cheney left the office of Secretary of defense under Bush 1, he hired a firm called Kellog Brown and Root (a subsidiary of halliburton) to brainstorm ways of how to privatize the U.S. military. This is the "revolution in military affairs" that's brought up many times by the Project for the New American Century. --147.144.1.251 20:55, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but unless you have some sort of allegation about corruption, there is no difference. For all we know the founders of Blackwater USA contributed to Bush/Cheney '04 because they are big supporters of <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">school choice</a> or any other GOP plank. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_Andrew_Miller_93c4.html" title="User:Steven Andrew Miller">Steven Andrew Miller</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteven_Andrew_Miller_23d6.html" title="User talk:Steven Andrew Miller">talk</a>)</span> 21:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
