	    <p>I believe that there's enough information known about the Black Ops in <i>Half-Life</i> for it to have its own article. Before, any reference to the Black Ops just linked to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_ops.html" title="Black ops">black ops</a> article which only really outlines the term; obviously not much to do with their role in the HL storyline. Anyway, the article might need a bit more reorganization, but I think this aptly covers the basics so far. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 10:09, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cool that they got their own page now. Thought they were quite important to the storyline and to the 'Black Mesa Conspiracy'. I know there are very few details regarding their purpose but could there be more some connection between the Black Ops and the G-Man? After seeing the bomb activation scene in Opposing force, I always assumed G-Man's objectives and aims were in parallel with those of Black Ops. Dont remember seeing any direct connections though. Anyone can comment on that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it seems that the G-Man's goal was always to prevent the disaster from occurring. It seemed like he knew it was going to happen in advance (Visiting Shephard at boot camp a week prior to the resonance cascade, arguing with a scientist also before the cascade, etc). When the resonance cascade did finally occur, though, the G-Man appeared to try and do what he could in his power to cover up the whole incident and stop its effects from spreading. Now, we do know that he wasn't the one that called the military aka HECU (Rosenberg did that in <i>Decay</i>, although once again the G-Man's presence watching Shephard before the disaster could imply that the G-Man predicted the HECU would get involved if things got bad). However, upon seeing that the HECU failed miserably at cleaning the mess up, it's possible that (And I would like to stress that this is the totally wild type of speculation that I don't think belongs in Wiki articles) the G-Man might have been the one who ordered the Black Ops to be sent in to eliminate the problem once and for all. The only real evidence to support this idea is that the G-Man's motives were apparently to try to clean up the mess caused by the incident, and that he's obviously seen reactivating the Black Ops' nuclear warhead. However, the G-Man might have had nothing to do with the Black Ops' presence at all, and the warhead thing could simply have been the G-Man seeing a convenient opportunity to "take care" of Black Mesa and he took it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 11:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Makes sense. Too bad I didnt play Decay to learn about the Rosenberg connection. Thanks for clearing.</p>

<p>I removed a small bit saying that the Assassins attacking Gordon just prior to his ambush by some marines could possibly be considered a plot hole, or that the Assassins could have changed their objectives late into the Black Mesa Incident and decided to work with the military. Technically, this is still early into the incident as Opposing Force takes place almost exclusively after Gordon teleports to Xen, so the Assassins deciding to work with the military at this point wouldn't make sense as they're clearly still quite hostile to one another by the time OpFor takes place. Also, it could be argued that the soldiers waiting in the other room had nothing to do with the assassins there. For one thing, Gordon had to manually open the door using the valve leading to the room the marines were in, and the marines attacked the first thing that walked into the room. This behavior does not seem likely if the assassins and soldiers were working together. Also, I'm sure Gearbox took this situation into consideration, and they simply took advantage of the HECU and Black Ops assassins never seeing one another to make them enemies in an expansion pack. I don't think this is too much of a stretch. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 05:01, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, given the agility and resourcefullness of the Black Ops, they might've just jumped in on the opportunity to eliminate Gordon. The whole area was an open-air compound, with only one open exit - the one, where the HECU waited in ambush. Instead of risking killing Gordon, they set up in that room for an ambush, and waited (dr Freeman's HEV suit was tracked all the time). The Black Ops moved into the seemingly abandoned area to eliminate the good doctor.</dd>
