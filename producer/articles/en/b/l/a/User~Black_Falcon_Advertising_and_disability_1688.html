	    <p>Advertisements featuring people with disabilities have become more prevalent in the United States in the last few decades as the U.S. business community realized two things: That people with disabilities are a consumer market and that the general public is not offended or upset by seeing disabled people advertising a product. Also, early disability rights legislation such as the <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehabilitation_Act_1636.html" title="Rehabilitation Act">Rehabilitation Act</a> of 1973, which required all federal programs and structures to be accessible and was finally being enforced by the early 1980s, began to build more societal awareness of the disability community. The 1990 <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_363b.html" title="Americans with Disabilities Act">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) also has given the business communities more awareness of disability issues. Some policy analysts actually called the ADA a mandate for marketers to begin to recognize the formerly invisible disabled market.</p>
<p><br />
In addition, the independent living movement, which gave disabled people educational and employment opportunities, also began in the early 1970s and gave people with disabilities more visibility in society. Advocates for people with disabilities in United States have been trying to educate businesses about the “disabled consumer market” for a number of years. Advertisers began to realize that disabled people buy soap, milk, socks, jewelry, makeup, home improvement goods, use travel services, live in houses, and enjoy nice home furnishings. For example, in the United States, 48.5 million disabled people who are age 15 and over had an estimated total discretionary income of $175 billion. There is even some evidence that the disabled consumer is much more brand loyal than other consumers.</p>
<p><br />
Disability Studies scholar Paul Longmore says that when TV ads with disabled people began, it illustrated that advertisers no longer feared that “nondisabled consumers will be distressed or offended.” Finally, in 1980 <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_captioning.html" title="Closed captioning">closed captioning</a> began on U.S. television, so the medium became more accessible to deaf people.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_Advertising_and_disability_1688.html" title="Edit section: First TV advertisement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>First TV advertisement</b></span></h2>
<p>The first TV ad for a commercial product said to feature a disabled person was in a 1984 Levi’s ad in which a wheelchair user popped a wheelie. However, McDonald’s restaurant chain claims to have been including wheelchair users in general shots of customers in TV ads since 1980. But its first TV ad to feature a disabled person was in 1986 when it depicted college-age deaf students discussing in sign language going to McDonald’s. However, at this point in commercial advertising images, the company still thought ads with disabled people should be directed at other disabled people and that these types of ads built “good will.” Deaf people became a popular disability group to depict in TV ads and by 1990 Crest, Citibank, and Levi’s had all used deaf actors. AT&amp;T capitalized on the Academy Award-winning actress <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlee_Matlin_2c40.html" title="Marlee Matlin">Marlee Matlin</a>'s fame by using her in some ads. By 1990, the National Captioning Institute reported more than 200 advertisers were captioning their ads, resulting in 2,600 closed-captioned TV spots.</p>
<p><br />
Wheelchair users became the other prominent category of disability depictions in early U.S. commercial advertisements. After Levi’s TV ad, companies such as Citicorp, Apple computers, Pacific Telesis, Nissan, and Target had all featured wheelchair users in TV or print ads by 1991. <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Corporation_8dc1.html" title="Target Corporation">Target Corporation</a> became somewhat of a pioneer in print ads using adults and children with disabilities in their sales circulars that went to 30 million households in 32 states. Target’s vice president of marketing said their use of disabled people in their ads was so successful that they can actually point to specific products that sold much better because they were modeled by a disabled person. In addition, the early campaign that depicted children with disabilities lead to 1000 supportive letters and “has been the single most successful consumer response we’ve ever gotten,” VP of marketing, Bob Thacker, said in The Washington Post. Target then expanded its disability images past wheelchair use to children and teens with Down syndrome, leg braces, and artificial limbs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_Advertising_and_disability_1688.html" title="Edit section: Controversial ads">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Controversial ads</b></span></h2>
<p>From the 1990s on, many of the advertisements featuring disabled people were accepted and considered non-stigmatizing. However, one major controversy arose in 1993, which illustrated how disabled and able-bodied people interpreted the images differently. A TV ad for Dow Chemical’s Spray ‘N Wash Stain Stick used a child with Down Syndrome. The ad began: “Halley has made my life very exciting. She’s very affectionate, and she is very active. We use Stain Stick. . .because the last place we need another challenge is the laundry room,” according to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. The ad used no professional actors but a real mother and daughter from Atlanta, Ga., found through a connection to the National Down Syndrome Congress. The Congress applauded the final ad and gave it a media award. However, an <i>Advertising Age</i> writer called the ad exploitative, “appalling,” and “the most crassly contrived slice-of-life in advertising history,” according to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Dow’s toll-free telephone line contradicted this opinion with 700 calls, all positive except for seven calls.</p>
<p><br />
Nike drew the anger of the disability community in 2000 for a print ad for its Air Dri-Goat running shoe that said: “Fortunately the Air Dri-Goat features a patented goat-like outer sole for increased traction so you can taunt mortal injury without actually experiencing it. Right about now you're probably asking yourself ‘How can a trail running shoe with an outer sole designed like a goat's hoof help me avoid compressing my spinal cord into a Slinky on the side of some unsuspecting conifer, thereby rendering me a drooling, misshapen non-extreme-trail-running husk of my former self, forced to roam the earth in a motorized wheelchair with my name embossed on one of those cute little license plates you get at carnivals or state fairs, fastened to the back?’ (<a href="http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/graphics/nikead.gif).The" class="external free" title="http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/graphics/nikead.gif).The" rel="nofollow">http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/graphics/nikead.gif).The</a> ad ran in <i>Backpacker</i> magazine and <i>Men’s Journal</i>.</p>
<p><br />
After hearing from a number outraged disability groups and individuals, Nike issued an apology on Oct. 24, 2000. It said: “We offer a sincere apology to those people, their family and friends. Clearly, disabilities of any form are no laughing matter and that paragraph should not have been included in the ad. We are immediately pulling this offensive ad from future publication.”</p>
<p><a name="Super_Bowl_Ads" id="Super_Bowl_Ads"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_Advertising_and_disability_1688.html" title="Edit section: Super Bowl Ads">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Super Bowl Ads</b></span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> ads are considered prominent because of their huge audiences. One of the first people with a disability featured in a Super Bowl was actor <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Reeve_86c6.html" title="Christopher Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>, for Nuveen, an investment management company, in 2000 (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFYSUPlZmcg" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFYSUPlZmcg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFYSUPlZmcg</a>). The ad caused a controversy because it depicted Reeve, who was a quadriplegic due to a riding accident, walking across a stage. In a frightening turn of events, many people around the world misunderstood the Nuveen ad and thought spinal cord injury had been cured when they saw Reeve “walk.” Chris Allen of Nuveen said in <i>The Guardian</i> that the message of the ad was “to inspire a dialogue on money, to have a new dialogue and get away from buying bigger boats and bigger cars and thing about the impact that money can have on the future.” However, Thomas Countee, the executive director of the U.S. Spinal Cord Injury Foundation, said in <i>The Guardian</i> that it received numerous calls from paralyzed people and their loved ones who wanted to know how to be cured like Reeve in the ad. He believes the ad inspired a false hope of a quick cure for spinal cord injury. “When you go out with an advertisement like that, you tread a very, very narrow line between trying to be creative – and being misleading,” Countee said.</p>
<p><br />
Many people criticized the ad for trading on tragedy and being dangerously misrepresentative and off putting. Reeve responded to criticism of the ad saying that a cure for paralysis will be available if enough time and money are spent on the effort. However, many disabled people had long criticized Reeve’s singular focus on a cure. As William Stothers, a wheelchair user and director of the Center for an Accessible Society, said in <i>Mainstream</i> magazine: “I don't object to research to find ways to restore damaged spinal cords or causes of other diseases. But I am deeply offended by any implication that disability is an abnormal condition removed from the reality of the human condition. Human beings come in an immense variety of sizes, shapes, talents, and functional abilities. We're all over the map in differences in what we can and cannot do. The limits in what we can do are often found in obstacles and barriers created in and by the environment, natural, built and attitudinal. Finding a cure for those barriers, now that I can buy into.”</p>
<p><br />
The next year’s Super Bowl ad also featured a person with a disability, but this ad from Cingular Wireless (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frMbk7g_mHo" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frMbk7g_mHo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frMbk7g_mHo</a>) was met with praise from the disability community. It featured <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Keplinger_f6a3.html" title="Dan Keplinger">Dan Keplinger</a>, the artist who was the subject of the Academy Award-winning documentary "<a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Gimp_4315.html" title="King Gimp">King Gimp</a>." In the 2001 Super Bowl ad the use of Keplinger was considered a brave step for the images of people with disabilities in advertising because Keplinger has a serious form of cerebral palsy that affects both his speech and mobility.</p>
<p><br />
The Cingular ad began by confronting the TV audience’s mistaken impression of Keplinger and his abilities. The words Keplinger uses in the ad confronted those who might dismiss him because of his disability. After illustrating his talents as a painter in the ad, he says with gusto: “I'm unbelievably lucky.” With this statement, he challenged those who would pity him. “Too often the media depict people with disabilities as a disability, not a person,” said Keplinger in Cingular press materials. "The Cingular ad, however, is about me as an artist and that's who I am."</p>
<p><br />
Keplinger's message was not about changing who he is, but reveling in how fortunate he feels. And this is a message embraced by many in the U.S. community of people with disabilities. “There are just so many things this ad does for us - but the most important is to show that disability in and of itself is not bad,” Cyndi Jones, a wheelchair user who is director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, Ca., said in The Baltimore Sun. “After all - I am unbelievably lucky.”</p>
<p><br />
High-profile people with disabilities continue to be used as models and spokespeople in advertisements. In summer 2005, quadriplegic rugby player and star of the 2005 documentary [[<i>Murderball</i>]], <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Zupan_a1fd.html" title="Mark Zupan">Mark Zupan</a> appeared on billboards in New York City and Los Angeles as a model for Reebok's "I am what I am" world-wide advertising campaign.</p>
