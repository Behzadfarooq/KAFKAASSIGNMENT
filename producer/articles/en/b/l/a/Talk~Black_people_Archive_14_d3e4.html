<h2><span class="mw-headline">Superimposition of Eurocentric linguistics</span></h2>
<p>Munto doesn’t mean black peole, it means people just like in Arabic zanj doesn’t mean black, this is a <b>Eurocentric superimposition</b>. i.e. European world view is imposed on African linguistics thus our word for normal people (as we see ourselves, everyone is different from us hence we are normal and they are white) however Europeans have imposed one standard on the world where their world view &amp; perception is suppose to be everyone else’s. Hence people is African languages means "black people" as they see us.

<dd>My brief review says that Bantu is the plural of Muntu (person or man/ people), though if it is not needed for the article, it doesn't need research. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 19:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HalaTruth, can you point me to the referenced article you mentioned above that discusses this issue. Africans do have specific terms for white people. In the languages I understand there are such terms, ie <i>mzungu</i> in Swahili and other lanugages in East Africa. In Luo there are even synonyms, eg. <i>munu</i> (which means white person), or combinations of the words "white" and "person", eg. <i>jo apar</i> or <i>jo mapar</i>. There are certainly innumerable other examples. I am not entirely sure what point the "muntu" reference is meant to illustrate, but it seems somewhat astray.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 22:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Halaquh seems to be referring to this edit,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=97379867&amp;oldid=97379464" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=97379867&amp;oldid=97379464" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which seems to turn a sensible statement into nonsense. The original point was well expressed. Now we have the tautological assertion that the majority population of Sub-Saharan Africa is "African". The point of the sentence is to say that the word for person implicitly means what in in English would be called a black person, since there isa a separate term for a whitey. I don't know how true this is, but the point is clear and it has nothing to do with "Eurocentric superimposition". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 23:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>do not mistranslate words to mean wht europeans think thy r. In Wolof Tumbaa, the word for person is not black person it is person. imposing white thinking on African languages, like zanj means black . again in English it would be person.

<dd>You merely demonstrsate that you did not even understand the original paragraph, and insist on the unhelpful and unsupported claims about "europeans". The original para very clearly stated that the word meant simply person, but pointed out that it was used <i>implicitly</i> to mean a black person because a <i>different</i> term is used for whites - in other words the normative model of a person is black. If you want to argue against that you will have to show that this is not true of actual <i>usage</i>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 00:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>then the correct word would be African people, because indians in Africa, tamils in Africa dont get called "people", and by the def of black people it is an inclusive term.so to avoid confusion, p,s i did understand it. but u did a good job re explaining it--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 00:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the above discussions I think we all agree in principal its just probably the wording. I understand the concept might be a little difficult to grasp. I included the information to add a local african perspective. In actual fact the word "african" is from latin and "black" is english. I can imagine before the europeans came to africa, africans would not describe themselves as blacks or even africans for that matter but as people. They would probably identify themselves with their empire, nation, tribe, language etc. When the europeans first set foot on african soil they must have looked odd and their ways strange-thus they were given a different name.</p>
<p>This legacy still remains in some african languages where in conversation, person(muntu) may implicitly mean black person when trying to compare or contrast with a white person(<a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzungu.html" title="Muzungu">muzungu</a>). This is not eurocentric because all the words in question are african.</p>
<p>The opposite is in the US where society expects African-Americans to be labelled as so but does demand the same from "european americans". <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChifumbe_2417.html" title="User:Chifumbe">Muntuwandi</a> 19:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It still looks like original research to me (the part about "muntu" = implicitly "black person"). If it is true then there must be regional differences in the usage of the term "muntu". A reference would be nice. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 23:17, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if one examines terms for black people in Bantu languages, many are simply derivatives of the word african eg swahili "mwafrika", which obviously entered the language recently after the arrival of europeans. Early africans viewed themselves as "the people" and the outsiders as foreigners(muzungus). This concept was not pejorative on both sides but just the reality of the demographics. Even a white person is a muntu, but if there is need for differentiation he is a muzungu. Interestingly the word "muzungu" has nothing to do with skin color but more with the behaviour of the european explorers.<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChifumbe_2417.html" title="User:Chifumbe">Muntuwandi</a> 06:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consistency of spelling</span></h2>
<p>The rule on British spellings vs. American spellings is, if I remember correctly, that whichever way an article starts it should remain that way. Recently someone changed a spelling in another article, apparently just thinking that the American spelling was wrong. In that case I had no trouble being sure of which side of the pond the article had started on since I had created that article some time ago.</p>
<p>It would save me a lot of trouble if every article had a note (in "comment" format) at the top stating whether the spelling standard was to be American or British.</p>
<p>If we don't keep to this standard, then people will start changing things back and forth. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 04:38, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stumbled accross the video of the carteret islands watching cnn. It was interesting because if anyone met the man walking down the street they would assume that he was of recent african descent. His appearance is almost indistinguishable from African people and yet he is not from africa but from thousands of miles away in the pacific. I think it is a good photo for this article in the discussion "who is black". I agree with ezeu, he looks dashing. I suggest we keep the photo until a more "photogenic" photo can be found.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am also thinking we should re-establish the gallery with pictures of black people from all around the world (Africa, US, Caribbean, latin-america, brazil, europe, oceania). The previous gallery was too USA-centric.</p>

<dd>Whenever I tried to simplify the English, I was attacked. This is not rocket science. It is not that complicated. But people want to make it complicated. And certain people have decided they own the term. Unfortunately all the people that feel they own the term "black people" disagree with each other. So, it just devolves into a nightmare. And droves of editors leave. And huge amounts of great material get thrown away. Because who wants to waste time fighting about nonsense when it is of no consequence anyway? It is unappreciated. There are better ways to spend one's time. Too many people with agendas who are too angry. So...I just have given up. Too bad, because this could be a fascinating subject.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 01:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look in the history of the talk page and the article, you will see all kinds of great stuff. Tons of amazing pictures and material. Scientific stuff. Social stuff. Historical stuff. Different views from around the world. Amazing and interesting. However, the subject is too politically charged to allow anyone to write it, except a very few people who have taken ownership of the article off and on. And so, that is what we get. For example, I loved the idea that Jablonski's recent work could be featured here with at least a sentence or two. Nope. Not allowed. I wanted to have some discussion of the science of genetics. Nope. Not allowed. I wanted some discussion of blacks in history around the world. Nope. Not allowed. Discussion of disagreements over definitions? Nope. Not allowed. I wanted a family of pages where all the material could be collected and featured, since we had so much. Nope. Not allowed. Now of course there are tools like RfC etc to settle these, but who wants to get involved with that nightmare? If someone is so angry and determined, let them have it. I dont care. I will work on other pages.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 01:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I think this is one of the most objective articles on Wikipedia. This was extremely informative. there may be a few things to touch up- like more clarification about the poltical term Black in the Civil Rights Movement. But for the most part, I though this article really covered everyone's side and the history behind the term very well. Dkceaser 02:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)Dkceaser</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rushton is not racist</span></h2>
<p>I was disturbed to see Deeceevoice remove the single best definition of a black person from the article by libeling this professional academic as a racist. Rushton is a professor at one of Canada's top universities and a member of the American Association of Advancement of Sciences. He was recently a guest on CNN's Paula Zahn discussing sex differences in intelligence, so I guess we're going to try to claim he is a sexist too. Rushton has devoted the last 20 years of his illustrious career studying racial differences in behavior, intelligence, brain size, genitalia, DNA, and hormones. His ideas may be provocactive, but there's not a shred of evidence to justify libeling this man as a racist, and even if he were, an unpopular ideology does not justify excluding his views from the article. If that were the case then we should remove all the Afrocentric opinions from the fringe pseudo scholars who are mentioned in the criticism section. It's bad enough that Rushton's widely cited theory was removed from the article. I'm willing to let that slide, but to remove the single best definition of a black person from the article simply by libeling the source is completely unaccepatable. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></p>

This person/people have been trying to peddle this same tired old line, against consensus, for quite some time. They disappeared for a while recently when the going got quite heated, but now they seem to have made a reappearance, presumably thinking that the coast was clear. I think this user is using sockpuppets to try to create the appearence of support for their dubious POV. I think there is and always has been a consensus on this page that people like Rushton, and his ilk are not reliable sources and do not constitue authorities in this field of research, indeed most academics shun people like Rushton because of the overt racism of their conclusions. It is clear that Rushton is not actually a biologist, and so certainly does not constitute an authority for biological definitions anyway. I also think there is no consensus that only people with a recent African origin are considered Black people, which is what the definitions this user included state, these contradict the rest of the article. I am going to look into this group of editors histories and determine if I can get a case of sockpuppetry against them. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 18:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Anyone who comes to the conclusion that race is a meaningful biological category is smeared by people like you. Well I've had it. Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral in view point and I'm tired of you silencing, smearing, and censoring accomplished academics simply because they don't support your narrow view point.

<dd>Freedom of speech used as an excuse to censor Rushton. LOL! If that's not an example of talking out of both sides of one's mouth I don't know what is. In any event I want Rushton in the article because he represents the view that MOST of your ancestors must be from a certain region of the world to be considered black as opposed to the one drop rule cited above and as opposed to the extreme 75% of your ancestors cited by Levin. His more controversial ideas are not being pushed, but his definition represents one view out of many on what it means to be black and in order to build a better encyclopedia, it should be included. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">Gottoupload</a></dd>

<p>Calling him rascist isnt censoring him and anyway his not being included here would not be censorship. I see he has his own article, it would have been helpful to link to it in the first place. His ideas look very extreme and he hardly comes across as either pro or even balanced abouit black people.

<dd>I agree we shouldn't include his controversial views in the article and I'll support you in keeping those out, but simply citing a basic textbook definition of a black person that a lot of people agree with makes sense to me. Why the resistance? It's no secret that are many different ways to define a black person and his is no more offensive than any other.

<li>Rushton is a quack when it comes to race, and he is a psychologist, not a biologist. His methods were faulty, and his conclusions have been widely criticized by other academics. He promotes what has been called <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_racism.html" title="Scientific racism">scientific racism</a>. Even the highly-whitewashed J. Philippe Rushton article (and the links on that page) point out that he has an undeniable political agenda. And again, he is not a biologist so should not be cited as an expert on biological matters.~~</li>

<dd>You might want to tell the University of Western Ontario and the American accoociation of Advanacement of Sciences and academic journals like Intelligence, Personality &amp; Individual Differences, which regularly publish his work, that he's a quack. Rushton is what's known as a sociobiologist. The article makes clear that biological definitions of blacks are controversial and Rushton is not given undue weight. However it's important to represent the view that MOST of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa to be black because this view is quite common and not currently represented in the article. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">Gottoupload</a>

<p>There are 2 types of editors I see in this article. Those that contribute to the article by adding information, and those that narrow the article by removing things. When I added Rushton et al to the article I didn't remove any of the opposing views, I simply added a different perspective not already represented in the article. All views should be heard.

<dd>The definition was not even created by American, but a British-born South African Canadian. And we're not giving bias to people of African biology, we are simply documenting the existence of this perspective along with extensive criticism. What's the problem? You want a one sided article? If black people come to this article trying to get a broad perspective on how black people are viewed and defined, we are doing them a disservice by excluding a whole branch of opinion in this area <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Viva la difference</span></h2>
<p>To me what makes the article fascinating is the diversity in view points. I think it's interesting that some people define black people as anyone descended from an equatorial region of the world, others are a little more narrow and limit black people to those from Africa, and some are more narrow still and limit black people to only those from sub-Saharan Africa. But then regardless of which of these 3 camps you fall into, another debate runs parallel. How much black ancestry does one need to be black? Is any known black ancestry enough as the one drop rule suggests? Do MOST of your ancestors have to be black as Rushton suggests? Or is do almost ALL of your ancestors have to be black as Michael levin and Brazilian culture suggests. These types of disagreements are what makes the article fascinating so I don't understant the resistance to including this diverse range of opinion. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">Gottoupload</a></p>

Levin is anti-gay, has written for right wing libertarian publications, and has spoken at events for the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_separatism.html" title="White separatism">white separatist</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Renaissance_%28magazine%29_3af2.html" title="American Renaissance (magazine)">American Renaissance (magazine)</a>.

<p>What does being anti-gay have to do with anything? So only people who are socially progressive are allowed to have an opion. I thought liberals were supposed to be against fascism yet here you are promoting it. Who says the Pioneer-Fund is antigay and anti-immigrant? Rushton was asked to be in charge of it only because he's the most credible scholar on the race realist perspective. Rushton himself has repeatedly denied that he or his ideas are in any way racist and his been backed by eminent biologists such as E.O. Wilson. As for Satel, once agin who cares if Satel is against political correctness. The very fact that Satel takes the concept of race seriously proves Satel is against political correctness. I find it very disturbing and very fascist that you are trying to exclude reliable cited scholarly sources from the article on ideological grounds. And your argument that thye must all be biologists to be cited is equally desperate. First of all, Rushton is a sociobiologist which is the most well suited field for this discussion. Second, insisting that they all be biologists to be cited for biological definitions would be like insisting that everyone cited in the sociopolitical section be a professional sociologist. Absurd. Without the biological definitions the article is extremely unbalanced. We have an entire section following it blasting these definitions as racist and too narrow by scholars (or pseudoscholars) of much lesser reputation, yet we're not allowed to include the definitions themselves. The fact of the matter is these definitions exist, they're actually very mainstream, and trying to exclude them from the article as if they don't exist is a disservice to the reader. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></p>

<dd>It is indeed amazing. I'm with you, Fill. All major viewpoints MUST be represented including the view point that Blacks are a biologically meaningful race defined exclusively by being mostly of sub-Saharan African descent. Wobble wants this view censored because he's pushing the POV that race is a meaningless concept and he pushes this POV in several articles. Deeceevoice is trying to censor this view because it conflicts with her agenda that ancient Egyptians were black or that the great civilizations of South Asia were black. Again we have a bunch of editors who are more concerned with protecting their respective agendas than writing a thorough balanced article.

<dd>I absolutely agree with Spylab. But I would go a step further. I would maintain that it is impossible to have a "biological" section and would remove it all together. This article is not about a "race", it is not about any single biological population, it is not about any population from a single part of the world. This article is about "Black people", people in North America may have a parochial view of what it means to be Black, that is that one needs to have a recent African ancestry, but this does not apply universally to all Black people. Just because a definition is true for North America does not make it true for any other part of the world. It is therefore impossible to biologically define Black people. Black people are Black because of the colour of their skin, some people who are Black come from Africa, some come from Australia or other parts of the world, these groups of people do not represent closely related populations. What they do have in common is social, in that they are discriminated against because of their skin colour. I would support the inclusion of a section that discusses the historical exploitation of various groups of Black people by White people all over the world, I think this would make for a much better section than a pseudo-scientific section about "biology". This has got bugger all to do with biology. The only important thing we can say about biology is that all humans are biologically very similar and are all part of the same subspecies. Anything else is parochial, and this is not US or North American Wikipedia. I would also point out that the sock/meat puppets <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">User:Timelist</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">User:Editingoprah</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">User:Gottoupload</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">User:Kobrakid</a> seem to want to push a far right racist point of view against the consensus on this page. At the least they are editing against consensus, at the most they are a group of meatpuppets (or a sockpuppet) who are trying to make an artificial consensus for a racist point of view to be included on this page. Either of these is a clear breach of wikipedia policy. This sock/meat puppet group disappeared from wikipedia mysteriously a little while ago when I told them that I planned to report them for this exact same behaviour. Well I'm going to check their user histories and file a complaint at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets</a>.

The biolical view is real, it's extensively documented, and no one who is interested in providing a complete view on this subject to the reader would try to remove it. It's clear that Alun and others have strong ideological views on this subject and they are allowing it to cloud their respect for wikipidea NPOV policy.

He is actually interested in <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a> and not "race", in this he is frighteningly similar to the <i>nazis</i>. Indeed much as Rushton thinks that some races are superior to others, the <i>nazis</i> believed that Germans were superior to Russians, and actually believed that science proved it. Well we all know what the "inferior" Russians did to <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Paulus_4488.html" title="Friedrich Paulus">Paulus's</a> Sixth Army at thr <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> and later did to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Berlin_88d7.html" title="Battle of Berlin">Berlin</a>. Indeed Rushton's his "definition" of Black is extremelly odd. For example <i>In both everyday life and evolutionary biology, a 'Black' is anyone most of whose ancestors were born in sub-Saharan Africa</i>, well it may be news to Rushton, but <b>all of us have ancestors exclusively born in sub-Saharan Africa</b>. Or this <i>a Negroid is someone whose ancestors, between 4,000 and (to accommodate recent migrations) 20 generations ago, were born in sub-Saharan Africa</i>, well I am British, the southern part of Great Britain was part of the Roman Empire for over 300 years, the first African people to come to Britain came at this time, no one in Britain can claim absolutelly that they do not have an African ancestor from between 4,000 and 20 generations ago because if they did they would be lying, the truth is we no one really knows. On a related note, in his book "Blood of the Isles" the geneticist Bryan Sykes claims to have encountered a Scottish woman who had mitochondrial DNA of recent sub-Saharan African origin. This woman was not aware of any African ancestry in her family. Sykes postulates that she may be the descendant of an African woman who came to Britain at the time of the Romans. According to Rushton, this woman is "a Negroid". And anyway this article is not about what Rushton calls "Negroid" people, it is about Black people. Rushton's definitions are not only not biological, they make no sense. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Not only are you incapable of refraining from incredibly libelous personal attacks against other people, but you are minimizing the seriousness of the Holocaust when you toss such loaded rhetoric around so casually. Rushton has no interest in eugenics. Rushton is an eminent sociobiologist studying the world around him. Simply because you are offended by his conclusion that peoples of predominantly sub-Sahran descent are sexually more endowed on average to Whites and North East Asians gives you no right to libel him as a nazi. Such behavior is way beneath the standards of wikipedia’s discourse. Rushton does not make the simplistic argument that some races are superior to others. Indeed he claims that each of these broad groupings is perfectly, beautifully adapted to its own ancestral environment.</p>
<p>None of your arguments hold upon scruitiny. Of course ALL of us have ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa. All of us have ancestors that were born in the ocean if you go back far enough. You’re just trying to confuse the issue. It’s obvious that Rushton is talking about recent ancestry. And of course virtually all of us have some recent African ancestry if we analyzed our family trees closely enough. That’s the whole reason definitions like Rushton and Levin fill a void in the article. Rushton emphasizes that most of ones ancestors must be of sub-Saharan extraction while Levin goes further requiring 75%+ ancestry.</p>
<p>Rushton uses terms like Black and Negroid interchangeably. Negroid is a modified version of “Negro” which means black in Spanish and Negro is synonymous with black person according to many dictionaries.</p>
<p>Rushton’s definition is simple, clearly worded and to the point, and speaks to how millions of people conceptualize black people. Anyway you look at it, a professor from a respected university who is a member of the American Association of Advancement of Sciences, and has published in many peer reviewed highly respected academic journals is a reliable enough source to be briefly cited for a basic definition. We have an entire section devoted to criticizing Rushton’s perspective on what it means to be black, so we need to document the perspective itself. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></p>

<li>Quit throwing around loaded words like "eminent" and creditials that have nothing to do with the subject at hand. You're not fooling anyone. Rushton, Leven and Satel aren't biologists or geneticists, and are not credible experts on the supposed biological/genetic definition of blackness. Rushton is a psychology professor, Levin is a philosphy professor and Satel is a psychiatrist. And you are wrong that he has no interest in eugenics. Look at his article and follow the link to the group he is the head of. Finally, millions of people do not use Rushton's definition of blackness. Most people define a person's status as black or white by sight (and maybe accent) alone.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 00:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No I'm not, I'm showing categorically that Rushton's definitions don't make any sense. He defines "Negroid" in one way and he defines a Black person in another. Neither of these definitions is actually very good, a Black person, he claims only needs a majority African ancestry, so that would be every human then. A "Negroid" he claims needs to have ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa from 4,000 to 20 generations ago, actually this means from 100,000-500 years ago given a 25 year generation span, well there must be <i>millions</i> of <b>indigenous</b> Europeans who have an African ancestry from this time (it's a massive time scale), but who just are not aware of it, gene flow between populations has been extensive, like it or not. Many of the proper scientific papers that I show above indicate the massive amount of gene flow between so called "races", we are not, and have never been, discrete non-interbreeding populations. Humanity, by it's nature, is promiscuous. These definitions seem to be the ones he uses in his book, all well and good, his book may display internal consistency in that he always uses Black person to mean someone with majority recent African ancestry, this does not necessarily make it a suitable definition for this article because whereas he seems to be only interested in Black people from North America, and so takes a parochial point of view, this article is not about Black people in North America, that article would be <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>. I suggest you go there to spout your racism. His definition of "Negroid" is irrelevant as this article is not about "Negroid" <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 06:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually he is not. If you actually knew anything about this subject at all, you would know three important and fundamental facts, all of which are covered extensively in the papers I link to above. Firstly <b>there is no generally accepted definition of race (or <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subspecies.html" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>), or of what constitutes a race (or <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subspecies.html" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>) in the field of biology, let alone any defined races. Secondly most definitions of race are ultimately social and not biological. Thirdly there are many biological definitions of <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subspecies.html" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> (that is race), the human species does not display any of the necessary biological diversity to be taxonomically categorised on the subspecific level.</b> Hence we are all <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_sapiens_sapiens.html" title="Homo sapiens sapiens">Homo sapiens sapiens</a></i>, the third designation would be different if we were <b>biologically</b> recognised as "races" or subspecies. Given that we are not, there is in actual fact no general recognition in the science of biology of any human racial groups. There are however social races. Rushton's definitions do not even constitute biological definitions. His definitions are based on ancestry and not biology (and none of us knows our ancestry, even if some people think that they do). A biological definition would be based either on physical appearance (<a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenotype.html" title="Phenotype">Phenotype</a>, the traditional method for taxonomy) or on genetic differences (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genotype.html" title="Genotype">Genotype</a> a more modern method for taxonomy). Neither of Rushton's definitions fit these criteria. And to repeat because you seem to be unable to understand this very simple point <i><b>this article is about the term Black people, it is not only about people of African descent.</b></i> <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 06:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yet these sources are considered mainstream?</span></h2>
<p>I find it truly amazing that people have problems with allowing Rushton (a sociolobiologist, top university professor, and member of the American Association for Advancement of Sciences)provide a brief definition in the article, yet look at all the undue weight given to the following pseudo scolars:</p>
<p>There are objections to the standard definitions of black people, as well as criticism of the term itself.</p>
<p>Cultural writer and filmmaker <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_%27Alik_Shahadah_0d3b.html" title="Owen 'Alik Shahadah">Owen 'Alik Shahadah</a> says "as a political term it was fiery and trendy but never was it an official racial classification of peoples who have a 120,000 year old history. Indians are from India, Chinese from China. There is no country called Blackia or Blackistan. Hence, the ancestry-nationality model is more respectful and accurate: African-American, African-British, African-Brazilian, and African-Caribbean." 'Alik Shahadah also objects that "in addition, because it is a term placed on us, we have no bases for its control, and hence they are able to say; 'Ancient Egyptians weren't black.' Black has no meaning; except the meaning they place on it, if and when they chose."<sup id="_ref-Shahadah_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shahadah" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Owen 'Alik Shahadah states "the notion of some invisible border, which divides the North of African from the South, is rooted in racism, which in part assumes that a little sand is an obstacle for African people. This barrier of sand hence confines/confined Africans to the bottom of this make-believe location, which exist neither politically or physically". Shahadah argues that the term sub-Saharan Africa is a product of European imperialism, "Sub-Saharan Africa is a byword for primitive African: a place, which has escaped advancement. Hence, we see statements like 'no written languages exist in Sub-Saharan Africa.' 'Egypt is not a Sub-Saharan African civilization.'<sup id="_ref-Shahadah_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shahadah" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Activist Nirmala Rajasingam considers most standard definitions of black too narrow: "It was a failure because it divided the Black community into its constituent parts.. into Jamaican or Punjabi or Sri Lankan Tamil and so on, rather than build up Black unity.. But you know, there are young Asians who would like to call themselves Black, but the African youth will say 'You are not Black, you are Asian. We are Black'. Similarly, there are young Asians who will say 'We are not Black, we are Asian.'. So it has all become diluted and depoliticized."<sup id="_ref-Kadirgamar_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kadirgamar" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lewis R. Gordon (Director of the Institute for the Study of Race and Social Thought at Temple University) says "Not all people who are designated African in the contemporary world are also considered black anywhere. And similarly, not all people who are considered in most places to be black are considered African anywhere. There are non-black Africans who are descended from more than a millennia of people living on the African continent, and there are indigenous Pacific peoples and peoples of India whose consciousness and life are marked by a black identity".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Psychiatrist Ikechukwu Obialo Azuonye says "being dark skinned is a widespread phenomenon which does not define any specific group of human beings. The tendency to reserve the designation black to sub-Saharan Africans and people of their extraction is manifestly misinformed".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheikh_Anta_Diop_ed91.html" title="Cheikh Anta Diop">Cheikh Anta Diop</a> also feels that the standard conceptions of black people fall short, stating: "There are two well-defined Black races: one has a black skin and woolly hair; the other also has black skin, often exceptionally black, with straight hair, aquiline nose, thin lips, an acute cheekbone angle. We find a prototype of this race in India: the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidian</a>. It is also known that certain Nubians likewise belong to the same Negro type...Thus, it is inexact, anti-scientific, to do anthropological research, encounter a Dravidian type, and then conclude that the Negro type is absent."<i><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[9]</a></sup></i></p>

<li>I'm not sure if all of those people are reliable sources, but note that those people are talking about cultural and historical definitions of blackness, not biological or genetic definitions. Culture is not a science, and there are many different opinions about the sociopolitical definition of specific racial/ethnic groups.

biology means biology, if it is a biological definition then the people talking about it must be experts in biology. imagine if Noam chomsky as expert as he is started giving biological def for black people? a critic of the general term is one thing but to offer biological definitions is a specific thing. U need a genetic person to talk about genetics, someone who understand genetics.skylab is correct on th epoint cultural opinions or politics isnt an imperical science. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 19:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well it may be your POV that there's no biological race but a lot of scholars would disagree with you. I'm not interested in opening that can of worms, so let's stick to what's best for the article and keep our personal POVs out of it. If you read the section I did my best to make it clear that race realists are outside the mainstream and are not endorsed by biologists. In any event we have a whole section criticising the hell out of race realists so we need to document the perspective, otherwiese when you read the criticism, it's hrad to know what view point they're criticising. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></p>

<dd>Excuse me for coming on hard, but the thought of going through this crap again displeases me.

What is the difference? Should every stupid opinion be included merely for the sake of balance? Perhaps yes, but there are (or should be) limits. What annoys me most is that Kobrakid (and company) probably do not intend it, but succeed so well in disrupting this article.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 20:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well there's a big difference between Rushton and Anne Coulter. Rushton is a serious scholar who publishes in peer reviewed academic journals. Rushton is a professor at one of Canada's top universities. Rushton is a member of the American Association of Advancement of Sciences. Rushton is treated as an expert on CNN and Rushton's book was well reviewed by the New York Times. Further, Rushton only became controversial when he released a study claiming black men had larger penises than White men, and much larger penises than East Asian men. But he's not being quoted based on such controversial views. We are only quoting him to represent the view that you need to have most of your ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa to be black. This is an enormously common view about what it means to be black, so I don't see the problem with having a tiny section devoted to it, especially since we have an ENORMOUS section disputing it. Simply put, Rushton is the best source I know of that represents this major view point, and the article would be incomplete without that view point being represented. As for the claim that black people are monkeys. That's an extremely fringe view. Less than 1 in a 1000 people would seriously entertain that view and you would not find a scholary source in any area supporting it. But the view that most of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa to be black? That's actually a very middle of the road view. In fact in Latin of America they would go further and say ALL of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa to be black and call many of America's blacks mulattoes. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a>
<dl>
<dd>You were making a good case, and I was rather agreeing with you until you started going on about monkeys. Isn't it rather obvious that my reference to monkeys was meant as a rhetorical device? If Rushton's conclusions are so obviously astute, shouldnt his conclusions also have been made by at least other scholar? In which case shouldnt there be someone else less contentious to quote? --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 21:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would prefer to quote someone less controversial than Rushton, but it's very difficult to find cited definitions of what a black person is (aside from basic dictionary definitions) so I'm reluctant to delete Rushton until we can find a replacement making the same point. I guess your probably thinking if Rushton's definition is so mainstream it should be easy to find another but the reality is people seldom explain in words what they mean by a black person. It's one of those terms that's implicitly understood but seldom discussed in a formal way. In fact the reason there has been so much debate in this article is because we have so few reliable sources to cite. But the reason I know Rushton's definition is mainstream is because it's so middle of the road. On the one hand you have many Americans saying if ANY of your ancestors are black you are black, but then you have Latin America going to the opposite extreme and saying if ANY of your ancestors are not black, you are NOT black. Rushton's right in the middle of the road by saying most of your ancestors must be from sub-Saharan Africa. He's essentially saying the same thing as the U.S. census map says however he's being clear about how much African ancestry you need so it's very easy for mixed race people to decide if they're black or not and giving us an alternative to the extremes of the one drop rule and Latin America's reverse one drop rule. He's a moderate common sense voice on the question of where to draw the racial line. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a>

<dd>But when you start deleting people because someone claims they are racist you're on a very slippery slope. For example we cite a lot of Afrocentric people in this article. Not only are they not in most cases considered serious scholars by any university, but you could probably make the case that most of these people are racist against Whites.

<dd>Huge difference between Rushton and David Duke. First of all Rushton is a SCHOLARLY source and wikipedia considers scholarly sources to be the best sources of all to use. Second Rushton is not a racist. Sure people who disagree with his views have accused him of being racist, but Rushton himself denies that he or his ideas are in any way racist and there's no documentation of him ever saying anything racist. By contrast Duke was a member of the Ku Klux Klan <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a>

<dd>Doesn't Duke, like Rushton, deny being a racist? --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 21:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Duke was a member of the Ku Klux Klan which is a racist organization. Rushton is a professor at a prestigous university in a country with strict laws against racism. In the U.S. people are free to have racist opinions but in Canada there are strict laws against hate literature and Rushton had to be cleared by the Royal Canadian Mounty Police to prove that none of his thoughts or ideas are in any way racist. Rushton's whole career depends on him not being racist because he studies the races as an objective scientist. In order to do that you have to be neutral and can't bring any preconcived bias to your studies. Rushton is far too intelligent to be a racist. Although Rushton believes the races do differ genetically in many important ways, he insists that these are only average differences and much smaller than the racists actually believe. Rushton is intelligent enough to know that nearly the full range of human traits and abilities is present in all races and that there's ENORMOUS variation within the races. Rushton also believes that white people are less intelligent on average than Orientals which is the opposite of a white supremacist. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></dd>

<dd>your argument has nothing to do with him being a racist, he goes to nice UNI dinner parties, you have however proven, he gets paid, he is popular, he like all racist denies being racist, he is intellegent, kant and david hume were intellegent as well, mayb he isnt duke, but that makes him worst because people then take him seriously, while he makes even more dangerous and harder to spot racist statements. i really dont care where he puts "orientals" in his little world, the irony is the African is at the bottom. we all know US academia has a legacy of racist academia, naturally most Europeans disagree with this view, an association of pretigious racist is still racist--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 22:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is about black people. In order to discuss black people intelligently we have to cite scholarly sources explaining who black people are. So far all the sources are from the social constructionist camp. They believe that being black is simply a matter of self-identification and such standards vary from culture to culture so in one cultuire Halle Berry is black, in another culture she is white, in another culture she is mulattoe. That's a valid view but it's a little too wishy washy for me and showing that view and that view alone makes the article incomplete because millions of people believe that race is a valid biological concept and that depending on where most of your ancestors are from you are either white, black, Oriental etc and that it doesn't matter how you self-identify or what culture you live in. All that matters is your DNA. Rushton is the most scholarly proponent of this view point I know of. Most proponents of this view are going to be labelled as racist because they believe race exists and are probably studying races in their profession and that makes them by definition extremely politically incorrect. Perhaps there's a less controversial source out there somewhere but for now let's stick with Rushton because we're not quoting him saying anything controversial (just a simple definition) and straightforward definitions of black people are so difficult to find that I'd like to document all of them (unless it's something really offensive). <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a></dd>

<li>I'll repeat a few points and expand on them because they may have been missed among the many comments on this page, and Kobrakid keeps repeating certain talking points that need to be shot out of the water: quit throwing around loaded words like "eminent" and creditials that have nothing to do with the subject at hand. You're not fooling anyone. Rushton is a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> professor, so that's what the university pays him to do, and that's what he may be considered an expert in (although he may have strange ideas in that field too; I haven't looked into it). Also, according to the American Association of Advancement of Science website, anyone can join that group if they pay the membership fees, so membership does not give anyone special credentials.<a href="http://www.aaas.org/membership/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaas.org/membership/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Sorry, try again. Also the term "race realism" or "race realist" are weasel words that imply that certain views are realistic and correct, when the evidence may show otherwise. Finally, does anyone know how to take this to arbitration? An administrator should make a final ruling verifying that Rushton et al aren't reliable sources according to Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 00:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Two things we can do I think. We can open an RfC here on the talk page regarding the inclusion of <i>facist</i> sources. Or we can open an RfC on Kobrakid and POV pushing. POV pushing and editing against consensus are serious breaches of wikipedia policy. If we opened an RfC about his/her behaviour we can get the wider Wikipedia community involved to scrutinise his/her behviour and the community would decide if there is a case to answer. I've seem RfC's opened about editors for far less than this blatant POV pushing. This user is clearly has a right wing racist agenda to push and is not interested in creating a balanced encyclopaedia, but wants to create some sort of platform for the white supremacist movement. I would say this is a clear attempt to damage the credibility of Wikipedia, and therefore it constitutes complex vandalism. Maybe we should start with an RfC on the talk page. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

Other editors feel that this is a North American point of view, and that the term Black people includes many different groups of dark skinned people that are not all of recent African origin, and do not represent closely related descendants from a recent discrete single population.

<p>I am in concert with the latter group. My opinions and contributions in this regard are on record in earlier versions of the article and on the article talk page. As an international enterprise, Wikipedia should reflect a broader notion of "black people" than is represented here.

<p>U could use that argument for every single citation in wiki, then what would be the point, if she said that then it is valid as a critic. most statements including yours are a POV, it is your take on you being brown, some say there is no brown race, some say there is no black race--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 00:20, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Black is a social contruction, you dont need to study race to make the statement she made. Diop, Shahadah, and the other guys definately dont represent all Black people, actually ones says he dont support the term. so your argument for exclusion isnt valid. Her statement is valid on content as well. Black identity was born out of the civil rights, and in the UK Indians are called BLACK. in South Africa they were called Black.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 00:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indians are called "brown" or "Asian" in UK and in most African countries. Where u get that Idea from we get called black? <i>Black is a social contruction</i>... yes absolutely, like "white" is or like "brown" is. <i>you dont need to study race to make the statement she made</i>.. yess I dont need to study to make MY statement either. doesnt mean I'm right. <i>Black identity was born out of the civil rights</i>.. once more ur right.

<p>Why are extremist non-scholary sources like Miss Rajasingam allowed in the article while scholary academic sources like these were forced out of the article:</p>

Thus, American Negroids are individuals most of whose ancestors from 15 to 5000 generations ago were sub- Saharan African. Specifying 'most' more precisely in a way that captures ordinary usage may not be possible.

</ul>
<p>-</p>
<ul>
<li>Sally Satel of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy_Review_248e.html" title="Policy Review">Policy Review</a> stated “The entities we call ‘racial groups’ essentially represent individuals united by a common descent — a huge extended family, as evolutionary biologists like to say.

<p>I tried to make this article more inclusive of a wider range of viewpoints from around the world and to have a family of articles that explored this. I tried to make room for scientific material as well as cultural and social material. However, the agenda of a certain class of Black Americans did not match with this, and the angry edit warring and visciousness among the black americans of disagreeing views, and between black americans and all others just became unbearable. And many good people have been chased away over the months and years. And if you look in the histories, you will see huge volumes of material has been flushed down the toilet as well.

<p>In most of Colonial Britian many people who were not African were called black. Black is a word used for non-White people, in the Black History month in the UK it is used to included Indians, and even Jewish issues. this article reflects all def of black some you may agree with and some you may disagree with. Ghandi was called Black by White South Africans (Black Bast you know the rest, thats what he was called), the Austrailian poeple were called Black by white settlers. Arabs are called Sand N&amp;&amp;g by American whites. Clearly Blackness is not limited to Africa, actually Hausa, Fulani, Amhara etc etc do not call themselves black, Somali people in the UK have a special box called Somali they do not tick the Black box, while Ethiopians do. so respect it isnt a "black and white" issue.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 02:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well i dont know about that but they should be included, I know the biological stuff got chopped because Biology is a science and if these people are ranting about Sub-Saharan genetics that is false science especially if they arent into genetics.

<p>This person is giving a scientific definition:</p>
<p>Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop also feels that the standard conceptions of black people fall short, stating: "There are two well-defined Black races: one has a black skin and woolly hair; the other also has black skin, often exceptionally black, with straight hair, aquiline nose, thin lips, an acute cheekbone angle. We find a prototype of this race in India: the Dravidian. It is also known that certain Nubians likewise belong to the same Negro type...Thus, it is inexact, anti-scientific, to do anthropological research, encounter a Dravidian type, and then conclude that the Negro type is absent."</p>
<p>Why is he allowed to talk science when far superior scholars are taken out? It's because he supports the POV of the bullies who dominate the article. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></p>

<li>If you have a legitimate reason for removing a source (based on Wikipedia guidelines), please do so, and clearly explain why. As for your so-called "far superior scholars", being removed, the reasons have been clearly explained several times on this discussion page. The three non-biologists were removed as sources in the Biology section because they aren't reliable sources according to Wikipedia guidelines.

<dd>Rushton doesn't support any political agenda. True a lot of racists exploit Rushton's work to justify their disgusting political agendas, but Rushton himself does not publicly support any political agenda. There's not even any evidence of Rushton being right-wing in his politics. In fact he's stated that he finds it very difficult to relate to political debates because he only looks at things from a scientific perspective. Have you ever seen Rushton on TV? He's not at all the raving right-wing racist you make him to be, but instead he's very calm civil open minded academic. And even if he did have a political agenda, 90% of people quoted in wikipedia probably have political opinions. So once someone makes a political statement they can never be quoted in wikipedia. In that case we should edit out everyone from this article. So Rushton's good enough to be published in peer reviewed academic journals but he's not good enough to be briefly quoted in wikipedia? Yet people who couldn't get published in a peer reviewed academic journal if their life depended on it dominate this article. The bottom line is this article is one sided because it claims black people are nothing more than a social construction and acts as though no other views exist. That's extremely dishonest and extremely misleading. There should be a brief sub-section at the end of the socio-political definitions section that's called alternatives to social constructionism that simply makes clear that some people define blacks as a racial category where Rushton, Levin and Sally are quoted. Otherwise the article is just promoting one sided anti-racialist propoganda and that's very POV. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Philippe_Rushton_c22d.html" title="J. Philippe Rushton">J.

Just because he doesn't rant and rave on TV doesn't mean he lacks a blatant political agenda. One can be calm and still promote a fringe or extreme view. And again, he is a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> professor, not a biologist or geneticist, so he should not be cited as an expert on biology or genetics. Maybe he can be considered a reliable source on other topics, but not science.

<dd>So what if Rushton is president of the pioneer fund. The pioneer fund is a perfectly legitimate organization, and its tax exempt, a status it would be denied if it promoted political propaganda. True some of its founders in the 1930s were racists, but was there anyone who wasn’t a racist in the 1930s? In the past several decades the pioneer fund has been leading the way in advancing the study of human genetic diversity, brain size and intelligence, twin studies. Two of its grantees are among the most cited psychologists of all time (Hans J. Eysenck, Arthur R. Jensen). One won a Nobel Prize (William B. Shockley). Three are Guggenheim Fellows (Arthur R. Jensen, Ernest van den Haag, and J. Philippe Rushton). Pioneer grantees have been elected as the presidents of the American Psychological Association, the American Educational Research Association, the British Psychological Society, the Behavior Genetics Association, the Psychometric Society, the Society for Psychophysiological Research, the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology, and the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences. Grantees currently serve on the editorial boards of major academic journals, including three on the board of Personality and Individual Differences, and three on the editorial board of the journal Intelligence.</dd>

<dd>Again, you can’t just go around censoring well-cited scholarly material from wikipedia because you feel it could in some way be used to support a political opinion you don’t agree with. As editors we must be non-partisan and allow in all notable opinions, and Rushton is certainly notable. Even if you think someone’s racist, that’s not a good reason to censor them from this article because racism has played a huge role historically in defining contemporary black identity, and you can’t have a complete understanding of black identity unless you understand how racists identify someone as black, and so precise definitions should never be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rushton has published a blizzard of scholarly articles about black people in peer reviewed academic journals so his definition of black people is obviously accepted by much of the academic community. It’s fine to have a section explaining how black-power activists define a black person, but people should know that that’s not how the term is defined when used in academic research. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

<dd>If you read the talk page, they took out Satel, Rushton, and Levin because they are not geneticists, even though Rushton teaches a university course on race.

<dd>That's absurd. How are definitions of black people off topic in a black people article? What was marginal about them? Some of the people being quoted may be controversial but the definitions being quoted are consistent with how the term is used in the real world. If you want to see marginal look at the quotes claiming that Dravidians are black. That's marginal in the extreme.

However, when it comes to scientific topics such as biology or genetics, it is imperative that the people commenting on it be experts in those fields.

<dd>Just because Rushton is a psychologist does not mean he can’t give an opinion that relates to evolutionary biology, because evolutionary biology is a multidisciplinary field which includes <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a>. If peer reviewed academic journals allow him to express his opinions on evolutionary biology, then who are we to censor Rushton? It’s absurd to imply that all opinions given in wikipedia must be confined to the precise field where someone got their degree. No field is precise, and all academic disciplines overlap and blend into one another. And what’s with your double standard of claiming any wacko can be an expert on sociology but only a biologist can talk biology. Such a condescending attitude is a major insult to all the bright hardworking sociologists who invested a life time acquiring expertise in their domain and wouldn’’t appreciate you implying that expertise in their field does not exist. And Rushton is a sociobiologist because sociobiology is a multidisciplinary field that includes evolutionary psychology. And if you felt the biology section was dominated by one POV you should have balanced it by adding alternative definitions of a black person from a biology perspective. I doubt you would find any though, because “black” has a very precise meaning when applied in science. But I’m not even arguing there should be a biology section, only that the definitions be included somewhere in the article. If you don’t like the title race realism definitions, then perhaps racialist definitions would be more appropriate? I just want the definitions included because as it stands now, the article is only promoting the view that blacks are an arbitrarily defined socio-political group, and this ignores the fact that most people believe that blacks are an objective category of nature with an exact definition <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

<dd>Well neither of us has done a scientific poll of what most people in the real world think, but I've very frequently heard comments that imply many people believe that it's possible to look black without actually being black. People say things like "Oh I thought all these years she was black but it turns out she's biracial" or terms like <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadroon.html" title="Quadroon">quadroon</a> and web sites like halfblack.com or people who say Tiger Woods is a quarter black. All of this implies that millions of people believe that being black has an exact definition determined by blood quantum. That’s why I think it’s important and interesting to have a racialist section where people can spell out exactly the precise type and amount of ancestry racialists believe makes you black. It’s boring for the entire article to just be social constructionists who argue blacks are whoever looks black or whoever identifies as black. People expect more exact information from an encyclopedia and people coming here will want more specific answered. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

<li>If you feel there should be more scientific information, feel free to post legitimate information from reliable sources who are experts in the field of science. Rushton and the two other politically-motivated non-scientists do not meet Wikipedia's guidelines for reliable sources on the scientific definition of race. Also, after looking at Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialism</a>, I'm not sure why you think that racialist opinions would be a positive addition to this article. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 15:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I’ve already explained to you that Rushton is indeed a scientist who teaches a course on race at a prestigious university, publishes scientific articles on race in peer reviewed academic journals, and although the pioneer fund has been maligned for funding politically incorrect research, it is tax exempt and thus does not meet the legal definition of a political organization. My goal is not to add more science to this article but rather to make sure all notable perspectives on who is black get documented. I came to this article to find out exactly who people are talking about when they use the word black and so it’s imperative that we include as many different kinds of perspectives as possible. Rushton, Levin, and Satel were not quoted saying anything derogatory about black people, they were simply quoted saying which people they considered to be members of the black category, sometimes with a degree of precision not seen in any of the other definitions in the article. As a user of an encyclopedia I want to see a complete discussion on who is black and I want specifics. If some notable figure thinks Dravidians are black I want to know about it. If someone thinks all non-whites are black I want to know about it. If someone thinks only people of recent African descent are black, I want to know about it. If someone thinks you need to have most of your ancestors born in sub-Saharan Africa to be black I want to know that too. And if someone like Michael Levin thinks anyone with less than 75% sub-Saharan ancestry is not black, then I want to know that. If the South African government under apartheid thought that only people with hair curly enough to get a pencil stuck in were black I want to know that. If the state of Mississipi thought that anyone with more than 1/128th sub-Saharan ancestry was black I want to know that too. But people keep removing fascinating information because it doesn’t conform to whatever agenda they’re supporting and robbing the article of diversity causing editors like Fill to leave in disgust. As Paul B stated, all notable opinions are welcome in this article and this knee-jerk tendency to impulsively remove anything that is even remotely politically incorrect is ruining this article. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

However, they should absolutely not be included as reliable and neutral experts on biology or genetics, becuase they do not meet Wikipedia standards for that. As I mentioned earlier, it would be nice if a Wikipedia administer could settle this once and for all, so I don'y have to keep explaining why non-bioligists and non-geneticists cannot be presented as reliable sources on those scientific fields. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Psychology is a valid science and psychologists who study <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> qualify as evolutionary biologists (and sociobiologists) because evolutionary biology is a multi-disciplinary field not confined to genetics only. The pioneer fund was founded in part by eugenicists but that was back in the 1930s when virtually all academics were racists. It's been accused of scientific racism but that's an unfair label that gets slapped on any researcher who dares to suggest that races may differ in intelligence just as afrocentric is an unfair label that gets slapped on any researcher who dares to suggest that black people had an early civilization. But unlike the so-called Afrocentric scholars, Rushton is published in peer reviewed academic journals which means he meets the highest standards of objective scholarship. Now I agree that none of these people are geneticists and so putting them in a biology section just because one of them is an evolutionary biologist gives the a little too much credibility which is why I'm insisting we just put them in a section called racialist definitions or alternatives to social constructionism. Now in that section we can put a disclaimer that they have been accused of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_racism.html" title="Scientific racism">scientific racism</a> or whatever other accusation you can find a source for(in fact I'll even find the sources for you). I don't care. Again it's not my goal to give these people credibility, but it is my goal to make sure all notable opinions about who is black get documented in this article because I come here to find out exactly who is considered black and how the standard varies accross cultures, time periods, ideologies, political perspectives, etc. So it sounds like we agree that these definitions can be included in the article, just not in a biology section, and with strong disclaimers accompanying them. Because let's get real. People come to this article not just to see who black people consider black. Black readers already know that. They want to know who white people consider black, and even if you think some of these whites are racist, people especially want to know who white racists consider black because white racism has informed so much of the identity of black people around the world. Now I'not suggesting we open this article up to racist or racialist opinions of black people (that would indeed be off topic), but I do think it's imperative that we document who racialists consider to be black because that's really the question we come to this article to get answered: Who is considered black? <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a></dd>

<p>This person is giving a scientific definition: also feels that the standard conceptions of black people fall short, stating: "There are two well-defined Black races: one has a black skin and woolly hair; the other also has black skin, often exceptionally black, with straight hair, aquiline nose, thin lips, an acute cheekbone angle. We find a prototype of this race in India: the Dravidian. It is also known that certain Nubians likewise belong to the same Negro type...Thus, it is inexact, anti-scientific, to do anthropological research, encounter a Dravidian type, and then conclude that the Negro type is absent."</p>

<p>First of all. Oh my f****ng god. I cant bellieve that some people think that my first comment on <i>scientific definition</i> was seriously. It just should show that hes comparison of Blacks and Dravdians is absolutly loosly. Like one has bright nose the other hasnt. One has curly hairs the other has straight hairs. And one has fat ass the other hasnt any at all... and so on. And saying that both have dark skin, thats why they have to be from the same "race". My statement is more BS than his was. Hell no I'm not European, and I dont want to be. I could have used EastAsians as an example that those Afrocentrists dont go fury. I googled that Mr. Diop and what do we see.... <i>Dalit: The Black untouchables of India</i>,The <i>African origin of Civilization</i> , and so on. Im not sure if everything what they show was written by him. But thats a sign of Afrocentrism for me. Why dont we go back in history and mention those racist white "scientists" who thought Blacks are in between Monkeys and Whites. Or those who thaught everyone with darker skinclouor is inferior. That Mr. Diops "scientifical" cognitions are outdated some generations ago. They aint as much absurd and inacceptable as that of those white racists but still not authentic.</p>

<dd>I see your point. Virtually anyone who believes that any early civilation in the world was black gets labled as Afrocentric. It's used as a way of marginalizing them. But it might not be that these people are Afrocentric, it could be that mainstream history is Eurocentric, so relative to the majority of scholars, these people are Afrocentric. We probably should make clear that these opinions are not considered mainstream, but calling them Afrocentric implies that black scholars who believe blacks played a role in world history are somehow biased because of their race.

<p>lets avoid the term unless it applies. many say good things about Africa and should be weighted on content not origin or implication. To thus speak of glorious Africa is just factual history, to speak negative of Africa as pre-civilized is Eurocentric, let the content determine the label. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 11:28, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
