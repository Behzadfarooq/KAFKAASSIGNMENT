	    <p>The Life Of Black Brendon</p>
<p><br />
The Early Days:</p>
<p>Black Brendon was born into this world in a small town in Iowa where a lot of meth is made. His mother met a guy named Dino at a bike rally in Iowa and moved in with him. Unfortunately, the two feuded over a parking ticket and split up and his mother became a profesional nail artist. Around the age of 7 Black Brendon's mother met her soon to be husband and moved into an apartment with him in the town of Mound, MN. On one sunny day Black Brendon and his friend were racing to the park when out of no where Black Brendon was stuck by a chevy. The man driving felt so bad for striking a young boy with a car that he bought him a coke and everything was even steven. Soon after Black Brendon and his family moved into another close by apartment. While Black Brendon and his BFF at the time were walking around the complex they got into a fight with the landlord and were evicted from there apartment. This caused his family to move again to the town of Medina, MN where the landlord was a total crack head and demanded the rent early. Once again they moved and this time to the town of Orono.</p>
<p>The Latter Days:</p>
<p>At the age of 13 Black Brendon moved into the school district of Orono for 8th grade. The first kid he got to know was Josh, whom he knew was a loser but still found it in his heart to be nice. Soon after he met Tyler, the gay one who read books. Things really took off in 9th grade begining with Drew giving Black Brendon his AIM SN. Then he started hanging out with him and this little italian smart ass who spoke his mind too much named Paul. A quick side note, Black Brendon cut his leg on a piece of glass sticking out of a gargabe glass which he didn't even feel and was first pointed out to him by his mom who considered him irrisponsible. Then he got a piece of an apple stuck in his nose that hurt so bad that he couldn't blow out. So Black Brendon had to go to a doctor to get it taken out. The apple piece looked like a big ugly bugger with blood all over it. Then he and his family went to Iowa for a little bit. In Iowa, Black Brendon was jumping his bike and he hurt his arm. After this he came back to Minnesota and he and his friends found a porno. So they each took turns jacking off to it behind a tree. Then he started making friends in Orono and doing stuff with them including putting snakes on girls dogs and 4-wheeled. On one particular day in Mr. Hansons Science class it somehow got out that Black Brendon was born in Iowa and also a Jahova. Almost the entire class made some fun of him throughout the class including notibles: Paul, Sam, Justin, and Calvin. Black Brendon, fed up with the name calling and Mr. Hanson laughing, stormed out of the room. Another time Black Brendon stormed out was in one fine day in Health class. Word had gotton out that Black Brendon's grandmother had been run over by a tractor. Tommy Peterson, who had randomly tuned into the conversation and only heard the words "run over by a tractor" assumed that Black Brendon had been run over do to his misshaven eyebrows and the comotion among people laughing from Tommys comment on what he believed caused him to storm out. On the last day of 9th grade Black Brendon "spilled" 4 bottles of pop over this girl named Sara. Around that time the phrase "game over" was born. Over the summer Black Brendon became better friends with his Orono friends. In the late summmer Black Brendon and some of his friends including Paul, Jacob, Ruby, and Tyler went to Valley Fair. The Day prior to this the side door to this insanly cool retro mini van had fallen off and his mother had made sure everyone was aware. Black Brendon made an effort to take a picture with everyone odd looking or acting that day. Later towards the begining of 10th grade Black Brendon and friends had found a hobo shed which consisted of 5 axe bottles, 1 machette, 1 deer head, one huge piss stained bed, and a birds nest light bulb. So they cut down a tree and drove away. There is much more to this complex mind but im tired of typing.</p>
