<p>The Black Friday demonstration was associated with the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_movement.html" title="Reform movement">reform</a> activities started in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> following the death of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Naseem_73af.html" title="Evan Naseem">Evan Naseem</a>. His death and the following <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Maldives_civil_unrest_01f9.html" title="2003 Maldives civil unrest">riots of September 20</a> were partly responsible for the formation of the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maldivian_Democratic_Party_0064.html" title="Maldivian Democratic Party">Maldivian Democratic Party</a> (MDP) in exile in neighboring <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. Ever since the MDP's formation, the Maldivian <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> has been under constant international pressure. The opposition movement has often accused President <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maumoon_Abdul_Gayoom_2819.html" title="Maumoon Abdul Gayoom">Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a> of being a brutal <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> who uses fear and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimidation.html" title="Intimidation">intimidation</a> to rule. Gayoom's critics are often said to be arrested and tortured in jail, an allegation he continuously denies.</p>

<p>Facing mounting pressure from both the local opposition and from abroad, Gayoom came up with a reform agenda in mid-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. With this <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agenda.html" title="Agenda">agenda</a> he took the unusual step of allowing citizens to openly <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">debate</a> the reforms in public. The <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maldivian_Democratic_Party_0064.html" title="Maldivian Democratic Party">MDP</a> quickly organized several debates in the name of <i>Minivan Bahus</i>. Though Gayoom allowed <i>debates</i>, no one from the government ever attended. Instead, citizens and members of the opposition movement gathered and heavily criticized Gayoom. In the face of this previously unforeseen <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism.html" title="Criticism">criticism</a>, after just six debates Gayoom put an end to them when his government forbade public schools from hosting the meetings. Though the public was allowed just six debates, the reform activities had gained such <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentum.html" title="Momentum">momentum</a> that citizens were now willing to gather in public places and raise their voices. Every night people started gathering near Tetrapod <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monument.html" title="Monument">Monument</a>, located at the east end of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9.html" title="Malé">Malé</a>. All opposition activities, from debates to these gatherings, were recorded by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Service_%28Maldives%29_b292.html" title="National Security Service (Maldives)">NSS</a>.</p>
<p>Due to "National security concerns," the gatherings were soon banned by the heavy presence of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>. This slowed the gaining momentum of the reform activities. Several key reformists were allegedly blacklisted and subsequently put under surveillance.</p>

People gathered in Republican Square, infront of Shaheed Hussain Adam Building</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When police summoned Mr. Mohamed Yoosuf, a few reform activists decided to gather near Republican Square to inquire about Yoosuf's detention. What started as a vigil at Republican Square in Malé at dusk on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, turned into a mass gathering of people demanding democratic reform.</p>
<p>As the crowd grew larger and the demands to free Mr. Yoosuf became louder, he was released that afternoon. However, the protesters demanded four other reformists detained in Dhoonidhoo detention centre be transferred to Malé. They also called for the release of Naushad Waheed, Ahmed Didi, Mohamed Zaki and Fathimath Nisreen; all who were detained, according to opposition movement, without a fair trial. By early morning <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, a large crowd had gathered near Republican Square, the NSS building and Shaheed Hussain Adam Building. Initially the NSS and government minister Ilyas Ibrahim unsuccessfully tried to win the trust of the crowd by addressing the crowd over a <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaphone.html" title="Megaphone">megaphone</a>. When they failed, they asked the pro-reformist MP Ibrahim Ismail (Ibra) to address the crowd in front of the NSS building. He convinced the crowd to move into nearby Republican Square.</p>
<p>After moving the crowed into Republican Square, Ibrahim Ismail addressed the crowd and assured them he would take their demands to the NSS authorities for their consideration. The crowd then gave its demand to Ibrahim Ismail, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release of the detained reformists</li>
<li>Release of Sandhaanu prisoners (Writers of an Internet magazine)</li>
<li>Release of <a href="../../../n/a/u/Naushad_Waheed_1ea5.html" title="Naushad Waheed">Naushad Waheed</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">Artist</a> and reformist)</li>
<li>Resignation of the President <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maumoon_Abdul_Gayoom_2819.html" title="Maumoon Abdul Gayoom">Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a></li>
<li>Resignation of Yameen Abdul Gayoom (Minister of Trade and brother of Gayoom)</li>
<li>Resignation of Abdullah Hameed (Minister of Atolls and brother of Gayoom)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the early morning, the reformists were released. They came directly from the Dhoonidhoo detention centre to Republican Square. There they addressed to the crowed, criticized <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maumoon_Abdul_Gayoom_2819.html" title="Maumoon Abdul Gayoom">Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a> and called for his resignation. They also demanded the demonstration to be lived on state run <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a>. However no news of the protest was transmitted yet. The crowed continued to grow and "took a life of its own", as later described by Ibrahim Ismail in his interview on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>.</p>
<p>At around 0700hrs? Maafushi jail was broken, thinking the government was overthrown, as the detainees got the news of the unusual protest in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9.html" title="Malé">Malé</a>. They headed to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9.html" title="Malé">Malé</a> in two Dhonis. However they were intercepted by NSS coast guard. One of the Dhonis was sunk and the other gassed with tear gas.</p>

<p>As the calling for <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maumoon_Abdul_Gayoom_2819.html" title="Maumoon Abdul Gayoom">Gayoom</a>'s <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resignation.html" title="Resignation">resignation</a> got louder and stronger, few pro-government people gathered to Republican Square.

Since international <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> was reporting the event, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Service_%28Maldives%29_b292.html" title="National Security Service (Maldives)">NSS</a> needed a valid and justifiable reason to use force to disperse the crowd. In several occasions the pro-government crowd tried to instigate violence. However reformists ignored them and continued the demonstration, calling for the resignation.</p>
<p>At around 0830hrs a person named Hussain Yoosuf stabbed two <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> officers. He is one of the many people who testified before the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee.html" title="Committee">commission</a> established to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investigate.html" title="Investigate">investigate</a> the death of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Naseem_73af.html" title="Evan Naseem">Evan Naseem</a>. After this incident there was a report of fire in the nearby Huravee Building, a government <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_building.html" title="Office building">office building</a>. NSS blamed the crowd for starting the fire. In addition to this, there came a group of people who threw <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottles.html" title="Bottles">bottles</a> and such objects towards the Police Headquarters. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protesters.html" title="Protesters">protesters</a> tried to stop them without any success.

At 2000hrs news, after declaring the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Emergency_0b38.html" title="State of Emergency">State of Emergency</a>, TVM downplays the size of the protesters and calls the gathering "illegal in every possible sense"</p>

Security was tight around <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9.html" title="Malé">Malé</a> due to the obvious perceptibility of such a demonstration to mark this anniversary. Two days before, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, NSS announced that they will be conducting a huge training in Malé for four days, starting from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Despite heavy police presence, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_Nasheed_1ead.html" title="Mohamed Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a> decided to sit right in the center of the Republican square with his colleagues. Minutes later he was approached by a team of Maldives Police Service. They approached him and asked him to simply "go away" from there. Nasheed demanded to know why he was asked to leave while he is not committing anything <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal.html" title="Illegal">illegal</a>. The leader of this team responded by saying such gatherings are illegal and they will have to remove him by <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force.html" title="Force">force</a> if not obeyed within five minutes. To this <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimatum.html" title="Ultimatum">ultimatum</a>, Nasheed responded by saying. "You will give us five minuts, after that what? you will beat us to death?". At one time Nasheed asked the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> to join them, since he is not <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inciting.html" title="Inciting">inciting</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a> but <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">peacefully</a> sitting there. since he refused to leave the spot, the police team moved towards the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a> pole few meters away.</p>
<p>At around 4:23pm, <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_police.html" title="Riot police">riot police</a> moved into republican square. Soon they surrounded <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_Nasheed_1ead.html" title="Mohamed Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a> along with other members of the party, present with him. Nasheed and his colleagues still refuse to standup. Members of riot police then forcefully removed them and had them taken into the nearby NSS headquarters. This lead a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Maldives_civil_unrest_37ee.html" title="2005 Maldives civil unrest">civil unrest in Malé and some other atolls</a>, that lasted for three nights.
