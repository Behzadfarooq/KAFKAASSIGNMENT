<p>I am writting about the issue of Macedonia, Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Slavs (like Wikipedia calls the Macedonians) and the problem between Macedonia and Greece about the term Macedonia. I am aware that this issue is largely discussed here, at Wikipedia, and Wikipedia claims that it is trying to take a neutral side. But, that is not the case. Wikipedia is everything except neutral in this question. In the following lines I will explain you why.</p>
<p>From the text in Wikipedia most of the people will conclude that Macedonian nation appeared during the World War 2 and Tito was the one who 'invented' us. The family of my wife (she is Mexican) read this and asked me is it truth. That was actually the first time I read what Wikipedia says about my nation, which was a direct reason for my reaction. My grandfather is born in 1911th. Yesterday I had a talk with him. He took a part in the strugle for independence since 1925th and he took a part in the 2nd world war. He is alive and personal prove that Wikipedia is full of bullshit and lies about our origin. He spent half of his life proving and fighting for that. He was shot 3 times, all 3 from the Bulgarians who wanted to ocupy Macedonia in the Balkan wars and in the WW1 and WW2. Just a 1 min with him will show you how many lies you suport in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I tried to edit some of the text few days ago, but everithing I wrote was deleted. And all I wrote were facts. Fact 1. Macedonians (or Macedonian Slavs, like ONLY Wikipedia, Greece and Cyprus calls us) is the only nation of many living in the area concentrated inside the borders of the geographical region of Macedonia. This is a pure fact, something that you can even find on the CIA web page. Can you give any fact to deny my fact? If you can not, why you erased it from Wikipedia? Fact 2. Republic of Macedonia has diplomatic relations with about 150 countries in the world. Wikipedia says that "at least 20" countries recognize Macedonia under the name Macedonia. Guess what? That number is more than 100. And this is an officially confirmed by our ministery for foreighn affairs. Fact 3. Wikipedia says that my country Contraversialy calls itself Republic of Macedonia. This is a pure example of taking a side in the problem. Why you don't say that Greece contraversialy deny us the use of the name Macedonia? If you intended to be neutral, just write that we have the naming problem with Greece, but do not call my name "contraversial"!!! Fact 4. While explaining about the antient Macedonia, its kings etc. you highly support the claim for their Greek origin. I can give you 1000s of facts that that is not truth and I beleive that some Greek guy can give you 1000s facts that those claims are truth. That was 2400 years ago and there is no chanse for us to know the real situation. We can only guess. But, when you give the Greek suported version, why you ignore the version suported by the newaged Macedonians? In this moment I can give you 10 names of internationally respected scientist supporting our theory. If you are neutral, why you ignore it? Fact 5. Wikipedia says that the Turkish Empire were calling us Bulgarians. Strange, because the Turks were recognizing the uniqueness of our nation since the moment they occupied the teritory of Macedonia. Actually, the Turkish history archives are the biggest prove of our existance, history and culture. Did anyone of you ever read anything from those archives? Even on the birth certificate of Khemal Ataturk says that he is born in Bitola, Macedonia. And his autobiography is full of memories of his childhood spend with the Macedonians. Fact 6. Wikipedia ignores the egsodus of the Macedonian people from Greece and says they were running because they were supporters of the comunists. 1/3 of the Macedonians have origin from this part of Macedonia. They were runned away from there by force and you can find many historical proves for that. Again, big part of my family has origin from there. As a matter of fact, my grand-grand father was married to a Greek woman, my grand-grand mother. But, no matter of that, his house was burned and he was forced to run away for his life and the life of his family. How dare you deny this? Do you know that even today my grand father is not allowed to visit Greece, because he was a kid when his family runned away from there? Fact 7. There are about 500 000 Macedonians that live outside Macedonia, mostly in Canada, Australia, USA, Sweden etc. At least 1/3 moved there before 1930s. If we were a product of Tito, how can you explain that even they feel of Macedonian nationality? I have a family in USA which moved there in 1927th. Their ancestors (my cousins) do not even know how to talk Macedonian well. But, they still feel Macedonian. One of them is even one of the financiers of the party of the Macedonians in Bulgaria, trying to help their strugle to keep their national identity. I repeat, first time he visited Macedonia was in 1995th, far after Tito. And his family moved in USA in 1927th, far before Tito. Fact 8. Wikipedia claims that the book of Macedonian songs by Dimitar Miladinov is actually Bulgarian. Have you maybe seen a original copy of the book, printed in Croatia? IT says clearly "Macedonian". Not to mention that the same author wrote one of the most important books in the Macedonian history "For the Macedonian issues", again printed in Croatia, where it clearly talks about the Macedonian nation and non-Bulgarian origin.</p>
<p>All this was simply erased from the database. I didn't erase anything when editing these pages, I support the other side and I do not want to hide their facts. But why Wikipedia wants to hide our facts, which show that we are not a product of Tito's ambitions for the Aegean Sea. In Tito's time, the Yugoslav army was far superior in the region. If he wanted the Aegean Sea, he would get it very easily.</p>
<p>Many things in Wikipedia are very offensive for the nowdays Macedonians. Wikipedia simply ignores us, gives us a new name and supports the theories of denial of our existance, culture and history.</p>
<p>I will try to give you an example that includes with Mexico. I beleive that you know that the Maya civilisation was invaded by the Spanish kingdom. Spanish were ruling Mexico for centuries and millions of Spanish people moved at Mexican teritory. Later, after the liberation war, Mexicans formed its own country. Fact 1. Mayas were living in Mexico (same as Antique Macedonians). Fact 2. Spanish invaded them and great number of Spanish people moved to Mexico (The Slavs moved on the theritory of Macedonia and there was no reported fights or movements of people away from the teritory where the Slavs settled). Fact 3. Nowdays, everyone of the Mexican is aware that they are partly Spanish, but they still have Mayan origin (Wikipedia says that the people living in Republic of Macedonia are Slavs. When there was no reported resetling of the Antique Macedonians, how is possible they not to mix with the Slavs? It is a fact that the nowdays Macedonians are not same as the Antique Macedonians, but they certanly have a significant part of their genes. Same as I beleive that Greece has a part of their Genes, but they are definitly not their direct ancestors). Fact 4. Mexican speak Spanish. Reason: The Spanish culture was superior in that time. (The Antique Macedonians accepted the Helenic culture, including a variation of the Greek language. Reason: the Helenic culture was superior in that time. Everyone who knows at least little history will know that Hellenic and Greek are not synonims. Greek is nation, Hellenic is religion/culture. USA and England both speak English, both are mostly cristians, but they are SEPARATE nations. Aren't they? Same happens to Germany and Austria, or Serbia and Croatia, or Canada and France, or Brazil and Portugal, or the rest of Latin America and Spain)</p>
<p>And here is a comment about the claims of the Bulgarians, that the Macedonians are actually Bulgarians. If that is truth, I am going to kill myself. Bulgarians through the history made the worst for my nation. During the strugle of the Macedonian people for independence from the Turkish empire, at the end of the 19th and begginbing of the 20th century, the Bulgarians were the ones who killed the most of our revolutionaries, including 4 members of my close family which were members of the Macedonian revolutionary organization (VMRO). Whis is not something that I was told by Tito. My grandfather (the same grandfather from above) was in fact a member of the same organization. He personaly knew many of the revolutioners that Bulgarians claim are theirs, including 2 of the leaders: Goce Delcev and Gorce Petrov. They were Macedonians and they all gave their lives for free and independent Macedonia and they had nothing to do with Bulgaria. There was a part of them who were Bulgarians inserted in the organizations, who were actually the killers of the real Macedonian revolutioners, because it was in Bulgarian interest to weaken the organization, so they could take the lead in the organization and later put Macedonia in the hands of the Bulgarians. Thanks god, they did not succeed. Wikipedia claims that VMRO was pro-Bulgarian and the revolutioners were Bulgarian fighters. You suposed to see the face of my 94 year old grandfather when I told him your claims. Neurtal Wikipedia? I do not think so.</p>
<p>At the end I have to ask for Wikipedia NOT TO TAKE A SIDE IN THIS. I am not asking to remove the Greek and Bulgarian side of the story. But, why you ignore our claims, which are suported by many non-Greek and non-Bulgarian scientists and very largely through the web. There are just about 2-2.5 million Macedonians around the world. We do not have enought influence and strenght as Greece has, which is much more powerful and richer country than Macedonia. The Macedonian-Greek question is too hard and too complicated to solve. History can be interpreted in 1000 ways, especially on a teritory like the Balcany, where there are so many nations on so little space. Fortunately, DNA testings are getting more and more reliable and soon it will be possible to be used to acuratelly show the origin of our nations. I hope that then the denyal of me, my history, culture and existance will finaly stop. It is very disapointing that Wikipedia takes a part in all that.</p>

<hr />
<p>ALL the Macedonian history (the one that the Macedonians, the one that Wikipedia calls Macedonian Slavs) before the 6th century is given in Wikipedia as Greek history. I am talking mostly about the Antient Macedonia. I do not claim that Macedonians (Macedonian Slavs in Wikipedia) have the exclusive right to this history. But, Greece can not have that right eighter. It is a history that this region shares and both, we (Macedonians) and Greeks have a part of our origin from those people. In the same time ALL the Macedonian history after the 6th century is given in Wikipedia as Bulgarian history. I am talking about the Wikipedia claims that in the 9th century the Macedonian Slavs got Bulgarized or assimilated by Greece, that in the 10th century Macedonia become a center of Bulgaria (which is not truth, because there are 1000s of hard proves and writtings found in Ohrid denying the Bulgarian claims), the tzar Samoil kingdom (which was everything than Bulgarian, because he had several fights with them and won in all and you can find again 1000s of proves in his fortress in Ohrod), then the Macedonian Ohrid Archbishopry which was clearly Macedonian and everything else than Bulgarian, with dressings and crowns with a completely different stile than the Bulgarian ones. Later Wikipedia claims that after 1018th Byzantine Empire makes Macedonia a Bulgarian province, but it doesn't say the reason for it (the Bulgarians were fighting at his side, so this was his reward towards them, something that will happen in the WW2, when the biggest part of Macedonia will be given to Bulgaria by the Germans. 3 of 4 sons of Samoil were actually latter killed by pro-Bulgarians Another reason is the wish of Vasili II to make a revenge towars Samoil and his people, with denying them, something that Wikipedia does NOW). Then, Wikipedia claims that the Ottoman Empire was seeing us as Bulgarians, which is completely not truth. You have incredible written archives in Turkish museums for this, so you can make a search by your own. All the Macedonian uprisings were characterised as Macedonians. Even the after-capture execution of the leaders was taking place in Skopje, the biggest town in the teritory of Macedonia and not in Sofija, which was the Bulgarian biggest town. Wikipedia says that the following Macedonian history is Bulgarian: IMRO, Ilinden Uprising in Krusevo (where the only newspapers that write about it as Bulgarian uprising are the ones who didn't have their Journalists in the region and were using the Bulgarian sources, which in that time was already liberated, who wanted to show the uprising as their own. Why you don't read some Russian sources which have their journalists in Krusevo and Bitola at the time? Some of the grand sons and grand daughters of the revolutioners are still alive, so you might ask them what their grand-fathers were fighting for. The Krusevo Manifesto says that their goal is FREE and INDEPENDENT Macedonia. Why would their form their own Republic, if they wanted to be part of Bulgaria? All Wikipedia claims simply have no sence), Goce Delchev and the other revolutioners (NOTE: Goce Delchevs nephews which are still alive all spent half of their life proving Goce Delchev's belongding to the Macedonian nation. NOTE 2: Why would he fight for Macedonia's independence if he was Bulgarian? If he was Bulgarian, wouldn't he fight for unification of Macedonia and Bulgaria? Why was he betrayed by a Bulgarian, which resultet in his death in Banica 1903rd? You are corupting our biggest revolutioner, something that we keep as a saint). Wikipedia says that the "St Cyril and Methodius" high school in Solun, where Delchev studied was Bulgarian. How come, when no Bulgarians were living in Solun?... A prove for the Bulgarian, Serb and Greek ambitions to assimilate the Macedonians and take their teritory is the deals and fights they had in the both Balcan wars. They were all exterminating the Macedonians, burning their houses and grabbing their lands, but Wikipedia completely ignores all that. I (and many more) have a living family members who were witnesses of that time. Then, the WW2, when 2/3 of Macedonia was given to Bulgaria by the Germans. Why the hell 100000 Macedonians were fighting against the Bugarians? 25000 died in that war, again many members of my family. And Wikipedia says that we have Bulgarian origin. Why they didn't fight at the Bulgarian side if that was the case? Wikipedia later claims that our country (Republic of Macedonia) was given to us by Tito. What a lie!!! As I said 100000 Macedonians were fighting for freedom. If Tito made us be under the Serbs again, that wouldn't be freedom and 100000 heavily armed Macedonians would continue fighting for it. Even my 94 year old grand-father, who took a part in the WW2 fighting for the partizans, and who was looking at Tito as a saint agrees with this, that he wouldn't rest till he saw Macedonia free. Wikipedia even denies the exodus of 250 000 Macedonians from Greece, saying they were running away by their own. Who the hell will leave his house and land if he was not forced to? My other grand father's house was burned and he was shoot at in order to make him leave his hometown.</p>
<p>On some places Wikipedia says that this 'Bulgarian part' of the history might be Macedonian, but that is very well hidden so it even can hardly be noticed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wikipedia says that 'In 2000 several teenagers threw smoke bombs at the conference of pro-Bulgarian organisation 'Radko' in Skopje causing panic and confusion among the delegates'. Yes, that is completely truth. But in 1000s of years, you find one incident that we caused against the Bulgarians and you wrote it. What about centuries of incidents, murders, wars, assimilation made by the Bulgarians towards the Macedonians? What about the fact that Bulgaria and Greece do not allow the Macedonian parties in those countries to register and take a part in the ellections? This is something that was taken even to the European court. HOW CAN WIKIPEDIA IGNORE THIS??? BTW, Radko had just about 50 delegates and members. Most of them born in Bulgaria and moved latter in their life in Macedonia.</p>
<p>In this case, Wikipedia is only a tool in the Bulgarian and Greek propaganda of denying and stealing the Macedonian history, culture and existance. Just search the internet and you will see that this kind of 'history' can ONLY be found on pro-Bulgarian and pro-Greek web sites. I am a living prove of the existance of the Macedonian nation. And that is not because I was told so by Tito. Macedonians were Macedonians far far before Tito. That is a fact that NOONE can change. How dare you deny everything what I am? How dare you to deny 1000s of killed people, who gave their lives for FREE and INDEPENDENT Macedonia?</p>

<hr />
<p>JUST SEARCH THE WEB, YOU CAN SEE HOW WRONG WIKIPEDIA IS!!! ONLY THE PRO-BULGARIAN AND PRO-GREEK SITES HAVE THE SAME CLAIMS AS WIKIPEDIA. MOST OF THEM ARE ONLY CLAIMS THAT ARE CONFIRMED BY FALSIFICATED LETTERS. The TURKISH WERE SUPERIOR AT THAT TIME AND ARE A NEUTRAL SIDE. AND FAR BIGGER PART OF THEM IDENTIFY THE MACEDONIANS AS SEPARATE NATION, MACEDONIANS. WIKIPEDIA IS NEUTRAL??? I DO NOT THINK SO!!!</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>You know, Wikipedia has nothing to do with this, there's no corporation or entreprise called "Wikipedia". The only persons writing articles here are members like you and I. If it appears as though the pro-Greek and pro-Bulgarian sides are shown a lot more than the pro-Macedonian one, that's probably because there's more Bulgarians and Greeks out there writing and editing the articles. In that case it is your job and that of the other Macedonians to balance it out. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Star_e338.html" title="User:Red Star">User:Red Star</a></p>
<p>By the way, do you expect people to read all of your rant? It's 10 times longer than the article!</p>

WHY DO YOU ONLY USE PRO-GREEK AND PRO-BULGARIAN SOURCES AND NOT NEUTRAL ONES?

<dd>This site isn't neutral, but VERY pro-Macedonian. It might be from Canada, but was set up by immigrant Macedonians, and represents a clear point of view, not being neutral at all.

</ul>
<p>In fact OMO Ilinden - Pirin isn't political party but a small group of enthusiasts of yugoslav macedonian ethnic idea. It isn't registered and probably it never will be registered because of too small number of supporters. According to 2001 census there are only 3 117 ethnic Macedonians in the district.</p>
<p>'<b><i>OMO Ilinden - Pirin has 4, 500 - 5, 000 members, and most of them (99%) say, they are ethnic Macedonians! And, as it happens, they have families who also (as it happens - again!) claim to be of Macedonian ethnic origin!</i></b></p>
<p>And, this is well known fact(for everybody except the Bulgarians themselves!!!): Pirin Macedonia has always been Macedonian! Do not believe? Just face the truth:<a href="http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/MacedonianMinorities/images/eurominority.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/MacedonianMinorities/images/eurominority.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/MacedonianMinorities/images/eurominority.jpg</a></p>

<p>from the main article and pit it here, in the discussion, because this map represents wrong data about demography of Blagoevgrad region and besides that the link leads to macedonian nationalistic site <a href="http://www.historyofmacedonia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.historyofmacedonia.org" rel="nofollow">History of Macedonia</a>, which exposes only the macedonian hypertrophic point of view. I offer you a strong evidence about lies, which traditionally come from Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, about the existence of large macedonian ethnic minority in southwest Bulgaria. This is an excerpt from the sentence of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg from the cases of OMO Ilinden and OMO Ilinden PIRIN Against Bulgaria (20.10.2005):</p>
<p>"Moreover, there was no indication that the applicant party had any real chance of bringing about political changes which would not meet with the approval of everyone on the political stage. Indeed, it was recognised that the public influence of the applicant party was negligible. It therefore appeared that the constitutional court’s holding that the applicant party’s activity truly “imperil[ed] [Bulgaria’s] national security” was not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."</p>
<p>The source of that text is the site of OMO Pirin: <a href="http://omoilindenpirin.org/news/05/echr_bulgaria.html" class="external text" title="http://omoilindenpirin.org/news/05/echr_bulgaria.html" rel="nofollow">Macedonian Minority Organizations, OMO Ilinden and OMO Ilinden PIRIN, Win Landmark European Court of Human Rights Cases Against Bulgaria</a></p>
<p>In the similar case, sentenced on 19 january 2006, the court stated that there are only over 3 000 supporters of the macedonian ethnic movement in this region and, still more, not all of them were active. As it is obvious, there isn't any large macedonian ethnic minority in Blagoevgrad province and there aren't any significant ethnic macedonian organisations in Bulgaria. And, of course, it is logical - after last bulgarian census there are only 3 117 ethnic Macedonians in the district. As a conclusion I beg the macedonian nationalists from Former Yugoslavian Repubilc of Macedonia to stop their interference in the demography data in that article.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine where you will come across Blagoevgrad Province as Pirin Macedonia. This is not Greece with a province of Macedonia that is referred to as such by the European Union. This is Bulgaria and Sofia has not presented any 'Pirin Macedonia' region of province to the EU. So we have to accept that it is the wishful thinking of Skopje dreamers. I have no problem with that but this is not the place to dream, but to present facts. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 12:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To your suprise, the name is used by Bulgarians too — in a historical context and indeed very often by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization_-_Bulgarian_National_Movement_e6bb.html" title="Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Bulgarian National Movement">the modern IMRO</a>. If you have to call the slice of Macedonia that's today in Bulgaria somehow, you would call it <i>Pirin Macedonia</i>. I find the name quite neutral and unoffensive, although I understand you concerns, because <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonism.html" title="Macedonism">Macedonists</a> like to emphasize the <i>Macedonia</i> part of the name. But they surely know <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> is a disambiguation page in Wikipedia&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Also, have you ever thought that offending the others isn't the right way to deal with being offended? There are certain <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">well-thought-over principles</a> of Wikipedia that you should make yourself familiar with. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 20:40, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Todor, you have just proved my point, IMRO! talks about Pirin Macedonia and we know what they want. But most Bulgarians have no idea what Pirin Macedonia means. Perhaps you disagree but there are no statistics either way. But that is not the main issue. The real situation why this has to be removed is because there are no official documents in Bulgaria, Europe or UN with that 'province' and there are no maps with that name (and please do not tell me you found one or two in Skopje or IMRO offices). So how can we justify placing 'Pirin Macedonia' up in the first paragraph? If there are some Greeks who, because of 'Nevrokop' and 'Melenikio' and a few other villages where Greek used to live, might call it 'Greek Macedonia', do we have to mention that as well? You bet no! I do not find the name 'Western Bulgaria' offensive for Republic of Macedonia and many Bulgarian call it like that. So I hope you will agree to include 'Western Bulgaria' in Republic of Macedonia and I will agree to keep Pirin Macedonia. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 14:47, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Errr, are you sure you know that IMRO is? I don't mean <i>this</i> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization-Democratic_Party_for_Macedonian_National_Unity_a024.html" title="Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity">IMRO</a> nor even the historical <a href="../../../i/m/r/IMRO_acab.html" title="IMRO">IMRO</a>, I mean the modern Bulgarian <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization_-_Bulgarian_National_Movement_e6bb.html" title="Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Bulgarian National Movement">IMRO</a>. It's a perfectly patriotic and pro-Bulgarian organization, espacially regarding the Macedonian issues, what's the problem with it?</dd>
<dd>Generally, names of historical regions or their parts are not displayed on maps when not an official entity, but this does not mean they don't exist.</dd>
<dd>Also, the name is not offensive itself — it's not 'Northern Ethnic Macedonia', it just describes it as part of the region (because that's what it is) based on one of its main features. It's not used only by ethnic Macedonians, but also by neutral sources, as proven.</dd>
<dd>The name is incredibly offensive to the Macedonians, believe me. They get offended even when people call their country FYROM, not to mention that.</dd>
<dd>Finally, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Macedonia_f584.html" title="Greek Macedonia">Greek Macedonia</a> is a different thing. And the name Pirin Macedonia doesn't imply in any way that the area's population is ethnic Macedonian (because it's never been, and a Macedonian national consciousness never formed there). <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 17:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I see that you are happy with the terms used but I do not know which are the 'neutral sources' you are referring; I am sure you are right but please point them out.</dd>
<dd>But here is one of my examples. The government in the republic of macedonia published many books claiming territories from every single neighbour. For Bulgaria we have, <b>Historical truth: liberal public opinion in Bulgaria</b> and <b>in Pirin Macedonia on the Macedonian national question 1896-1956</b>, edited by Pero Korobar and Orde Ivanovki, Skopje 1984. You will notice that the title considers Bulgaria as a separate territory from 'Pirin Macedonia' which is exacly what the editors try to prove in the book. Inside you will find articles like, 'The overwhelming majority in teh Pirisn region is Macedonian', by Gerogi Madolev (1948), or that that the fact that Bulgarian are in Pirin Macedonia is a proof that the Bulgarians want a 'Greater Bulgaria'. I am happy that you are not offended but I am worried that the terminology of an 'unliberated Macedonia' is so widespread.</dd>
<dd>The Bulgarians or the Greeks or anyone else in Europe does not use such irridentist terminology. The Serbs did it and I am relieved to see that they are paying a heavy price. So I think we cannot simply accept the republic of macedonia and its propagandists to institutionalise through the back door ambiguity with the term Macedonia. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 14:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Macedonia_2fe5.html" title="United Macedonia">United Macedonia</a>. FYROM paid a price - a tight economic block from Greece, and a naming dispute obstacle to joining the EU. Had they not made the irredentists claims, for example depicting the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Tower_of_Thessaloniki_a786.html" title="White Tower of Thessaloniki">White Tower of Thessaloniki</a> on their currency, published irredentist maps, and used symbols from the city of Vergina in Greece, there probably wouldn't have been a naming dispute, and FYROM (or Republic of Macedonia as it would have been known) would be ascending to the EU on New Year (together with Bulgaria and Romania). I guess they went too far... --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 14:35, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bulgaria is facing many problems to join the EU. But look at Albania and Moldova, they are economically and socially much worse off and they are like republic of macedonia. It is not because of the Greeks that they are not in. You think Skopje was worried about economic blockade? They are still refusing to link up the rail link with Bulgaria!!! It is only 14 kilometers to complete, Bulgarians say yes but they say no. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 14:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not saying that that's the only problem, but the naming dispute will certainly slow the whole process down even though it is not necessary to resolve it before ascension, and I don't think you can compare R.

There only one mention about the effects of the name: "<i>Relations with Greece have improved in the last few years.

However the dispute over the name of the country has remained an open issue since 1993." <i>So it is an open issue - that is all, together with the open issue with claiming Blagoevgrad Province but Bulgaria is not in the EU and so this does not get mentioned. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 15:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Look, they can "claim" whatever they want. No one is going to annex the Blagoevgrad Province, no one is going to annex northern Greece or anything else. The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsinki_Accords_e7ec.html" title="Helsinki Accords">Helsinki Accords</a> seem to be getting in the way of this (although they didn't stop the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechslovakia splitting up - perhaps they are ignored in practice&#160;:p).

<p>Size is not important. Of course they can claim whatever they want. But they are also pushing their irredentist talk everywhere like here in Wikipedia. Size does not matter to cause chaos. There are many crazy people who think they have god on their side or that they are suffering because of crazy thinking about historical injustice and then they build an ideology that says you are allowed to do anything against other people. I think these people of republic of macedonia already have a machinery to cause harm like their extremists did in the war against the Albanians. It is our duty to expose them because we want to build roads and communications and cooperation and we do not want to build dangerous differences. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">Makedonija</a> 15:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was threaten by Todor Bozhinov:</p>
<p>"3RR You've violated the three-revert rule on Pirin Macedonia. I'm not sure you're familiar with it and I'm not going to report you for now (you haven't been warned), but if you revert once more you'll very likely be reported and blocked.</p>
<p>By the way, I don't see what's the problem with my version — many people find the name exactly offensive — you fall in the other category, so it's just a matter of how people see it today. Recent Macedonistic propaganda has played a role in this resentment against the name by some Bulgarians, no doubt about it. Todor→Bozhinov 13:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>The reason is the next Todor Bozhinov's note:</p>
<p>"The name 'Pirin Macedonia' is regarded as offensive by many Bulgarians, who assert that it is widely used by Macedonists as part of the irredentist concept of United Macedonia. However, many people in the country also think of the name as a purely geographical term, which it has historically been. Its use is, thus, controversial."</p>
<p>Dear Todor Bozhinov, for me your redaction is neither true nor acceptable and yes, I doubt about it. Don't you think you should prove that for MANY Bulgarians the name Pirin Macedonia is offensive? Please give to the readers and authors of the Wikipedia reliable arguments for that assertion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't threatened you in any way, I was just making you aware of important Wikipedia policies — I warned you because you're in danger of being blocked. I'm not the one who could block you (I don't have that privileges), but it's very likely you could be reported. I have nothing against you to threaten you whatsoever, actually, I was trying to help you.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your doubts, just see <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonija_0b69.html" title="User:Makedonija">User:Makedonija</a>'s edits to the page and the discussion with him. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 14:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Dear Todor Bozhinov, I'm more than surprised from your answer. Do you really think that a discussion here could prove the assertion that for MANY Bulgarians the name Pirin Macedonia is OFFENSIVE? Are there any debates in the bulgarian society about that offence? Are there any social, political or cultural clashes after such public discussion? Please, give us some RELIABLE ARGUMENTS from the life outside Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>P. s. User Makedonija could be personally offended, but see what he have said above: "But most Bulgarians have no idea what Pirin Macedonia means." Dear Todor Bozhinov, therefore this name couldn't be OFFENSIVE for MANY Bulgaians...</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The last version of Todor Bozhinov is milder so I can't say anything against it:</dd>

<dd>"Despite a history of use by Bulgarian nationalists, the term 'Pirin Macedonia' is today regarded as offensive by certain Bulgarians, who assert that it is widely used by Macedonists as part of the irredentist concept of United Macedonia.

<p><i>The region is regarded by many of the people living in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> as part of an irredentist imaginary state that unites the whole geographical <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28region%29.html" title="Macedonia (region)">region of Macedonia</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>However, these claims are due to the long period of propaganda-like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_9b99.html" title="History of the Republic of Macedonia">history in the Republic Macedonia</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>Today the idea of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Macedonia_2fe5.html" title="United Macedonia">“united” Macedonia</a> is part of the doctrines only of extremely right-orientated parties and organizations in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. Only a negligible 3,117 of the province's population of 341,245 described themselves as <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">ethnic Macedonians</a> in 2001, Bulgarians being an overwhelming majority of 286,491.</i></p>
<p><i>This low number of ethnic Macedonians in the region is explained by supporters of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonism.html" title="Macedonism">Macedonism</a> as being a result of repression. They also assert that the number of Macedonians in the province was much larger as recorded by the 1948 and 1956 censuses, claiming that then-<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinist.html" title="Stalinist">Stalinist</a> Bulgaria recognised a distinct Macedonian minority and allowed free self-determination (and implying this is not the case today). This is explained by Bulgarians as being part of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comintern.html" title="Comintern">Comintern</a>'s and the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_Communist_Party_e427.html" title="Bulgarian Communist Party">Bulgarian Communist Party</a>'s policy of the time, which supported a <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a>-backed admission of Bulgaria to <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> with the corresponding incorporation of Pirin Macedonia into the Macedonian Socialist Republic. With the easing of this trend the idea of promoting a separate national consciousness in Pirin Macedonia lost support.</i></p>

I think this passage is relatively well sourced with many links to other articles. I can't see any flagrantly inadequate information. Best wishes, Jackanapes 01:44, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. s. I just have read the dispute between Todor Bozhinov and Dan Carkner in their personal talk pages. Maybe it will be better for all of us to continue the discussion here. Jackanapes 02:01, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I do think that the section could cause many Macedonians (citizens of the republic) to see red because of the way it is phrased; in fact I'm supprised it hasn't been vandalised by anonymous editors with Macedonian IP-addresses yet (-:. It should be rewritten without using the words "imaginary", "propaganda-like", "doctrines", "extremely", "negligible" and "overwhelming", because these words are emotional. "irredentist" may cause offense because many don't know what it means and a fanatic Macedonist may interpret it as negative without consulting the article about it. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslav_37b7.html" title="User:Preslav">Preslav</a> 07:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslav_37b7.html" title="User:Preslav">Preslav</a>, I do not think so. I think that it is dangerous illusion to try to satisfy <i>fanatics</i> or extreme nationalists from Republic of Macedonia. My regards to the tolerant citizens of this state, but I'm not sure that any euphemistic softening of the situation, which leads to distortion of macedonian-bulgarian relations, could be reasonable and effective. The official macedonian attitude toward Bulgaria and bulgariannes is still based on propaganda-like antibulgarian doctriines with two basic elements - denial or negativization of bulgarian past (check one example <a href="http://star.utrinski.com.mk/default.aspx?pbroj=2201&amp;stID=78273&amp;pdate=20061006" class="external text" title="http://star.utrinski.com.mk/default.aspx?pbroj=2201&amp;stID=78273&amp;pdate=20061006" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and claims for vast ethnic (allegedly oppressed) minority in Pirin Macedonia with accusations about the status of its (allegedly violated) human rights. The conception of "United Macedonia" in its postyugoslav variant in Republic of Macedonia is imaginary, aggressive, extreme and - no doubt - has irredentist origin. Because of this several months ago bulgarian minister of foreign affairs Ivailo Kalfin, supported by the bulgarian pesident Georgi Parvanov, declared that Repulic of Macedonia must stop its aggression against the bulgarian history and nation (check <a href="http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_Bulgaria_i_Sveta/Material/04_08_bgmac.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_Bulgaria_i_Sveta/Material/04_08_bgmac.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.president.bg/news.php?id=2691&amp;st=0" class="external text" title="http://www.president.bg/news.php?id=2691&amp;st=0" rel="nofollow">here</a>). And this isn't an exception to the rule, we have to bring in our minds long-lived greek-macedonian diplomatic strife about the official name of RoM/FYRoM. I'm afraid macedonian position is defenceless on the ground of history and contemporary statistics. My conclusion is that any kind of extremism must not be treated with tolerance, therefore this article needs historical paragraph, but not euphemistic softening of this macedonian-bulgarian conflict.

<dd><i>Georgi Pavanov: Let me remind you first of all that Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia under its constitutional name. We have always supported Macedonia in its efforts to secure peace and stability. However when it comes to history, and we have a common history, I think there is a line to be drawn beyond which our own history cannot be stolen by anyone else. However I would say that these issues are best left to historians. We should put our efforts together and look ahead towards the future. Let us collaborate in that direction. Bulgaria is making progress already and hopefully in the future Macedonia will also join the European Union. This will be the best solution to the issues which have accumulated over past decades, and which may still be outstanding.</i></dd>

<p>According to Stoyko Stoykov, one of the leaders of the non-registered ethnic Macedonian political party OMO "Ilinden" - PIRIN (abbreviation of United Macedonian Organization "Ilinden" - Party for Economic Development and Integration of the population), the present number of the ethnic Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia is between 5,000 and 10,000:</p>

<dd><i>EFA and OMO Ilinden – Pirin at a Press Conference in Brussels</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>29 November 2006 | 18:27 | BNR</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bulgarian National radio (BNR)’s correspondent to Brussels Diana Chepisheva comments on the press conference organized in Brussels by the European Free Alliance and OMO Ilinden – Pirin</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Diana Chepisheva: The only MEP that attended this press conference was Bernard Juan, a Spanish MEP from Catalonia, a member of the group of the Greens in the European Parliament. Upon opning the press conference he stated he would talk on a very sensitive issue – that there is a political party in Bulgaria, OMO Ilinden, that it is directly connected to the European Free Alliance (EFA), but unfortunately it is not recognized legally in Bulgaria, and that they take this as a threat to EFA. Otherwise, Bulgaria is viewed as any other European state and that political parties should be able to take part in the political life everywhere.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Then the floor was taken by the leader of OMO Ilinden – Pirin Stoyko Stoykov. What he decided to underscore upon starting is that the party he represents is a civil and democratic one, but it has been permanently denied legal registration over the years because it was the only party in Bulgaria that defends the rights of the Macedonian minority. Stoyko Stoykov told about the way laws and rules have changed over the years, that before they needed only 50 people to register a party, then the number had grown to 5000, and later to 5,000, which in his words had violated their right of self-declaring and peaceful organization.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Then a series of suggestions followed about the real existence of a Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. And Stoyko Stoykov defined himself as its representative. He even summoned the audience to go and touch him if someone doubts his words. However, there were no people willing to do so.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Another participant in this news conference was the co-chairman of the European Free Alliance Gunther Dauwen. He said he visited Bulgaria in September and that he saw that the official representatives of Bulgaria state that there is no Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. Now, after the debates related to the report by Geoffrey Van Orden and the already well-known amendment, he find it completely clear that official Sofia is persistently defending the thesis that there is no Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. In his words, this was foolish because there is just one problem that must be solved and that the Bulgarian authorities have had the chance to solve over the last 10 years but they haven’t done so, and that is why they should not get offended now that someone stands on the side of this Macedonian minority, whose rights are neglected.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Gunther Dauwen underscored that Stoyko Stoykov is a Bulgarian: “See, he speakes Bulgarian”.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The other thing he pointed out was that Stoyko Stoykov is not a separatist.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The press conference was also attended by lawyer Yonko Grozev from the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. He distinguished himself clearly, at the very beginning, from all possible political reminiscences. He underlined that he is there only in his quality of a representative of a party that has been denied registration, which something that the European Court on human Rights has defined as violation of the right of association. Yonko Grozev, of course, presented the well-known court decision, but did not take part in any way in the political discussion.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Another thing that I find very interesting and worthy mentioning is that being asked about the number of members of OMO Ilinden, and about the number of the Macedonians in Bulgaria, Stoyki Stoykov said that the membership list of OMO Ilinden reaches about 6,000. Referring to the number of people that define themselves as Macedonians in Bulgaria, he said the no one knows the exact number of these people and it is the government’s fault since during the latest censuses in the country it has categorically denied to give a possibility for such a type of self-definition.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Radio host: You mean that this type of ethnic origin is not included in the list of possibilities, as the options listed are Bulgarian, Turk, Roma, etc.?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Diana Chepisheva: Right. That the option Macedonian is not included. The problem according to Stoykov, originates (according to his judgment and data) from that fact that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 Macedonians, while their number had even reached 187,000 during some periods of the history of Bulgaria.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Radio host: Well, if there are between 5,000 and 10,000 macedonians, and OMO Ilinden has a membership list of 6,000 people, it turns out that more than half of them are members of OMO Ilinden, right?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Diana Chepisheva: Yes, it seems so. In the mean time it was said that it is not only Macedonians that are members of OMO Ilinden and that there were representatives of different ethnoses. However, I would like to add something more about the figure 187,000 Macedonians back in the history. Stoyko Stoykov said that he was speaking about censuses in the period 1946 – 1956. However, nothing was said of course about this part of our history that is related to the forcefully Macedonization recommended by Stalin. Anyway, this was what was stated here.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Asked whether he thinks OMO Ilinden stands the chance, if it gets registered, of overcoming the 4% barrier needed to enter the parliament, Stoykov refused to make some categorical comments and added that this is somethi9gn that must be checked in practice, and that if they cannot overcome this barrier on their own, the world has though of coalitions.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Another thing that I’d like to add is that the co-chairman of the European Free Alliance Gunther Dauwen, asked whether he knows what the ethnic conflicts have caused on the Balkans and who needs another artificial one, he answered that he knows very well the history of the Balkans and that aim of the political formation that he represents is not to cause tension and conflict. The only thing that they would oppose as a European formation is the line of official Sofia according to which there is no Macedonian minority. We are searching for solution, not tension, he stated.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The presence of media representatives was quite symbolic at this press conference. Although it was held in the main press hall of the European Parliament, it was attended by about 10 journalists, most of whom were accredited representatives of Bulgarian media here. There were also about 10 employees of the European Parliament.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Els de Groen was not present, which does not exclude the possibility that she grounds herself on this press conference and reanimate the issue again during the upcoming debate on the Geoffrey Van Orden’s report on Bulgaria before tomorrow’s vote in the plenary hall.</i></dd>
