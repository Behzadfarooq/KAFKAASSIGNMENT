<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Research and facilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Research and facilities</span></h2>
<p>The Black Mesa facility is built over several decommissioned <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile_silo.html" title="Missile silo">missile silo</a> complexes constructed during the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, which have been converted into a vast civilian institute for the research of every conceivable scientific discipline. Much of the work undertaken at the facility involves fairly standard scientific research, such as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Radiation (disambiguation)">radiation</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocketry.html" title="Rocketry">rocketry</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theoretical_physics.html" title="Theoretical physics">theoretical physics</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">lasers</a>, experimental <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacecraft_propulsion.html" title="Spacecraft propulsion">propulsion</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">hydraulics</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotics.html" title="Robotics">robotics</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroelectricity.html" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applied_mathematics.html" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a> and a very wide spectrum of research into <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and all manner of <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> research. Research at the facility includes both <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_research.html" title="Pure research">pure research</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applied_science.html" title="Applied science">applied science</a>. The facility also serves as a base for decommissioning <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapons.html" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a>. In addition to this legitimate research, several secret projects are also carried out at Black Mesa, which are deliberately left vague. A large amount of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classified_information.html" title="Classified information">classified</a> research is carried out, including the development of high-tech weapons and defense systems, research into extra-<a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimensional</a> travel, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleportation</a>, and the study of <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xen_%28Half-Life%29_587f.html" title="Xen (Half-Life)">Xen</a>. During the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tram.html" title="Tram">tram</a> ride that opens <i>Half-Life</i>, an announcement on the public address system states that the facility is seeking employees with backgrounds in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theoretical_physics.html" title="Theoretical physics">theoretical physics</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biotechnology.html" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, and various other high-tech scientific disciplines. It is also said that jobs in low-clearance security and materials handling are available. Black Mesa, as the same announcement states, is an <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_opportunity.html" title="Equal opportunity">equal opportunity</a> employer.</p>
<p>The opening sequences of <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_ea8b.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a></i> and its expansions (<i>Blue Shift</i> and <i>Opposing Force</i>) reveal much about the facility. Apart from hinting at the enormous size of Black Mesa, it is revealed that the facility is very high-security, as each employee is required to undergo a series of rigorous security checks as they travel around the complex. Black Mesa is dominated by a bewildering number of laboratories, test areas, and administration offices. These, along with cavernous storage facilities, take up most of the underground areas of the complex. Despite being located in the middle of a desert, the underground and indoor sectors of Black Mesa are maintained at 68 <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degrees_Fahrenheit_789b.html" title="Degrees Fahrenheit">degrees Fahrenheit</a> (20 <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degrees_Celsius_4a90.html" title="Degrees Celsius">degrees Celsius</a>) at all times, enabled by Black Mesa's sprawling network of ventilation ducts.</p>

</div>
<p>As employees are required to live in the complex itself, Black Mesa contains many personnel facilities, including laundromats, recreation and sports areas such as lounges, basketball courts, swimming pools, a video rental outlet (as seen in <i>Blue Shift</i>), fast food outlets, food courts, cafeterias, and at least one bar serving <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a>. The facility is well-populated by <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vending_machine.html" title="Vending machine">vending machines</a> and rest areas for the employees of the facility. As Dr. Eli Vance reveals in <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a></i> that his wife and daughter lived in Black Mesa with him, it can be inferred that employees' families reside in the dormitory complexes as well. The complex may also have its own <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, <i>The Mesa Times</i>, although this may be an outside publication. The <i>Blue Shift</i> manual reveals further details about the facility. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Calhoun_2344.html" title="Barney Calhoun">Barney Calhoun</a>'s duty rotation is printed in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, suggesting that the facility recruits international personnel. Included in Calhoun's papers are several pages describing bizarre animals, claiming that the facility houses strange specimens from across the globe (they are, in fact, creatures from <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xen_%28Half-Life%29_587f.html" title="Xen (Half-Life)">Xen</a>). A point of interest is that the same pages describe how, in the event of an emergency, security officers are required to co-operate with military personnel from the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazardous_Environment_Combat_Unit_929f.html" title="Hazardous Environment Combat Unit">Hazardous Environment Combat Unit</a>, suggesting that Black Mesa has experienced problems with escaped specimens in the past. Possibly to deal with potential escaped specimens, or perhaps as a leftover from the facility's days as a military missile complex, Black Mesa contains many automated machine-gun turrets, which, when activated, will emerge from armoured cupolas and fire upon any moving object in their line of sight.</p>
<p>Black Mesa's motto, as seen in the <i>Blue Shift</i> manual, is: <i>Working to build a better tomorrow for all mankind.</i></p>

<p>The physical range of the facility is, from an in-game perspective, nothing short of massive, large enough that the surface area is divided into seven lettered sectors and upwards of nine numbered areas. Most of the facility is located underground, where vast concrete-lined caverns and old <a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBM_4c9d.html" title="ICBM">ICBM</a> silos are linked by a network of electric trams. Black Mesa is apparently self-sufficient, housing its own ventilation, plumbing, sewerage, and power generation systems including a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroelectricity.html" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> dam and multiple types of electrical generators and reactors. The facility is filled with all kinds of laboratories and testing areas, most of which contain very high-tech equipment. The complex also features <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-storey_car_park.html" title="Multi-storey car park">multi-storey car parks</a> (complete with Black Mesa four-wheel drive <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUVs_eec9.html" title="SUVs">SUVs</a>), arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons, a local electric rail materials transport network, laboratories housing the latest equipment for every conceivable high-tech scientific discipline (including a powerful anti-<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometer.html" title="Mass spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>), and even its own rocket launch site. Black Mesa is kept supplied by a freight rail link to the rest of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. It can be inferred that the facility is relatively old considering that some areas are described by in-game characters as "old" or "abandoned." Several areas of the complex are badly run-down despite the obvious fact that they are still in use. The surface areas of Black Mesa feature more modern construction.</p>

<p>The Black Mesa Research Facility is populated by two main groups of civilian employees: science personnel and security personnel, along with various other inhabitants including administrative personnel, service personnel and occasionally the employees' families (as stated by Dr. Eli Vance in <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a></i>). The base also keeps a small military presence. All facility personnel wear identity badges, and the automated tram announcement at the beginning of <i>Half-Life</i> reminds staff that they must display their badges at all times, as well as that "regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Missing a scheduled urinalysis or radiation check-up is grounds for immediate termination." The following are the main types of personnel employed in the facility.</p>
<p><a name="Security_Personnel" id="Security_Personnel"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Security Personnel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Security Personnel</span></h3>
<p>Security personnel (a.k.a. security guards) are the main component of Black Mesa's support personnel force. Each guard is granted a different security clearance specific to his or her duty, with an average clearance of Level 3. The security guard uniform consists of a blue shirt, black tie, dark blue pants, black assault boots, equipment belt, armor vest and helmet. The standard issue security guard sidearm is the GLOCK 17 pistol (or the Beretta, with the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_High_Definition_Pack_1b9c.html" title="Half-Life High Definition Pack">High Definition Pack</a> installed), but it seems that Shotguns, Colt Pythons, Desert Eagles, and Grenades are also available to them.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Security Officer</b> - The vast majority of guards work as security officers, tasked with protecting secured areas and information, reporting breaches of authority to their administrative sponsor and helping with general maintenance tasks. In rare cases, security officers will be tasked with capturing escaped research specimens.</li>
<li><b>Section Manager</b> - The role of section manager is effectively a desk job that consists of directing security officers and assigning tasks.</li>
<li><b>Instructor</b> - Security officers will often take on additional work instructing new recruits in the Sector A Training Facility.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Science Personnel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Science Personnel</span></h3>
<p>Science Personnel (a.k.a. the Science Team), recruited largely from <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">academic</a> backgrounds, are the overwhelming majority of Black Mesa's population. Each scientist is granted a different security clearance specific to his or her duty, with an average clearance of Level 5. Like other employees, scientists have an assigned uniform, consisting of a blue shirt, white labcoat, red striped tie and white (or beige) slacks. Many scientists are trained in the use of the MP5N sub-machinegun as part of <a href="../../../h/e/v/HEV_suit_94b4.html" title="HEV suit">HEV suit</a> training, but those in R&amp;D have little or no knowledge of combat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Research and Development</b> - The largest portion of the scientists are assigned to research and development positions, where they conduct experiments and create new technologies. The research conducted ranges in focus from particle physics to biological study to space travel. Most R&amp;D scientists have a limited knowledge of first aid, and can heal some wounds. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Isaac_Kleiner_524d.html" title="Dr. Isaac Kleiner">Dr. Isaac Kleiner</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Eli_Vance_135e.html" title="Dr. Eli Vance">Dr. Eli Vance</a> were prominent R&amp;D scientists.</li>
<li><b>Research Associate</b> - Research Associates work alongside R&amp;D scientists, but with a lower status in the employment hierarchy. They are usually required to conduct the more mundane or less desirable portions of a given experiment. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Gordon_Freeman_8205.html" title="Dr. Gordon Freeman">Dr. Gordon Freeman</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Colette_Green_f1cd.html" title="Dr. Colette Green">Dr. Colette Green</a> were notable research associates.</li>
<li><b>Hazardous Environment Supervisor</b> - Supervisors act in a similar role to research associates in that they assist in experiments, but they are primarily concerned with maintaining a safe work environment. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Gina_Cross_242d.html" title="Dr. Gina Cross">Dr. Gina Cross</a> worked in this position.</li>
<li><b>Instructor</b> - Scientists will often take on additional work training employees and conducting simulations in the Sector A Training Facility.</li>
<li><b>Survey Team</b> - Survey teams were organized soon after the first teleportation labs were constructed in Black Mesa. Their assignment is the most dangerous, as they are tasked with entering Xen to collect samples and conduct experiments. Because of the danger, survey team members are highly trained in the use of the HEV suit and a variety of weapons.</li>

</dl>
<p>The events of the Black Mesa Incident are triggered by a seemingly routine experiment carried out by the Anomalous Materials team in Sector C, Test Chamber C-33/a. When research associate <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html" title="Gordon Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a> pushes a crystalline specimen into the beam of an over-charged anti-<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometer.html" title="Mass spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>, the experiment triggers a resonance cascade, which causes severe structural damage to the entire facility and severs communications with the outside world, and within much of the facility itself. At the same time, the resonance cascade causes <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimensional</a> seams to rip open, forcibly <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleporting</a> intelligent creatures and wildlife from the border world <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xen_%28Half-Life%29_587f.html" title="Xen (Half-Life)">Xen</a> into the Black Mesa facility. The confused creatures begin attacking the facility's personnel, causing chaos as Black Mesa's inhabitants hide or try to flee the facility by any means available. Soon after the resonance cascade, soldiers from the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazardous_Environment_Combat_Unit_929f.html" title="Hazardous Environment Combat Unit">Hazardous Environment Combat Unit</a> (HECU) appear in Black Mesa, under orders to cover up the incident by killing the Xenians and silencing the facility's civilian personnel. Whilst the soldiers are at first successful, their advantages are gradually lost as they come under incessant attack by increasing numbers of Xen lifeforms, the Black Mesa Security Force, and Gordon Freeman. Helped by Black Mesa's surviving personnel and protected by his <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html#H.E.V._suit" title="Gordon Freeman">HEV suit</a>, Freeman is able to fight his way across the facility, killing many members of the HECU and destroying a large amount of military hardware, including tanks, helicopters, automated sentry guns, and several dozen laser tripmines. As the Xen creatures gain ground in the facility and inflict increasing casualties on the military, the HECU begins a hasty and incomplete evacuation, removing the bulk of the HECU as highly-trained <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Ops_%28Half-Life%29_2954.html" title="Black Ops (Half-Life)">Black Ops</a> appear, who begin executing abandoned HECU survivors and the few surviving members of Black Mesa's personnel. The Black Ops, though, sustain heavy casualties from the newly-arrived <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_X_c317.html" title="Race X">Race X</a> creatures, and ultimately evacuate the facility. Throughout the earlier stages of the incident, several members of Black Mesa's science team, operating out of the relatively undamaged Lambda Complex, attempt to close the dimensional rifts between Black Mesa and Xen by launching a geo-stationary <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> into orbit. Ultimately, Dr. Freeman reaches the fortified Lambda Complex and, after bringing Black Mesa's nuclear reactor online, is teleported to Xen.</p>

<p>The Black Mesa facility itself is badly damaged during the resonance cascade and the resulting Xen invasion, and sustains severe damage during the military occupation. Although the ultimate fate of Black Mesa is unknown, it appears that most of the facility is destroyed by a nuclear device planted deep in the facility by the Black Ops at the end of <i>Half-Life: Opposing Force</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst most of Black Mesa's personnel are killed in the facility itself, several members of the science team and security force survived the incident and escaped. <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html" title="Gordon Freeman">Dr. Gordon Freeman</a> is teleported to <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xen_%28Half-Life%29_587f.html" title="Xen (Half-Life)">Xen</a> by the Lambda team and does not return to Black Mesa, instead being employed by the mysterious <a href="../../../g/-/m/G-Man_%28Half-Life%29_3ac9.html" title="G-Man (Half-Life)">G-Man</a> and put into stasis. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Wallace_Breen_0cba.html" title="Dr. Wallace Breen">Dr. Wallace Breen</a>, the facility's Administrator, escapes by unknown means. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Isaac_Kleiner_524d.html" title="Dr. Isaac Kleiner">Dr. Isaac Kleiner</a>, a member of the Lambda team, is able to escape as well as <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Eli_Vance_135e.html" title="Dr. Eli Vance">Dr. Eli Vance</a>, a high-ranking member of both the Anomalous Materials team and the Lambda team, carrying with him his young daughter <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyx_Vance_fbdb.html" title="Alyx Vance">Alyx</a>.

It remains unknown if any other personnel escaped Black Mesa, or if any of the more heavily built or underground areas survived the atomic blast.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not the actions of the Lambda team, in particular their launching of the satellite, actually helped to close the dimensional rifts. After the launch of the satellite they theorise that forces on the other side of the portals are keeping them open.</p>

<p>Black Mesa contains a vast and complicated array of laboratories, storage areas, personnel facilities, and abandoned areas. The various facilities in Black Mesa are loosely grouped into seven Sectors:</p>
<p><a name="Sector_A_Training_Facility" id="Sector_A_Training_Facility"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Sector A Training Facility">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sector A Training Facility</span></h3>
<p>Encountered in all four of the <i>Half-Life 1</i> games, Sector A contains the separate <b>Hazard Courses</b> used for training HEV personnel (as seen in <i>Half-Life</i>) and security officers (as seen in <i>Blue Shift</i>). Demonstrations are provided by trained instructors or pre-recorded <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holography.html" title="Holography">holographic</a> assistants, whilst participants are constantly monitored by observing scientists. The two known Hazard Courses are built over old, disused industrial sectors of the facility, and are each divided into an obstacle course and target range. This facility can also be accessed in the <i>Opposing Force</i> expansion pack by activating the alt-fire on the Displacer in the map the weapon is found in.</p>
<p>Sector A also contains a <b>Satellite Communications Centre</b>, housing a large satellite uplink dish. This facility is used in <i>Decay</i> when <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Colette_Green_4c4e.html" title="Doctor Colette Green">Colette Green</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Gina_Cross_2540.html" title="Doctor Gina Cross">Gina Cross</a> help Dr. Rosenberg to contact the military.</p>
<p>A schedule in the <i>Blue Shift</i> manual also places the <b>Area 4 Personnel Dormitories</b> in this sector.</p>
<p><a name="Sector_B_Coolant_Reserve" id="Sector_B_Coolant_Reserve"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Sector B Coolant Reserve">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sector B Coolant Reserve</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Coolant Reserve</b> (formerly the <b>Section A-17 Prototype Laboratories</b>) stores the industrial coolant used to maintain Black Mesa's thousands of computers and machines. It is first seen by Barney Calhoun when he escapes from Sector C.</p>
<p>The section was originally the site of the (now decommissioned) <b>Displacement Field Laboratory</b> seen in <i>Blue Shift</i>, where Black Mesa's first teleportation experiments took place. It is powered by the Auxiliary Generator Facility. The surface level of Sector B is now a <b>Train Yard</b> that is used to ship freight in and out of the facility over the New Mexico Railroad Line. The sector also contains the <b>Area 2 Administration Offices</b>.</p>

The entrance to Sector C of the Black Mesa Research Facility.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sector C is notable primarily for housing the <b>Anomalous Materials Laboratories</b> that were Dr. <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html" title="Gordon Freeman">Freeman</a>'s workplace. This area contains the anti-mass spectrometer (Test Lab C-33/a), which was the initial source of the Black Mesa Incident and the starting point of the <i>Half-Life</i> series.</p>
<p>In addition the Anomalous Materials Laboratories, the sector also contains the <b>High-Energy Particle Laboratories</b> and <b>Supercooled Laser Laboratory</b>.</p>
<p>Sector C is patrolled by guards from the <b>Area 3 Security Facilities</b> The facility is adjacent to the High-Energy Particle Labs, and encompasses a central lobby, personnel facilities, video surveillance, and an armoury. The sector also contains the <b>Level 3 Dormitories</b>, which feature a Library and an Aquatic Centre with a large pool. This is the area where Gordon Freeman lived while working at Black Mesa. His dormitory (Dorm 309) can be explored in <i>Decay</i>, and indicates that the average dormitory room is furnished with a bed, entertainment centre (with television) and a small bathroom with shower.</p>

Sector D (Office Complex) following the Xen invasion</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Seen early in <i>Half-Life</i>, Sector D is mainly a large underground complex of <b>Administration Offices</b> where the bureaucratic aspects of Black Mesa's upkeep take place, along with some limited research.</p>
<p>The Administration Offices are built beneath the surface's <b>High Security Storage Facility</b>, a large semi-subterranean warehouse made of interlocking Storage Areas. The lower levels of Sector D contain the <b>Silo D Experimental Propulsion Laboratories</b> where rocket engines are tested in one of Black Mesa's many decommissioned missile silos.</p>
<p><a name="Sector_E_Biodome_Complex" id="Sector_E_Biodome_Complex"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility_db87.html" title="Edit section: Sector E Biodome Complex">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sector E Biodome Complex</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Biodome Complex</b>, a relatively new area of the facility (still under construction at the time of the Black Mesa Incident, as seen in <i>Opposing Force</i>), contains a series of Specimen Observation Areas, where captured Xen aliens are kept and observed in artificial recreations of their natural habitats. Alongside these enclosures are Specimen Containment Rooms where the aliens are studied in closer detail. The lowest underground levels of Sector E contain the <b>Hydrofauna Studies Laboratory</b> where aquatic aliens are kept in older decommissioned areas that have been flooded and converted into makeshift tanks. The sector also contains the <b>Advanced Biological Research Lab</b> seen in <i>Half-Life</i>, a smaller facility where the aliens are tested on and dissected by an automated robotic Surgical Unit, in ways that are likely <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioethics.html" title="Bioethics">unethical</a>.</p>
<p>The second level of the lab is used as an experimental weapon research lab, testing dangerous weapons such as the Gauss Gun and a large High-Powered Laser. The other surface areas of Sector E form an <b>Ordinance Storage Facility</b> where vast amounts of munitions and explosives are stored, ranging from small arms to crates of dynamite, even including some nuclear weapons. An area of this facility, <b>Storage Unit 04</b> (also known as the Level 4 Storage Unit) becomes infested with the creature known as the "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_X_c317.html#Gene_Worm" title="Race X">Gene Worm</a>" towards the end of <i>Opposing Force</i>.</p>
<p>The surface of Sector E contains the bulk of Black Mesa's still-functional military facilities, including at least three <b>Helicopter Hangars</b>, a <b>Topside Armory</b> and a <b>Topside Barracks</b>. The nearby <b>Silo E High Altitude Launch Center</b>, a silo converted into a fully-functional satellite delivery rocket lauchpad. was used by the Lamba Team, with the help of Gordon Freeman, to launch the satellite that later helped repair the resonance cascade in <i>Decay</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, Sector E is the location of Black Mesa's various Waste Processing facilities, including the <b>Biological Waste Processing Plant</b> seen in <i>Half-Life</i> and <b>Waste Processing Area 3</b>, seen in both <i>Half-Life</i> and <i>Opposing Force</i>.</p>

<p>The heavily fortified <b>Lambda Reactor Complex</b> is the site of Black Mesa's top secret teleportation labs. The reactor is a huge device consisting of the Lambda Reactor Main Coolant System, and the cylindrical Lambda Reactor Core. The core of the reactor consists of four levels (Levels A-D) that fuel an extremely powerful teleportation portal on Level A, where survey Teams are equipped and sent to Xen.</p>
<p>The <b>Gamma Laboratories</b> in Sector F were built later, as a means of capturing Xen specimens without risking casualties. These labs use a Prototype Displacement Beacon, which generates strong displacement fields and opens miniature dimensional rifts between Earth and Xen, for the safe and easy collection of alien life. It was used by <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Richard_Keller_4cfd.html" title="Doctor Richard Keller">Dr. Richard Keller</a> in <i>Half-Life: Decay</i> to stop the effects of the resonance cascade and produce a "resonance reversal."</p>
<p>Sector F is linked to the rest of the base via the <b>Secured Access Lambda Sector Transport</b> and the <b>Central Complex</b>, which contains Black Mesa's Central Command and Communication Centers and a Mechanized Infantry Repair Bay.</p>

<p>The following areas are either not linked to a specific sector, or their specific sector is currently unknown.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Area 7 Recreational Facilities</b> - Whilst not seen in the game, a map of Black Mesa's tram routes in <i>Blue Shift</i> mentions Area 7. As Black Mesa's employees are required to live in the facility itself, it can be assumed that Area 7 contains comforts and diversions such as sporting areas, cafeterias, and other personnel facilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Area 8 Topside Dormitories</b> - One of the many topside dormitories on the surface of Black Mesa, featuring a basketball court and a small train platform. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Calhoun_2344.html" title="Barney Calhoun">Barney Calhoun</a> lived in one of the Area 8 dorms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Area 9 Transit Hub</b> - The Area 9 Transit Hub acts as one of the many transit security checkpoints throughout the Black Mesa Research Facility. Trams that pass through the Area 9 Transit Hub can be rerouted to both the Sector E and C transit lines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Mesa Air-Traffic Control</b> - This building is adjacent a large airstrip, and is used to monitor and direct activity in the airspace above Black Mesa. Special clearance codes must be entered at this building before any rocket launch can take place in other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Infirmary</b> - At the beginning of <i>Opposing Force</i>, <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Shephard_4238.html" title="Adrian Shephard">Adrian Shephard</a> wakes up in a damaged Black Mesa infirmary, which appears to still be under the control of Black Mesa personnel, who are caring for wounded soldiers and studying <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headcrab.html" title="Headcrab">zombies</a> under the protection of security officers. The infirmary is equipped with <a href="../../../c/a/t/CAT_c01a.html" title="CAT">CAT</a> and <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a> scanners, which are still functional. Some areas of the infirmary, though, have been abandoned due to parasitic infestation, and have been blocked off with furniture and hospital beds. There are laser-based experiments taking place in this building.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Level 1 Main Facility Entrance</b> - Never physically seen within any of the <i>Half-Life</i> games, the Level 1 Main Facility Entrance heavily implies that it used as a central entrance checkpoint for all the facility personnel. The facility was only seen written on a transit map near the Sector G Main Access Lift, in <i>Half-Life: Blue Shift</i>.</li>
