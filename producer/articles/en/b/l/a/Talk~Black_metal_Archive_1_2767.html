<dd>Roger that
<dl>
<dd>Obviously all of metal past about 1976 (when Motorhead released a punk album) has been punk-influenced; punk hardcore in the form of Discharge is the immediate ancestor of modern black metal (listen to 1982's "Hear Nothing, See Nothing, etc"). Most metalheads don't acknowledge this, in part because of what happened with emo. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">www.anus.com</a> 03:23, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes because Doom Metal, Gothic Metal, Symphonic Metal, Power Metal. These are all really influenced by Hardcore Punk. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 16:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hardcore had a major influence on early black metal (listen to A Blaze In The Northern Sky by Darkthrone and tell me that there aren't direct roots to punk there) and deserves a mention in the main article.</dd>

<dd>I think there's an issue of confusion here as i don't find many similarities between Hardcore Punk and the present-day Hardcore as part of the alternative genre... maybe i'm wrong, but i think it's the same as the conflict between the old use of "Speed Metal" ( to describe old Metallica, turned to Thrash later on )and the new meaning to describe a faster version of Power Metal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thrash metal</span></h2>
<p>It must be said that anybody who believes that Venom 'invented' black metal has no idea what they are talking about. Venom influenced, or perhaps even inspired, black metal, but they definitely were not themselves. It is fair to say that Venom started thrash metal, but not black metal.</p>
<p>Leyasu, what did you mean with "Thrash metal originating before Black Metal"? Venom released the first Black Metal albums, and Venom again inspired Thrash Metal bands (as well as other Black Metal bands). Which Thrash Metal band came before Venom released "Welcome to Hell"??</p>
<dl>
<dd>See the history provided by the article. If a consensus is reached that the history is wrong, then it shall be changed. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 07:23, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Venom was a heavy metal band; it has little in common with what was later called black metal, and there was nothing done in the genre until the early 1990s. At the time of Venom through late Celtic Frost, there was little differentiation between death and black metal among the majority of fans.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProzak_20ce.html" title="User:Prozak">www.anus.com</a> 03:18, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, there is a consensus that 1. Venom was the first Black Metal band and that 2. The early Thrash Metal bands like Metallica were directly inspired from Venom. This means that Thrash Metal was inspired from Black Metal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a quote from Malcolm Dome that hihglights this: "But Venom started it all. Without them thrash may never have existed" "Whatever they say about us, Venom were the first in the field. They started the whole thrash movement" - Lars Ulrich, Metallica Both quotes from the book "Thrash Metal"(1990, Omnibus Press) I see from the Thrash Metal article that there were some metal music before Venom that did have some Thrash <i>riffing</i>, but this was not bona fide Thrash Metal. If Black Metal really derived from Thrash Metal, then this needs to be substantiated. <a href="../../../w/t/h/User%7EWTH_889c.html" title="User:WTH">WTH</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>A band giving themselfs credit for starting something they didnt is common place. You repeating it doesnt make it fact. There has been no general consensus, other than what ive found by asking about that Venom has given themselfs credit for not only starting Thrash Metal, but Death Metal and Gothic Metal as well. This is on par with Evanescence's claims of writing Nirvana's song Smells Like Teen Spirit. This is a claim only a few fans of the band seem to back up. Until hard proof and general consensus is reached against what is common history, the article shall not be changed on this point. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 16:56, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is very much hard proof while I have yet to see proof of any known Thrash Metal band inspiring Venom.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Instead of deleting information that I provide proof for, you may take your time to provide facts stating otherwise. <a href="../../../w/t/h/User%7EWTH_889c.html" title="User:WTH">WTH</a> One band doesnt define a genre nor its roots. I will also point out that Metallica made outrageous, untrue claims about Napster users, and Kerrang has made outrageous claims such as Mortiis being a Gothic Metal mastermind and Linkin Park being Death Metal. I suggest you find less POV, less inaccurate, less market the band that pays us most, sources. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 17:39, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I rest my case, for now(as editing back and forth s futile), but I have to point out that you are not able to provide any proof that Venom was inspired by any Thrash bands at all. (Contrary to what you seem to think, I will take notice if you provide proof). Neither do you seem to recognise the name Malcolm Dome and I suggest you google his name and his bibliography. (starting with the link above.)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../w/t/h/User%7EWTH_889c.html" title="User:WTH">WTH</a> I am not being funny with you WTH. But this argument has gone on several times had has been part of vandalism many times. My intrest is only in making the better article, it isnt personal. If you find more sources, and give the links here so all can read them, the article can be changed easily. It is simply a case of trying to protect against vandalism, that is all. Sorry if i come across as making this personal between us. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 00:13, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's the truth as is written on Lord's of Chaos by Michael Mohnihan and Dodrik Soederlind: The primary sources Euronymous(Mayhem) based his music on was the name and grittines of Venom's Black metal album (which by no means is black metal, it is only a gritty NWOBHM album) and the late Bathory (a band that can jump to any genre they want to, but considered Death Metal) secondary sources are Mercyful Fate(king diamond), Hellhammer and Celtic Frost among other bands. In no way did Venom invent black metal as it was only their album's name so they need to be removed from the originators of black metal along with the rest of the bands for only one of those bands actually played black metal, that band being Mayhem.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know where all this discussion about Venom being thrash came from, as they are simply the first black metal band (even though, musically, they are NWOBHM). Oh, and the authors of Lords Of Chaos are idiots for calling Bathory death metal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>- This is ridiculous. By black metal, we mean the style of music which became popular amongst certain Norwegian bands in the late 80s/early 90s (Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, etc), and derivates there of. Venom did not play in this style. Venom played thrash metal, and though they, along with bands such as Mercyful Fate and Celtic Frost, had some influence on black metal, they were definitely not the first black metal band. If any band should be credited as the originator of black metal, it should be Bathory. <a name="Euronymous_cover" id="Euronymous_cover"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Euronymous cover</span></h2>
<p>Hi, just a question. It is said in the article that Euronymous planned to use the picture he took of Deads corpse as an album cover. AFAIK it was stolen by a guy from a label Euronymous had trouble with. This guy used it as cover for a black metal sampler. I have this information from a german blackmetal magazine called Ablaze. I still have it and can look it up, starting to search for it later. But maybe they were just misinformed... Overall a well done article!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Isengard</span></h2>
<p>Hey, sorry to wake you up, but what the heck did you mean by putting Isengard into "Tolkien Metal"? I know that the name Isengard was taken from Tolkien, but Fenriz plays something more folkish than Tolkienesque. Or did you mean the other, less known Isengard from Sweden? If that's the case, then it's okay with me, heh.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tolkien Metal isnt a form of music, it is actually an encompassing term like <b>Goth Music</b> (see the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_music.html" title="Gothic music">gothic music</a> article). This means it encompasses any metal band with Lord Of The Rings based themes. If the band takes its lyrical theming from Lord Of The Rings, this is probally why some fans use the term Tolkien Metal to describe them. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 07:34, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, actually Corpse Paint was used only by some Black Metal bands ( Marduk ) and included white skin, black lipstick and black/gray shade around the eyes, all messily applied to simulate the dead look. Other bands ( see Immortal ) used what they called War Paint which was much more oppulent consisting of big black drawings applied around eyes and mouth. And sure enough, there's the third cattegory of bands who wore the make-up for no other reason but the show or because of the trend... regards!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subgenres</span></h2>
<p>Do we really need distinct articles about subgenres of a Metal subgenre or is it better to describe them in the main article? Expecially since Vikings, battles, middle ages and Tolkien's works are quite a common theme in most Metal subgenres and therefore the names could be misleading. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValhalla_3815.html" title="User:Valhalla">Valhalla</a></p>
<p>I do think we need separate articles. You describe everything thats common to Black metal and its sub-genres in the Black metal-page, and then on each sub-genre page you describe what makes this sub-genre uniqe. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandos_3528.html" title="User:Sandos">sandos</a></p>
<p>I certainly haven't heard titles like "Tolkien metal" or "Suicidal black metal" being used to describe cohesive and musically distinct sub-genres outside of Wikipedia. In the cases of troll metal, Tolkien metal and the like, they seem to refer to the lyrical content of the bands in question, which is a tad absurd since rock bands have taken inspiration from Tolkien's works ever since Led Zeppelin's first album. Black Sabbath were lyrically inspired by Dennis Wheatley, but no-one ever called them "Wheatley metal" did they?</p>
<p>NSBM seems a slightly less unnecessary distinction as it is a cohesive musical movement, particularly in eastern Europe, and it is a generally unified ideology (however immature and unsound that ideology may seem to yours truly), but I'd still strongly suggest that it be merged with the main article on black metal. belzub</p>

<p>N.S. Black Metal or National Socialist black metal - This Genre is a very touchy one because it involves the radical ideas of racial seperatism and upholdence of the Aryan race, being applied into the music of black metal. most bands of this type of black metal are fueled by the conservation of pagan beliefs and traditions from total oblitheration by the christian beliefs.</p>

<p>- Well Viking Metal is a term used to describe bands by lyrical content rather than sound. While it's true that so called Viking Metal bands use northern folk influences in their music it still doesn't make for a valid subgenre, imo. Viking Metal bands play from Black Metal to Power Metal. Also, some bands are referred to as Blackened Viking Metal, which would mean that Viking Metal is not Black Metal to start with! Ulfednar 05:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><b>Of Corpsepaints' origins:</b></span></h2>
<p>The German article about corpsepaint on <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpsepaint" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpsepaint" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpsepaint</a> should be translated and added to Black Metal section. It presents the hypothesized origins of corpsepaints through history. I add another remark: in the French film called "L'Odyssée de l'Espèce" ("The Odyssey of Species") which deal with the first hominids' origins, shows in a reconstitution of a Homo Sapiens tribe in Europe corpsepaints really similar to those observed on Black Metal bands. (<a href="http://www.dinosoria.com/fondespece.jpg)It" class="external free" title="http://www.dinosoria.com/fondespece.jpg)It" rel="nofollow">http://www.dinosoria.com/fondespece.jpg)It</a> is noteworthy to say that this movie was realized by Jacques Malaterre with the help of anthropologists (f.i. the famous Yves Coppens) and this shows how this reconstitution is scientifically relevant and, maybe, very close to 'truth' ( look at pics in 'Gallerie' section <a href="http://odysseedelespece.france3.fr/" class="external free" title="http://odysseedelespece.france3.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://odysseedelespece.france3.fr/</a>). Some further information could be found in scientifical publications about the scientifical relevancy of the use and importance of these paintings in early Europeans. Therefore, there may be a connection between prehistorical corpsepaints, the later Northern cultures (Scandinavian and German), some Medieval burial practices with dead corpses, with the nowadays corpsepaintings (mainly 'face-paints') worn within Metal culture: Thrash, Black or Glam (look at German Wiki article, linked just above). It SEEMS POSSIBLE that this practice of corpsepainting, with white colour on face and black colour on eyes (and mouth sometimes), had been an early European prehistorical tradition, conserved later mainly in Northern Europa and merging again today in Metal genres' aesthetism. It hasn't been discussedif other cultures have the same make-ups. But, due to the fact that mineral or vegetal substances used for make-ups are linked to a certain ecosystems, this tradition MAY be a European specificity. It is just an HYPOTHESIS. But, this hypothesis should be mentionned and discussed in the article. Why? For if it may be linked with early Europeans traditions, it would echoe the common "anti christian", "pagan" claims of Black Metal. In this way, it could be viewed as an 'pagan', pre-christian (and anti-chrisitan) symbol, but far older than Black Metal.</p>

<p>While venom is mentioned as one of the key black metal bands, in the history, everything preceding the explosion of black metal in norway is left out. I believe Venom and Bathory deserve mention in the history before the rest of those artists because they were the first two black metal bands. Also I think Dimmu Borgir should not be listed as a notable black metal band. The person that discussed it here (which for some reason I can't seem to respond to) said himself that Dimmu Borgir was black influenced gothic metal. Well being influenced by black metal doesn't make a band a notable black metal band now does it?

Venom is in fact not black metal at all....they coined the term but that does not make them BM anymore then Deep purple is Heavy Metal because they coined the term...Venom is Thrash through and through Redleaves 03:42, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

OK. lets sort things out: 1 wave: Venom, Bathory 2 wave: Mayhem (could maybe be in the 1st wave also), Darkthrone etc 3 wave: Immortal, Dark Funeral etc</p>
<p>my understanding is: first wave- Bathory, etc (whether it's actually black metal is debatable); second wave- Mayhem, Emperor, all those Norwegian bands caught up in the whole church burning thing; third wave- any black metal bands formed during and after the mid-90's <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnues_271d.html" title="User:Marnues">marnues</a> 22:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fake black metal</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to add that a lot of bands are very fake black metal, in the sense that they are not what TRUE black metal is. Black metal originated as an attack on God, and the belief that Satan is the true ruler. The bands went back to their pagan roots.</p>
<ul>
<li>correction: black metal was considered an attack on God, however, that does not necessarily mean it has to continue to be an attack on God. There are lots of different messages within Black Metal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now a lot of new black metal bands claim that "God doesn't exist, christianity is a lie," which is absolutely not what real black metal is about. Bands like Emperor, Mayhem, and Burzum BELIEVED in Christianity, but they chose to worship Satan, not God.</p>
<p>Err because I messed up my original post, I'd like to say the bands did not go back to their pagan roots, because paganism has nothing to do with christianity (paganism is a polytheistic, naturalistic religion).</p>

<dd>I pretty heartilly agree w TUF-KAT, and caution anyone looking to be particularly opinionated about precise musical definitions that there arn't many. In my experience the people worst at catagorizing music are the artists themselves (they often invent some ludicrous title for their individual style, like "gutter funk", or who knows what), immediately followed by their fans. The best judge of what style a particular band or song is in is from a musically literate "outsider", i.e. somebody who has heard many different types of music, and is something less than a gushy mega-fan. Also usually the broader the catagory (like say "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>"), the easier to find a fit, and the more specific, the more vague things are.

<dd>I agree. And if Christian black metal cannot be labeled black metal because of Christian beliefs – which I think is a pretty much universally accepted view – then I also think it is valid to accept that black metal, at least partially, is defined by ideology, and not only music. I don't think black metal is necessarily Satanic, but at least opposed to Christianity (or whatever the current religious belief in the band's area). Mr. Death 08:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not all Black Metal bands are neccessarily satanic. They might have some pagan influences (which isn't really satanic) and they're still considered Black Metal. Take Immortal, one of the most famous, for example. Their entire body of work usually revolves around their fictional fantasy world, and satanism has pretty much no part in it.</p>
<p>I'd like everyone here to note that Burzum frontman/only member Varg Vikernes is a known Odinist and therefore, is Pagan and not Satanic. Even Burzum's lyrics had much to do with occultism. I'd also like to add that orginally Black Metal was a revolt and a breaking off of Death Metal. Satanic lyrics and influences have been found in older Death Metal bands and just went with the influences taken from older Death Metal bands such as Possesed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 165.139.123.17 (<a href="../../../1/6/5/User_talk%7E165.139.123.17.html" title="User talk:165.139.123.17">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_165.139.123.17_8489.html" title="Special:Contributions/165.139.123.17">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Black metal and influences</span></h3>
<p>Could I add a note about how black metal is very open to incorporating some aspects of other genres into black metal to create new and original sounds? I've always felt black metal was an amazingly open-minded genre when it came to music (let's not go into racism please).

<dd>Is there any style of music which isn't "<i>open to incorporating some aspects of other genres</i>"? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 11:41, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes there are several styles of music that shun any influences at all. Take a look at any other genres of metal. Take a look at punk rock. Take a look at hip hop. Black metal is very geared towards influences, moreso than most genres. I felt it should be mentioned, since so many bands take on influences.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you aren't familiar with the kind of influences black metal takes on, and how often. It's easy to sit back from your passive point of view and say how all genres are open to influences, but you really have to see just how open the black metal scene is to influences before you can understand why it might be worth mentioning. There are musicians who go out and look for new styles to adopt into their own, not just an occassional random artist that decides to fuse two genres together. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanctum_7a9b.html" title="User:Sanctum">Sanctum</a> 04:50, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know particularly much about black metal, but I disagree with your assertion. Comparing the openness of genres is inherently subjective. Take a hypothetical genre X popular in Y location. If, in Y, X is by far the most popular genre, it will likely remain fairly untouched by other styles, irregardless of its level of openness. How do you propose to measure openness?</dd>
<dd>WRT to hip hop specifically, there are styles with long histories and numerous practitioners who have fused hip hop with rock and roll (rock rap), thrash metal and punk rock (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_hip_hop.html" title="Hardcore hip hop">hardcore hip hop</a>), other kinds of metal (contentiously, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap_metal.html" title="Rap metal">rap metal</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>), soul (<a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_soul.html" title="Nu soul">nu soul</a>), funk (<a href="../../../g/_/f/G_funk.html" title="G funk">G funk</a>), jazz (<a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_rap.html" title="Jazz rap">jazz rap</a>), techno (<a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghettotech.html" title="Ghettotech">ghettotech</a> and others), doo wop (<a href="../../../s/w/i/Swingbeat.html" title="Swingbeat">Swingbeat</a>), house (<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trip_hop.html" title="Trip hop">trip hop</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_house.html" title="Hip house">hip house</a>, others), highlife (<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_life.html" title="Hip life">hip life</a>), pure teen pop (pop hop, J-rap, much of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_hip_hop.html" title="Mexican hip hop">Mexican hip hop</a>), merengue (<a href="../../../m/e/r/Merenrap.html" title="Merenrap">merenrap</a>), reggae (recent <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragga.html" title="Ragga">ragga</a>), salsa (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timba.html" title="Timba">timba</a>, and others), mbalax (see <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_hip_hop.html" title="African hip hop">African hip hop</a>), waila (see <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_hip_hop_7388.html" title="Native American hip hop">Native American hip hop</a>) taarab (see <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Tanzania_0c8a.html" title="Music of Tanzania">music of Tanzania</a>), Turkish music of various kinds (see <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_hip_hop.html" title="Turkish hip hop">Turkish hip hop</a>), South African pop (<a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwaito.html" title="Kwaito">kwaito</a>) and dancehall (<a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggaeton.html" title="Reggaeton">reggaeton</a>), just to mention those explained in the 'pedia, which doesn't go into extant fusions with everything from zouk to flamenco to cumbia to kaseko to sega to punta to samba to mariachi and traditional music from Ireland, India, France, New Zealand, Greece, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Finland and elsewhere. My point is not that hip hop is more open to influences than black metal or anything else, but that it is highly debateable.</dd>
<dd>As another well-known counterexample, reggae has been fused with dozens of styles of music in non-Caribbean areas it has taken hold of (as well as almost every kind of Latin or Caribbean music out there), including all of Africa, Palestinians, Australian Aborigines, Maoris and Native Americans -- this, I think, makes it more open to more diverse influences than black metal, which appears to be influenced almost entirely by Northern European and Anglo traditions (with some exceptions, I know). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 19:37, Oct 12, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Sam has a good point -- music is a fluid thing, and tends to take on components of whatever is around it. Bizarre fusions like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polka.html" title="Polka">polka</a><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocksteady.html" title="Rocksteady">steady</a> are perfectly common. Certainly, a section on how black metal takes on other influences is fine, but any comparison between how often black metal does so vs hip hop, sout or Corsican polyphonic choirs should really be annotated with who believes it, and why. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 15:37, Oct 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My summary is in perfect union w tuf-kat, a section on how black metal takes on other influences would be great, but saying it does so more or less than any given genre would likely be POV. However, if you can find some sort of expert on the subject to quote saying Black Metal is especially prone to fusion, that would be ok, so long as it is verifiable, and expressed as one POV among many.

<dd>In my opinion, Black metal isn't more easily influenced than any other kind of music. Black metal could actually be said to be especially hostile to change (For example the much famed and respected <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkthrone.html" title="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a> who have stuck to the same style since the early ninties, shunning change). There are a few progressive Black metal bands (<a href="../../../e/n/s/Enslaved_%28band%29.html" title="Enslaved (band)">Enslaved</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windir.html" title="Windir">Windir</a>, <a href="../../../m/%C3%B6/r/M%C3%B6rk_Gryning_53bf.html" title="Mörk Gryning">Mörk Gryning</a>), but this isn't any different from changes and developments in other styles of music. That the changes Black metal have undergone might seem more obvious than evolutions in other styles of music could be contributed to the fact that Black metal started out as an extremely specific and simplistic genre, and has with time gained other influences from other areas. Today, Black metal is a very wide genre. Darkthrone stay with the roots, playing "Grim" Black metal, Enslaved evolve and use uncommon song structures etc (Progressive Black metal), Dimmu Borgir use orchestral elements, ("Symphonic" Black metal), Ulver has become an electronic outfit (Have stopped being Black metal all together) and so on. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShandolad_1055.html" title="User:Shandolad">Shandolad</a> 15:53, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Black metal definitely has a very strong attitude against influences, but what they say and what they do are very different things. Since 1995 there has been a large number of very experimental black metal bands, it's in some ways necessary to be somewhat original to gain acceptance in the black metal scenes these days. I think at some point people stopped saying "true black metal" and started saying "tr000 black metal" (as in they say the same thing but now they are being sarcastic). It would be hard to say how much of black metal is experimental since it's now a grassroot genre and by the very nature of grassroot genres necessarily has a lot of imitation bands. But for the bands that exist beyond a grassroot level (if we were to somwhow arbitrarily define this) there is a trend towards experimentation.</dd>
<dd>I'm disappointed that so many people seem to be resisting adding something about this section when a few of them are not even familiar with black metal. Yes, all genres have experimental artists, but black metal, believe it or not, is a very experimental genre. It's not a handful of artists, there is a trend for black metal as a whole to experiment. We have seen the incorporation of folk, neoclassical, ambient, avant-garde, hell even mayan music has been brought into black metal. I'd just like to write something about this, it's a very real phenomenon. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanctum_7a9b.html" title="User:Sanctum">Sanctum</a> 02:05, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added musical samples for BM: 30 seconds each from Bathory-Woman of Dark Desires, Burzum-Ea, Lord of the Deeps and Immortal-Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms. I believe these musically pretty much represent what most people agree to be black metal. I was tempted to put a sample of Venom-Black Metal, but it would be useless for genre identification processes. Could someone maybe format the sample box better? I'm hopeless.

<dd>This does not to be on the black metal wikipedia page. It's obvious that it isn't an actual sub-genre.

I don't think that a section of "black metal insults" (so to speak) would be too terrible a idea, since some people are obstinate about having this mentioned. You can add things like "Norsecore," "White Metal"...--Astrosa 02:53, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Faggoth", "Troll Metal", "insults in black metal" etc. have no place in an encyclopedia. "Insults in quantum-physics" would probably not be even considered a topic in Wikipedia, so I don't see why it should apply any more to black metal. There is about as much purpose to such a section as there would be to a section called "Jokes told by black metal fans". And saying "troll metal" is a sub-genre of black metal is like saying "Lord of the rings" is a subgenre of books. I don't understand why this discussion is still going on. Not everything that is ever written on Wikipedia has to be preserved, especially not when it misleads people as much as these topics do. I think a delete is justified in this case.

<p>Faggoth is not a subgenre, its a simple swearword pertaining to the subjectively perceived "softness" of emo and goth in general. Get that right, leyasu, and stop reverting the edits - lev</p>

<dd>Firstly the term is used to mean anything associated with Goths, wether directly, indirectly, in reference, in inference, or in assumption. It does not mean only Gothic Rock and Emo.</dd>

<p>This isnt leading anywhere, leyasu. Stop being such a snide bigot and face the facts: "Faggoth" isnt a genre. Im neither "attacking bands and fans" nor am i "vandalising" when i point out the fact that "faggoth" is used to insult gothlike attire. Look at the word: faggot + goth = faggoth. If you cant bear the word being defined properly, as you obviously cant (reverting my edits with your arrogant snide remarks), delete the entry. Protecting wrong information for the sake of quantity at the cost of quality is wrong - lev</p>

<dd>POV pushing isnt correcting anything. Your blatantly using the section as a mean to make attacks at Goths and Emo's. The term isnt used soley for the purpose 'you' use it.

<dd>The entire section "Subgenres" is nothing else than mere trolling in itself. Adding "Faggoth" as a subgenre of Black Metal is a prime example. There are only two actual subgenres of Black Metal; NSBM and Viking Metal. Everything else is just a flavour of Black Metal, such as War Metal (Marduk etc) and Symphonic Black Metal (Hecate Enthroned, Old Mans Child etc). But they still remain "classic" Black Metal and do not represent additional subgenres. The question that remains is: how to categorize a band such as Amon Amarth - Death Metal because thats how they sound, or Viking Metal because the image they to convey. Id say Amon Amarth is Death Metal, we´re talking about music, and because of that the music itself should be considered when trying to link a band to a certain genre, not its lyrics - lev</dd>

<dd>Indeed. I think enough people have expressed their opposition to this section, and I simply cannot unserstand that it remains here at all. It scores a miserable 682 hits on Google (!!!!!!!!!!!!), and is unheard of by many metalheads, apparently. Honestly, if no-one gives me a valid reason to keep it I'm going to take it into my own hands to delete it, and rather sooner than later. After we have had all these disputes about coining terms, and some sub-genres have been completely disregarded despite over 13 000 hits on google (I'm thinking of Pirate Metal), we decide to keep this ridiculous entry?! It simply doesn't make sense, and it's confusing to anyone who reads the article, not to mention insulting. Honestly, <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a>, we wouldn't lose any core information by deleting this section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poor Revamp</span></h2>
<p>The edit made by 64.217.25.42/Jackliddle seems to come from someone who is novice to the subject. 1.) Black metal is not related to "Doom Metal". Black metal is more related to death metal as both started around the same time and came from the same influences (Thrash Metal). 2. There is no reason the original introduction should be reworded, since it is basically redundant as to what the original one said - that defining the genre is often subjective. While 64.217.25.42/Jackliddle's edit is certainly not vandalism, there is little rationale behind it, and the mention of the subgenre being "related" to doom metal is certainly misleading. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 00:31, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can accept the difficulty with the doom metal association, fair enough, personally I never claimed it was. The most recent revert you made (as of this talk page edit) has nothing to do with the doom metal claims. It is not just the introduction that is being disputed here. What are the problems with the "Characteristics" section where the majority of the edits by 64.217.25.42 were made? There was no reason to reword to original introduction, the recent edits were neither misleading nor false, that doesn't mean that it can't be reworded does it?</dd>

<dd>A majority of the "Characteristics" section is also misleading, and still misleading, even after 64.217.25.42 made the corrections (which I will correct in a jiff). It seems this article has gone downhill since its original edit a couple months ago.Calling black metal guitars/instrumentation more focused on "melody and atmosphere" is again taking a simplistic and inexperienced approach to the genre - being that there is also the side of black metal in which the songs are supposed to represent the most raw, blatant, visceral form of hatred, and not about "melody and atmosphere". The black metal genre did not evolve from Dimmu Borgir or Cradle of Filth, and some recent edits seem to make it look like that. Please, let's not make this look like it was written by some</dd>

<dd>Suicidal Black Metal bands often promote the listener's suicide, and not their own. So there is no paradox or conflict in the term Suicidal Black Metal. I have heard it many, many times and think it is probably starting to be accepted as a subgenre of black metal, defined as someone earlier wrote, by slow, depressive, doomy and/or extremely monotonous elements, and lyrics promoting depression and suicide <i>of the listener</i>. Besides the bands mentioned (and I don't know about Xasthur or Leviathan, as I don't know enough to comment on them), I would definitely add <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_%28band%29.html" title="Shining (band)">Shining</a> and Abyssic Hate to the list as being of the more notable suicidal black metal bands.

<p>Acoustic Black Metal does not exist.In 1995 Ulver recorded an acoustic album "Kveldssanger" which some call acoustic black metal.But this was only an acoustic album played by musicians that recorded black metal music in past.Beside Ulver there are some black metal bands that have one or two songs that are played on acoustic guitars.Then it came time when acoustic black metal was mentioned on few places but this was only a joke.There are many "bands" that go under the label of acoustic black metal but they are all a joke.One of them is Impaled Northern Moonforest. From that point acoustic black metal is a joke.Beside all that, in 2002 a band called Strevlosh recorded a three song demo.A raw recording played on one acoustic(classical)guitar. From this was born Strevlosh Zvezda which got closer to ABM than anyone else. In 2004 new demo was recorded in the studio with real drums, classical guitar and black metal vocals. At this point the band doesn't use drums anymore.There are now two classical guitars in use and black metal vocals.And at this point this is the closest anyone got to the label of ABM. Here is a page with some info for Strevlosh Zvezda <a href="http://www.audiostreet.net/strevloshzvezda" class="external free" title="http://www.audiostreet.net/strevloshzvezda" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiostreet.net/strevloshzvezda</a></p>

<dd>Sounds most like a few bands that use accoustic guitars in the same way as Gothic Metal. Which if you read, says what they have described. Nothing special really, better worth mentioning that more Black Metal bands are taking influence from Gothic Metal bands? Ie: Cradle of Filth and this Impaled Northern Moonforest? I think it shouldnt be listed as a genre, more a note that more bands are using accoustic guitars found in other Gothic Metal. Actually, the more i think about it, the more bands seem to be crossing different genres together all the time =x <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 06:41, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is it so important to mention a joke band like Impaled Northern Moonforest?</p>

<dd>For the same reason its important for you to sign your comments with four tildes (<a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 09:51, 17 December 2005 (UTC)) and give us reason on how they are a joke band. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 09:51, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't get me wrong when I ask you this: What is wrong with you? Read on Wikipedia about Impaled Northern Moonforest. You will get to part where it says "The two decided to start a joke black metal band..." Go on INM fansite and click on ABOUT and there you will read beside everything else also "they were bored and decided to make a true (joke)..." Is it so hard to get it? When a person says for his band that it is a joke, why can't you get it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is it just me, or does from that description, Suicidal Black Metal sound like a mixture of Black and Doom Metal? <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 06:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And it probably is a mixture of Black and Doom Metal. If a band sings about a certain topic it does not mean that it is inventing a whole new genre,subgenre or whatever. If a band is coming from some Asian country and sings in their language about Asian mythology and with all that plays Black metal it does not mean they are playing Asian Black metal. It takes much more to invent a new genre or subgenre or whatever.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True, but the variances of such things bear mentioning at least. Perhaps menitoning that many bands are singing and writing lyrics in their national tounge? Also would it be worth making an article to explain about bands that fuse two different, establish forms of metal together? Ie: Black/Doom, Black/Power, Doom/Power, Gothic/Death, Etc etc? I think someone there should be a place to discuss this issue. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 17:26, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have not personally heard pakistani black metal, but I would like to say that 1) if Pakistan has a metal scene, could it really be exclusively classified as black metal, and 2) if Pakistan has a metal scene, then it deserves it's own page. If a small region in the US consisting entirely of white people developed a small subculture which performed traditional Pakistani music, it would probably not be considered a part of the Pakistani traditional music 'scene.' <a href="../../../z/m/b/User%7EZmbe_9d94.html" title="User:Zmbe">zmbe</a> 19:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A valid point you make, but let me ask this. Would bands that play Black Metal that use pakistini themes be considered Black Metal?. This i think warrants not so much a merger, but perhaps mentioning in the article that Black Metal has grown large, and expansive, so that many regions have added in elements of their natives culture to their performance of Black Metal? <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 09:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The entry for Pakistani Black Metal is better fit for a magazine article. Good for Pakistan, they finally have black metal. But how does that affect or further the entire genre of black metal? The title is referencing a specific <i>scene</i> not a <i>genre</i>. That would be like me saying "you know what, I'm making a new genre.....Maryland Black Metal." The location of a certain number of bands does not necessarily mean it's an <i>entire new genre</i>. US gets the USBM distinction for its well established scene and ethics, as does Norwegian Black metal for its enormous influence on ALL black metal that has come out since. But without an established scene, credibility, influence on the rest of the genre and future bands, or a very specific and completely original sound, all Pakistani Black Metal is is a bunch of Pakistanis playing black metal.
<dl>
<dd>This comes back to the first of my two points. Should heavy metal coming from pakistan really be classified specifically and exclusively as black metal? How many ethnic or other outside influences are required for it to become a separate genre? Again, I have not personally heard this music. But I do find it remarkable that Pakistan could possibly have a metal scene that is so musically similar to black metal that it cannot be separately classified. <a href="../../../z/m/b/User%7EZmbe_9d94.html" title="User:Zmbe">zmbe</a> 21:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sentence with the parenthetical reference to NSBM currently makes no grammatical sense. It would be fine without the parenthetical bit, but that bit is so compressed that it is not even grammatical and certainly conveys nothing to me. Given that NSBM seems to be agreed by everyone to be a small part of Black Metal, I think the author of this sentence, or someone else who understands what is being said better than I do, is going to have to tease the ideas out into more than one sentence. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 12:32, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Superfluous. Pakistani black metal does not have enough relevance to be put on the main black metal page. Ask yourself the following: if you were to insist on having this on a *general* black metal page, wouldn't you also be committed to write specifically about countries more relevant to the genre insofar as evolution and contribution is concerned--eg. France, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Australia... the list goes on; i don't think there is any argument in saying these are not more black metal relevant countries than Pakistan. The reason they aren't on there is because they're not necessary for a general black metal page. Origins, evolution, content, diversity, influential bands, contraversy... these are things to be discussed. Not the ins and outs of a country's black metal scene that is superfluous to black metal in the broad scheme. --Astrosa 02:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Japan has a rising metal rock scene, black or heavy metal rhythm combined with Japanese Imperialist lyrics.

<p>-Troll metal should be removed from black metal be moved to folk metal i do think troll metal a valid subgenre and their enough bands that play what i consider trollish (Otyg , Troll bend fir , Finntroll , Troll Fest , Funeral Dust , etc..) but they use Fiddles , Flutes , Tin Whistles and other very unblack instruments plus their upbeat-</p>

<p>Troll metal doesn't exist. It never has. Calling something "troll metal" is a description, like "fire metal" or "cheesy metal." It isn't an actual subgenre of black metal. I think this requires a primer in reality. First of all, reality exists outside your ego and desires of importance by contributing some irrelevant material. Secondly, reality requires observation, not invention; while you can edit wikipedia pages, you can't edit reality. Finally, reality probably hates you and wishes ill of you. When you keep these rules in mind, you're realize that troll metal is an invention and has no places in being in an archive of material floating in the objective world.</p>

<p>I don't mean to jump into the middle of a hot debate really, but I tried to delete bands like Opeth, Nargaroth, and Velvet Cacoon from the "troll metal" section. These bands are certainly not "troll metal"; Opeth isn't even black metal at all! The person who reverted my edit said that these bands were troll metal because they are bands of "internet trolls". I believe that's a bit ridiculous, as (aside from that statement being utterly POV) wasn't it established that if troll metal does exist, it's something akin to Finntroll – black metal music themed around the Scandinavian mythology of trolls? If so, then these bands absolutely do not meet the qualifications for being "troll metal".

<dd>I agree with Morri. For the 13-something-years I have been involved in Black Metal there was a time around the mid-1990's when everyone made up new labels for every band out there, Troll Metal being one of them, but these "labels" quickly disappeared again when people realized it was black metal all the same. Some of these "Troll Metal" bands that are spoken of on the page are black metal bands with trolls in their lyrics (at varying degree), but there are black metal bands out there who also uses porno film sounds and naked women as part of their image. That doesn't make Porn Metal, Playboy Metal or Titties Metal anymore of a genre than Troll Metal. Mr. Death 08:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...hasn't been invented yet but pretty soon one of you goofballs is going to apply that term to some new band. Seriously, from an outsiders perspective (although i am a fan of what i call "heavy metal music"), it is laughable at how this type of music has inspired so many sub-genres. Don't you people have anything better to do than to try and categorize every band into it's own unique musical style? Just call it all "metal" and be done with it. People must look at these pages and just laugh and laugh at your lot.</p>
<dl>
<dd>okay, i kinda agree that some of the sub-genres are kind of questionable, but calling it all "metal" would really make no sense. I mean, it's an extreme example, but Cacophony and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Wizard_a23a.html" title="Electric Wizard">Electric Wizard</a> are both metal, but they're almost complete opposites. ALSO, even in less extreme cases, it's a helpful way for a fan of one band to find similar bands. And besides, if people actually use the different terms, wikipedia should mention them. And people DO use a lot of the terms.--<a href="../../../e/e/l/User%7EEel_cfe9.html" title="User:Eel">Eel</a> 01:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After studyinf musical genres as comphrensivly and thoroughly as i have, and still am, doing. I would like to explain to our anomynous user friend, what a genre does in its exstance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Genres start as small terms, to explain a certain small amount of bands in another genre of music, who do something that isnt akin to that music. in this case, Troll Metal is predominatly a fusion of Black Metal with Power Metal and Folk Metal aspects. This is known as a subform. The bands listed are inheritantly black metal, however due to the genres high density of bands within it, it is helpfull for fans to break it down into subgenres/subforms, for the sake of explaining different approachs to the music.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Over time, these subgenres often devolp their own scene, and a larger quanitity of bands performing that paticular style. At this time, as such, when this scene grows large enough to support, moniter, and become inclusive of itself all around the world, to the point it seperates itself from the genre it was part of, in this case black metal, it becomes a subgenre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If, and note that i said if, a genre gets so large it is recognised all around the world, even by name to those that do not understand what it entails, and, if it inspires several forms of itself, it becomes what its best called a master genre for this exercise. Master genres in typicallity are Rock N Roll music and Heavy Metal music. Master Genres, become so large in density, that their scene and music is completely indepedent of other scenes, also inspiring several versions of themselfs, while keeping what makes it what it is. For example, and i am using a fictional crystal ball here to come up with a fictional prophecy, imagine this:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Black Metal emerges, and grows big, with several subforms and groupings being used to group the expansive selection of bands within. Troll Metal grows past Black Metal and encompasses several subforms of itself, including variations of lyrical styles, troll types, and musical composition. Troll Metal gets so big, that its name is recognised throughout the world as an everyday form of music, and its subgenres/subforms grow their own sizable scenes, mostly independent of each other, while remaining synergetic with each other, and adopting the guise Troll Music to refer to them all. Troll Metal has become a master genre.</li>

<dd>The original "poster" is an idiot. He listens to music like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit and calls it "metal". Since metal is much more diverse than his nu-metal he has trouble forumulating thoughts within his small collection of neurons called his brain. Plus people of intelliegence are able to distinguish the metal genres quite easily. The OP needs to commit suicide.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Faggothic section and Norsecore</span></h2>
<p>Someone fix this entry; Faggoth only refers to wanna-be black metal bands that add an excess of gothic metal shit.</p>
<p>Also, I haven't checked to see if Norsecore has it's own page, but if so it should be merged in the section explaining what faggoth means, and if not it should be mentioned, for reference as a derogative term.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Faggoth is a term that fans such as yourself use as a Neoglistic insult. Gothic Metal fans disappreciate the term as many other fans do. Both sides of this veiw are represented. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 22:28, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Many bands have been disputed about their belonging in this category, such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir... They have been called "Faggoth" due to their excess of the "gothic" look. The fact is, however, that these accessories used by these bands are purely show, just to draw in a unique audience. Among these looks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>spiked boots</li>
<li>corpse make-up</li>
<li>piercings</li>
<li>long hair</li>
<li>leather</li>
<li>fishnet clothing</li>
<li>finger armor</li>
<li>spiked wristbands</li>
<li>black nail polish</li>
<li>black lipstick</li>
</ul>
<p>These bands have also been disputed for their use of high-pitched guitars and shreiking vocals... many true black-metal fans are aware that the sound is not what is important, it is the message, otherwise popular "death-bands" such as Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden would not have cemented their names into black-metal history. The sound just makes the band more unique, searching for a special kind of audience.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly. Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath are not Death Metal. Secondly, the above list are all used by many Black Metal bands for show, so their is no real difference between 2 bands doing it and 30 more doing it. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 02:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find this treatment of the term 'Norsecore' as a serious genre by Wikipedia to be absurd. Norsecore, as known by all those involved in the metal scene, is simply a derogatory term for what is essentialy death metal or grindcore with a thin sheen of black metal layed on top. Not to say it's bad; Panzer Division Marduk is fucking awesome.</dd>

<p>As a BM fan I have never heard of Faggoth, concerning Noisecore, this IS a serious genre in its own right, The artist Dan <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doormouse.html" title="Doormouse">Doormouse</a> mixed a compilation of Noisecore on Digitalhut Sounds a few years ago, consisting of fast noisy distorted droning techno, nothing to do with Black Metal. <a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Grace_b34c.html" title="User:A.Grace">A.Grace</a> 01:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">troll metal and its profound effects</span></h2>
<p>personally, i enjoy troll metal more than any other type of death metal. The plight of the trolls aren't expressed through music enough today, and to this day they are underapreciated, especially by those weakling Christians. I desire nothing more than to consume their flesh. If it were possible, I would be a troll and stalk the forests stalking my next victim, claiming my rite to the race, as Grendel dominated the humans of Herot</p>
<p><br />
well, i hate to disagree, but i myself feel very partial to the cause of the dwarves. they are the true spawn of satan, and where as the trolls are hulking brutes, the dwarves are the great industrialists. they are the perfect symbol of my hate for humankind as they work behind the pictures, undermining human civilization. and they have awesome names. i wish i was born a dwarf. trolls suck</p>
<p><br />
my name is schlomo lebowitz and i was just wondering why there aren't more jewish trolls?</p>
<p>Because the trolls ate them all</p>
<p>How do trolls mate? Just wondering</p>
<p>Can dwarves and trolls mate with each other? I think it would be awesome.</p>
<p>they can mate, but stories tell of frightening birth defects do to this.</p>
<p><br />
Is it true that trolls constructed kingdoms with structures built out of pure hate? Or was it some sort of hate-concrete mixture?</p>
<p><br />
Hey guys, in case you're interested in trolls. A great place to check is your local Mormon Temple.</p>
<p>Do trolls wear underwear or does it all hang out European style?</p>
<p>For the most part Trolls despise clothing, excluding, of course, battle armor.</p>

<p>Having an article that focuses exclusively on black metal in Pakistan isn't the best of ideas. What's to stop a section about black metal from Norway, Sweden, USA, Finland, Poland, Ukrain, etc, where the black metal scene is much bigger? It feels like the person who wrote the section on pakistani black metal did so mostly because of the giggles it would produce: black metal in a predominantly muslim third world country. I don't think the merge was a good idea, nor is it a good idea to devote such a large chunk fof this article to pakistani black metal. Of course, I see no harm in mentioning in this article that black metal is present even in Pakistan, but not that much more. --<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENargos_a985.html" title="User:Nargos">Nargos</a> 18:06, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree that this section is out of place. Unfortunately I wasn't aware of the AfD. I mean, I was skipping through the article, was very perplexed by the section on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html#faggoth" title="Black metal">faggoth</a> (???!!), mildly surprised by the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html#troll_metal" title="Black metal">troll metal</a> section and fairly intrigued by the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html#war_metal" title="Black metal">war metal</a> one (are these seriously 2 of the most important sub-forms, whereas <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_black_metal.html" title="Symphonic black metal">symphonic black metal</a> or folk black metal don't even have a section?)... But when I got to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html#pakistani_black_metal_bands" title="Black metal">pakistani metal bands</a>, that really blew me away.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I tried to find info on those bands. I could find neither Miasma nor Void in the Metal Archives, Taarma doesn't even have a full-length album, and I couldn't find any info on Northern Alliance's discography (either in the metal pages or on google). In fact, Taarma are from Afghanistan, not Pakistan (<a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=58400" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=58400" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>,<a href="http://taarmablackemperorjogezai.metalhordes.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://taarmablackemperorjogezai.metalhordes.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think this information should be lost, but it <i>clearly</i> shouldn't be here. If someone wants to learn more about black metal and visits the page, they might think that either these bands are really famous, or it is somehow a big deal that a couple of bands are recording demos in Pakistan. If someone with some knowledge of black metal visits the page, they'll just be really surprised to see such a big section on something they had clearly never heard of and will probably not hear of again unless they go to live in Pakistan. In either case it really doesn't make the article better quality. I don't suppose anyone wants to AfD the section again as it has already been done, but for my part I don't see why this can't be on a separate article and have a link on the black metal page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really feel comfortable with doing the overhaul, but if it was up to me I would thoroughly change the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html#subforms" title="Black metal">subforms</a> section, adding some more important ones (as I mentionned above). And seriously, there's all this deal about pirate metal, but troll metal gets even less hits on google (9760 vs. 13900/ "troll metal + music gets 685 hits vs. 11700 for "pirate metal" + music!!!!). Does the fact that a band sings about something (ie. Trolls, pirates, sci-fi, Tolkien, etc.) define their genre? Why not have a sci-fi metal and a Tolkien metal? Well, that's just my opinion anyway. --<a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris">IronChris</a> 00:05, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Difference between black metal and thrash???</span></h2>
<p>What's the differnce bewteen thrash and black metal? It seems so much similar...will someone please explain it to me? Thanks!&#160;:)</p>
<p>Actually, what is known as the first wave of black metal is basically a form of thrash. Bathory is musically very similar to thrash. However later bands moved further away from thrash. I'm not a musician myself, so I can't tell you what it is musically, but there is generally a greater emphasis on atmosphere and the lyrics are considered evil for one reason or another. Of course there are no hard set rules, but most bands who are distinctly black metal follow them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnues_271d.html" title="User:Marnues">marnues</a> 04:32, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is this genre called black metal when most of the people in this scene are racists and fascists?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black.html" title="Black">black</a> has other meanings than <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%28people%29.html" title="Black (people)">this one</a>.

<dd>Calling people racists and fascists is a serious insult. At least if you had <i>any</i> arguments to back up your theory I might accept talking this over, but you obviously know <i>nothing</i> about the subject. So please, don't talk about things you don't know about. Obviously there are racists and fascist black metal bands, just like there are racist and fascist pop bands, racist and fascist classical composers, rascist and fascist rap artists... but this is a minority. So please, look at the facts before being insulting. --<a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris">IronChris</a> 20:20, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not every hiphop group is also unfriendly regarding women and preaching male domination over the femal part of mankind (pimps and hoes), although sometimes it may appear as such. True, there are racists and fascists among black metal groups (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_black_metal_ae1c.html" title="National Socialist black metal">National Socialist black metal</a>), but won't you find these also elsewhere? Black metal and it's sub-genres often deal with paganism (turning into anti-christian and satanist tendencies) and ancient history of the Nordic countries, but being proud of your national or religious heritage is not automatically a racist or fascist act. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrynnar_aa08.html" title="User:Brynnar">Brynnar</a> 12:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With regard to racist attitudes being the in the minority view, it is worth mentioning that prominent bands such as Darkthrone and Mayhem have racist comments and attitudes attributed to them. Fenriz caused a stir when he challenged that anyone daring to criticise a Darkthrone recording should be "patronised for their obvious jewish behaviour". The same recording also featured the slogan 'Norsk Arisk Black Metal' (Norwegian Aryan Black Metal) on the back. Hellhammer, drummer of Mayhem is also purported to have stated in an interview reprinted in Michael Moynihan's 'Lords Of Chaos' that Black Metal is for whites and the prime movers within the Norwegian scene despise black people and felt that the arson incidents would have served a better purpose if mosques or synagogues had been burned instead. Emgee 7 April '06</p>
<p>The term black metal is a pun on black magic, and in no way refers to black people. Though there are a prominent amount of racists within the black metal scene, it is unfair to say that "most of the people in this scene are racists and fascists".</p>
<p>First off i'd like to state that any person who considers there are more than one type of humans on Earth ( that being, obviously, PEOPLE ) is a racist! As long as idiots don't see that and try to "fight against discrimination" we'll have nothing good on our hands. Now that i got that off my chest, the fact that there are guys out there who, by their own persona, have something against something should have no effect on their music ( not saying lyrics, just music) and much less so on the genre they approach! I might me a gay-bashing mysoginistic racist xenophobic church-burning sonuvabitch, but if i just pick my guitar you won't be able to see that, will you? And "most of the people in this scene are racists and fascists?" is just another crappy invitation to unnecessary fucking-up of other human beings. More people like this and i'll get stabbed in the street for wearing my Satyricon shirt, thus showing off my alegiance to Satan, Nazis and The Ku Klux Klan! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Mhrrr!

<dd>The section of Cyber Metal has been created by a user who openly admitted to coining the term Cyber Metal and creating an article for it.

However if there was an agreement to delete it then go ahead. I don't agree with that (maybe the black metal page isn't the right place for it, but cyber metal certainly is notable and passes the Google test easily) but if there was a discussion on the subject I accept that.

<dd>Well, I understand that we can't go around coining terms and creating names of genres for every little variation in lyrics, melody, rythm, etc. Think of someone who wants to learn more about Black Metal and who visits this article, just what are they going to think? They're just going to be confused because they'll read this long list of subgenres they had never heard of before and will probably never hear of again. I, for instance, have never heard of "faggoth" or "war metal" anywhere else than here. I have heard of cyber metal (though not often) and definitely I've heard about -and you probably have too- folk black metal (which includes most of troll metal) and <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_black_metal.html" title="Symphonic black metal">symphonic black metal</a>, but they aren't featured in this article.

<dd>As for pirate metal, some people believe it is a valid subgenre of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_metal.html" title="Power metal">power metal</a> as it scores 14.100 hits on google, but this is open to debate. I would like to point out that this is more hits than troll metal (12.100 hits), but pirate metal is not even mentionned anywhere in Wikipedia except on the article of the main "pirate metal" band, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_Wild_%28band%29_604c.html" title="Running Wild (band)">Running Wild</a>. Also, "pirate metal" has 22 times more google hits than "faggoth" (652 hits), "cyber metal" has 57 times more (36.800 hits), but faggoth remains and the other two are deleted. We need some form of concensus here, and fast, if we want to prevent edit wars and raise these articles to a good quality standard (they are just too confusing in their present state and get edited and reverted constantly, which is ridiculous).</dd>

<p>Leyasu, can you explain why you restored the "faggoth" section? What AfD are you talking about?

Besides, next to no-one voted on the AfD, which also makes me think that it was not representative. It is obvious that if that AfD took place now, the outcome would be very different.

<p>i have rewrote alot of stuff from the war metal section. it is a perfectly reasonable sub-genre with a large number of bands playing it. Info such as "troll metal" should be deleted, and probably "faggothic". but it might be worth mentioning that the term "faggothic" has been applied to a lot of bands, though is not a genre, usually an insult to the more melodic, gothic sounding black metal bands. what it says about 'faggoth' now is pretty accurate.</p>
<p>pemission to remove the 'disputed' banner from the war metal section? if anyone has any problemswith what it saya at the moment then post here and it can be discussed. but it most certainly is a sub-genre rather than just a pointless label. unsigned comment</p>
<p>I deleted Faggoth and Troll metal as per agreed above. I guess we can also safely a some undoing this is an act of vandalism? Since someone took some effort to re-write War metal, what do we do with this? Spearhead 15:04, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. i re-wrote the war metal article a few days ago (see above post) and its all be reverted to what it said before and is wildly inaccurate (to the point that i believe the person who originally wrote that has very little knowledge of the sub-genre at all). i was going to add quite a bit more because what i wrote last time was kind of rushed. why was it reverted? is what i wrote inaccurate? i know for a fact that what i wrote was a lot more bloody accurate than whats there now. e.g. "War metal is a black metal offshoot sub-genre that, since the release of a now infamous split between the bands Black Witchery and Conqueror, has been used to describe a certain sound". that split came out in 2001 and the term has been in use for much longer than that, as well as a large number of war metal bands existing prior to that!</p>
<p>Ive changed it back to its previous form (what i wrote) and changed a few parts but ill probably re-write a lot of it as its a bit poorly-worded. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 212.219.131.2 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.131.2.html" title="User talk:212.219.131.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.219.131.2_4799.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.219.131.2">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Yeah, well considering the amount of vandalism/blanking/restoring on this page, I think many people have become a bit "revert-happy". Maybe you should consider getting an account (that might make things easier for one thing). I couldn't see your previous edit, did you use another IP? Anyway I know little about war metal so I wouldn't be able to check if it was right anyway.

<p>"Vandal, vandalism, violation of AfD, block, ban"... Are these the only words you can come up with, LS? I thought that Wikipedia was based on discussion, but it's obvious that for you it's based on threatening other people. I think I've read 3 or 4 messages today from you saying "don't do this or I will get you banned". Which, considering the number of times you got blocked yourself is some heavy irony. PLEASE stop this annoying conduct, if you have a point, give your arguments. If there's a policy you cite, give the link. We're all ready to see your arguments and weigh them up like we do for anyone else.</p>
<p>About the AfDs, I haven't seen any policy that says that they are the final word. On the contrary, it seems to me that an AfD only serves to try to reach a concensus, and if no clear concensus is reached, it can be overlooked. You are so fond of citing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, so I think you should re-read the section <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_democracy" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy</a> about how wikipedia is based on discussion, not voting, and certainly not threats. If you followed just that, it would make things considerably more easy and enjoyable for yourself and for everyone else.</p>
<p>And please don't say "IronChris, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>!", because there is no personal attack to be found here, just advice. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 18:30, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I think we've hit a loophole in policy here guys, Ley (wb) is right in asserting that Troll metal was "kept" (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Troll_metal_572f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Troll metal">VfD here</a>), which means there is a place for it on WP and it shouldn't really be merged to one article and then quietly slid off the face of WP through the back door after discussion on another talk page. However, when topics like this are kept it is up to interested parties (e.g. <a href="../../../h/m/m/WP%7EHMM_ece8.html" title="WP:HMM">WikiProject Metal</a> members) to find the right place to put it. Consensus rules, but AfD consensus overrides talk page consensus. I think that we should either a) agree to create an odds and ends page of Minor heavy metal scenes and sub-genres or at least b) discuss this further at WP:HMM, where members should be about where Troll metal fits best, not who will get the better of hanging this up on the admin's board. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 16:16, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"True black metal"</span></h2>
<p>Just a little question, should there be a mention of "true black metal" in the article? It's an expression that's quite widespread (85200 google hits for example) for bands such as <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_%28band%29.html" title="Emperor (band)">Emperor</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigor.html" title="Abigor">Abigor</a>.

<dd>true black metal is probably very POV and not a proper subgenre, nevertheless it can be mentioned somewhere as some BM seem to think it is important. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Spearhead (<a href="../../../s/p/e/User_talk%7ESpearhead_01c8.html" title="User talk:Spearhead">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spearhead_b79c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spearhead">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>I don't think it should be a subform. But the article should definitely reflect the fact that there is a large number of people who are black metal purists and resist any sort of change from the early 90's black metal bands. Then it should probably be said that all bands which originally made such music have either moved on or disbanded. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnues_271d.html" title="User:Marnues">marnues</a> 22:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NO. There is no such thing as true black metal, it is simply called Black Metal. It's the new black metal that is different (modern black metal) and there are other similar genres of black metal, like symphonic black, necro black, etc.. People may use the phrase "tr00" or "kvlt" when trying to look cool or describe the age of certain black metal, but it's not a genre or any kind of classification. The genres are so overly messed up in metal because of people who are uneducated, or new to the scenes. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 23:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It remains a fact that lots of people use the term. Maybe this should be pointed out and explained, even if it isn't a subgenre. You say it isn't a subgenre, Oinkness, but I don't think "battle metal" is a genre at all. But that's just my opinion&#160;;-) On this subject, did you check out <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_metal.html" title="Epic metal">epic metal</a>? Though I think it's not a very good article (not at all in fact), there is a section on battle metal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although I originally introduced the subject of "true black metal", it was just an idea, I don't have sufficient knowledge about it to write something. So if someone can write a few sentences to explain it that would be cool (unless the concensus is to ignore "true black", then that's cool too).

<dd>The concept of "true" Black Metal is so widespread i think it warrents a mention, though i don't think you can really consider it a subgenre as such. There are certain aspects of BM that are frequently used by bands claiming to be true - harsh, lo fi production for example. There was a BM special in Terrorizer a few months ago that listed a few unique practises of BM, i will have to dig it out and read it again. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_in_albania_2b33.html" title="User:Big in albania">Big in albania</a> 13:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True in Black Metal means pretty much a band that is considered so by someone who cosiders him/herself true... One big tail-chase imo. Like yeah, i believe TRUE BLACK would be a band that plays Black Metal out of passion for it and finding that particular genre fit for expressing whatever it has to express, but i have been contradicted on this before, so maybe i'm wrong. But definitely NOT a genre and/or subgenre! No more than "KVLT" could be considered a genre! Ulfednar 06:33, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but the terms "Kvlt", "Necro" and "trOO" etc are still unigue to this genre and carry certain conotations - just look at the number of bands using the "True Norwegian Black Metal" slogan on their albums, or variations of it. This info would be useful to the article for laymen to understand the genre better through understanding some of the slang used by fans. If you knew nothing of BM, would you know that Kvlt basically = hardcore? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_in_albania_2b33.html" title="User:Big in albania">Big in albania</a> 13:10, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't you guys actually try to find out about the history behind Black Metal and the Black Metal scene in the Scandinavian? Somehow the article in Wiki that talks about it is only true to a certain extent. Why must we actually care about "True Black Metal"? Everything in this world can be true. You can lie but it's true that you have lied. What more about Black Metal being so true? And yes, Black Metal is not cool. Their terms and signs are not cool. Black Metal enthusiasts should not admire Black Metal just because it's cool. This is not the correct way to appreciate music. Black Metal is just a sub-genre out of many other Metal sub-genres. But please, don't mix Pagan Metal and War Metal with Black Metal. Black Metal may contain certain elements of the other two genres, but Black Metal is just purely a genre itself without other major influences from other genres[not even Death Metal].</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lack of Comprehension</span></h2>
<p>Every time I search for a subject to find information on, there is a discussion going on about wrong information, debates about relativity between genres, and all kinds of crap. Seriously, I looked for battle metal and it brought me to the black metal page. Black metal and battle metal are NOT THE SAME or similar at all, despite any possibly influencial relations between the genres. Thus, they should not be grouped into a single wiki... Battle Metal shouldn't be stuck on the black metal page, just as progressive metal is not the same as progressive rock.</p>
<p>I know, sometimes it can be confusing all these different metal genres, but it's really not that hard to figure out. There is no influence on black metal from punk, that is an ignorant statement. There may be punk influence on INDUSTRIAL BLACK METAL, but that's a completely different genre.</p>

<dd>I think it's quite an ignorant statement to say that there <i>are no</i> influence from punk in black metal. Of course it is. Celtic Frost, Venom, Slayer, etc. They are probably all very punk influenced, and so in extension punk have influenced for example Darkthrone, and those influenced by Darkthrone, and so on. But anyway, who cares, there are too many genres as it is. Why not just say there's Black Metal and be done with it. Oh my god (i.e. Satan), I hate genres... Mr. Death 15:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's minor. If that proposition of creating a page for minor genres leads to something, I think that would be the place.

<dd>There is also a snide comment on Troll Metal which is totally out of place ("<i>has become more accepted as a genuine sub-genre (as opposed to a meaningless label applied to a select group of bands such as 'Troll Metal')</i>"), and POV such as "<i>Many even consider it a more relevant sub-genre of black metal than National Socialist Black Metal or pagan metal</i> ".</dd>

<p>1) is war metal more of a genre than NSBM? (because nsbm is a genre with only one specific characteristic, the bands political ideology, which is irrelevent to the music especially seeing as many nsbm bands do not use NS-orientated lyrics. graveland for example. whereas war metal has specific MUSICAL characteristics.) 2) "troll metal". what i wrote wasn't a snide comment towards the "sub-genre of troll metal", but a fact that war metal isn't dictated by lyrics, but by musical factors. try asking for 'troll metal' reccomendations on a forum and see what responses you get. then try asking for war metal reccomendations on a forum and you'll see the same names come up on any metal forum (i.e. blasphemy, conqueror, AoA etc) But as far as im concerned you can delete the whole war metal part of this article. i added some info (which ive been meaning to make more detailed), but ive used wikipedia as a source of info long enough to know that its wildly innaccurate to the point of being worthless.</p>
