The vote right now may be against passage, but I don't think your hard work is for nought -- whether your proposal passes or not, the trail-blazing you did needed to be done, and if like Moses, this <i>particular</i> proposal does not make it to the Promised Land of enactment, be assured the Israelites -- your proposal's intent -- will. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 23:34, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Please don't change American English into British English unless the subject is specific to a country that uses BE or the majority of a non-country specific article already uses BE.

<ul>
<li>Except that your assertions of superiority are unfounded as far as this project is concerned. The same page also states that, "For the English Wikipedia, there is no preference among the major national varieties of English." Linguistically, I disagree with you, as I feel words such as "hospitalized" generally have their sounds better emulated with American spelling. Regardless, this project has established the coexistence of different versions of English, and your assertion of one version as "superior" and your subsequent actions upon that belief are unsettling to me, especially with your status as an administrator. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 05:33, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)

<p>Blankfaze, there are a few things you should think about before making spelling changes where both versions are accepted. First off its not considered polite to change a spelling to your preferred one unless the context <i>requires</i> it to be changed (New York Harbour to New York Harbor, etc). Also, when changing spelling, do note where and what the spelling is in context of, this was in regards to an <i>American</i> political figure on <i>American</i> soil, and should therefore be in American English, if either choice is preferable. I'd also like to point out that in controversial cases like this, it can only help your case to note in the edit summary "Changed spelling to British English, due to context", if you can't claim that, then you probably shouldn't be changing it. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"></a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">siro</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><font color="#627562"><i>χ</i></font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">o</font></a> 04:52, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, Siroxo, thank you, really, for trying to help... But I'm going with proper English. I understand your points, but using correct spellings is in the best interest of an encyclopaedia. I think it's silly to insist on corrupted spellings over the correct ones. Even still, I DO NOT go around changing spellings on topics explicitly American. The main page, however, is an exception. It is the most visible page there is, and as such, ought to look like it! So I will continue to correct any such misspelling on the main page, and defend it if I have to. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 05:59, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>British English is not "proper" English. There is no such thing as "proper English" in the way you seem to be implying. Having said that if you want to talk about which form of english is best then the only reasonable authority would be the OED. How else could you possibly define it? Conventions in this Encylopedia is to use either spelling, at not to correct spelling difference across the pond either way. This convention (it could even by policy but i can't be bothered to search for it) has the wonderful propert of averting these kind of argument. Having said all that, putting all seriousness aside, everyone should read <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_UK_spelling_campaign" class="extiw" title="meta:Guerilla_UK_spelling_campaign">meta:Guerilla UK spelling campaign</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Nate the Stork)</a> 15:19, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know you are a firm believer in the 2,000 edit count requirement for administrator, and I respect your perspective. I just wanted to note here, in case you were unaware, that AcademicChallenger's user page makes mention of the fact that he is blind, an obstacle which has made learning and using Wiki format more difficult than it is for most of us. I'm not saying you should necessarily alter your vote on that account, but I did want to note that the circumstances Michael Snow and I were alluding to are not the more common "ah, but this person writes substantial edits and new articles, which reduces edit count"....even though that is true of Academic Challenger. I assumed that, if you were not aware of this circumstance, you might want to be made aware of it. Of course I can still understand your desire for administrators with more experience in personal disputes, etc., and therefore your sticking by the edit count requirement. I just thought you'd want to know if you didn't already. Sorry to ramble, and sorry I never seem to drop by here to, say, thank you for being a good editor and an intelligent contributor (I do think you are both, and I am thankful). Best wishes this fall, and thanks for hearing me out.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 19:43, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I disagree that such comments are outside the bounds of good etiquette. It does serve a purpose - it lets onlookers know, "Hey! This vote is really stupid and ridiculous, not to mention baseless! Don't take it into consideration at all!" That said, I do not seek to embarass you. You do that fully well on your own, by opposing CryptoDerk. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 07:52, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>I have removed the attack (and that is certainly what I consider it). After getting to know Crypto, I have formed a different opinion of him, and have changed my vote. Calling people or votes "stupid" is completely uncivil.... take that sort of thing directly to the voter before posting something so inflammatory. Jwrosenzweig's comment is an example of a good way to handle the same thing, and I respect him for it... yours is an example of the opposite. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 07:58, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've asked you a number of times to stop. Calling me stupid serves no purpose, and is a blatant personal attack. You have "won" and a I have changed my vote -- leave it at that and stop with the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flamebait.html" title="Flamebait">flamebait</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:49, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)</li>
