<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacksad.html" title="Edit section: Plot and Style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot and Style</span></h2>
<p>The story is set in a <i><a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_noir.html" title="Film noir">film noir</a></i> environment, in the USA of the late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950s</a>. All the characters are <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphic.html" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animals</a> (female characters are often much more anthropomorphized), their specific species reflecting their personality and their part in the story. For example, nearly all the policemen are <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canidae.html" title="Canidae">canid</a>, usually <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Shepherd_5cb5.html" title="German Shepherd">German Shepherds</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodhound.html" title="Bloodhound">Bloodhounds</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox.html" title="Fox">Foxes</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Terrier_bf1b.html" title="Scottish Terrier">Scottish Terriers</a>.</p>
<p>The strip is made with a rather dirty-realist outlook, a dark cinematic style and fairly clean, realistic lines. Coupled with the truly lavish and time-consuming drawing, done in watercolor, the strip appears very realistic indeed despite using animals. The quality of the drawing has improved noticeably throughout the series, with sharper, higher-quality colour and less grainy lines in later issues.</p>

<i>Arctic Nation</i> cover, French edition.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This volume deals with inter-racial violence and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> of the 1950's in a pseudo-American suburbia called <i>the Line</i>. The book also obliquely addresses issues of economic depression, sexual repression and perversion, all intended to expose the social malaise and prejudice that exist beneath the apparently harmonious surfaces of communities.</p>
<p>Beginning with a black vulture hanged in a street, Blacksad meets his future sidekick, <i>Weekly</i>. Blacksad rejects him at first due to his unpleasant smell, and because Weekly mistakes him for a fellow tabloid journalist.</p>
<p>Blacksad is working for an old <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_school.html" title="Elementary school">elementary school</a> teacher, Miss Grey (a <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazelle.html" title="Gazelle">gazelle</a>), to find and rescue a young <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bear</a> girl, Kyle (in some editions Kayleigh), who was kidnapped, quite possibly by "Arctic Nation", a <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_organisation.html" title="Political organisation">political organisation</a> similar to the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>.</p>
<p>After becoming friends with Weekly through the latter's persistence, Blacksad is harassed in a bar by three Arctic Nation goons (resulting in one of them being thrown into the bar counter). Their leader, a white <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_fox.html" title="Arctic fox">Arctic fox</a> called Huk, turns out to be a close friend of the local Chief of Police, Karup (a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_bear.html" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a>). The pair is taken to Karup and he is shown to have some <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_prejudice.html" title="Racial prejudice">racial prejudice</a> himself.</p>
<p>Blacksad subsequently confronts Kayleigh's mother, Dinah, about her daughter's disappearance, which she has mysteriously failed to report to the police. He suggests an affair between herself and the son of Oldsmill, a rich white <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialite.html" title="Socialite">socialite</a>. This line of inquiry was prompted initially by Miss Grey. Dinah takes great offence at the insinuation, casting doubt onto its validity as a lead. In the following scenes, he and Weekly clash with a black activist organisation - the "Black Claws"—themselves originally accused of Kyle's abduction, and similar in their tough <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_racism.html" title="Reverse racism">reverse racism</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>'s doctrines. They force Weekly to publish a statement denying their involvement in the kidnapping. Blacksad then decides to follow the Oldsmill lead, but discovers that Oldsmill's son is mentally handicapped (the result, it is suggested, of the Oldsmill family's <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endogamy.html" title="Endogamy">endogamy</a>), and thus unlikely to have had an affair with Dinah.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Weekly investigates the activities of Karup's wife, Jezabel (again, a 'white' <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bear</a>), discovering her affair with Huk and her emotional meeting with Dinah, in which she appears to blackmail Jezabel by threatening to reveal 'what she knows'. This compounds suspicion on Karup, already rumoured to be a <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophile.html" title="Paedophile">paedophile</a>. Blacksad then returns to Dinah's apartment to find her dead. At this point, suspecting Karup of the murder, he confronts him and his wife, whom he accuses of adultery. In consequence, Karup attacks Huk and argues violently with Jezabel: during their tête-à-tête, it comes to light that they have never had <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>, and that Karup is, seemingly genuinely, not a pædophile.</p>
<p>At the violent climax, a black <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magpie.html" title="Magpie">magpie</a> called Cotten (complicit in the abduction and threatened into co-operation) leads Blacksad to an Arctic Nation meeting in a derelict <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a> factory where Kayleigh - and Weekly, also having been abducted - are hidden. Blacksad saves Weekly from a gibbet after Karup is betrayed and hanged himself by Huk, under the (false) pretence of kidnaping and child-abuse. As the factory burns and Cotten is shot dead by Huk, Blacksad rescues Kayleigh, along with Weekly. Later, he finds Huk dead in his garage - with a screwdriver through the brain.</p>
<p>The book's finale sees Blacksad cornering Jezabel after her husband's funeral, proving, through a matching birthmark, that she is Dinah's twin. Jezabel clears up the loose ends: her father was in fact Karup, who had abandoned her black, pregnant mother to die after being turned by the racist doctrines of the Oldsmill set. However, Jezabel's mother lived long enough to raise the twins, and, fuelled by revenge, Jezabel ascended 'white society' under a false identity, eventually marrying Karup, but refusing him any intimacy (in a bizarrely platonic <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electra_complex.html" title="Electra complex">Electra complex</a>). With Dinah hired as their maid, Jezabel seduced and manipulated Huk, using him to carry out the fake kidnapping, thus capitalising on the rumours of Karup's pædophilia. Huk also spontaneously murdered Dinah 'to make sure she kept her mouth shut'; and so in the aftermath of Karup's hanging, Jezabel in turn killed Huk by way of vengeance. The book concludes by highlighting Kyle's innocence and her ultimate abandonment, but her fate is not made clear.</p>
<p>There are probably some discrepancies between publications. Cotten is also seen as Hewitt, Kayleigh as Kyle, and some versions of the book end with Blacksad scattering Cotten's (Hewitt's) ashes to the wind over <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, fulfilling his last wish.</p>

<p>Is based firmly shortly before the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Red_Scare_cc7f.html" title="Second Red Scare">Red Scare</a>, Blacksad is employed as a <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyguard.html" title="Bodyguard">bodyguard</a> for a rich old <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tortoise.html" title="Tortoise">tortoise</a> called Hewitt Mandeline, who goes on a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> trip to Las Vegas. After returning home, Blacksad's last assignment is to accompany him to an art gallery, where he meets his friend Smirnov with his family. He finds a leaflet for <i>An Energy for Peace</i>, a lecture given by his old school teacher, Otto Liebber (an <a href="../../../o/w/l/Owl.html" title="Owl">owl</a>) a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_physics.html" title="Nuclear physics">nuclear physician</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> candidate, supported by the rich, young, dynamic, idle <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> Samuel Gotfield (a <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatian.html" title="Dalmatian">dalmatian</a>) and his titular scientific research foundation.</p>
<p>However, all is not going well for Liebber and the Gotfield Foundation; the lecture hall is mobbed by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communist.html" title="Anti-communist">anti-communist</a> rioters and Blacksad takes an instant dislike for Gotfield, who makes a mockery of the lecture. He also meets Gotfield's fiancee, writer Alma Mayer, who reacts frostily to him. Gotfield invites him to a party at his luxurious coastal mansion where Blacksad meets the so-called 'Twelve Apostles' - twelve <a href="../../../l/e/f/Leftist.html" title="Leftist">Leftist</a> intellectuals who gather near Gotfield for protection from the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_Hunt_962f.html" title="Witch Hunt">Witch Hunt</a>: Greenberg, a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">beat poet</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a> Dora, Klein the <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculptor.html" title="Sculptor">sculptor</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> Bill Ratcliff and scriptwriter Jess Logan, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painter.html" title="Painter">painter</a> Sergei Litvak, accomplished <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemist.html" title="Chemist">chemist</a> Laszlo Herzl and Ms. Mayer herself. After Blacksad grudgingly saves a drunken Gotfield from drowning, with the help of Liebber's close friend Otero, Herzl angrily accuses Liebber of promoting <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weaponry.html" title="Nuclear weaponry">nuclear weapons</a>, ending the 'party' on a poor note. When Otero gets back home, he is killed by a mysterious <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile.html" title="Crocodile">crocodile</a> assassin. It seems he actually meant to kill Liebber.</p>
<p>Blacksad and Alma - who will soon marry Gotfield, planning on a honeymoon to <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara_Falls_ba00.html" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a>—begin to have feelings for each other. Blacksad decides to become Liebber's 'Guardian Angel', following him and observing him. Soon he saves Liebber from a car bomb, planted at a garage entrance by the same crocodile, but despite a destructive leap through a pane of glass and brutal hand-to-hand combat, he fails to stop the goon from escaping and Liebber disappears from the scene leaving just a wrecked <a href="../../../d/e/s/DeSoto_%28automobile%29_96f6.html" title="DeSoto (automobile)">DeSoto</a>.</p>
<p>From Smirnov, Blacksad learns that the crocodile is a highly-regarded <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_killing.html" title="Contract killing">hit man</a> known as Ribs, and that his bomb was uncharacteristically chemically complex. Suspecting that Herzl the chemist might have hired Ribs to kill Liebber out of professional jealousy, Blacksad confronts Herzl. To his surprise, Herzl is a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_hunter.html" title="Nazi hunter">Nazi hunter</a>, who shows him photographic proof that Liebber used to work for the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Third Reich</a>. (The story never resolves who hired Ribs.)</p>
<p>Stricken with this new information, Blacksad seeks solace from Alma, but before they can meet, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> arrests her and other Apostles as communists, inexplicably betrayed by Gotfield. When the FBI agents visit Litvak in his art studio, they accidentally kill him after injecting him with <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_thiopental.html" title="Sodium thiopental">truth serum</a> to try and find out where Liebber is. Liebber, meanwhile, has returned to his old neighborhood (where Blacksad also grew up), only to find it overcome by poverty and his father's church in ruins. Suffering a personal crisis, Liebber hides at the city <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarium.html" title="Aquarium">aquarium</a>, where Blacksad once hid as a child.</p>
<p>Blacksad intercepts the FBI agents before they take Alma away and rescues her, taking shelter in Weekly's apartment. Falling in love with Alma, Blacksad promises to take her to Niagara Falls, which none of her previous husbands ever managed to do, and which to her is an important act of commitment. Blacksad then finds a fatalistic Liebber at the aquarium. Liebber admits to a lifetime of failure, trying to improve the world and reduce suffering, only to make the wrong choices and leaving the world worse than before. His last sin was to follow Litvak's advice: that to maintain the balance of world peace, both Russia and the United States would need to have nuclear bombs - and Liebber has been supplying Litvak with the information for the Russians.</p>
<p>Hoping to minimize the damage, Blacksad visits Litvak's studio only to find his dead body. Realizing that Litvak had copied Liebber's information onto a canvas and then painted over it to disguise it as a work of art, Blacksad goes to the shipyards, where the painting has been loaded onto a boat bound for an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_exhibition.html" title="Art exhibition">art exhibition</a> in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Berlin_ec48.html" title="East Berlin">East Berlin</a>. It turns out Litvak had made two copies of the painting entitled "Red Soul", one of which would return to North America after the exhibition, while the other copy (containing Liebber's information) would remain behind for the Russians' nuclear program. Blacksad re-routes this painting to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>As Blacksad prepares for his trip to Niagara Falls, the FBI agents arrest him and plant fake evidence to frame Blacksad for killing the painter. Senator Gallo himself interrogates Blacksad, trying to find out where Liebber is hiding. When Blacksad refuses to cooperate, Gallo points out that his fingerprints were found in Litvak's studio and that he is likely to die in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_chair.html" title="Electric chair">electric chair</a> if he refuses to cooperate. Blacksad is then released.</p>
<p>Blacksad visits Gotfield to find out what made him betray his friends and move into Gallo's camp. Since Gotfield is rich, Blacksad deduces that Gallo must have offered him something money couldn't buy, and this turns out to be the case. Gotfield is now one of a selected group of people who will be evacuated to a special government shelter in the event of a nuclear war. The main criteria for selection is being a friend or supporter of Senator Gallo.</p>
<p>Finding a list of names along with a description of this plan (called 'Project Noah') in Gotfield's safe, Blacksad uses it to blackmail Gallo. Blacksad is not blamed for Litvak's death, and the government fakes Liebber's death and allows him to leave the country. Blacksad gives the list of names to Weekly in a sealed envelope, with instructions to publish the contents if anything happens to him.</p>
<p>The end of the comic is bittersweet. Liebber writes Blacksad a letter, explaining that he has returned to Germany where he is happy again, helping a community rebuild itself after the war, and is teaching children to read and write. Alma, meanwhile, gives up on Blacksad after she reads the (fake) story in the newspaper that Liebber committed suicide after Blacksad turned him in. In her mind, Blacksad is now as much a traitor as Gotfield. Blacksad tries to find her again, but she has vanished.</p>
