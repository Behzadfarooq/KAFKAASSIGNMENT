<p>Black first made an appearance in the album world in G-Series' mixed album, "Chharpotro", where their song "Chena Dukkho" was met with immense praise and became a fan favorite. They later continued to contribute to G-Series mixed albums, while working on their own album "Amar Prithibi", released in 2002. "Amar Prithibi" was a huge success, immediately solidifying Black's position as one of the best new bands in the country. It was also the fist alternative rock album ever released in Bangladesh, which until the late 90s was heavily dominated by soft rock/pop groups like Feelings, Miles and the occasional hard rock bands like Warfaze. Songs such as "Obhiman", "Amar Prithibi", "Amra" and "Prarthonad" all went on to become huge hits from that album. In the meantime, Black continued to produce songs for mixed albums like "Anushilon", "Projonmo", "Din Bodol" (which featured their collaboration with popular bands Artcell and Cryptic Fate on the song "Ashirbaad") and "Lokayot". They were also featured in the mixed album series of Sumon (Aurthohin), with tracks in "Agantuk", "Agantuk-2" and "Agantuk-3".</p>
<p>In November 2003, they released their sophomore album, "Utshober Por". This was probably the most controversial album in the Bangladesh Music Scene, as it had a total different sound then its predecessor. A much more mature effort, in terms of experimentation, than "Amar Prithibi", "Utshober Por" featured a more commercial alternative sound that older Black fans were not used to. Although this album seems to be a bigger hit than the first album, this album was less universally praised than the first one as a lot of fans seemed to be alienated by the new commercial sound. But then again it can be said that "Utshober Por" was an album that was far ahead of its time for Bangladesh. Black created a whole new listner group from this album. Moreover the band BLACK had become more popular when they were casted in the telefilm play named "OFFBEAT" which was telecasted on valentines day of 2004 in Bangladesh on Channel I.</p>
<p>The band has remained on hiatus with recording another album after the tragic accident that claimed the life of sound engineer Mobin and severely injured their bassist, Miraj, and their drummer, Tony. They started to practice again according to a local newspaper almost a year after the fatal accident. It took a while for Miraj to recover, during which the legendary Bassbaba (Sumon) of Aurthohin filled in for him.</p>
<p>Black's keyboard player, Tahsan, launched his own solo career in 2004 with the release of the album "Kothopokothon". The album had a completely different sound to Black's albums, as it was mostly a pop fare. It was a big hit, particularly the song "Irsha" which soon became a fan favorite. In 2005, Tahsan released his second solo album 'Kritodasher Nirban', followed by his third, 'Ichche' in 2006.</p>
<p>However, early in 2006 it was made official that after a mutual understanding, keyboard player Tahsan had left the band. Many Tahsan purists developed a negative aspect towards the band. The debate of Tahsan leaving the band as a positive or negative turnabout still lingers on. Though hardcore fans of Tahsan's were in a state of denial, the speculations of any sort of animosity between him and the other members are entirely untrue, as solidified by the remaining members of Black. Although much rumored, there is apparently no third party involved in Tahsan's departure. No matter what, it was a sad day when Tahsan and Black each took their own way. But nevertheless now both of them have their own genres to ply on.</p>
<p>Black is going to start the recording of their 3rd Album from September Onwards. They are done with the construction of their own studio. All the equipment have arrived, and it is said that their 3rd album will hit the market sometime in the middle of this year. Although the band reports that the album title is yet undecided. Black has confirmed that they will change their style a bit, and they have said they will bring fusion, and other soft numbers in their albums. Their lead vocalist Jon is said to sing unconventional soft songs that will be a heart break for the rock based fan of the country.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%28Bangladeshi_band%29_6641.html" title="Edit section: Return of Black">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return of Black</span></h2>
<p>After a long time, Black released a song titled "35" in the mixed album "Underground". This album was released on 21st october 2006. The song was one of the biggest underground hits of the year. "35" was the first song they released after the horrendous car accident which nearly left their bassist Miraj crippled. After a long hiatus Miraj is expected to finally step into the band again. Details are quite sketchy but Miraj is expected to start appearing on Black's practice sessions again.</p>
