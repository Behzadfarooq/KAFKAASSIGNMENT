<p>I think most blacks would disagree that they are "left-wing." The tendency to vote for Democratic candidates does not make one left-wing. Is this an informative article, or an editorial?? Kemet 21 Nov 2005.</p>
<p>Why is racial integration considered a linchpin of conservatism? It seems to produce a dissonance with individualism. I wouldn't expect us to support segregation, or be hostile to integration, but I just don't think it's necessary to promote it or even support it to be a black conservative. <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan.html" title="Juan">Juan</a></p>

<p>Just like there is no blanket position with black liberals, there is certainly no blanket position with black conservatives.

<p>I'm not entirely sure how we can neutrally distinguish these two situations, but it is clear that there is a significant difference between being a Reconstruction-era black Republican and being a black Republican today.</p>
<p>Reconstruction-era black republicans were not "conservatives", at least not by any useful standard of the time. They certainly weren't about to become southern Democrats!

<dd>The problem with saying Jackie Robinson is a black conservative is this idea that Democrat equals liberal. The Democratic party when Robinson was growing up were the remnants of the Democratic party of the late 1800's (i.e., the South) so Democrat did not equal liberal, Democrats equaled racist, so I would question the validity of trying to classify who and who isn't a black conservative.</dd>

<p>Fair enough -- I haven't been on Fox News since last summer (had to back off with going to work for a television station), and I have scaled back my writing output. I have also put my blog on hold for the moment (though I will probably put some links and other "minor stuff" online there soon).

<p>I would question the placement of Black Republicans on a page about Black conservatism as it seems to equate the two. Being a Black Republican doest not mean the person is a Black conservative, especially when you talk about people in the late 19th century and early 20th century. We have to remember that the Democratic party was the South, so most Blacks by default chose to be Republican. The shift towards the Democrats started under Roosevelt and after the 1960's it would be disingenuous to say that Republicans of more recent times are even comparable to the progressives of the early 20th century or the party in the post-Civil War era.</p>
<p>I suggest that Black Republicans, or the history of Black Republicanism be given a new page or removed from the Black conservatives page. We have to remember that parties are fluid and the placement of this list on the page suggests an ideology that has remained the same for decades.</p>

<p>I think I know where this came from, but I'm a fan of the show and I don't think it's accurate to see him as a conservative. He has conservative views on many crime-related issues, but he is also strongly progressive/liberal/other in non-crime areas. In the first 2 seasons especially he's depicted as intense about racial concerns and implies Lt. Gee is a sell-out. He chides Bayliss for being prudish and annoys Beau by implying he's a racist. In a Season 4 episode he makes a mocking reference about becoming a Republican because they're cold and uncaring. Anyway unless there's something I'm missing I hope this removal is acceptable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<p>Does it seem to anyone else this article has a great many problems? It seems like it's trying to deal with one bias with a counter-bias and comes out a bit confused. Also on reflection much of it seems to see the black community as just liberal majority versus conservative minority, which seems a bit exaggerated. In life and judging by commentary I think a great many, possibly as much or more than a third, of African Americans deem themselves independent or moderate with some just apolitical. The vast majority votes Democrat, but I'm not sure that means the vast majority is "liberal" in the US sense. On many social issues the African American community comes out moderately conservative judging by polls. However we have a two party system in the US so if you dislike the Republicans (and I think it's fair to say most African-Americans do) you vote Democrat, but that doesn't mean you per se identify as liberal or Left.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>This article is very biased, I feel that it is racist, probably original research or from very bad sources.</p>
<p>Majority of blacks do not identify with the left on many of the issues on this site. First off, the way this site defines the left is incorrect. But mainly, the majority on blacks have conservative views on social issues. To claim otherwise is total ignorance and racist. 75.2.250.145 04:03, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I edited I tried to differentiate a bit. From what I can tell 19-28% of the black population self-describes as "conservative" to a moderate or strong degree. However going by the partisan numbers I know of this means up to half, or maybe more, of the "Black conservatives" are Democrats. Likewise to say the black population is mostly Left, as this once did, is almost certainly misleading. A great deal of blacks are moderate or politically mixed/independent. (If the US had a viable <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Democratic_Party_1cd2.html" title="Christian Democratic Party">Christian Democratic Party</a>, or a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a> party, I think it's possible it could do well in the black community)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>Reading on her I wonder if she should be mentioned. In some ways I think calling her politics "conservative" is a bit misleading. She opposed integration largely based on her support of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League_c21c.html" title="Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League">Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_nationalism.html" title="Black nationalism">black nationalism</a>. For example her letter opposing Brown largely seems to indicate she deems blacks to be a separate culture that does not need to associate with white America and that integration was based on the idea blacks needed "white mares" to uplift them. However she did support <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Taft_a229.html" title="Robert Taft">Robert Taft</a> and was staunchly anti-communist.
