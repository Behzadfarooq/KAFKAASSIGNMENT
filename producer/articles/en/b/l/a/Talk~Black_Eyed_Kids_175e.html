<dd>I completely disagree.

<dd>Please don't be dumb. Let's not get off topic, and also let's not go around claiming that there really are such beings as 'black eyed kids' when there is no substantial evidence and a hell of a lot of proof that the supernatural does not exist. Let's keep neutral and not go into some kind of paranoid fantasy about the paranormal actually existing, children.

<dd>Please be civil and refrain from ignorant comments as the one above. If the supernatural were stupid then we might as well delete every article relating to it. The fact that it is a paranormal phenomena relates to the fact that there is not substantial scientific evidence to prove against or for it. An urban legend is merely a scary story passed on throughout the ages to scare people, this is not the case seeing as it is a PHENOMENA that has occurred to several people in recent times - I have not heard or seen of any urban legend depicting such "supernatural" phenomenon before, simply because it was not documented prior to the experience. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 00:30, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is as much an urban legend as BigFoot or Ghosts. The only difference being that its origins are much more recent. I say relabel it as "paranormal phenomenon" or something of the like rather than urban legend. The origins are easily traceable to Brian Bethel, there is no "a friend of my cousin's girlfriend" activity going on, and it has been supposedly experienced by other people not connected with Bethel. I'm not saying there are demonic children running around, I'm just saying that it isn't an Urban Legend and therefore shouldn't be labeled as such. --Iavas <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.130.128.106 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.130.128.106_7edc.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.130.128.106">contribs</a>) 23:23, July 19, 2006.</small>

<p>This article relates a <b>paranormal phenomenon</b> not an urban legend or legendary creature. This phenomenon is not an urban legend because the eye-witness accounts by other people are first-hand and not: "this happened to the cousin of my friend's girlfriend etc..." and are not based on hearsay or traditional folklore, nor are they legendary creatures because this is a relatively modern phenomenon which cannot be attributed to any older source as for instance the Mothman Prophecies or Jersey Devil can. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 16:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Urban legend is essentially modern folklore. Simply calling the story folklore would be misleading in the same way that the category 'legendary creatures' might be, because, as you said, it implies that they've been around longer than they have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 'friend of a friend' type urban legends (dogs in the microwave, killer pop-rocks, etc) are very common and often the first thing one thinks of when the term is mentioned, but stories like the Roswell crash, the men in black, area 51 and most conspiracy theories are also prime examples of urban legend as modern folklore. It's not about the source (or lack thereof) of the story - there are plenty of people who claim to have met MIBs or to have been abducted by aliens. Those are still urban legends in part because of the way that people who <i>did not</i> experience them first hand continue to pass them around. This isn't about the reliability of those who've reported seeing them, it's not about passing a judgement on the story, it's not an attempt to make it seem less important or interesting, but the Black Eyed Kids are definitely a part of urban legend.</dd>

<dd>Look I'm not trying to cause any disruption, you do what you feel is correct, but as far as I'm concerned the definition of legend (although it adheres to the probability of an event or occurence having existed) it is still reliant on several factors - such as being a story that is pased on through society and is usually observd or recorded in larger numbers than is the case with the BEK. Anyway this is still clearly not folklore nor a modern legend. It is a phenomena which has as of yet minimal coverage. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 15:22, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been reading more and more reports online about black eyed people of all ages. Some of them have the same threatening aura as in Bethel's report while others only seem "odd" or "out of place". Either way, I highly suggest renaming the article "Black Eyed People" phenomenon or something less specific than "Black Eyed Kids". I realize that originally that is what the phenomenon was called, but there are at least as many reports about very similar occurances with adults instead of kids. If you would like some examples, I suggest going to <a href="http://paranormal.about.com/library/blstories06.htm" class="external free" title="http://paranormal.about.com/library/blstories06.htm" rel="nofollow">http://paranormal.about.com/library/blstories06.htm</a> (sorry, I don't know how to link in wiki). The article should also be updated to include these new reports. (68.156.227.159 11:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point, I assume this calls for a "redirect" - for people looking for Black Eyed Kids or Black Eyed People. However the phenomenon is <i>known</i> in the parapsychological community as BEK. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 12:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being notable on paranormal websites doesn't mean this is something that's been picked up on the published sources that wikipedia guidelines require. Since indecision or total misunderstanding of guidlines has garnered this page a keep, where can it be merged so we can reduce the total amount of unsourced and unsourcable original research? 24.118.141.128 21:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are we to delete or merge every article about something that has not yet become popular enough to warrant an official publication? I wasn't aware that Wikipedia was based on a popularity contest or the tabloids. Granted, there is no scientific study done on the subject, nor is it widespread enough to be included in a book on the paranormal (of which I am aware). However, given the multiple and growing number of reports, at least one of which is by a trustworthy source, there is absolutely no reason to demote this article to a mere mention. It should be, if anything, expanded upon, as there is plenty of room for the newer material. Again, just because the source is online does not automatically mean that it is worthless. 68.156.227.188 22:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
