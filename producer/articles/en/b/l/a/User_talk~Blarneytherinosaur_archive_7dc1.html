<p>Hi - welcome aboard! Like the work on Knight's Point, and also the additions to my former home town (Milton). Have a look at the Knight's Point article now - both Gadfium and I have made a couple of tiny changes, which should show you a little more about Wikipedia's "house style" - <i>very small</i> changes though, because the article is good work! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 08:20, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Cheers for quickly reverting the rubbish by 162.40.181.140! I had just made a small edit and noticed it myself and was in the process of removing it when you spotted it. Great work! Blarneytherinosaur 03:14, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>No problem; your edit went in just moments after his, so you might not have noticed the earlier vandalism. I've seen worse slip through and go unnoticed for days. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 03:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for adding to the 'Presbyterian Ladies' Collge, Sydney'! Im new to Wiki so if you could work out how to add the school crest and/or a couple of pics that would be great! And plese feel free to add/delete/change whatever you want..Im very short on free time so can't see myself finishing it anytime soon.

<p>Hi Blarney - finally got the photos done for the Milton article, and I've also extended the information on the town's history. Thought you might like to give it a look... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 08:20, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad you like the photos. I used to live only about a block from that church (in Spenser Street, if you know Milton at all). BTW, I've just realised I know an ex-Gore broadcaster in Victoria, but his name is Derek, so it's not you&#160;:)<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You might be aware that there has been some contention around the use of userboxes. There has also been a new <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Templates" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criterion</a> added with regard to templates.</p>
<p>A box you are using, Template:User Antipope was recently tagged as such. I've removed the tag, but would ask that you {{subst:}} the template.

<p>I thought those people who were working on the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock.html" title="Clock">Clock</a> page had agreed to include Analog Clock as a subsection of Clock... Did you talk to anyone on the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Talk%7EClock_9eee.html" title="Talk:Clock">Clock Talk Page</a> about this decision of yours to create a new Analog Clock article?

<dd>To answer your question, no, I didn't check <a href="../../../c/l/o/Talk%7EClock_9eee.html" title="Talk:Clock">Talk:Clock</a> before I changed <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_clock.html" title="Analog clock">analog clock</a> from a redirect to a short article so I didn't realize that there had been a discussion about this. I was trying to find somewhere to direct a redlink for [[analogue clock]] and when I found analog clock redirecting to <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock.html" title="Clock">clock</a>. I saw that there was an article for digital clocks so saw no reason why anaglog clocks shouldn't have one too. Would you like me to restore things to their original state, or would you prefer to do so yourself?</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your responses! There's no worries with the edit; you'll notice I had corrected the link edit to function properly. Nothing wrong with it. Also, I was a bit mistaken - it was the discussion of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_clock.html" title="Digital clock">Digital clock</a> that was on the Talk Page, and they had decided against making a whole new article for Digital clock, and yet... there it is... So I don't think an article about Analog Clocks is out of place, either. I just am heavily fond of discussing any potential big changes, or at least mentioning them on the Talk Page so that people who question them can address their concerns smoothly and easily. &#160;:)<br />
Feel free to keep the new article (and make it grow to at least the same size as the Digital Clock article) and link, but I would consider posting a message on the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Talk%7EClock_9eee.html" title="Talk:Clock">Clock Talk Page</a> about it --- that way, you might get some more people contributing to its growth, too, after all! &#160;:) Thank you for your swift reply, I apologize if I came off reprimanding when it was more curiosity. -<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">JC</a> 04:53, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know you are interested in christianity, and I recently started a new wiki over at wikicities which is on the subject of christianity. <a href="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian Knowledge Base</a> is the site.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV. It is not meant to be a mere Christian Encyclopedia, but to foster a real sense of community. I'd like to include things like current events, news, stories, and anything that would add to both an understanding of Christianity, but also its enjoyment. I'm looking for help to build a resource that could really enrich the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. <a href="../../../n/s/a/User%7ENsandwich_4afa.html" title="User:Nsandwich">nsandwich</a> 05:51, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If in doubt, then don't subst. If you are not explicitly told to subst a template, don't. See also <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUBST_6f53.html" title="WP:SUBST">WP:SUBST</a>. Note that there is some disagreement among wikipedians whether to subst or not. I'm rather in the non-subst camp, due to the maintenance problems that substing of templates creates. If we do not subst, then changes to the template are automatically broadcasted to the use locations. This is very helpful. Substed templates need to be manually updated, causing lots of edits and hard work. Subst also has the problem, that it is not complete. This means only the first "layer" of template is replaced. There is a proposal to fix this at <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2777" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:2777">bugzilla:2777</a> with the new "substall" command (I have also voted there for this bug, I recommend to do this too. Everybody can create a login on bugzilla and vote for a bug to be fixed). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 07:03, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are a christian? How do you think those girls feel to have that incident linked to PLC's entry in Wikipedia? It is old new and as the article says it is also a complete media fantasy. You seem determined to keep the reference to it in place despite people removing it. Can you justify your actions on christian grounds? How about forgive and forget.

<p>Dear Blarney, Thank you for replying, I maintain that this matter relates to young people who made a silly mistake and desrve to get on with their lives without having this hanging over their heads forever. I can understand the desire of people to maintain a resource like Wikipedia and I also understand that people can cause some mischief by deleting factual information. But I don't think Wikipedia deserves to be dragged down to the level of the "Gutter Press", I think it should be more noble and authoritative than that. By your criteria of "Notable and Accurate" I think this article fails on both counts. As mentioned in the article the press had exagerated their claims, this is reason enough to not post the article because the person who posted it had no idea by how much the article was exagerated. Thank you for removing the article to the discussion page it is a suitable outcome. I agree with your comment that PLC should contribute all the great things their students do and the opportunities they provide for education and the development of young women. I will contact their community relations people to see if they can contribute. Regards G Moran <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.238.72.193 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.238.72.193_1386.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.238.72.193">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Thanks G Moran. I've had quite a few opinions about whether the information should be included. The source that had been put up to support the inclusion of this information is not reliable enought, and unless a more reliable source is found, the material should not be included.</dd>
<dd>I did not say that "PLC should contribute all the great things their students do and the opportunities they provide for education and the development of young women." I said that I "It would be great if people who know something about PLC would write".

<p>Ok, Blarney...,</p>
<p>I didn't think of the fact that pics make it slower to load. I'm an artist/art historian... I like pics, OK?</p>
<p>What is the effect of having more in gallery and less in the article? Do the gallery pics load much faster because they are compressed? or what?</p>

<p>I just removed some of the pics to the gallery, but I think I'll put poor old Broughton back again. Yes they do go rather well at the Broughton site.</p>
<p>If you've got time, take a look at <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fra_Angelico_7f83.html" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a>. there was some appalling twaddle written by william Rosetti for Britannica which had been put in a great slab on that page... the most awful BS I've ever read (almost) but with the authority of Britannica behind it. I've put a chunk of what I removed onto the discussion page as a sample..... anyway, I have a watch dog who follows me around and edits out the word "beautiful" every time I use it, so I have to be careful.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the same story applies to the Fra Angelico page, too many pics for happy downloading. I'll take another look at that problem.</p>

<dd>Actually I was talking about single sex schools, in other Western countries (remember that there are developed nations such as Japan and South Korea that are *not* part of the western world), such as the UK, the US, and many nations on mainland Europe, schooling is vitually all co-educational (single sex education was formerly more common in the Britsh Isles, but as far as I know, has become rare as "hen's teeth"). Many Australian schools, particularly independent ones, claim to be based in the English/British model, but as far as I know, they are actually based on an outdated model of education in the British Isles, and are more conservative and less liberal towards students than their "precursors" in UK (and Ireland). <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a> <a href="../../../m/y/r/User_talk%7EMyrtone86_1f23.html" title="User talk:Myrtone86">(<font color="green">☏</font>)</a></dd>

<p>Hi, I just thought I should leave a note about the categorization of Moore College. Although Moore is an Anglican college, I thought it would be worth putting it in the Reformed category because of its theological views. I'm not asking for it to be put back, just explaining why it was there in the first place. Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> 08:14, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guessed that was the reason. I think the Reformed category would be tidier if it only had colleges affiliated with the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_churches.html" title="Reformed churches">Reformed churches</a>. But that is just my view, since I was thinking of classifying the colleges by denomination rather than theology. Anglicanism is a denomination with Reformed theology, and not just in the Sydney diocese (see also <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridley_Hall%2C_Cambridge_b299.html" title="Ridley Hall, Cambridge">Ridley Hall, Cambridge</a>.) It is not normally considered a Reformed Church.</dd>
<dd>I thought the categories would be useful to take the long and unbalanced list of seminaries out of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a>.</dd>
<dd>Did you notice that our new categories lose focus completely in the Indian sub-continent, where the colleges have tried to maintain affiliations with several Protestant denominations, including the United Churches?</dd>
<dd>I probably won't do too much more on cats, except where it takes biased or uninformative lists out of articles. I suspect most encyclopedia readers don't use categories, and they rarely appear on Google results pages. --<a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_e9d7.html" title="User:Hroðulf">Hroðulf</a> (or Hrothulf) (<a href="../../../h/r/o/User_talk%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_0e3a.html" title="User talk:Hroðulf">Talk</a>) 09:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fair enough. I did go to the UCB site, and found that they still had references to their licenced Rhema affiliates - this must be outdated content. Also, at the head of the list of Rhema's with other names, there's also a line that will need changing.</p>
<p>In addition, the dropping of the affiliates can't be a simple matter of them now being an Australian broadcaster in their own right. They've had Vision for a number of years now. That statement was one of the factors that made me think the Rhemas were still affiliated.</p>
<p>If the Rhemas are no longer with UCB, then how, if at all, are they joined together? This information needs to be added to the page. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatturn_857b.html" title="User:Matturn">matturn</a> 07:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No prob. I've been meaning to do something about that redlink for a while. Actually, we had Dunedin historian Peter Entwisle editing some articles here a couple of months back, and I was kind of hoping he'd have started that article and a couple of others, but he seems to have been inactive on WP lately. What I wrote is pretty much straight from DNZB, so it could still do with a bit of expanding, but it's a start at least. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The curriculum of many Christian Right schools includes packets of materials from the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) program. In many of these schools the students work on the packets in their own small offices or cubicles. The work consists of low-level cognitive tasks that emphasize simple association and recall activities, as is typical of instruction from workbooks. Despite the reviling of B. F. Skinner by the Christian Right, the materials make heavy use of behavioral objectives, programmed learning, and rewards (Hunter, 1987, cited in Speck &amp; Prideaux, 1993). Students are not supposed to communicate with other students, get up, or turn around without obtaining permission from a supervisor. Students who are having difficulty are expected to raise a small American or Christian flag signaling that they need help. In many of the Christian Right schools interaction between students has been cut off and intellectual activities in groups rarely occur because group work is not valued. Cooperative learning, which invests some power in and attributes some wisdom to the group, is seen to undermine the relationship of subservience of children to adults and to God. Cooperative learning is considered bad learning." -- Almost sounds like the workplace. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Marksman_9cb1.html" title="User:Colonel Marksman">Colonel Marksman</a> 03:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The new Page is Definitely better, but the Criticism section is longer than the other odd-dozen sections combined.

<p>Hi, regarding your page on cities in NSW, you say that Grafton and Goulburn should not be called cities. It is my understanding that both these places were proclaimed cities under the Crown Lands Act 1884 (48 Vic. No.18 1884), gazetted in 1885 (Goulburn certainly was, and I am fairly sure that Grafton was also). This is the same legislation in which Bathurst and other towns were proclaimed cities, as the intent of this Act was to implement land reforms in NSW which required the clarification of the status of all settlements in the colony. So whatever their current features may be regarding size etc, they are certainly still cities as they were proclaimed as such through the abovementioned Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the status of "city" historically has no association with population, economy, etc. It was originally a designation specifically and solely to identify a town as being the See of an Anglican bishop, and a town gained the status of City upon the creation of a new See with a local church being designated the Cathedral for the diocese (as it was a requirement of the Church that a diocese have a cathedral, and that a cathedral be located in a City). A town could have had nothing more than a chook shed and a church, and still be designated a City if appointed as the seat of a See. This is the reason why many modern cities do not seem to meet the 'requirements' of that status, as they were granted it through the Church previously. The idea of a City being of a certain size (either of population or economy) is one that only came about in the latter stages of the 19th century.</p>

<p>That's fine, I just thought it might be helpful to provide a little more background as to how/when they actually became cities, since they do not otherwise seem to meet "modern" definitions accorded to that label.

<p>Brother Phil Joyner, did not get sent to PNG. He left to go teach in Townsville at a school for disadvantaged people after finishing his 5 year stint at Nudgee. Brothers work on 5 year blocks that end in Easter. ie. he wanted to teach people in need not rich kids.</p>
<p>The rest of it is rumour, or a single ex-student who "fell off the rails" and has gone through the legal system.</p>

<dd>No worries. I don't need to know the specifics. Any claims that serious that don't give a source needs to be removed, whether they are true or not.</dd>

<dd>Also, please start a new section when you bring up a new topic on edit talk pages. Taking a look at the coding on any talk page should show you how. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> <small><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlarneytherinosaur_0246.html" title="User talk:Blarneytherinosaur">talk</a></small> 02:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They are anglican, methodist, and other such churches, that come under the banner of Catholic (keep in mind that this is a very broad and generalised term). If it were to be Roman Catholic - alot of those schools would not be included. Possibly an area i should clear up on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 09:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Recently i upgraded the article on St Andrew's College which was later undone. I understand the reason why my contribution was reverted. I am a third year resident of St Andrew's College and student computer administrator of the college. Is there a way to get this 'copyrighted' material on Wikipedia? i.e. permissions? One of the regular contributors of this article(mainly to fix things random residents write), Wayne erricson, is the manager of St Andrew's College. Maybe he could authorise for material from the Website and other college text be included in wikipedia. I understand that there are rules and guidelines that have to be followed, and i am ready to do that. I just think it would be nice to have St Andrew's College well represented on Wikipedia so that everyone can easilly learn about the college, and re-writing text that has already been refined to effectivelly inform readers about the college seems a bit pointless to me. Any information from you would be much appreciated Cheers David Lambert 11:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC) (David.oz)</p>

<dd>Hi David,</dd>
<dd>Thanks for asking. I'm not an expert of copyright myself, but you should take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright</a> and particularly the linked page <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a>.</dd>
<dd>Remember that any information added to Wikipedia may be further edited, so it won't necessarily stay how it is on the St Andrew's homepage, particularly since material for an encyclopedia is written differently to a website and must conform to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>.</dd>
<dd>I hope this helps you out.</dd>

<p>Hi I just did another update on the St Andrew's College article. Just about all of it is from my own personal knowledge of the college, but i got some numbers from the college's annual report so i put that in as a refference. All de additions are written in my own words. If there is anything that you think is not compliant with the Wikipedia rules, please just let me know and i will change it asap. Cheers, David Lambert 07:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi David. I've taken a look at your additions seem fine, although I don't know how many encyclopedias would note regularity of cleaning, but that's alright.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can see for looking at your talk page that no one has introduced you to the guidelines here, so I will do that myself. You don't need to read them all straight away, but they will point you in the right direction when you need help. If in doubt, feel free to ask me or at <a href="../../../q/u/e/Wikipedia%7EQuestions_bd8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Questions">Wikipedia:Questions</a>.</dd>

<dd>Apart from that, enjoy your editing. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> <small><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlarneytherinosaur_0246.html" title="User talk:Blarneytherinosaur">talk</a></small> 01:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
