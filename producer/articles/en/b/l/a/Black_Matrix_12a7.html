<p><i><b>Black Matrix</b></i> is a popular Japanese game series featuring Evil Angels and Holy Angels engaged in a conflict for power. You play Cain (or Abel, depending on the version), a young boy who always ends up on the side of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>. In each game he must set off in search of a young girl, either his master or a friend, who has mysteriously disappeared. The game has not received a translated release due to its disturbing nature (there is a scene in which you murder four archangels - <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael.html" title="Michael">Michael</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel.html" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Raphael.html" title="Raphael">Raphael</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriel.html" title="Uriel">Uriel</a>). As a result, no detailed plot or rom translations exist.</p>
<p>Each game has a slightly different logo. "Black Matrix 0" is for Game Boy Advance; it is slightly easier than the other games in the series. "Black Matrix 00" (also called "Black Matrix Cross") is for Playstation. It has 2 disks and is a more detailed version of the Game Boy Advance game. "Black Matrix" on Sega Saturn is actually a sequel to the first two and is by far the most grisly version, with blood effects and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a>. An extended version of this game was released on the Dreamcast with added anime scenes. Three games feature voice acting by Japanese <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiyu.html" title="Seiyu">Seiyu</a> and all have in-game artwork. There are early FMV introductions to all the games except for the Game Boy Advance version, where a pan across a tapestry-style drawing is used instead. FMV is also used for the four Japanese game trailers. A Black Matrix game is reputedly in progress for the PS2.</p>

<p><i>Black Matrix</i> is a turn-based strategy game which usually takes the player through the various levels of hell until he reaches the surface. Various characters join up after talking scenes between levels. Usually they are dressed like members of the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_subculture.html" title="Goth subculture">Goth subculture</a>, unless they are holy angels, in which case they are dressed in <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reich.html" title="Reich">Reich</a> uniforms. The player and his party fights with various weapons, spells and summons on a gloomy isometric arena. The player and foe takes turns respectively and there is no speed order. Some versions feature a "Biorythm" bar which affects the strength of spells.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactics_Ogre_0c39.html" title="Tactics Ogre">Tactics Ogre</a>, you can reverse a turn if you make a mistake. Black Matrix relies on intermittent towns for distribution of weapons, buying of equipment, training sessions and so on. In the Saturn/Dreamcast versions you can infuse weapons with Blood Points to make them more powerful, but since Blood Points are scarce, it is difficult to develop weaponry fully.</p>
<ul>
<li>In most versions of the game, the main character is killed at the beginning of the game and resurrected by an unidentified injured angel who tears his wings off his back and gives them to the main character. The injured stranger then dies.</li>
<li>When characters die their prostrate bodies can still be attacked. If this happens, the character will be lost for ever. They can be resurrected whilst lying on the ground using healing spells and potions.</li>
<li>"Blood Points" take the place of magic points. They can be distributed through the party before battles.</li>
<li>In most versions, the main character makes an early choice to determine whether he will wear devil (grey) or angel (white) wings.</li>
<li>The Saturn version has a sound test which is accessible from the title screen.</li>
<li>The characters can be set to parry or attack in the 00 version. This means the player can choose between offense and defence during an enemy turn.</li>
<li>You can spend hours playing sub-games in the circus on the PSX version. In the Saturn version, you can only play sub-games in the house at the beginning (such as mole bopping).</li>
<li>Training battles begin Player Turn in the Saturn version, instead of Enemy Turn in the DC version.</li>
<li>The main character is blonde in the Saturn game, whereas in the Dreamcast version he is a brunette.</li>
<li>In the Saturn version you can recruit white-winged angel prisoners. The war between the angels and devils lasted for 666 days. Eventually Mephisto sealed away the heavenly beings inside the city of Linear. In order to sustain the seal, angels must be sacrificed in Linear. If you rescue slaves, sometimes they will join your party.</li>
<li>Love is a crime in the "Black Matrix" world and any character found guilty of love or kindness is hunted and punished.</li>
<li>The heal spell is called Lilim. It is a disturbing spell which looks like a ghostly pink woman tearing open her breast to let loose a crowd of bats. In the Game Boy Advance version it is just a flapping pink bat.</li>
<li>John uses a spell which can call back dead characters as <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie.html" title="Zombie">Zombie</a> decoys (Saturn version). He also has the option to detonate them in the middle of an army.</li>

<p><i>Black Matrix</i> features only human or angel characters. Wings are either grey, white or leathery. Some characters have more than one pair of wings, depending on their rank.
