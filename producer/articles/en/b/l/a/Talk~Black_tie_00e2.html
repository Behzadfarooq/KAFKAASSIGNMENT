<dd>Yes, I also find the "you can't wear a two-button single-breasted dinner jacket in the UK" line slightly dubious myself.

<p>Now, coat-of-arms are "issued" by varrious authorities, usually governmental in nature, but also from some other "real" authorities, like varrious royal houses, and religious authorities. They can be obtained by those that are acceptable, in some conditions, like military officers and accidemic educated.</p>
<p>The "kilt" can be worn by anyone with scottish heritage (including by marrage), or from a location with a <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartan.html" title="Tartan">tartan</a> (Canada and each province has a tartan that would be appropriate to wear). Many organizations also have a tartan (wearing that as well is acceptable). The point is to wear an appropriate tartan. Wearing the tartan is accepting the leadership of that "<a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clan</a>." A mute point today. There are many approriate tartans to wear. A person form Chile would wear the Cochrane tartan, to recognize the great contribution of the Admiral Cochrane to that country. Of course, if you have ever worn a kilt, the Government tartan is always appropriate. see link <a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/weartart.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/weartart.htm" rel="nofollow">www.electricscotland.com/webclans/weartart.htm</a> --<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlenlarson_97f6.html" title="User:Glenlarson">User:Glenlarson</a></p>

<dd>"A person from Chile would wear the Cochrane tartan, to recognize the great contribution of Admiral Cochrane to that country." Well, I live where <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorna_Doone_8c98.html" title="Lorna Doone">Lorna Doone</a> cookies are baked... But, which tartan would be appropriate if you were, say, from Vladivostok and stationed in Antarctica, one wonders... A "mute point" indeed! Similar fantasies encourage truly naive Americans to send away for "their" family crest-- say Smith-- and display it with pride to the gawping locals! The text remains in the article, what one calls "only a snare for geese."

Many may be upset at others wearing the kilt; however, Scottish culture has been spread around the world, including India and Pakistan, or any "British" Caribbean island, which have pipe bands.

<dd>One point of vies is but that, one.

I'm going to take it out. It is as absurd to suggest that anyone can wear a kilt, except for fancy dress, as it is to suggest that a Irishman can reasonably attend a formal dinner in the full regalia of a native American chief. If you're not Scottish, preferably born in Scotland, you will look very foolish. Just because many people do, does not make it OK. Brentford 10:13, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Placed it back in, although the statement has been changed to read more of a fact statement. Again, many are doing this, and "accept" the Scottish culture. Most have some reason. Again, the original text is copied from the article titled <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilt.html" title="Kilt">kilt</a>. Here the discussion is not concerned about this area but only what is worn under the kilt (regimental?). The statements here draw discussion; however, it needs to be resolved on the kilt page as well. Now, native Americian's do have a system for awarding title and thus "full regalia" to others, and it would be appropriate to wear such afterwards. People don't look foolish in this area when they wear the kilt, and good gentlemen accept their motivation for wearing the kilt, genetic, marriage, military service, or other. People are perhaps upset at the growing number of non tartan kilts being sold and worn by the youth; however, it is occuring, and although the kilt article does not have such reference (yet)(opps, ith artcle kilt does have this material). Simply deleting a fact is not acceptable in an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlenlarson_97f6.html" title="User:Glenlarson">User:Glenlarson</a></dd>

I see from the history that Wetman removed it last year, but he didn't really give much of an explanation. "D.J." is a common abbreviation in the UK (though slowly being replaced among young people who wouldn't normally wear one by "tux" from innumerable "prom" storylines in US TV programmes) so a more concrete objection is requested before deleting it again.

<p>The definition of black tie is inheritently contradictory. It is defined as a synonym for "dinner jacket" or "tuxedo" and, at the same time, as a dress code. Only the latter is correct. Unlike "dinner jacket" or "tuxedo", "black tie" is not an article of clothing. While black tie certainly requires a dinner jacket/tuxedo, putting on such a jacket does not necessarily mean being dressed for black tie. If this were the case then all formal proms and weddings would be considered black tie events. The difference lies in the details of the outfit, such as colour and style. It is more correct to consider "black tie" not as a noun but as an adjective similar to "formal" or "semiformal". <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Marshall_79a7.html" title="User:Peter Marshall">Peter Marshall</a> 19:00, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree. This needs to be a short article on what to wear to a black tie affair versus a white tie or semiformal affair. <a href="../../../t/u/x/Tuxedo.html" title="Tuxedo">Tuxedo</a> should have its own article; not disambiguate to here.

<p>Many continental Europeans and Latin Americans have commented to me (an American) that they would never wear "black tie." To them, this is considered to be the uniform of the waitstaff for a formal event. They typically wear a dark suit for evening wear. In the case of the most formal event, they wear a morning suit in the day, and white tie at night.</p>

<dd>Interesting comment to me. I grew up on <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Brown_8d86.html" title="Father Brown">Father Brown</a> mysteries and <i>The Queer Feet</i>, found in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/infrb10.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/infrb10.txt" rel="nofollow">The Innocence of Father Brown</a> covers just that subject with a thief alternately being a waiter and a gentleman as he steals the silverware. -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 14:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's correct that black ties are generlly only worn by waitstaff, everyone else wears white ties. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, such as, some academic events, and some funerals. (I know these exceptions are valid in Sweden, not sure about the rest of Europe, but rules are probably similar)./<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProbell_2a4b.html" title="User:Probell">probell</a> <small>(<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProbell_28ac.html" title="User talk:Probell">Talk</a>)</small></dd>

<p>Is it really bad form to wear a shirt with a sewn-in collar? I feel like it is almost (if not entirely) impossible nowadays to locate and purchase a formal shirt with collar studs and no attached collar. I can almost imagine Jeeves scolding Bertie Wooster for wearing a pre-attached collar, but I think times have changed as far as this matter is concerned. Thoughts, anyone?</p>

<dd>Since the second war it's been acceptable, and is now pretty much compulsory, as wing collars are no longer conventional for black tie.
<dl>
<dd>I think I understand what the article means. It wasn't stated quite right so I have gone back and changed it. Separate wing collars <i>were</i> the norm but as these are no longer generally available, a classic ("normal" turn down) collar should be worn, rather than a non-detachable wing collar, which is seen as incorrect as the point in a wing collar is that it is detachable. Hence a non-detachable wing collar is just pretentious, in a manner similar to a pre-tie bow tie - the idea is almost that if one is not classy enough to have a detachable wing collar, don't bother having one at all. You'll find that "people in the know" would not be caught dead wearing a wing collar these days as it is now considered quite crass (Ben Schott makes a mention of this in his 2007 Almanac).</dd>
<dd>As the advice goes on black tie, when in doubt consult Bond. In none of the films does he wear a wing collar with his evening suit (though he does wear it with a morning suit at Felix Leiter's wedding, but then no one debates that this is correct).--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 20:29, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Chapter XXXIV ("The Clothes of a Gentleman") of Emily Post's <i>Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home</i> (1922, New York, Funk and Wagnalls) (full text available at <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/95/" class="external free" title="http://www.bartleby.com/95/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bartleby.com/95/</a> ), regarding tuxedo clothes, "The smartest hat for town wear is an opera, but a straw or felt which is proper in the country, is not out of place in town. Otherwise, in the street the accessories are the same as those already given under the previous heading." I believe "opera" is another term for a collapsible silk top hat. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Gerard_Tom_957c.html" title="User:Michael Gerard Tom">Michael Gerard Tom</a> 04:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not a Wikipedia editor and am just passing through, but I saw that this article needs sources and wanted to recommend a web site. It may make a suitable external link; may be a good source for some of the material in this article; or may be a good place to find other useful sources for the material: there is a comprehensive bibliography on the site. It ought to come in particularly useful in relation to the "Black Tie versus Dinner Jacket/Tuxedo" discussion above, and to the "history of the tuxedo" section of the article. The URL is <a href="http://www.blacktieguide.com" class="external free" title="http://www.blacktieguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blacktieguide.com</a>.

<dd>I agree that this is a decent site for references. It discusses both traditional black tie and new "American" (I am loathe to call these American, as the American upper-classes tend to stick to the first traditional code and not the "American" style) incarnations and it notes that these two dress codes are, despite what a casual observer might think, completely different.</dd>
<dd>However, I am a bit conflicted as to the legitimacy of having references at all. As with any dress code, there will always be an element of subjectivity, and this makes it hard to make any legitimate claim of any source being correct.--<a href="../../../z/o/s/User%7EZoso_Jade_9110.html" title="User:Zoso Jade">Zoso Jade</a> 19:34, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
