<dd>I agree. Season one was called "The <b>Black Adder</b>", then we have "<b>Blackadder</b> II", "<b>Blackadder</b> the Third", "<b>Blackadder</b> Goes Forth" and "<b>Blackadder's</b> Christmas Story". So it definitely looks like "Blackadder" became the preferred term. (source <a href="http://blackadder.powertie.org/episodes/" class="external free" title="http://blackadder.powertie.org/episodes/" rel="nofollow">http://blackadder.powertie.org/episodes/</a>). And it's the character's surname - Sir Edmund Blackadder, Captain Blackadder, etc. so one word again seems best. - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispyH_0fe4.html" title="User:ChrispyH">ChrispyH</a> 08:49 Sep 2, 2002 (PDT)</dd>

<p><i>Blackadder II</i> and <i>Blackadder the Third</i> both struck me as alluding to other shows not mentioned in the article. <i>Blackadder II</i> opens with a black adder slithering across checkered tiles, which I found quite reminiscent of the opening sequence of "<a href="../../../i/%2C/_/I%2C_Claudius_1406.html" title="I, Claudius">I, Claudius</a>". The ominous violin music that starts the former even recalls the striking opening notes of the latter, although it's stylistically rather different. The opening of <i>Blackadder the Third</i>, with Edmund looking through a library of Blackadder-themed texts, also reminds me of the <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterpiece_Theatre_f35d.html" title="Masterpiece Theatre">Masterpiece Theatre</a></i> opening, in which the camera moves about a study, revealing novels of the various stories that have been featured on the show. That may be a bit of a stretch, as <i>Masterpiece Theatre</i> is simply an umbrella series, created in the U.S., in which (mostly) British television series (we in the U.S. would call them "miniseries") are shown, and thus seems unlikely to have influenced the <i>Blackadder</i> writers. Could someone with a British perspective provide some insight on these two potential allusions? -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:16, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've certainly noticed the similarity with the I, Claudius opening sequence, so that's not just you, although whether it's intentional or not is another matter. I'm afraid I haven't seen Masterpiece Theatre, so I couldn't really comment on that. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheJames_fe4e.html" title="User:TheJames">TheJames</a> 14:49, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is rather big. Would it not be better to have a seperate page for each series, and just the overview and links here?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes - the page is now 40k and needs to be split in some way while, hopefully, containing summaries and sufficient detail for this to be a featured article. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:11, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, one idea would be to create <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blackadder_episodes_3919.html" title="List of Blackadder episodes">List of Blackadder episodes</a> and spin out all of the episode lists for the 4 series (the specials could be added to the list too, of course). Alternatively, the sections on each series could also be spun out to separate articles and replaced by a shorter summary. In any event, "Blackadder: The Cavalier Years" is the only special <i>not</i> to have a separate page, so again this section spun out and replaced by a summary. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 11:58, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. That's the answer. A website called 'Some of the Corpses are Amusing' had a lengthy description of the pilot, complete with screen captures - they had access to a bootleg - but although SOTCAA still exists, in altered form, it doesn't have that page any more. It was part of the site's 'edit news' section, if I recall correctly.-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 08:57, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And, (cough), thanks to the internet, and for the purposes of review only, I hasten to add, this pilot episode has now entered the orbit of my hard drive. I shall see if there's anything worth mentioning in the article itself. The quality is very much like a multi-generation VHS tape. The theme tune is the same. It is set '400 years ago' according to the scrolling text at the beginning. It's shot cheaply on video in the studio. It's called THE BLACK ADDER, by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson. The cast list features "Prince Edward - Rowan Atkinson", "Perry - Tim McInnerny", <b>Baldrick - Philip Fox</b>, who is a prolific but generally unknown television actor in the UK; the character of Baldrick is much the same, however, and he does indeed say "I have a cunning plan", which is "quite cunning". The king is not Richard III, and the historical period is much less precise; there is mention of fighting the Spanish. Blackadder's character is much more aggressive than he was in the real first series; he's closer in spirit to the scheming Blackadder of later on, but more hyperactive. It's not very funny, unfortunately. The wordplay that became so much the show's tradmark hasn't been devised yet, the grotesqueness is greatly toned down, the historical humour is very broad, and the characters aren't quite right. I'm guessing, but I assume that the producers realised this and made some drastic changes for the actual series - Rowan Atkinson was a hot property at the time, so I suppose it <i>had</i> to be commissioned - which also didn't work. Enter Ben Elton. "I'm afraid the eunuchs can't make it (to the party); they are in Chester, and dare not make the journey in this inclement weather", "No balls, that's their problem".-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 20:46, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All but two of the links in the <b>Chronological order</b> section were circular, redirected back to this article. (The exceptions were <a href="../../../b/a/c/Blackadder%7E_Back_%26_Forth_846d.html" title="Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth">Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth</a>, which has its own article, and <b>Blackadder The Third</b>, whose case disagreed with the redirect, the former of which I fixed here.) Given that this article has <i>not</i> been split up into separate articles, as has been suggested, it seemed more logical to have these links jump to the internal reference, as it appears to be a mini-table of contents (at least until someone creates all those other articles).</p>
<p>The problem is that the shows all contain Wiki italics markup ('') in the headers, which I can't figure out how to add to an internal link. (Links don't like apostrophes; the ".XX" format [where XX is the hex code for the character] doesn't seem to work if it's immediately followed by printable characters; and "%DD", where "DD" is the decimal ASCII code, didn't work, either.)</p>
<p>For now, the specials (whose titles include "double quotes", which links don't seem to mind) all jump to their description. I've removed the other, superfluous links, pending either a technical solution to my stated problem, or the creation of articles for each of the series. I also left "Back &amp; Forth" as an internal link, because (A) it would be confusing to have only one of the links in the mini-TOC jump to another article, and (B) there's a link to the "B:B&amp;F" article in its section. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:31, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anybody know where these were filmed? I was wondering where the path that the minstrel dances around Edmund is - presumably they were filmed at a stately home. However, I couldn't find anything on any fan websites. They were probably recorded on the same day as the outside scene with Kate in <i>Bells</i>, as there are no more location shots in the entire series. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_Beecham_4816.html" title="User:Rob Beecham">Rob</a> 22:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if most of the quotes in the section <b>Popularity and effects on popular culture</b> should be moved to wikiquote, just leaving a few of each to act as samples. And maybe the lyrics can go the same way as well, it doesn't add a whole lot to the article which is fairly long and has a few areas like this that don't really give much information compared to how large they are. <a href="../../../s/f/n/User%7ESfnhltb_bab6.html" title="User:Sfnhltb">Sfnhltb</a> 05:07, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could not agree more. There are WAY too many. I back your idea of moving most of them to Wikiquote. Five quotes would actually be enough (possibly more than enough). Also, the Quotes section should probably also be moved, unless it has some value to the article. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepheus_6d02.html" title="User:Zepheus">Zepheus</a> 19:15, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>(in Goodbyeee..., there's a scene which shows Haig playing with toy soldiers, which he sweeps nonchalantly from trench to trench, and then onto the floor while listening to Blackadder's plea to get out of the final push on the phone)</i></p>
<p>This isn't correct, IIRC. Haig merely sweeps the toy soldiers into a dustpan with a brush and then dumps the contents of the dustpan into a bin. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Stu-Rat (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStu-Rat_9445.html" title="User talk:Stu-Rat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stu-Rat_e730.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stu-Rat">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This article is far too expansive and covers irrelevant and redundant data. It ought to be reduced as soon as possible. I have removed the quotations from the "Popularity and Effects on Popular Culture" because the list was too long, and most of it was probably covered by wikiquote. So has the "quotes" section been remove. Not only that, but I see no justification whatsoever to include such a list in this section. Furthermore, I believe that none of the information contained there fits under it either; however, I have allowed it to remain because I believe the information could be useful if moved elsewhere. "The Shakespeare Sketch" must have some information besides a year or the entire "specials" subsection ought to be removed; this is unsatisfactory. If there's going to be so much information on each of the series, then they probably ought to have their own pages. Lastly, much of the article seems to be speculative and may require an intensive overhaul. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetalrobot_5ab9.html" title="User:Metalrobot">Metalrobot</a> 13:40, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would second much of Metalrobot's comments and add that it is more than a bit odd that the synopsis for the 15 minute 'Cavalier Years' special is longer than any two of the regular series sections put together. Also, the comparison to 'The Three Musketeers' is unsourced and smacks of original research. I feel sure that it was a labor of love for the wikipedian who put it in and I don't want to start an edit war, but I thought it worth mentioning so that other wikimembers can come to a consensus (or maybe they will have a cunning plan) about it.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 15:55, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just want to comment, that probably because of these removals, this section has nothing to do with neither popularity, nor cultural effects anymore. It's just some information about production now (ok, and half of a sentence about Baldrick's catchphrase).

<p>I strongly suggest the use of a picture of one of the more recognisable blackadder incarnations on the Edmund Blackadder template. While I appreciate the original Blackadder is held in high regard by cretain users on wikipedia, the first series is not highly thought of in general public circles. Also, the first blackadder does not represent the more familiar characteristics of the Blackadders (just look at his stupid face compared to the more condecending, refined look of the other 3). I personally would champion Blackadder II who seems the most recognisable. His image is used in the main wikipedia article and was the primary icon used in the <i>Greatest Sitcom</i> series.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 19:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Mrs Miggins' pie shop was a never-seen running gag in Blackadder II; she — or at least, a descendant of hers — is now finally shown). Wasn't Mrs Miggin's Pie Shop shown in the episode "Potato"?

<p>No Mrs Miggin's pie shop was never shown in series 2. I believe it was mentioned twice (I may be forgetting one?), once in 'Potato' when she was 'bed ridden from the nose down' and had baked a pie in the shape of 'an enormous pie' and once in 'Money' when Blackadder demands money off the bishop for a 'slap-up meal at Mrs Miggins'.Jameskeates 07:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Blackadder series was almost certainly named, without his foreknowledge and to his subsequent mild irritation, after Dr Eric Blackadder, with whom I played golf on a number of occasions in the mid-eighties at the Hampstead course. Dr Blackadder had been senior medical adviser at the BBC for a considerable period before I met him. I believe he was then in his mid-sixties - I have had no contact with him since 1990 and I see his name does not appear in the list of Hampstead members for 2003-4.</p>
<p>The name "Blackadder" sounds outlandish to South-East-of-England ears. However there are 24 individual entries under that surname in the Edinburgh and District telephone directory. There is at least one village - I believe two - called Blackadder in the South-East of Scotland. (There is also a "Whiteadder").</p>
<p>Dr Blackadder, at the time I knew him, had all the formality and correctness of an Edinburgh doctor. I grew up in Edinburgh myself, and although I was about twenty years younger and a very different character to him, I felt we understood each other. It was not difficult, however, for me to imagine that the creative spirits in which the BBC abounds might identify Dr Blackadder as an object of parody. Some might see thoughtfulness, but others stiffness, in his manner of speaking.</p>
<p>The way Dr Blackadder told me the story indicated clearly that he thought his name had been deliberately purloined for the series. He said he had been present at a BBC cocktail party when a TV producer he knew rushed up to him. My memory after more than a decade and a half is bound to be faulty in minor respects, but I believe the producer said something like the following to Dr Blackadder. "Oh Eric, so glad to see you at last, been trying to get hold of you, but you know how it is, one never gets enough time, every time I tried to phone you you weren't there, terribly sorry, gosh is that the time, anyway, just wanted to tell you, really sorry you weren't informed, anyway Eric old chap we've just done a new comedy series, heavens I should have been gone five minutes ago, the point is, Eric, that the series happens to bear your name, can't think how that happened, one of those things that just transpires in our world, but very glad to have told you now, load off my mind, 'fraid it's in the can now so nothing can be done, you never know how these things are going to turn out but I have a sort of hunch this one might be quite good, really must rush now but so glad to have talked with you, definitely talk at more length soon, bye."</p>
<p>Dr Blackadder also told me that after the series had become successful he booked a family dinner for about ten in some London restaurant. He was slightly startled by the red-carpet treatment which the manager and staff accorded him and his guests, until the manager asked him with a hint of dismay in his voice when Rowan Atkinson was going to turn up.</p>
