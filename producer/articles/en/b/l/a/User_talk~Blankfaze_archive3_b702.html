<p>I am confused by your votes to oppose Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and support Cyprus and Armenia. Could you please explain here? Thank you, Pædia 03:32, 2004 Jun 4 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I voted to support Cyprus and Armenia because they are members of European organisations, whilst Kazakhstan does not appear to be. Also, I asked a friend of mine, a foreign exchange student from Kazakhstan, which continent she considered Kazakhstan to be in, and she said, "Asia, definitely." As for Azerbaijan: I didn't see that it was a European council member. Was that added later by any chance? If not, it was an oversight by me, Anyhow, I shall change my vote to support. I think that any country that is a member of the European Union or Council should be included. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 23:35, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand supporting members of European organisations. Kazakhstan, though not a member, is listed as partly in Europe by all four sources. Other European countries Belarus, the Holy See, and Monaco are also not members.<br />

<li>Well, I'm glad to see someone who's adamant and impassioned about their opinion. But you're not going to win me over on this one. I think we're just goin to have to (respectfully) agree to disagree. You got me on 1 out of 2!

<li>Congrats, man. Lucky you, goin' to college. I'm going to be a senior at Woodham this fall. No college for me, probably. Shit grades. But it's neat to meet another Pensacola person here on WP. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 01:22, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand why you wouldn't be going to college. You seem smart enough. I was in the IB program, which pretty much ensures that you're going to college...although, funnily enough, about 30 or so kids opted to stay at UWF this year. Hm. We had one girl go to Harvard, which I think is ace. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">TheCustomOfLife</a> 01:28, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yeah, I'm a terribly bright person, I'm just lazy, so I make bad grades. I haven't the qualifications for higher education, my friend. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 01:34, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the thing about being lazy and in IB is that you can probably pass the qualifications to get the special IB diploma, not make great grades, but still have a kickass weighted. See, my final GPA was a 3.08 unweighted but a 4.18 weighted due to all the high classes I took. I had lots of extracurriculars, too, without even trying. My SAT could have been better, though. I took it twice and ended up reporting a 1300.
<ul>
<li>Hmm. I have a 2.99 GPA as of last year's end. That's unweighted, I think. Or maybe not. I can't remember. Anyhoo, I plan to SMOKE my SATs. I'm a test whiz. Always with the 98s on the FCATs! Haha... watch, I bet I bomb the test. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 01:44, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you can technically still bring your GPA above a 3.0, and then qualify for the 100% Bright Futures. Even with the way it is now, you can get 75% of it paid. I'm sure any of the colleges here in Florida would take you, especially UWF.

<p>Why'd you move the pictures? The new layout looks so...ugly! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">TheCustomOfLife</a> 19:50, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, it looked way uglier before. The pictures were way too big, and it looks really bad for an encylcopaedia article to have the text wedged between two big photos. The page looked like an advertisement for the magazine! It was either that, or delete one of the pictures, coz the article doesn't really need a picture of both anyway. This was nothing personal, I just stumbled upon it while ging through random pages. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 19:55, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When there are two magazines I think it is wise to have both. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">TheCustomOfLife</a> 20:49, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the two magazines are just variations on the same template. To have both, I think, is redundant. But instead of deleting one of the images, I tried to find a way where they could both stay. That was by making them smaller, and putting both to the right, because the text between the images looked goofy and unpolished. IMO. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 20:52, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Look, I don't mean to infringe upon your work, and I respect you, but when you wedge text between images it often creates wrapping that looks unprofessional or it overlaps onto other elements. It's just bad formatting. I want to stress to you that this is nothing personal. One of my main activities on WP is patrolling random articles looking for untagged stubs, inappropriate content, and grammatical and formatting errors. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">?­?</a> 21:00, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>Can you understand, though, how I would take something personally if it basically says, "Don't take this personally, but your formatting sucks."

<li>Oh, yes, I can understand. I just think it looks too unprofessional for Wikipedia. Change it back if you want, but someone else will eventually come along and think the same thing I did. Really, I don't mean to offend you.

<p>Good afternoon! Light went out in the computer room, and a storm is imminent. Repair it now, or later? The burning question... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 20:45, Jun 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, a few hours from nasty horrible ungrammatical stub to usable article is impressive then? Glad you like the changes to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Disposable_Heroes_of_Hiphoprisy_e525.html" title="The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy">The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy</a>. I am thinking about spidering off to form a series of articles on the music scene of the time and its impact on later music, so keep your eyes on the page for links to follow.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkArcher_a9d4.html" title="User:SkArcher">SkArcher</a> 00:34, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Most definitely. I've never seen a trainwreck of a stub develop so quickly! That sounds good. I dunno much about this band, but that sounds good! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" rel="nofollow">»</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">»­</a> 00:54, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your VfD entry was last on the list when I looked at the page, and I was heavily into the scene when I was younger - I feel very old now, because I remember moshing to DHOH back in 1992&#160;:/ - a case of lucky timing on both our parts for this article. I will confess that I had to look details of which bands they had supported and when they split up tho, and I even found out about the Burroughs connection, which I hadn't been aware of before. Glad you like it.&#160;:D <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkArcher_a9d4.html" title="User:SkArcher">SkArcher</a> 00:59, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<li>Are you new around here? Just curious. I can't remember if I've seen you areound before or not. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" rel="nofollow">••</a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">••</a> 01:26, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In a way yes, in a way no. I only bothered creating a username a few days ago because I wanted to make an actual factual comment. Most of the time prior to that I have lurked and confined myself to link maintainence, grammar, spelling and other minor things. I only recently got the confidence to put an actual name to myself and write things. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkArcher_a9d4.html" title="User:SkArcher">SkArcher</a> 01:48, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I see. Well registering is good for you, coz people are much less suspicious of people who have a name and aren't behind anonymous IPs. Welcome to WP, and I hope to see good things from you! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" rel="nofollow">••</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">••</a> 01:51, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
