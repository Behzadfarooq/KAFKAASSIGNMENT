<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I am scared. Mommy and Daddy dropped me off here at this scary place with scary people. I just turned 7 and I got a new school dress. Mommy and Daddy told me I wouldn’t be with anyone I knew and that I couldn’t go to my old school anymore. I knew I wasn’t loved. I am all alone with a picture of Mommy and my dolly and some money. There is a nice lady here called Marry-Beth. She takes good care of me. She got me my bed and shelves. I get my own space in a corner. This place is called ‘g’ something. It’s a lot darker in here than it used to be at home. The walls have no paint. I have to stop now because they are turning out the lights. It’s gonna be dark. I hate the dark. I am going to hide. Marry-Beth can’t stay with me. I hate it here. Marry-Beth is leaving me now. I can’t cry. It’s gonna</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I had to stop because it was dark. I couldn’t see. I don’t remember sleeping. All I see are kids running around at the playground. I can’t play. Mommy says these kids are sick. I can’t play with them or I will die that’s what Mommy says. Daddy never calls. He doesn’t like me. Mommy told me that. She told me I was going to die if I stayed with Daddy because Daddy hates me. I love my Daddy though. He only hurt me once. I had a bruise. Mommy says no one will take me so I had to come here. My aunt said I was ugly and said that she would consliber it. Wait, Marry-Beth can help me. Consider is what my aunt said. Marry-Beth says I am very ‘bright’ for someone who wasn’t taught anything out of school. I think I learn fast. I am going to eat for the first time today. I didn’t have breakfast. I was scared.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I sat alone. Marry-Beth wasn’t there. She had to help other people. I hate it here. I feel so alone. The grown-ups here tell me to stop writing and start playing. I can’t play. I’m too sad. No one will teach me. There is one part of this place that I’m supposed to go to school at. I don’t want to. They are trying to teach me things I don’t need to learn. It is craft time. I’m going to paste something on here that I have to do before I go to bed every night.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I had a nightmare last night. I met a girl named Alicia today. She is pretty and has really long golden hair. She also has freckles. She wants to play with me. I don’t want to play. She says that she had a mommy and daddy too, but they died. I feel sad. She doesn’t cry. I won’t cry either. Marry-Beth says that it’s because I am sad inside and won’t let it outside. I think that Alicia is nice. She is nice to me. She tells me secrets, about herself and her family. She told me that her mommy and daddy got burned. Their house caught on fire and they saved her but couldn’t save themselves. I wish my mommy cared as much.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I am starting to like it here. I go to school now. I used to hide in the big tree house outside. No one could find me. These kids here aren’t sick. Marry-Beth tells me that they were treated bad and could have been killed. I don’t know anyone except for Alicia. Alicia keeps leaving me when we do activity time. I can’t fallow her around. I don’t want to.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, Today I cried. Marry-Beth. She got in an accident. I was there. I saw it. I threw-up. I had to go to the nurse. I fainted, that’s what they told me. She is dead. I don’t have any friends. Alicia isn’t my friend. She leaves me alone, just like Marry-Beth. Angel says that she got decapitated. I don’t know what that means but her head came off. I can’t think about it. The car door hit into her head while the other cars slid into the school’s gate. Angel said it was her destiny. I don’t believe her.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, The boys here are mean. They broke my dolly; she only has one arm and some hair. They also threw around my picture of Mommy. I didn’t care about the picture anymore. Mommy doesn’t see me anymore. I think she hates me. Daddy is gone to Brattleville and I can never see him again. I want to, but I am afraid. He might hurt me again.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, Today was ‘find your history’ day. It wasn’t fun. Everyone else had fun except for Molly J. and Jerrid D. They cried. I couldn’t take it. It made me want to but I didn’t. I looked at my family on the computer. My mommy’s name is Phillis. In this picture she looks pretty. No one else looks nice. I don’t care, I hate my family. My aunt that called me ugly lives in Brattleville. I want to visit her. She is the only one who is closest to me that won’t hurt me; well I hope she won’t at least.</p>
<p>I’ve found that I can take rejection. Just coming here shows that I have been rejected by the world. I don’t want to be adopted. What if they send me back here? A family who already had 2 kids adopted a girl name Lulu. I don’t think I am going to be adopted. I hope I don’t. I can’t leave now that I’ve gotten used to it here.</p>
<p><br />
Dear Diary, Alicia got adopted.</p>
<p>Chapter Two</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I’m 10 now. I haven’t written in 3 years. I forgot. Last I wrote I said Alicia got adopted. She did but they brought her back. They weren’t very nice people. I think about Angel a lot and how she helped me just like Marry-Beth. I hardly remember Marry-Beth. I only knew her for about a week. It was sick though, I mean about what happened to her. I still have a sick feeling in my stomach that she’s somewhere I’m not and that she is dead when I’d rather be. I have some friends. One is Joey Clark, Amanda Peterson, Alicia, and Carl Mason. They eat with me sometimes. I made a poem in class today. I don’t know what it means. I can only make good poetry when I am sad. I guess I make good poetry all the time, then.</p>
<p>As she lay upon her grave North wind wakes her up from the dead And as she walks on the dirty dusty road Her eyes look up For she had found her house And even on that cold windy evening The candle still burned It was blinding to the eye And she could see no more The only place That she could be Was in her room of her early life With just the light of the moon</p>
<p>Long huh?</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I sometimes think about my dad. I hardly remember what he looks like. I don’t want to see him though. I’m afraid of what he might do. What if he takes me away? What if he kills me? He might, but I don’t really know him that well. I can’t understand him or his life of hatred.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, My mom sent me a letter. Angel and Karen, my two ‘mental’ helpers say that this is good for me and that I should write back so I can get to know my mother. I don’t want to. The school put me in a mental group because I won’t talk or do anything but read. I like to read. I finished reading ‘Anne of Green Gables’. It’s a good book. I finished it in a day. But because I won’t do anything, I have helpers. I talk to them. I won’t talk to Ms. Gerald or Mr. Carter or any other teachers. Alicia says that it makes her embarrassed when I don’t answer the teachers when they talk to me. I don’t need to.</p>
<p>There are some black kids in this place. I like them… they are nice. But they are treated terribly. One assistant of Gordon Shreggar called the cops because one boy was fighting over a toy with another white kid. I haven’t seen him since. I hate it.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, A kid named Jacob Albert got adopted twice and got sent back because he has a disease. I don’t know what it is yet but it is scary. He is always in the sick dept. in the back of the orphanage. They say that it is forbidden to go there, but I will someday. But not because I’m sick, but to visit Shirley: a girl I met who is really nice. After I think about it I start to cry, I mean, me living in an orphanage. It’s always too cold in the winter and it’s always too hot in the summer. Phillis wrote me a letter. It said:</p>
<p>~Dear Claire, I hope you are having a great time at where you live now. I am sorry, I can’t understand it either. Your father was a violent man and this is the only way I could help you. I am so sorry. Well, I moved in with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago and here it’s beautiful! The house is huge and I have a great view of the ocean! I hope you’re not mad at me. I didn’t want it to be this way… And I have some other news. I don’t know how you’ll take this. You may like it or you may not. I am getting married to Bob, you know, my boyfriend. I hope that you will be happy for me. You cannot come to the wedding, though. After you have stayed in that orphanage I believe that you are too sick to come. Your teachers tell me that you are a mute. Can you really not talk? You don’t have to write back but that would be nice. I love you, just remember that. I am also expecting a baby; you will have a baby sister! I will send pictures because they will not let you out of there. I love you very much Claire and I really don’t mean the things I do and by them I don’t mean to hurt your feelings it just happens that way. I am sorry if that confused you. I am very sad that I can’t see you and I’m sorry that I stopped visiting, but like I said, I moved away. I love you lots!</p>
<p>Love, Mommy, Bob, and baby Abby~</p>
<p>I hate her. I know she doesn’t mean any of that. I just wish that she didn’t remember me and that she didn’t feel even a little bit for me. I just can’t have anything to do with her. I am not mute; I just choose not to talk. I don’t need to talk. I don’t mind anymore that I am in the mental class. Most of the time it’s just about getting me to talk. I will stay there until I do talk. I think that’s going to be today.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I spoke today. I now talk. It feels weird because people talk to me slow like I’m dumb. I tell them to speed up but they don’t. I get mad when they do that. I wonder what my sister will look like. Have you ever had the feeling that you want to go somewhere because something there is waiting for you but you can never have it? I made a poem about it. It’s kind of short, though.</p>
<p><br />
Someday, I know I will have a place in this world My life will have meaning And all the things That kept me from accomplishing The impossible And that things that are there, Calling my name, Reaching out to me Will be there where I can reach it</p>
<p>My teacher says that I am a phenomenal writer. I don’t think about it much. She gives me homework that works on my talking skills. I don’t like Ms. Gerald. She makes me mad. It’s past curfew. I must go or else I won’t get as much breakfast.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I was a bad girl, a VERY bad girl. I got ‘grounded’. The people here call it ‘away time’. I’ve read enough books to know what they’re talking about. I visited Shirley. She is very sick. They told me she had a rare disease that ate your skin. I think her mommy was afraid of her like Phillis is of me. I don’t know why my aunt doesn’t want me. She has seen me before, and I know that I’m not pretty but… I don’t think I deserve this. Do I?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dear Diary, We took a field trip today to a local library. The librarians liked me because of what my teacher told them; you know, how I like to read. I saw the name of the orphanage. It’s called Greyman’s Orphanage. I also saw the papers that parents have to read before they abandon their children. It said:</p>
<p>The child that is left here will be left with full custody for us and will be entered in the local schoolhouse at the end of the orphanage. If your child has any mental or physical disabilities, please contact us right away. If your child has any special medical needs or has an allergenic reaction to anything, please contact us immediately also. If your child is harmed here in any way, you will not be able to sue due to the fact that you have signed the application and have registered your child into the program.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m not Phillis’ anymore.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I thought of something. When I was putting on my warm new nightgown and I stared up to the poorly made ceiling, I began to think. So what if I do get adopted? It will be better than living in this dump. So that’s when I decided that the next time it’s open house, I will come out of hiding. I think about it and I realize that some people would think it absurd for a 10 year old to have to make such a great decision. The decision is whether you want to stay in this horrible place or to be left in the hands of someone that you don’t know and they don’t know you. I think some more about my choices. Angel says I am smarter than most grown-ups she knows. I think she is talking about Ms. Gerald. I made another poem.</p>
<p>It is the break of day, A shy voice calls out to you Will you answer? Will you care that if the child Is drowning and you Are left on the shore With a lifesaver in your hand? You can say you care But do you really mean it? It’s only a matter of time before That child will be drowning For real this time and What do you do? Nothing- But that child Is drowning Drowning in sorrow Drowning in pain And you’re just watching there With the lifesaver in your hand…</p>
<p>I wrote that one out to Phillis. She would get mad if I showed it to her. I don’t think I will; writing just helps me get the pain out. That one was long, but I believe that I got the point across.</p>
<p><br />
Dear Diary, Today I played soccer with Alicia. She makes me happy. I do not like boys here, they are mean to me. They broke my dolly again after I stitched it back together. I got stitches. I forgot to say that. I fell down the stairs because a boy that was 14 kicked me. He got in trouble but he just had to speak to the priest. The older kids have to go to the Greyman’s Church for Youths. But anyway, Alicia is nice to me though she doesn’t hang out with me much. She doesn’t ever save me a seat at lunch. I always have to sit at the far end of the table, away from everybody else. But what can I say? She’s the only thing I have.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I hate Alicia. She is so deceiving! One day, all of a sudden, she walks up to me at recess and yells out: “I don’t want to hang out with you anymore! You just have problems all because your mom left you! My mom died! You’re just acting crazy and have problems because you hardly ever talk!” I cried and people made fun of me. She didn’t get in trouble, though. I ran to my corner on the 2nd floor and cried on my bed. Then I looked at her bed, 3 beds away from mine, and saw my dolly in her bag. Today I got in trouble again.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I didn’t finish talking about yesterday. I grabbed my dolly, walked up to Alicia and punched her in the face. She then scratched me and I pulled her hair and she cracked my wrist. I tackled her and she kicked me in my stomach. I don’t remember all of it but I think it ended with something like: I punched her again and gave her a black eye; she kneed my chest and knocked the wind out of me. With all I had left, I grabbed her hair and shook her head all around. She screamed but by then, Angel and some other people had come and tore us apart. I pulled out a lock of her golden hair while they pulled me off of her. It looked like this: She was on the ground on her back while I was beating her up sitting on her stomach. We both struggled to get free, and she did for a second which startled me, but they grabbed her again. Only then did I realize all of the kids cheering me on circling around us. I got a lot of male friends (not boyfriends just friends) after that. I have decided to hang out with only boys now.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>Dear Diary, From now on I only hang out with boys. My 11th birthday is coming up in June and I have decided to only invite boys. I know I probably won’t get my way but at least I can try. My new best friend is Cameron. He plays with me and I get to play with his other friends too. I think I like him… I’m not sure though. He is nice to me and he never picks on me.</p>
<p>Dear diary, Cameron and I hang out a lot together and he doesn’t care when his other friends make fun of him. I know this probably won’t last long, but having him as a close friend is the best thing that happened to me. All these ups and downs, twists and turns… I am just glad I have a part in this world.</p>
<p>Dear diary, What I am about to tell you will be shocking and unusual. I got adopted. They are called the Smiths and they say that they live in a big house. Right now I am sitting in the back seat of their car getting hit on the shoulder with a big cardboard box with all of my stuff, even dolly. They seem too perfect. He wears his hair slicked back, she wears her red hair in a bun, they wear dressy clothes, isn’t there something wrong with them!? Maybe even just a little bit?! I don’t know but I think that we are pulling into the driveway right now. I have to stop writing now, they are talking to me, and I’ll tell you about it later.</p>
<p>Dear diary, Their house is BEAUTIFUL! It’s like one of those luxury things that you see on TV (I only watch TV when I sneak over to the school custodian closet when the custodians watch boxing or football). Mary Elizabeth Smith is my new ‘mother’. I am not going to call her mother. It sounds too awkward knowing that my mother is off having a baby that she loves and takes care of with a selfish father who doesn’t want anything to do with what doesn’t belong to him. It sickens me. I am going to go to another school, another catholic school. I didn’t talk a lot during lunch. They asked me questions like: “did you know your parents,” or “what do you like to do in your spare time?” I think that they were shocked to find out that I like to wrestle with the boys and play in the mud. They are like goody-goody two shoes. UGH! And the worst part is that they want me to wear dresses… no. Well, my room is nice and I have a computer and some other cool stuff. I just hate the color scheme: PINK. My life has just become something that is annoying and won’t stop pestering me. Well, goodnight.</p>
<p>Dear diary, George Edward Smith is making take horse back riding lessons at a farm just south from the farmers market, a couple blocks from here. It’s pretty fun. My favorite horse is lightning because he always goes too fast… he, he. After learning to sidesaddle from Mary (I know how, I just can’t do it well) I think that she is becoming more attached to me. That’s bad. I am hoping that they think that I am a little brat and send me back to where I belong: Greyman’s Orphanage, for the poor innocent souls (I just added that last part but it is true). The only reason they chose me was because of my intelligence. It’s what’s on the inside that counts (my family was never beautiful in that subject). And listen to this: I have been noticing that they look kind of shaky around me, like they’re afraid or something. I don’t know. I’ll find out sooner or later.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I can’t stay here anymore. They treat me like I’m their family. It’s like having a 3rd parent. I feel like they are trying to replace my real parents… not like my real parents did any better.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I am leaving tonight. Mary Smith lets me talk to my friends back at Greyman’s on the phone. They tell me that they will help me, so I’m leaving. I just can’t be here anymore. I am taking you so don’t worry, not like you would, but whatever. So I am going to crawl through my bedroom window when Charlie and Cameron give me the signal. I left a note to the Smiths so they don’t worry. I am looking through the window right now. Oh! I think I saw something…</p>
<p>Dear diary, I am scared and cold. I don’t tell anybody else that I am scared. It is dark out and there is only Harry outside: one of the councilors. If I get caught, who knows what kind of trouble I will be in? I am in the old tree house right outside of Greyman’s across from the schoolhouse. I don’t know what else lives in this tree, what else could be lurking in the bushes, or what I am laying on but whatever it is, it is hard and it hurts my stomach. Oh, it’s just a nail. I am lying low for now and the boys promised to give me food in the morning. Hopefully, Alicia- that blonde haired rat- won’t squeal on me if she finds me here.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I have been in this stupid tree house for about 3 days now and no one has even thought of looking in here. What idiots. I bet George is thinking about how much money he could have saved by not buying me. Crap…</p>
<p>Dear diary, I am back at Greyman’s at my same corner with my same shelves and my best friends in the whole world. The Smiths decided that they couldn’t have a child that runs off and everything like that. I don’t care. I knew that I wouldn’t stay there for long. I am not in as much trouble as I thought. Guess what? I hate to read. My vocabulary went from advanced to average. I don’t care as long as I have my friends.</p>
<p>Dear diary, 2 days from now is ‘open house’ or whatever. I just hope I don’t get picked again. Unfortunately, everyone has to dress in their best outfit and either stand in one place all day long or sit in one chair or couch all day long. At least we get to miss school. Last time there was an open house, I had to stay in my corner, ALL DAY LONG! It sucks because if you’re bad just one time you can’t do anything else. Charlie tells me that I have a gift because I am a girl. He says that I am more likely to get out of trouble when I’m in it. Stupid Charlie. I HATE being treated like that woman was on the silver dollar. I HATE IT! I am going to go kick Charlie now, the other boys will laugh, and it will begin a fight. Oh yeah, did I mention? I cut my hair. It is shoulder length so I can see my victims. J Anyway, time to get in and out of trouble…</p>
<p>Dear diary, Love sucks. And to make my life more miserable than it is already, this is my last day for freedom (tomorrow is open house). Well, this is what happened this morning: After breakfast we had break. I was climbing on the monkey bars while Amber yelled at me because I wouldn’t move. Cameron then came over and I hopped down from the bars. I landed kind of clumsy but that didn’t matter. He then said abruptly: “Kiss me,” and he perked out his lips. I looked disgusted but actually felt loved for once. I then dropped my jaw, pushed him, and while he was on the ground I kicked sand at him. I then heard some small giggling and then hysterical laughing. I looked up at the boys and they yelled while still cracking up: “OKAY! OKAY! You get the cheesecake.” It was a gag, and I was the fool. Oh how I wanted to KILL Cameron right then. And then guess who I saw standing next to him after I looked back up from the ground? Alicia. She was wearing baggy pants for the first time. She had hair a little bit longer then mine – about to her chest – and she crossed her arms and gave me that look. That look that said: ‘Ha, ha you loser. I got your man and there’s nothing you can do about it.’ But I did do something about it. I ran over towards her and rammed her. It was quite funny because she gasped really loud like a pig so it kind of sounded like a squeal. I was on my hands and knees on top of her while she was struggling trying to get me off of her. She then slapped me in my face and I pulled her golden hair and she squealed again. I felt like laughing but I was too angry.</p>
<p>Everyone crowded around us and no one bothered to tell the teachers/councilors. She grabbed her hair back from me and I was slapping her face back and forth from one hand to the other. She then kicked my butt really hard, I got off of my hands to see what happened and she pushed me back. The tables had turned. I was now the pigeon. She started hitting my stomach and legs while I pulled her hair, tried to kick her, and (with the little energy I had left) punched her head and kneed her in the stomach. After that, the teachers pealed us off of each other as we struggled to get back to each other again to finish off the fight. Since the teachers saw her on top of me, I am not in trouble. I hate Cameron now though he says he’s sorry and I want to take him back so bad. I have to play hard to get.</p>
<p><br />
Dear diary, I am getting dressed as I write. My hair is in pigtails while my bangs are swayed to the side. Angel loves doing my hair. So does Gwen but I tell her “no” so she just walks away. Angel asked me about the fight and I only told her part of the story. It wasn’t all my fault. I would have tackled Cam but beating up Alicia just makes me feel a whole lot better. Eck, got to go downstairs now. Tell you more after I’m done.</p>
<p>Dear diary, Fright has just taken itself to a new level. I hid in the basement the whole time until Gwen found me. I think I saw my dad. I looked through a hole in the wall and it seemed as though he was looking for me. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t go out. He then went in to the boss person’s room and he reserved me. Now I cannot be adopted by anyone but him. My friends don’t understand. I just want to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I want to run away but I can’t. Where am I supposed to go? I am sure my father is smarter than the teachers so he could find me easily in the tree house. I am awake at 4:00 am. I have until 1:00 pm and I am packing my things now. Maybe I made a mistake. Maybe that wasn’t my dad. Maybe it was someone who was looking for a short brown-haired girl who was just absent at the time. I don’t know… I just wish this day were over. I am leaving dolly here. I am giving her to Nancy: a new girl who is younger than I was when I came here. It’s just too soon for me to be seeing him.</p>
<p>At 12:56 He is still not here. I think he forgot about me. I’m looking out of the window… and I don’t see anything. Oh wait, uh-oh. He’s here I think. There is a black sports car. No, it can’t be him. There is a woman in the car. That must be his wife. Can’t talk now. Have to hide.</p>
<p>Dear diary, I am in my ‘room’. I am locked in here until supper. He grabbed my arm violently, threw my bags into my arms and pushed me into the attic. This place has one window, one dinky light, and a rusty squeaky bed. It’s not his wife, her name is Laura and there are a whole bunch more of them here too. I don’t like it here. Why does he want me here? He said that I won’t be going to school anymore and that I won’t need any of my old clothes. He is making me do all the laundry and junk… I can understand why Phillis left him.</p>
<p>Dear diary, It’s freezing in here! I have but one blanket that is holey and a dresser that I can only put so many things in until it cracks; it already has too many holes in it now. I am also really scared. I cried tonight, for the first time in a while. It’s been a long time. But it wasn’t ‘refreshing’ like Angel said it would be. My dad hits me for no reason. I have bruises in so many places from being pushed and grabbed and yanked around and slapped and even punched. I hate him. I don’t understand why he would do this. What was the point in getting me? He must be using me. His girls laugh at me when I get hit. I am usually alone in the house and am locked in my room all day. Today he came in and told me he will leave me here and I will be alone for 3 days. Amy, another one of those girls, might even come over for a day. I have been here; awake, all day long with no access to food. I am locked in this h-e-double-hockey-sticks (Angel says I shouldn’t swear… I wouldn’t mind being her kid) hole. I am so hungry…</p>
<p>Dear diary, She unlocked my door and then told me that I was worthless and that my dad would send me away because she meant more to him than I did. Then under my breath I said something like: “I hope so”. This then made her so angry and she started to kick me. “YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP!” (I cleaned that up a bit) she said to me. She was hitting me so what else was I to do? I had practice from the butt-faced Alicia, so why not? I started to fight back. I kicked her and pulled her ratted hair and punched her arm. She then ran for the kitchen. Not like I knew where the kitchen was but I think it was because she brought back the knife. I stared at her with fear and then the knife. It was really sharp –maybe a steak knife- and she said: “What now you $&amp;#@^$ #%(*@%^#?” Then she cut me. First she cut my arm and I saw it in slow motion. I looked at my arm and all the blood and started to tear. I couldn’t feel the pain. This woman didn’t even know me but she was willing to kill me. She then cut my stomach and I gasped. I grabbed at my stomach and collapsed.</p>
<p>I am at the Hospital now and she was carried away. I don’t know how I got here but I am here now and I am out of my dad’s house. I don’t want to go anywhere. I don’t want to see my mom, I don’t want to see my dad, I don’t want to see Alicia or Cam, and I don’t want to see myself. The doctor is nice to me and asked me where my family was. I told her I lived in an orphanage. She then said: “I am so sorry dear.” “I’m sure not…” I said to her and she took pity on me. I then fell asleep. I remembered nothing after that. They may have had to operate on me, but I have no recollection of it. Then I felt the pain. It felt like someone was grabbing all my flesh and ripping it off by the handfuls. I opened my eyes again, and I saw Angel. I wanted to get up and hug her, and cry, and smile, and laugh… but I didn’t. I just smirked and said that I was happy to see her. Why can’t I feel my feelings around people!? But then I saw what’s-her-face. I was so enraged I couldn’t even think of her name. She glared at me and said: “I really like you Claire. You are the only real friend I’ve had, and look at what we have done to each other.” I smiled as she lifted her hair out of her eyes and showed me her black eye. I wanted to laugh but then she came over and hugged me.</p>
<p>I am back at the orphanage and I am so happy. I am also scared but I won’t say so. I don’t want to die. I said and felt it but I didn’t mean it. You can’t really mean something like that until you are flying through the air about to smash on a cold sidewalk, or about to kick that chair from underneath you as you hang from the ceiling by a rope around your neck, or about to close your eyes for the last time as you hesitantly pull the trigger of that gun you had been eyeing for only God knows how long. Then you don’t feel it anymore. I kind of don’t want to feel anymore but I don’t want all the crap in between. I never want to see my dad again and now I wonder why Phillis could marry such a man. Did she forget about me? Did she want me to die? *</p>
