<p>Ok, but what does "better results" mean? Faster burn? More complete burn?

<p>Larger grain, slower burn. Large guns require slower combustion to overcome inertia of the ball and build pressure. "Grains" two to three inches across were used in large artillery pieces. Fine, fast-burning powder was used in muskets and shotguns. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.51.25.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.51.25.96_0942.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.51.25.96">contribs</a>) 02:21, 14 June 2005.</small></p>
<p>Larger guns require less of a violent, explosive shove, and more of a constant push. All grains take fire from the outside, so larger grains take more time because of larger surface area. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllStarZ_ea0a.html" title="User:AllStarZ">AllStarZ</a> 04:11, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This, for a start, thoroughly demolishes the aforementioned site's claim that the Chinese did not know gunpowder at Marco Polo's time. And speaking of Marco Polo, the site uses several details of his travel report as "evidence" that are definitely false. He definitely did *not* design the catapults in the mentioned siege, which ended a year before he allegedly entered China. And yes, he did not mention fireworks - similar as to how he did not mention chopsticks, foot binding, chinese writing and the Great Wall. 82.83.243.182 11:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If anyone is going to revert, please provide a <i>primary</i> source for Chinese gunpowder, or a detailed analysis of some really, really good archaeology. I just finished scouring Needham for true Chinese gunpowder, and I did not find it until the seventeenth century. The earlier recipes were for other combinations of saltpetre explosives. Needham has lots of pretty charts classifying a million ingredients as "carbonaceous material," but that is just his way of trying to place gunpowder very early in China. It's just a matter of terminology. I think it's better to be clear than to be chauvinistic. Ditto for the Arab gunpowder. We need primary sources or other compelling evidence. <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcanter_b0c6.html" title="User:Ocanter">Ocanter</a> 17:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The mix is sometimes dampened with <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. Black powder is also corned to change its burn rate. Corning is a process which first compresses the fine black powder meal into blocks with a fixed density (1.7&#160;g/cm³). The blocks are then broken up into granules. These granules are then sorted by size to give the various grades of black powder. Standard grades of black powder run from the coarse Fg grade used in large bore rifles and small cannon though FFg (medium and smallbore rifles), FFFg (pistols), and FFFFg (smallbore, short pistols and priming <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flintlock.html" title="Flintlock">flintlocks</a>). To reduce accidental ignition due to an electrostatic discharge, coarse black powder grains are sometimes coated with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphite.html" title="Graphite">graphite</a> dust, preventing charge build-up during handling. Very coarse black powder was used in mining before the development of <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitroglycerine.html" title="Nitroglycerine">nitroglycerine</a> and <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a>. Black powder is classified as a <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_explosive.html" title="Low explosive">low explosive</a>, that is, it <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflagration.html" title="Deflagration">deflagrates</a> (burns) rapidly. High explosives detonate at a rate approximately 10 times faster than the burning of black powder. Although black powder is not a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_explosive.html" title="High explosive">high explosive</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Transportation_42db.html" title="United States Department of Transportation">United States Department of Transportation</a> classifies it as a "Class A High Explosive" for shipment because it is so easily ignited. Highly destructive explosions at fireworks manufacturing plants are rather common events, especially in Asia. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as "Class C Firework", "Class C Model Rocket Engine", etc. for shipment because they are harder to ignite than the loose powder.</p>

<dd>I believe it would be useful if you read the talk page that accompanies <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a>; whilst this is only a subjective judgement on my part, what you appear to be doing could be regarded as <b>disruptive tagging</b>. Perhaps this is not what you intended. Unfortunately, for you, your repeated blocking for breaking the three revert rule does give the impression that you have little regard for Wikipedia practices. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 18:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can ascertain, <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> made some editorial changes to some paragraphs (possibly those related to the history of gunpowder in China) and added tags to many of the paragraphs that he did not change. He also added a through-away comment along the lines <i>lets be fair to the rest of the article</i>. This to me appeared to be <i>self promotion</i> and did not provide adequate justification for the tagging. The paragraphs that <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> objects to are technically correct. I get the feeling that the user has little knowledge of gunpowder in Europe / USA - but that may be unfair. I have added references to some of these paragraphs that were tagged; I have also edited some these paragraphs because the words appeared to be a straight copy from references that were not quoted. All the other paragraphs that have been tagged by <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> and which he regards as unreliable, are technically correct. It is not my job to go and get references for <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a>. I have provided a number of references at the end of the article; and <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> will find the information that he seeks in them. I would suggest that more effective use of his time would be made if he would to read the sources and add the references to the relevant paragraphs rather than adding disruptive tagging and block deleting text from the article. As I have said earlier, this article is not perfect; and some of the sentences appear to have been lifted whole from unacknowledged sources. <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> could make a positive contribution here; the changes that have been made in respect of the history of gunpowder in China appear to fall into the category of <i>Positive Contribution</i>. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 17:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both myself and <a href="../../../e/i/o/User%7EEiorgiomugini_174c.html" title="User:Eiorgiomugini">Eiorgiomugini</a> have identified various good points in this article as well as some poor points - particularly poor referencing (and in my case, found direct copying of text from unacknowledged sources). We have both made attempts to improve this article. Today I was intending to layout a new framework with the aim of doubling, or more, the size of this article; covering ancient history, and from a western viewpoint its production and use from <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">Medieval</a> times through to the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> when the UK ceased manufacturing it commercially. However, there is another article <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">Gunpowder</a> which covers the same topic. My proposal is to merged the two articles into <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">Gunpowder</a> and make this article a <i>redirect</i> page.<a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 11:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. We could spruce up this page but there is enough information about black powder itself that we can make a separate page out of it. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllStarZ_ea0a.html" title="User:AllStarZ">AllStarZ</a> 04:09, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a comment, I would ask what is the difference between the Black powder and the Gunpowder articles; as far as I can see they were written by different groups of authors, they cover basically the same topic and use the same references. My knowledge of the Eastern (pre-)history is quite poor and there is good information in both articles; however, both articles appear to have identical views, from both a Eastern and Western standpoint.<a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 10:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One way forward could be to use the Gunpowder article to refer to military uses, e.g. guns, rifles, pistols, mortars, etc, and the black powder article to refer to civil engineering uses. I was intending to expand this article to include a lot more of the manufacturing technology, and we have over 300 years of that in the UK; however the manufacturing technology is, almost, independent of the powder's final use. The range of types of ballistic properties that were exploited in war-like use were also exploited in civil use. The powders are obsolete for both civil engineering and military use. That leaves fireworks and historical weapons reenactment groups. Again, I struggle to differentiate between black powder and gun powder. I would welcome you thoughts.<a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 10:49, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd rather that the contents of the gunpowder article be merged into the black powder article, since the former article makes more references to black powder. The gunpowder article could be used to either redirect to guns or black powder. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllStarZ_ea0a.html" title="User:AllStarZ">AllStarZ</a> 19:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to prefer this latter arrangement, merging the gunpowder article content into the black powder article. Gunpowder in modern times can be either smokeless powder or black powder. However, black powder is not really connected with smokeless powder for its historical development nor for its use, even to today. Black powder is still widely used in replica weapons, in fireworks, and even in large Naval guns, and is deserving of an article of its own. Black powder is not obsolete; it is just a niche technology. Likewise, smokeless powder is deserving of an article of its own. Gunpowder, however, should most likely be set up as a re-direction page, to both the black powder and smokeless powder articles, with perhaps a short historical paragraph containing the information that until smokeless powder was invented, there was only one gunpowder, namely black powder. Trying to break out military vs. civilian use is not likely to be a workable solution, as the original developments were almost always entirely militarily-based. Ball mill technology for producing black powder is limited to just the largest commercial producers as upwards of 10 tons of pressure are required for achieving decent burn rates in the final product; modern precipitation techniques, on the other hand, are much more suitable for small producers and field expedient production of black powders. These techniques, suitable for field expedient production, can produce black powder that is nearly indistinguishable from commercially-produced black powder. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 03:33, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel that the history material on the early saltpeter explosives (or "early gunpowder," if you prefer) should all go in the gunpowder article, not in the black powder article. If we were to simply merge all the early history into the gunpowder article, the black powder article would be a lot more coherent, and the early history in the gunpowder article would contain more information. <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcanter_b0c6.html" title="User:Ocanter">Ocanter</a> 17:40, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree with <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcanter_b0c6.html" title="User:Ocanter">Ocanter</a>; and so I admit that the discussions above slightly concern me. From a UK perspective <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpowder.html" title="Blackpowder">Blackpowder</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> are the same thing. There is the charcoal/potassium nitrate/sulphur (75:15:10) mixture, which can be mealed or granular, glazed or unglazed; and also the sulphurless equivalents which are not mentioned in the article. I own or have borrowed all the references except the Chinese ones - so I have Needham (vol 5, part7), West, Buchanan, Cocroft, Brown, Kelly and Earl and all these talk about gunpowder. Gunpowder is not <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokeless_powder.html" title="Smokeless powder">smokeless powder</a>, which is based on nitrocellulose - I expanded that article; neither is it ball powder, Rifle Neonites, or Parabellium Powder, these are all smokeless powders. From a UK military perspective gunpowder as a propellant and an explosive was obsolete by World War I: being replaced by <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordite.html" title="Cordite">Cordite</a>, as a propellant (I wrote most of that article), and high explosives such as TNT, RDX etc. The UK stopped making gunpowder commercially in the 1960s and all gunpowder was then imported from eastern Europe - what was known, at the time, as East Germany and Yugoslavia. Gunpowder is, or was, still used in fireworks and certain specialised applications such as quickmatch, primed cambric, fuses and timing delays. And yes it is used by historical reenactment society's. Sorry, but I have doubts that gunpowder is used in large Naval guns; I don't believe the UK has used it since Cordite came in to service; and I suspect it is Cordite or smokeless powder that is being used. Gunpowder is a much <i>softer</i> explosive than the nitro-based explosives and so gunpowder type mixtures continued to be used for coal mining and other mining operations where damage to the material was to be minimised. But even for this civil application, it was replaced in the UK by what was to become <i>Permitted Explosives</i>. The problems of flash from gunpowder made it too dangerous to use in mines, where methane and/or carbon monoxide might be present.</dd>

<dd>So in summary, I think blackpowder and gunpowder are the same and the articles aught to be merged. As gunpowder is on the CD version of wikipedia, it may be more acceptable to merge blackpowder into gunpowder. I don't regard gunpowder and smokeless powder as interchangeable terms; so <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokeless_powder.html" title="Smokeless powder">Smokeless powder</a> should remain separate from gunpowder. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrotec_ef8b.html" title="User:Pyrotec">Pyrotec</a> 18:44, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From a US perspective, blackpowder and gunpowder are not the same thing. In the US, gunpowder includes both black powder and smokeless powder. As for Naval uses, black powder is still used in US battleships. There was an explosion from the silk bags containing black powder in the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Iowa_%28BB-61%29_4062.html" title="USS Iowa (BB-61)">USS Iowa (BB-61)</a> in the Number 2 turret that killed a large number of sailors in the not too distant past and forced it to be mothballed. As for cordite, the US has never used cordite; this is strictly a UK-only smokeless powder. It appears that there is a slight difference in nomenclature arising between the UK and the US usages. Black powder is but one form of gunpowder in the US. If we move black powder to gun powder, then we should also move smokeless powder there, too. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 19:37, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
