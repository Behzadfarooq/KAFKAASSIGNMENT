<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlack_dbb0.html" title="Edit section: Black is an absence of light">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Black is an absence of light</span></h2>
<p>The abscence of colour is white, the absence of light is black, why are absences of colour or light regarded as not being a colour? If anything, black and white are shades of grey (Which is a colour)</p>
<p>There lies a paradox as to whether or not black is a color. If you use the spectrum reasoning, black not being part of the 7 component colours that make up white light, then black is not a colour. However, if black is explained as absorbing all light such that no light reflects back to an observer's eyes, then black is what the eyes perceive as "just another colour" because the eyes can't decipher which colour is it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is bugbear of mine, and I suppose it comes down to a question of semantics, and would be considered unproductive by most people, like the question of whether viruses are a life form or not. But here goes anyway. We see a surface as black when it is reflecting no light at visible wavelengths. Thus, it has been defined as "the absence of colour" as all the other colours are caused by non-zero wavelengths of light. My objection is that 0 IS a number, and can provide information. Thus, if you merely say "Black is not a colour because you are not seeing anything" then a philosopher might reply that your hand, not having organs of sight, is also not "seeing anything" but we would be loathe to say of the resultant lack of sensation that it is "black". More revealingly, we all have a "blind spot" on our retina, where the optic nerve cable enters the brain. We are generally unaware of it, but it can be located. In my case, I have a small blind spot right next to the fovea of my left eye, caused by retinal neuropathy. I only become aware of it when I am focusing on small print at a certain angle. When that happens, the letters simply vanish. I am not aware of any blackness at all. The difference between these preceding examples, and such an event as when I am looking at a dark sky on a cloudy night, is that the blind spot in my eye, and my hand, are not equipped to sense light at all. My eyes are, and in sensing “blackness” they are providing valuable information about the visual world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider this example. You are going on a trip, and you decide with your family that when you reach your destination you will ring them. To save money, you agree that you will ring 3 times and then hang up. Your family await these 3 rings but they never come, and they begin to worry. Of course, it would be silly to say that no message had been conveyed as no sound had been issued by the phone handset. In the context of the agreement, a message has been sent by the inactivity of the sender. The same goes for the 0 wavelength of light. Physicists would be happy to say that 0 wavelength is as valid as any non-zero wavelength. After all, quantum physics is full of “virtual particles” and the like. So in the phone's case, silence is a type of sound, not the absence of sound, and blackness is a type of colour, not the absence of colour. In conclusion, remember that the most important clue in Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes’ story“Silver Blaze" from the following quotation:
<dl>
<dd>Gregory (Scotland Yard detective): Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?</dd>
<dd>Holmes: To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.</dd>
<dd>Gregory: The dog did nothing in the night-time.</dd>
<dd>Holmes: That was the curious incident.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the clue was the dog didn’t bark because it had seen anything untoward. Therefore the perpetrator of the crime was someone the dog knew and trusted. The “absence of sound” in this case led to the apprehension of the perpetrator of a serious crime. So in such cases, these absences might well be regarded as “signals” every bit as important as those of a non-zero value. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyles325a_c306.html" title="User:Myles325a">Myles325a</a> 10:29, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The song doesn't really use the word black in a negative context. Actually, the word is never mentioned in the lyrics, just the title. It refers to the end of films, which can fade to black (which then segues to the end credits) or which otherwise usually cut to black (again, end credits). The title refers to life fading, as the song is about suicide in part, as though it were a film. Because of this, I think the song should be removed from the list of songs in the article.</p>

<p><i>Black while commonly referred to as a color, is in actuality the abscence of color and as a word has several subtle differences in meaning.</i> is the current lead sentence.</p>
<p>If you ask a typical person, he'll say black is a color. The American Heritage Dictionary says black is a color. I think the lead should identify black as a color, perhaps with a modifying/clarifying clause. -<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrick_595e.html" title="User:Grick">Grick</a>(<a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGrick_ad14.html" title="User talk:Grick"><sup>talk to me!</sup></a>) 01:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Black IS a colour.</p>
<p>Proof: Definition of colour is-</p>
<p>"Color or Colour (according to spelling differences) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, yellow, white, etc. " (source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour</a>)</p>
<p>Since colour is about perception rather than light and we perceive black as we would perceive blue, red and green, which are also colours. Black must be a colour even thought it represents the absence of light.</p>
<p>What we call green, red, black etc is just a tag the brain uses to understand light. Not the light itself. When I dream I still see colour (including black) even though there is no light entering my eyes.</p>

<p>The reference to black as the color of the belt for the highest-ranking martial artists in many modern schools of martial arts should be subsumed under the reference to <i>kuro</i> (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> for "black") as a symbol of nobility, age, and experience in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_culture.html" title="Japanese culture">Japanese culture</a>. The coloring of the belts in these schools of martial arts is a direct reflection of the color-ranking scheme of Japanese culture.</p>

<p>That is, "Seek and ye shall find". What is the logic of the order of these entries? Suggest alphabetical only. I have differentiated between "blacklisted" and "blackballed" here, which are not the same thing at all. I have also provided "blackmail" with a short definition, pinched from the eponymous entry.</p>
<p>Moreover, some entries have an explanation, others don't. Why does Black Thursday get a brief explanation, but the infamous "Black Hole of Calcutta" gets none. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyles325a_c306.html" title="User:Myles325a">Myles325a</a> 11:00, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
