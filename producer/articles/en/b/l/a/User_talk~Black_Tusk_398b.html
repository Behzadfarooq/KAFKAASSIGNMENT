<p>Hi. Saw your creation of <a href="../../../t/u/y/Tuya_Butte_5562.html" title="Tuya Butte">Tuya Butte</a>, which I may add to as I know a bit about formal geographic regions in that area....just wanted to advise that when you "create a mountain" to please add [[Category:Mountains of British Columbia]] to the bottom of the page. There may be other suitable categories but I can't think of any others at the moment. I'll add them also to Ash Mountain etc. but please do not add Wiki articles based on ungazetted/unofficial names as is commonly done in Bivouac.com and in mountaineering guides; Wiki articles should be on formally named mountains ONLY (not sure about your "Matthew's Tuya", for instance, as I mapped that area and don't recall seeing it on the Provincial Basemap at <a href="http://maps.gov.bc.ca" class="external free" title="http://maps.gov.bc.ca" rel="nofollow">http://maps.gov.bc.ca</a>).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:22, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ooops; forgot it's an extinct volcano; so use [[Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia]].<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to previous now that I've come across Caribou Tuya, which I haven't tried to look up on the map; but I do have to wonder what else there is going to be about these tuyas that qualifies them for separate articles; photos and maps would help in all cases. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 07:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; for basic images it's simply [[Image:xbxbx.jpg|thumb|400px|right|{Caption)]] but for mountains there's an infobox which is laid out as per <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Garibaldi_358a.html" title="Mount Garibaldi">Mount Garibaldi</a>: {{Infobox Mountain | Name=Mount Garibaldi | Photo=Mount_Garibaldi.JPG | Caption=Mount Garibaldi as seen from [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] | Elevation=2,678 metres (8,786 feet) | Location=[[British Columbia|British Columbia, Canada]] | Range=[[Garibaldi Ranges]] | Prominence = | Coordinates = {{coor dm|49|51|N|123|00|W|type:mountain_region:CA}} | Topographic map = [[National Topographic System|NTS]] 92G/14 | Type=[[Stratovolcano]] | Age=[[Pleistocene]] | Last eruption=[[Holocene]] (~10000 [[Before Present|BP]]) | First ascent=1907 A.

<dd>Hi; sorry about that; forgot to explain that after you put in the code and you see the redlink with the image-file name, use "upload file" in the little menu at left (toolbox below the search window) to put the file up. Saw your edits to Tuya Butte and others and figured that's what you tried; I guess I assumed the image-upload thing was obvious, but if that's why you took out the infobox you put in, that's why the image didn't work.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 07:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I've just created some stubs for for the BC Wikiproject using a dogwood logo but want to find a peak-pic to use for BritishColumbia-mountains-stub, which I'll create today. I've looked through what pics there are in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Category%7EMountains_of_British_Columbia_abeb.html" title="Category:Mountains of British Columbia">Category:Mountains of British Columbia</a> but can't find anything that reduces to 35px and still looks like something; tried Garibaldi, Albert Edward etc - Assiniboine's shape would be perfect but the online picture doesn't cut it as it's foggy-cloudy/flat-contrast.

I just tried using it on the <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayoosh_Range_067d.html" title="Cayoosh Range">Cayoosh Range</a> article but didn't do very well (see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Mountain_Range_97e4.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Mountain Range">the template's talkpage</a>). It occurred to me while filling in its blanks (since reverted, as the formatting I screwed up so will leave it to more experienced hands, or a tutorial so I know what went wrong) that I couldn't answer the geology parameters asked for - type of rock, age of formation - whereas you seem equipped for that, at least in regard to some ranges that you're obviously familiar with. Suggest you try it on <a href="../../../t/u/y/Tuya_Range_bb13.html" title="Tuya Range">Tuya Range</a> maybe....I know the range boundaries there so can give you the high/low points and their elevations, thanks to Provincial Basemap which is handy for that sort of thing (high point is simply the highest one, and the data can be pulled from Bivouac; low point would not be its prominence col, though...rather opposite to that, in fact, if it even has a prominence col given its drainage pattern...many ranges aren't framed by waterways/rivers anyway).

<p>I know some American usages include the whole fam ding all the way to the Alsek, but that's not the Canadian usage; there is an archaic and quasi-legal usage in BC/Canada, such that on maps of the Lillooet Ranges you'll see "summit of the Cascades as defined for legal purposes" but that dates to colonial times when geographers hadn't gotten in the game or orotaxonomy (classification of mountains). Meager is in the Coast Mountains. NB "Coast Range" in Wiki redirects to Coast Mountains, "Pacific Coast Range" is for the Oregon coastal range, and what we call the Pacific Cordillera the Americans call the American Cordillera. Ontarians like to call it the Canadian Cordillera, apparently, and I've never been clear on whether the Pacific Cordillera is supposed to include the Selwnyns and the Brooks Range. Don't worry, it gets even more confusing....but Meager is in the Coast Mountains, not the Cascades (already took out the category; suggest we ask for a Category:Coast Mountains.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Meager's not in the Garibaldi Ranges, either, only in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ranges_3d75.html" title="Pacific Ranges">Pacific Ranges</a>. There is no formal subgrouping of the Pacific Ranges it belongs to; Bivouac uses "Meager Group" and in older material I've seen the region around the Lillooet Icecap referred to as the Lillooet Crown, but for now that' uncitable. Try using Bivouac as an x-ref for what range something belongs in; I built their system, although there's necessarily a few invented name here and there - Meager Group, Railway Group, and more as you get up around Waddington/Queen Bess/Monarch and beyond.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Thought you might find useful the map of SW BC I just uploaded to Wikimedia Commons. It's linked at <a href="../../../l/o/w/Talk%7ELower_Mainland_995b.html" title="Talk:Lower Mainland">Talk:Lower Mainland</a>, towards the bottom currently, right after two other maps I drew for the Lower Mainland based on it.

<p>Hi; if you look at this morning's edits to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> you'll see I did some slicing and dicing there. I'm just wondering if it was you who put in the full listing of Cascade Volcanic Belt member-mountains, or if that was already there and you amended it. Now that there's a separate article for <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Volcanoes_5782.html" title="Cascade Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanoes</a> it would confuse the Yankees a lot less if there were no such listing on the Cascade Range page - as edits will re-surface trying to retitle these as part of the Cascade Range, <i>which they're not</i>, not even "sometimes" (except in error, usually from stateside). They also throw around the term "High Cascades" freely - 'cause it sounds cool - but <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpireguy_272b.html" title="User:Spireguy">User:Spireguy</a> can tell ya, and it was in the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> text somewhere if it's not still, that the High Cascades as a term refers to the big free-standing summits from Rainier southwards, and is exclusive of the North Cascades, which are a separate region....interestingly, apparently people around the North Cascades are known to refer to them as the Canadian Cascades, a rare example of reverse linguistic imperialism; I added Slesse to the North/Canadian Cascades region listing, but don't know which others are in the same boat; I think there's some in Cathedral Park but I don't know the geology well. If you have some geologic information on Slesse, by the way, could you flesh out that article some: <a href="../../../s/l/e/Slesse_Mountain_6d6a.html" title="Slesse Mountain">Slesse Mountain</a>. It's one of the first ones I'll add a pic to if/when <a href="http://www.telemark.net/~randallg/photos/" class="external text" title="http://www.telemark.net/~randallg/photos/" rel="nofollow">Randall and Kat's Flying Photos</a> say "yes" (my uncle was on the flight....). And anyway, about the Cascade Range stuff, please be careful with edits there, and watch out for "APOV" (American Point of View); they have a way of fudging things they don't know and qualifying misconceptions with "sometimes called" or "often called" etc<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, at Lillooet the big peak just south of town, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Brew_d638.html" title="Mount Brew">Mount Brew</a>, I've heard is a volcano but don't know the details; ever heard of this?

<p>The longer that list of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Volcanoes_5782.html" title="Cascade Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanoes</a> goes on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> the more likely it is that one of the Americans is going to rewrite that the Cascade Volcanoes are all part of that range; especially when obscurities like the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge_River_Cones_cb23.html" title="Bridge River Cones">Bridge River Cones</a> (near and dear to my heart and I've always wanted to see/visit them - according to something John Baldwin told me but didn't put in print, there's hotsprings up there somewhere too, around the eastern rim of the Lillooet Icecap - but I've been adamant about not allowing Americans' fuzzy geography redefine British Columbia geography with vagaries like "sometimes this, sometimes that". So what I'm suggesting is that the entire list you're building on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> gets migrated to where it belongs - <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Volcanoes_5782.html" title="Cascade Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanoes</a> - and that that entire section on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> doesn't even mention any of those peaks by name, but only a statement that the two definitions are <i>very</i> different and that for a listing of all peaks of the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Volcanoes_5782.html" title="Cascade Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanoes</a> to see that article (instead). For one thing, totting up volcanoes only on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascade_Range_2f79.html" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> means a lot of non-volcanic peaks in the North and High Cascades aren't getting the mention they deserve (Luna, Shuksan, even Cheam and Isolillock (Holy Cross) and Hozameen/Hozomeen. So please just cut-move-paste the whole section over to the Cascade Volcanoes article, and put a sentence-link to it; the Cascade Range article is too volcano-heavy already....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 14:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just checked the lat-long you gave for the Bridge River Cones; it's in the Gunn Valley to the west of Lower Taseko Lake, near Yohetta Valley - north of the Tchaikazan. <i>That</i> location, if it's correct, is in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilcotin_Ranges_304e.html" title="Chilcotin Ranges">Chilcotin Ranges</a> (which may or may not be a subset of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ranges_3d75.html" title="Pacific Ranges">Pacific Ranges</a> depending on who you're talking to). Can you located them more precisely; the boundary between the Pacific Ranges and Chilcotin Ranges isn't exact in Holland, and I'll have to refer to them somewhere; the crest of the Coast Mountains in that area is definitely Pacific Ranges; where the "fall-off" is I'll have to read Holland again to find out; if the Cones were in the upper Bridge River itself they might be considered Pacific Ranges; although the north bank of that river is part of the Chilcotin Ranges (because the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dickson_Range_ee57.html" title="Dickson Range">Dickson Range</a> is); I'd say the boundary - maybe - is the pass between the Lord and Bridge Rivers on the ENE side of the Lillooet Icecap - 50°56'11"-123°31'57" , although NW from there sort of NW across the Lord, Falls and Tchaikazan Rivers; Mount Monmouth is definitely in the Pacific Ranges, to the west of that line...; anything north of the Yohetta Valley, or the lower Tchaikazan, as your current Bridge River Cones location is, is in the Chilcotin Ranges for sure.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 14:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure, but I think Fire Mountain, NE of Port Douglas (head of Harrison Lake), may be a volcano; the creek to the south of it is also Fire Creek; there are hotsprings in Sloquet Creek, the next valley south from Fire Creek, and also at Tipella City (near Port Douglas; just townsite/real estate promo that never went anywhere); and some of the peaks south of it are named Ember, Ash, Flame, Spark, Flue etc - all on the massif south of Fire Creek, and north of Sloquet.

It does in no way resemble a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_Mountain_2e7e.html" title="Table Mountain">Table Mountain</a>, it's just a simple "pile of rocks" with an ordinary summit.

<p>Hi Black Tusk, I saw you added an infobox to Herðubreið, but you rounded the elevation of the mountain. Rounding 1682 m to 1500 m is quite a significant difference. I fixed it, but please try to preserve the actual heights when you add infoboxes to mountains in the future.

<p>Hi Black Tusk,</p>
<p>I appreciate all of your extensive efforts on volcano related pages, especially the under-appreciated volcanoes of BC. I've visited/climbed/skied several of the BC volcanoes (even in northwestern BC), along with many more down in the States, so it's nice to see that other people are interested in them too. I've posted a lengthy message on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Talk%7ECascade_Volcanic_Belt_6b1e.html" title="Talk:Cascade Volcanic Belt">Talk:Cascade Volcanic Belt</a> about the proper name for that article, and the Cascade volcanoes as a whole. I'd appreciate your comments.</p>
<p>On a second point, I noticed that you had added Cascade volcanoes categories to several volcanoes in the Fort Rock basin in Oregon (Fort Rock, Big Hole, Hole-in-the-Ground). However, these volcanoes are the result of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin_and_Range_9cea.html" title="Basin and Range">Basin and Range</a> crustal extension, not Cascadia subduction, so I hope you don't mind if I change the categories.</p>
<p>Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> 21:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; thought you might like to know I found these in a BC Basemap search while looking for stuff to do with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Allan__Volcanic__Brown_0512.html" title="Robert Allan &quot;Volcanic&quot; Brown">Robert Allan "Volcanic" Brown</a>, who has nothing to do with volcanoes (his nickname was because of his personality). They're off Rugged Point, the southern apex of <a href="../../../k/y/u/Kyuquot_Sound_cea5.html" title="Kyuquot Sound">Kyuquot Sound</a>. I know there's a coastal cone in that area, around Nootka Sound, so thought maybe these are actually volcanic; whatever other reason for their name I don't know; perhaps it's in maritime history records?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Black Tusk, I think that <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanoes_of_Indonesia_dae3.html" title="Volcanoes of Indonesia">Volcanoes of Indonesia</a> should probably be merged into (and then changed to a redirect to) <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_volcanoes_in_Indonesia_8f65.html" title="List of volcanoes in Indonesia">List of volcanoes in Indonesia</a>, which is a featured article that already contains far more info. Actually, "Volcanoes of Indonesia" would be a much better name for that article, but making that change is a little more complicated and would require the assistance of an admin. If you don't object, I'll go ahead and do this merge/redirect within the next few days. Or feel free to do it if you agree.
