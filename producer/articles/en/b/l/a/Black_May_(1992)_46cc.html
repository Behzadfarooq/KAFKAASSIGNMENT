<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_23.html" title="February 23">23 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Army Commander <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suchinda_Kraprayoon_4a97.html" title="Suchinda Kraprayoon">Suchinda Kraprayoon</a> overthrew the government of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatichai_Choonhavan_9bc9.html" title="Chatichai Choonhavan">Chatichai Choonhavan</a>. The coup-makers, who called themselves the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Peace-Keeping_Council_f253.html" title="National Peace-Keeping Council">National Peace-Keeping Council</a> (NPKC), appointed <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anand_Panyarachun_47f1.html" title="Anand Panyarachun">Anand Panyarachun</a> as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Thailand_31b2.html" title="Prime Minister of Thailand">Prime Minister</a>. Anand's interim government promulgated a new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Thailand_1e58.html" title="Constitution of Thailand">constitution</a> and scheduled <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assembly_of_Thailand_8514.html" title="National Assembly of Thailand">parliamentary</a> elections for 22 March 1992.</p>
<p>A government coalition with 55% of the lower house was formed, which appointed General Suchinda as Prime Minister. Massive public protests immediately followed. On 9 May, Suchinda responded by saying that he would support a constitutional amendment making individuals who had not been elected to Parliament ineligible for the Premiership. Tensions dissipated.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_May_%281992%29_46cc.html" title="Edit section: Popular protests">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Popular protests</span></h2>
<p>The truce was short-lived. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">17 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> the two leading government parties announced that, while they supported the constitutional amendment, they also favored transitional clauses that would permit Suchinda to serve as prime minister for the life of the current Parliament. By that evening, 200,000 demonstrators filled <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanam_Luang_a384.html" title="Sanam Luang">Sanam Luang</a> to call for Suchinda to resign. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamlong_Srimuang_335d.html" title="Chamlong Srimuang">Chamlong Srimuang</a> led the protestors on a 2 KM march to Government House. As they reached the intersection of Rachadamnoen and Rachadamnoen Nok Avenues, they were halted at Phan Fa Bridge, which had been barricaded with razor wire by the police. After negotiations failed, some protestors stampeded and broke through the barricade. The police retaliated with water cannons and clubs after protestors tried to commandeer one of the fire trucks. Stones and molotov cocktails were soon flying. Chamlong used a loudspeaker to exhort the marchers not to attack the police, but his words were lost in the unrest.</p>
<p>Over the next several hours, hundreds of troops arrived to quell the protest. Just after midnight, Suchinda declared a State of Emergency, making gatherings of more than ten people illegal. Chamlong remained near Phan Fa Bridge and the nearby <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_Monument_%28Bangkok%29_0391.html" title="Democracy Monument (Bangkok)">Democracy Monument</a>. Around 4:00 a.m., soldiers threatened the nearly 40,000 protesters by firing <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_rifle.html" title="M16 rifle">M16 rifles</a>. An hour and a half later, they began firing again. By the morning, the army moved more troops in, and crowds grew even larger at other sections of the city.</p>
<p>Early on the afternoon of 18 May, Suchinda publicly accused Chamlong of fomenting violence and defended the government’s use of force. Shortly later, troops, firing continuously in the air, moved in on the crowd surrounding Chamlong. The troops handcuffed and arrested Chamlong.</p>
<p>The crowds did not disperse, and the violence escalated. After government troops had secured the area around Phan Fa Bridge and the Democracy Monument, protests shifted to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramkhamhaeng_University_6f27.html" title="Ramkhamhaeng University">Ramkhamhaeng University</a> across the city. By the evening of 19 May, some fifty thousand people had gathered there.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a>, Princess <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirindhorn.html" title="Sirindhorn">Sirindhorn</a> addressed the country on television, calling for a stop to the unrest. Her appeal was rebroadcast throughout the day. In the evening, her brother, Crown Prince <a href="../../../v/a/j/Vajiralongkorn.html" title="Vajiralongkorn">Vajiralongkorn</a>, broadcast a similar public appeal. Then at 9:30 pm, a television broadcast of King <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhumibol_Adulyadej_1c5d.html" title="Bhumibol Adulyadej">Bhumibol Adulyadej</a>, Suchinda, and Chamlong was shown, in which the King demanded that the two put an end to their confrontation and work together through parliamentary processes. Following the broadcast, Suchinda released Chamlong and announced an amnesty for protestors. He also agreed to support an amendment requiring the prime minister to be elected. Chamlong asked the demonstrators to disperse, which they did. On 24 May 1992, Suchinda resigned.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that although Suchinda had clearly said he would order the forces to shoot should the planned demonstration go forth on the 17th, the king did not do anything to prevent the bloodbath but only acted <i>after</i> more than fifty of his subjects had been killed and several hundreds wounded.</p>

<p>The front page of the <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Herald_Tribune_e6b0.html" title="International Herald Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>'</i>s 20 May 1992 issue was blacked out, as was an editorial of the <i><a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok_Post_ab67.html" title="Bangkok Post">Bangkok Post</a></i> of the same date. Three other newspapers were shut down on May 21.</p>

<p>The violence resulted in 52 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and many disappearences. Over 3,500 people were arrested; hundreds of them were women and children. Many arrested were tortured; some were beaten, left to sit in sweltering sunlight, soaked in gasoline and threatened with immolation, and left to starve.</p>
<p>A House of Representatives Special Committee and a Fact-Finding Committee led by Sophon Rattanakorn shared the same conclusion: the government of General Suchinda used excessive force to crack down on the rally. Some facts from the investigation, such as names of military officers and military units responsible for rounding up, killing, and torturing of protesters were revealed to the public. It is believed that these facts were recorded on the report of the Defense Ministry's Fact Finding Committee led by General Pichit Kullawanit, and are kept secret to this day from the Thai public.</p>
<p>The military constitution of 1992 remained in place until 1997, when a replacement was drafted and promulgated.</p>
<p>Chamlong later apologized for his role in the events: "I wanted a peaceful rally," he said afterwards. "I can’t deny some responsibility for the damage and loss of life. I feel deeply sorry for those families whose members were killed in the incident, for those people who were injured and their families." Nevertheless, he noted that "we were right in what we have done." He later retired from politics.</p>
<p>Suchinda was later appointed Chairman of Telecom Asia (today known as True), a company which received a concession to install 2 million telephone lines in Bangkok during the Anand government.</p>
<p>Anand became Chairman of Saha-Union Group, which had received an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Power_Producer_8b99.html" title="Independent Power Producer">Independent Power Producer</a> concession during his government.</p>
