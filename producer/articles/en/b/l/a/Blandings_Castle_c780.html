<p>Blandings Castle, lying in the picturesque <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale.html" title="Vale">Vale</a> of Blandings, <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, is two miles from the town of <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html#Market_Blandings" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">Market Blandings</a>, home to at least nine pubs, most notably the <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html#The_Emsworth_Arms" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">Emsworth Arms</a>.</p>
<p>The tiny hamlet of <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html#Blandings_Parva" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">Blandings Parva</a> lies directly outside the castle gates and the town of <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html#Much_Matchingham" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">Much Matchingham</a>, home to <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html#Matchingham_Hall" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">Matchingham Hall</a>, the residence of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Gregory_Parsloe-Parsloe_41b9.html" title="Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe">Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe</a>, is also nearby.</p>
<p>The castle is a noble pile, of Early <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_architecture.html" title="Tudor architecture">Tudor</a> building ("its history is recorded in England's history books and <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eug%C3%A8ne_Viollet-le-Duc_9817.html" title="Eugène Viollet-le-Duc">Viollet-le-Duc</a> has written of its architecture", according to <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Fresh_a2e4.html" title="Something Fresh">Something Fresh</a></i>). One of England's largest <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stately_home.html" title="Stately home">stately homes</a>, it dominates the surrounding country, standing on a knoll of rising ground at the southern end of the celebrated Vale of Blandings; the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severn.html" title="Severn">Severn</a> gleams in the distance. From its noble battlements, the <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrekin.html" title="Wrekin">Wrekin</a> can be seen.</p>
<p>The famous moss-carpeted Yew Alley (subject to the devious gravelling schemes of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html#Angus_McAllister" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">Angus McAllister</a>) leads to a small wood with a rough gamekeeper's cottage, which <a href="../../../p/s/m/Psmith.html" title="Psmith">Psmith</a> made use of, not to write poetry as he at first claimed, but to stash stolen jewellery. Another gamekeeper's cottage, in the West Wood, makes a pleasant home for the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_of_Blandings_0ddf.html" title="Empress of Blandings">Empress of Blandings</a> for a spell. The rose garden is another famous beauty spot, ideal for courting lovers. There is a lake, where Lord Emsworth often takes a brisk swim in the mornings.</p>
<p>The house has numerous guest rooms, many of which haven't been used since <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a> roamed the country. Of those still in use, the Garden Room is the finest, usually given to the most prestigious guest; it has a balcony outside its French windows, which can be easily accessed via a handy drainpipe.</p>
<p>The main <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a> has a smaller library leading off it, and windows overlooking some flowerbeds; it is here that Lord Emsworth is often to be found on wet days, his nose deep in an improving tome of country lore, his favourite being <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html#Augustus_Whiffle" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">Whiffle</a> on <i>The Care of the Pig</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blandings_Castle_c780.html" title="Edit section: Possible locations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Possible locations</span></h3>
<p>There have been a number of attempts to locate and identify the possible locations of Blandings. Norman Murphy, in "In Search of Blandings", looked at a whole range of criteria based around architecture and landscape features. His main suggestions were <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudeley_Castle_e34a.html" title="Sudeley Castle">Sudeley Castle</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> for the castle itself, and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston_Park_30a2.html" title="Weston Park">Weston Park</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> for the gardens. Richard Usborne, in the appendix to the unfinished <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_at_Blandings_bd13.html" title="Sunset at Blandings">Sunset at Blandings</a>, regarded the issue from the point of view of train journeys and travel times.</p>
<p>The most recent work was carried out by two researchers in the Department of Geography and Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_London_3428.html" title="University College London">University College London</a>, Dr Daryl Lloyd and Mr Ian Greatbatch. They made use of a <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographic_Information_System_1b56.html" title="Geographic Information System">Geographic Information System</a> to analyse a set of geographical criteria, such as a <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewshed.html" title="Viewshed">viewshed</a> analysis of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wrekin_a130.html" title="The Wrekin">The Wrekin</a> and drive time from <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>. Their final conclusion was that Apley Hall, <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> was the best suited location for fulfilling the geographical criteria.<a href="http://wodehouse.ru/dt050903.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://wodehouse.ru/dt050903.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>The master of Blandings is, nominally at least, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Emsworth_d2e1.html" title="Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a>. Clarence, the ninth Earl, is an amiably absent-minded old chap, who loves his home and gardens dearly and is never happier than when pottering about the grounds on a fine sunny day, poking at flower beds or inspecting his champion pig, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_of_Blandings_0ddf.html" title="Empress of Blandings">Empress of Blandings</a>.</p>
<p>Lord Emsworth's nine sisters, his brother <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galahad_Threepwood_0338.html" title="Galahad Threepwood">Galahad</a> ("Gally"), his daughter <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html#Lady_Mildred_Mant" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">Mildred</a>, his sons <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Threepwood_9333.html" title="Freddie Threepwood">Freddie</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html#George_Threepwood.2C_Lord_Bosham" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">George</a>, and his numerous nieces, nephews, and in-laws inhabit the castle from time to time. For the Threepwood family, and their friends, the castle is forever available for indefinite residence, and is occasionally used as a temporary prison—known as "<a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Island_7af8.html" title="Devil's Island">Devil's Island</a>" or "The <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastille.html" title="Bastille">Bastille</a>"—for love-struck young men and ladies to calm down.</p>
<p>Emsworth's sister <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html#Lady_Ann_Warblington" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">Ann</a> plays the role of <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2telain.html" title="Châtelain">châtelaine</a> when we first visit the Castle, in <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Fresh_a2e4.html" title="Something Fresh">Something Fresh</a></i>.

<p>Another sister of Emsworth is Lady Julia Fish, ("The iron hand beneath the leather glove") whose son Ronald Fish ("Ronnie") marries a chorus girl called Sue Brown, who by the way is the daughter of the only woman whom Gally ever loved—Dolly Henderson.</p>
