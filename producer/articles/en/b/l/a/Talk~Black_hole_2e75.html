<p>How is it that "observable" emissions from black holes (ultraviolet rays, etc) are even observable in the first place? All frequencies of radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum travel at the same speed: the speed of light. If light (I'm assuming visible light) cannot escape, how can X-rays?

<dd>It's not stupid. Certainly, we couldn't colonize a black hole in the sense of "landing on it". However, it <i>would</i> be possible (theoretically) to put a space station in orbit around a black hole, or even build some large structure (a ring or a sphere, for example) around (but outside of) the black hole. The reason for doing this is that spinning black holes could actually serve as energy sources. There is something called an <a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergosphere.html" title="Ergosphere">ergosphere</a> around a spinning black hole, outside of its event horizon. It is theoretically possible to throw something into the ergosphere and get back something with higher energy. The practical details of how to do all this are -- of course -- well beyond our current abilities. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMOBle_a932.html" title="User:MOBle">MOBle</a> 19:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to go back to this old chestnut, as it seems to have been siezed upon by an editor with lots of "interesting" ideas. But i have come across this problem before, and never had it satisfactorily debunked. I'm going to phrase it carefully: <b>Given an arbitrarily long but finite amount of time (distant observer's local time) will a distant observer ever see a star become a black hole</b>. Time dilation during gravitational collapse suggests not.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMongreilf_a72d.html" title="User:Mongreilf">Mongreilf</a> 14:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Define "see".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with question is that -- strictly speaking -- we cannot know whether or not something is a black hole until the infinitely far in the future. (See Hawking &amp; Ellis' <i>The large-scale structure of spacetime</i>, or Thorne's <i>Black Holes and Time Warps</i>.) A black hole is <b>defined</b> as a region from which nothing can <b>ever</b> escape. We can't know if anything ever escapes until we know everything that ever happens. In this sense: no, we can never "see" a black hole form.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, Physics is more or less the science of predicting what will happen, given some knowledge of the present state of the Universe. In this case, we measure a certain amount of mass (for instance, by watching stars in orbit around the mass), and the size of the space it fills up. If it is smaller than a certain size, General Relativity predicts that nothing will ever escape. In this sense, we can deduce that a black hole exists. Any time astronomers talk about "seeing" a black hole, this is basically what they mean. (Of course, General Relativity might actually be wrong...)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I think this is sufficiently well explained in the Evidence section. On the other hand, I'm not the target audience.

<dd>(Well, that's not really the definition of a black hole, but...) Okay, so now we can ask if it is ever possible to see something go so dim that it stops emitting anything -- like a photon. Presumably, if it ever does grow so dim, there is some last photon emitted. How can we possibly decide if we've seen the last photon? I maintain that we can't, unless we know everything that will ever happen, or use Physics to predict everything that will ever happen. This is the same answer as above.</dd>

<dd>yes, fair enough about the last photon, but presumably we are able to model and extrapolate a decline in photons and use a lack of photons received as statistical evidence that such a model is good. very little science is based on "total information". also i must be very old school, i thought escape velocity &gt; light speed was one of the definitions of a black hole.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMongreilf_a72d.html" title="User:Mongreilf">Mongreilf</a> 12:21, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the "model", this is just what I mean by "use Physics to predict everything that will ever happen". I agree that very little science is based on "total information", but this is precisely the unusual feature of the definition of a <b>black hole</b>; it is both a strength (in the sense that it allows us to prove interesting mathematical theorems and a weakness (in the sense that it requires a knowledge of the future of the Universe). If I recall correctly, Hawking's decision to use this "teleological" definition is insightfully narrated in Thorne's book.</dd>

<dd>The currently accepted definition is this one that basically involves an (absolute) <b>event horizon</b>. The original notion did use the somewhat weaker <b>apparent horizon</b>, which sort of boils down to "escape velocity" &gt; speed of light. This is also the heuristic definition, but it is not exactly correct. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMOBle_a932.html" title="User:MOBle">MOBle</a> 22:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the main page about black holes at the beginning where it mentions the masses expected for black holes, it has been suggested in J-P Luminent's "Black Holes" (Cambridge press, (c)1992)(its an older book but its points are still valid), that it is possible to have a black hole of any mass if its contents are compressed sufficiently. In the book he mentions that a black hole could form when a mass the size of a mountain, is compressed down to a small Tv, which is significantly less massive than the mentioned sizes predicted on the main page. Additionally, the next generation of particle accelerators are predicted that they may even be able to create micro miniature black holes with lifetimes in tiny fractions of seconds, as was suggested by a fairly recent poplar science article.

<dd>It is true that a black hole could have (basically) any mass. Rock weighs about 2700 kilograms per cubic meter. I guesstimate that a mountain might weigh 10<sup>13</sup>&#160;kg. In <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometrized_units.html" title="Geometrized units">geometrized units</a>, this is 10<sup>-14</sup>&#160;meters.

That's a pretty small TV. Conclusion: Luminent was either wrong or talking about something else. One way to find out is to look for another source.

<p>I'm not a big fan of this addition. I think the existing article is very clear, and certainly understandable by anyone with a middle-school education.

<dd>The concept is not necessarily clear to such people; this addition was prompted by queries which made that clear. Reading the article, it explains in scientific terms that a bblack hole is "an object with a gravitational field so strong that nothing can escape it", and covers the history and formation and evidence for/of them. But it doesn't describe, in laymans intuitive terms, what a black hole actually is. That's a common problem with some types of articles. It's easy to assume knowledge and background that many readers don't have. A summary overview that explains a scientific concept in lay-terms is often very beneficial as a sort of orienting overview of counter-intuitive concepts such as a mass collapsing into a zero (as opposed to small) space (singularity), and placing that in the context of "normal" matter. A student or lay-person with little physics knowledge can read the two paragraph overview and gain a fairly accurate understanding of the field, including enough understanding to make sense of (or discuss) other aspects of the topic. Some touching up might not hurt but the basic idea is valuable. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 03:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Black Hole Theories:</p>
<p>For all my adult life I have wondered if our understanding of Black Holes have been flawed. It is taught in grade school and even our colleges around the world that Black Holes destroy everything in there paths, this belief is from only looking at similar occorances here on earth, such as, Hurricanes &amp; Tornados. While it is a common understanding that these earthly forces do have a path of destruction, does it always mean that all aspects of occurances throughout the universe having the same appearance as those on earth, make them a destructive force?</p>
<p>In science we have been taught to look at all the aspects of what is not understood so that we can conclude a new understanding. So, how about this aspect of Black Holes, Life Builder.</p>
<p>As we look into the the heavens and admire the shear beauty of the universe we find one specific denominator, what is it? Well, it's not the darkness. It's not the great number of lights. It's not the shear number of galaxies or planets that inhabit the galaxies. Actually it is one thing that 99.99% of all human see everytime that we see the moon in the night sky or pictures of our beautiful planet that we call home. The one common denominator is in fact that not only as with the earth and the moon, every planet that we see in pictures are "ROUND" not square or mashed together but "ROUND".</p>
<p>We have been taught that matter and light do not escape the gravitational forces of a Black Hole and that once caught in the clutches of the event horizon, all life as we know it is doomed for destruction and out of existance. It is my belief that this teaching and understanding is flawed.</p>
<p>As with the mining of minerals from beneath the surface of our planet earth and mingling it with fire and other minerals transforms Iron Ore into steel, it would not be far fecthed to believe that Black Holes do the same thing and with the same type of results with the creation of life in the form of "ROUND" Planets.</p>
<p>If we look at the event horizon of a Black Hole we would notice not only light but also debris in the form of astroids and whatever else was caught up in the outer bands of this massive looking storm. With all these particles being directed to the center of the Black Hole, this debris would be compressed into a molten ball eventually being redeposited into the vastness of space. Towards the end of the life of the Black Hole and one the deposits of debris begin to run out, this may very well be where each Solar System is born into existance with a new sun. As with our own Sun, we do know that it has a strong gravitation pull on all the planets that surround it along with debris fields known as the Milkey Way, revolve around that center focus.</p>
<p>I pose this one Question: Could it be that our Sun as we know it, is the actual reminants of a Black Hole, burning off the last remaining particles of light and debris resulting in the heat and light that nurtures the life on the surface of our planet that we call home?

<dd>To answer your questions briefly (a more detailed answer might be obtained by asking on the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Science_39ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science">Wikipedia science reference desk</a>:
<ol>
<li>The sense in which black holes "destroy" everything is, that an object which gets too close to one, will be unable to escape, and will ultimately suffer destruction molecule by molecule through <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaghettification.html" title="Spaghettification">spaghettification</a>, due to the extreme forces of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> operating within a black hole. That should count as "destruction" in any book, at least as far as those living where it came from are concerned. See the Simple Overview section of this article for more.</li>
<li>The description is nothing to do with earthly weather, and everything to do with what happens when you put a finite mass in a relatively tiny amount of space until it collapses under the force of gravity, and then travel too close to it.</li>
<li>Whilst it is possible that in some ways black holes build and create "life", in whatever form that might mean, we have no evidence of it now. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball_01e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a crystal ball">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, and we do not put ideas in here that aren't <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiable</a> (or at least whose credible and noteworthy proposal is verifiable) in the real world somehow. This is (at the moment at least) just speculation, and we don't put our own ideas in Wikipedia, however attracted we might feel towards them, but only things which seem to have some kind of notable support or the like.</li>
<li>The reason things are (roughly) round is similar to the reason that the oceans and your glass of water are (roughly) flat. There's no great mystery to it. Gravity attracts matter equally in all directions, and the shape which a centrally directed and rotationally symmetrical force tends to create is a sphere (in 3 dimensions) or a circle (in two).</li>
<li>Your belief may well be interesting for you. But it wouldn't get into encyclopedia brittanica or any other encyclopedia, because it isn't shared by those who have experience of such things. You might find this page <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> on personal views and beliefs, useful.</li>
<li>A black hole is not going to create a ball of some kind at the centre, molten or otherwise. The centre of a black hole is a point, known as a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity.html" title="Singularity">singularity</a>, and any object sufficiently close to it will be shredded into pieces, then the pieces into atoms, then the atoms into subatomic particles, and into the zero size point that is the singularity. There's no solid object in the middle for planetary formation, the gravitational field would be too strong for that to exist.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> doesn't lie around the sun and isn't a debris field of any kind. In fact the sun is close to the edge, in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy, nothing to do with the centre.</li>
<li>Last question, no it couldnt be. A black hole is simply a black hole, they don't have "remnants" that "burn off last particles". You might be thinking of other forms of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">star</a>, but a black hole is not that. It isn't "burning" anything. It's collapsing into zero space, due to the incredibly high gravitational field it creates in its immediate vicinity.</li>

<p>The section <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html#Event_horizon" title="Black hole">Event horizon</a> is incorrect. It states that nothing can escape a black hole because the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. This is an old, incorrect, non-relativistic explanation of a black hole. The real reason that nothing can escape a black hole is that space-time is curved due to gravity and only an inward direction remains.

<dd>I've looked into it, and find it very hard to find a short, satisfying explanation why nothing can escape from inside the event horizon. It is because light cones are rotated which, ultimately, is caused by the gravitational field. You can find this in any textbook on GR that treats black holes. The problem is that there's a whole theory of general relativity between gravitation and the rotation of light cones, which is, off course, too much for an encyclopedia. So I suppose it is a bit to straightforward to say that nothing can escape from within the event horizon because space-time is curved.</dd>

<dd>I think that the energy driving the jets is coming from the accretion disc rather than the black hole itself. I am just guessing, but I think that the gravitational energy of infalling material is converted to kinetic energy in the disc and then a small part of it goes to heat due to friction and then it shoots out sideways in the jets because it cannot go back out via the equator which is full of accreting stuff. The plasma in the disc captures and amplifies ambient magnetic fields as it spins and they force the escaping particles into a narrow beam. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 04:51, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I heard that if the sun were to be a black hole of the same mass, nothing would happen to the planets, they won't "fall" in the black hole. However, the gravity of the black hole is so powerful that things within the black hole's horizon have no hope of coming back. So, if the sun were to be a black hole, where its horizon would be located and why planets would not "fall" in the black hole despite its overwhelming gravitational force? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.201.98.14_15f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.201.98.14">24.201.98.14</a> (talk) 17:27, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>The strength of the gravitational field of an object is determined by its mass. If the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, its gravitational field (outside of the Sun's radius) would be the same as it is now. As Newton discovered (and is still true in Einstein's theory), the gravitational force outside a spherical shell is the same as if its mass were all concentrated at the center, whereas inside the spherical shell the gravitational force is zero. Therefor, at any place inside the Sun, the Sun's gravitational force is the same as if it were being generated by the ball of solar material inside that radius, crushed to a point at the center. So (making the very crude approximation that the Sun's density is constant), the Sun's gravitational force is proportional to the distance from the center (Mass/radius<sup>2</sup> is proportional to radius). For a black hole the entire mass is crushed to the center, so its gravitational force keeps increasing as you get closer. The black hole's <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_radius.html" title="Schwarzschild radius">Schwarzschild radius</a> (where the event horizon is) would be about 3km (2 miles) - much less than the Sun's radius. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing, thinking about general astro physics, not only black holes by themselves, is that so much energy is released if the sun collapsed to a black hole, it would be a supernova.

<p>Theoretical physics is a really tough subject for an encyclopedia, since readers can range from 12-year-olds (or younger) to physics undergraduates (not to mention science fiction enthusiasts or would-be writers looking for background). I don't see how a single presentation of a subject like black holes can meet the needs of audiences at both ends of the range.</p>
<p>So I suggest the article should be restructured into 2 major sections, or possibly separate but linked articles, one "popular" and one "technical".</p>
<p>The popular section / article would contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-technical definition. It would still have to mention <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> in order to explain why a spaceship can't escape, because a Newtonian explanation only explains why unpowered objects and particles can't escape.</li>
<li>Anatomy of a black hole: singularity, event horizon, ergosphere (if the hole spins fast), etc.</li>
<li>Formation of black holes.</li>
<li>Evaporation of black holes via Hawking radiation.</li>
<li>Black holes at the centers of galaxies.</li>
<li>Black holes and earth (as at present).</li>
<li>Link to <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a> with brief note.</li>
<li>Black holes in fiction. BTW at the time of writing I can't find in this article a link to a separate article "Black holes in fiction", as discussed above.</li>
<li>Link to "Alternative theories" section of the "technical" page / section, plus very brief description (more of a note).</li>
</ul>
<p>"Technical" page / section: all the other content.</p>
<p>I would prefer separate pages, since that both articles would still be pretty long. I think the "popular" page should be the main entry, since more readers of Wikipedia are likely to be non-technical, but the "popular" page should have a link to the "technical" page at the top and in "see also".</p>
<p>The "popular" page would have to be checked by a competent physicist (I'm not even an incompetent physicist) to ensure that it contains no more distortions than those that are inevitable when describing a highly mathematical subject in plain English. Then it might be a good idea to lock it, to prevent editing without competent supervision. I think the "technical" page should remain open, sop that new theories and discoveris can be incorporated.</p>
<p>Question: May, Moore &amp; Lintott's book "Bang!" says (p 77 in UK edition) that the orbit of a star labeled S21 proves there's a large black hole at the centre of the Milky Way - the orbit's minimum radius is 17 light-hours so that limits the radius of the central body, the orbital period is 15.2 years and that determines the mass of the central body, and the central body's mass and maximum radius mean it has to be a black hole (discounting the exotic alternatives to black holes). Can anyone find an academic reference which describe this analysis? I've googled and found nothing.</p>

<p>I've always found black holes rather novel. Since I'm not (yet) educated in astronomy or even really basic physics, my speculations are anecdotal and not based on any real science. Still, I always thought it would be fun if the "pre-big bang" pinhead-sized universe was the other end of the event horizon of a black hole in some other universe in the big multiverse.</p>
<p>It would be novel and cool, and if <b>I've</b> considered it, then it must have been considered by a million other people, and has been disproved (or at least discussed). Does anyone have any information about that?</p>

<li>FWIW, the Universe probably does not exist before the Big Bang (of course, our knowledge of the first <span class="texhtml">10 <sup>− 43</sup></span> seconds is non-existent. and probably shaky until <span class="texhtml">10 <sup>− 10</sup></span> seconds or something - I'd have to ask a cosmologist.</li>

<dd>In string theory there is a theoretical proof that if the universe (or just one dimension of the universe) were crushed rather than expanded in the Big Bang, the particle-particle interactions would be the same as if it had actually expanded. By this theory the universe could be an ever shrinking point, rather than an expanding volume, but we simply can't tell the difference. Or the universe could be a line or a disk. Purely theoretical though, and to my knowledge no one has shown that this theory can be applied to the singularity inside a black hole, although several theorists have postulated on the possible consequences of such. Brian Greene discusses the "sub-plank" universe theory in his book "The Elegant Universe," though he doesn't mention the suggestion of a universe inside a black hole. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy1221_3762.html" title="User:Someguy1221">Someguy1221</a> 14:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The biggest problem is that one can't say much about what a black hole is - our understanding of space-time breaks down inside of the event horizon (which is why the radii of black holes are given in terms of the event horizon and not in terms of what is inside). In fact, due to the cosmic censorship principle, it will be impossible (as far as we know now) to know what's going on inside the black hole.

And can anyone point to a more scientific explanation of the spiral paths? (note to self: <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=662" class="external autonumber" title="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=662" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</p>

<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that much of this is just the result of angular momentum and friction. In an amorphous cloud, you may have net angular momentum (rotation of the cloud), but particles follow all manner of orbits, resulting in a cloud that's a spheroid. Near a black hole, the cloud is dense enough for particles to interact with each other, and the net result of such interactions is for non-average momentum components to be cancelled out (particles moving relative to the average flow feel drag). End result: In the inner disc, all particles have approximately the average angular momentum, and follow approximately circular orbits in the plane of the disc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Within the disc, you have the inner parts orbiting more quickly than the outer parts, due to being deeper in the black hole's potential well. This causes shearing between adjacent streams of orbiting matter. Drag between such streams tends to rob energy from more closely-orbiting (faster-moving) streams and give it to the farther-oribiting streams, causing the innermost layers to spiral further inwards. As there is friction involved, some of the energy winds up as heat, causing net movement of the disc inwards as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have numbers for the density of accretion discs around black holes, but there are many papers about this (search for rapidly-variable x-ray sources, as these are thought to be black hole accretion discs that switch between two different almost-stable modes of operation).</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotating_black_hole.html" title="Rotating black hole">Rotating black hole</a> says that space-time is dragged at the speed of light at the outer boundary of the ergosphere and faster than light within the ergosphere.

Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole," which implies that the ergosphere is entirely outside the event horizon. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any frame-dragging within the event horizon of a rotating black hole?</li>
<li>How does the frame-dragging rate vary with increasing "depth" (a) between the outer boundary of the ergosphere and the event horizon? (b) inside the event horizon?</li>
<li>What happens just outside the outer boundary of the ergosphere?

<p><a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotating_black_hole.html" title="Rotating black hole">Rotating black hole</a> says, "Due to the two event horizons, a rotating black hole is also required to have two photon spheres, an inner and an outer one.

<p>I've completed pass 1 of the edit discussed in Talk item "Possible restructure?" (17 Feb 2007). Please check it for errors, inconsistencies and serious omissions. For comparison, the previous version of the article is at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_hole&amp;diff=113600010&amp;oldid=113059176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_hole&amp;diff=113600010&amp;oldid=113059176" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]</p>
<p>The objectives of the edit were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make as much as possible of the content intelligible to someone who is neither a physicist nor (like me) a long-time fan of "hard" science fiction. I thought the previous version's "Simple overview" was just a summary in almost equally technical language, took most of the concepts for granted and therefore was very unlikely to help a non-specialist reader.</li>
<li>Simplify the language, and reduce the technical terms used to a small and consistent subset, to minimise the reader's learning curve (the old article used a few sets of synonymous or near-synonymous terms).</li>
<li>Improve the structure: reduce the extent to which the same topic was covered in different sections (often quite widely separated); reduce duplication; order the sections in a way that would be most helpful to the non-specialist. In the process I also moved a lot of the images so that they are now aligned with the sections to which they are most relevant.</li>
<li>Keep the parts that are likely to be most interesting for physicists (and extremely hard to explain in fairly simple language, at least for me!).</li>
</ul>
<p>At present I think it may be unnecessary to create separate technical and non-technical articles.</p>
<p>I've left all of the original article in but hidden by HTML comments, in case anyone thinks it necessary to copy and paste parts of it. I know it makes the download too large, but hopefully that can be resolved within a month.</p>
<p>If within the next 2 weeks the edit is not reverted and there are no comments which force me to re-think the whole approach, I'll start researching the questions I've raised in recent Talk posts - but please try to answer them!</p>
<p>The article (old and new versions) needs a lot more citations / references. I'll be searching for these too. Please add any that you know of!</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any better diagrams for the anatomy of black holes, especially rotating?

<dd>Here are some general comments on the article:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies" section has some severe problems. First of all, the section is incredibly timid. As it currently stands, the section suggests that <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sag_A__6c94.html" title="Sag A*">Sag A*</a> is the only well-studied supermassive black hole and that black hole candidates have only been found in a few other galaxies. This simply gives the wrong impression of current astronomical research. Many <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_galaxies.html" title="Active galaxies">active galaxies</a> (including all <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seyfert_galaxies.html" title="Seyfert galaxies">Seyfert galaxies</a>, all <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_galaxies.html" title="Radio galaxies">radio galaxies</a>, all <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasar.html" title="Quasar">quasars</a>, many <a href="../../../l/i/n/LINER_2af8.html" title="LINER">LINERs</a>, and many <a href="../../../u/l/i/ULIRG_980f.html" title="ULIRG">ULIRGs</a>) potentially contain black holes. Although no one has conclusively demonstrated that the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_galactic_nuclei.html" title="Active galactic nuclei">active galactic nuclei</a> contain black holes, that is the general premise adopted by extragalactic astronomers. Moreover, the page never even uses the term "<a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_galactic_nucleus.html" title="Active galactic nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>", which is embarassing. Furthermore, the section needs to communicate that the masses of many (potential) black holes have been measured in many nearby galaxies, including many otherwise-normal galaxies (see <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_4594_2968.html" title="NGC 4594">NGC 4594</a>, for example). This section needs significant revision.</dd>

I agree this section should link to <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_galactic_nucleus.html" title="Active galactic nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>, and will fix this a.s.a.p.<br />
I'm less sure about adding more info, as I think the "Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies" section has enough to tell the non-specialist reader that the evidence is strong to overwhelming and, as your next comment says, the length of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black hole</a> is a concern.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 22:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, I also think that the entire article is too long at the moment. Much of the material should be summarized on this page and discussed more in depth on other pages. For example, the discussion on "Entropy and Hawking radiation" probably belongs on either the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a> page or its own page (Entropy and Hawking radiation).</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a>, I sympathise, but have mixed feelings. Articles which are major entry points to WP tend to be long (e.g. <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>) because they carry the overhead of summarising and linking to related topics. At the same time I understand that no reader wants to plough on forever. This dilemma is one I've seen on WP before: for each major entry point WP needs a plan which defines how much detail goes where. Would you like to refer this question to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Astronomy_3c90.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomy">Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomy</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Astronomical_objects_5ab3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical objects">Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical objects</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Physics_630e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics</a> and get the 3 projects moving towards agreement - I've seen from the Talk pages that you're a regular contributor in these discussions.<br />
Before I started the recent edit, I <a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlack_hole_2e75.html#Possible_restructure.3F" title="Talk:Black hole">suggested</a> that the article needs to be split into 2, "popular" and "technical". What do you think of that idea?<br />
Re "Entropy and Hawking radiation" specifically, I think <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black hole</a> needs to explain Hawking radiation in enough detail for a non-specialist to understand the basic idea and that there are still uncertainties about how or even whether it works, and I have an open (?vacant) mind on how best to achieve that.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 22:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also I've just seen another discussion where an article was turned down for FA status and one of the grounds was excessive dependency on links to other articles - apparently there's an FA guideline that says "the perfect Wikipedia article should be as self-contained as possible ....". That might be a reason for keeping it all together.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 13:00, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

On the other hand if you mean that it's a bit "pop science", I favour including "pop science" because I think WP's objective is / should be to inform and motivate non-specialists (specialists have plenty of channels already), so it needs "Hot topics" (or "cool topics", in other dialects) to appeal to non-specialists and to get search engine hits.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 22:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In terms of splitting the article, I really think that the first step is to move some of the lengthier sections to separate pages rather than to split the page into basic and advanced pages. This article should attempt to give a higher-level summary of the topic; the subpages can be used to discuss the extensive details. Anyhow, that is my opinion.</dd>

<dd>I referred to the "Black holes and Earth" section as flaky because it is based on vague speculation and very improbable events. The chances of any stellar-mass object crossing through the Solar System as described in that section are very close to nil; this is a common galactic dynamics problem that I studied as a graduate student. The particle accelerator section seems to discuss something at great length that the section itself says is improbable. I would guess that the article would be improved by deleting the entire "Black holes and Earth" section altogether. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 22:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No need to apologise for not answering earlier - 5 days is pretty good, and I know you have a day job.</dd>
<dd>Re splitting the article, I admit my own opinions on this keep changing - I originally proposed such a split, then edited the article and thought no split was needed, and now the length is making me favour splitting again. I suppose the criterion should be whether a section can be summarised in a way that is informative enough but still significantly shorter - if "yes", then split it out. My own inclination is to keep the article in one piece until it looks good enough to be stable, then review for splitting - otherwise there's a danger that e.g. a summary will be edited but not the linked detail article.</dd>
<dd>Re flakiness of the "Black holes and Earth" section, I still favour keeping it for the reasons I mentioned earlier, and because dispelling misconceptions is an achievement (John Locke described himself as an "under-labourer" preparing the way for the "master-builders" of science <a href="http://www.philosophypages.com/locke/g00.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.philosophypages.com/locke/g00.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>).

<p>As far as I understand it (?????), the "no hair" theorem implies that black holes have no temperature but the Hawking radiation theory implies that they do. Is there a conflict?<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 10:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "no hair" theorem (NHT) states that a black hole has no other caracteristics beyond its mass, eletric charge and angular momentum. In other words, two black holes that have exactly the same value for these three quantities are completely identical in all respacts, since there are no other caracteristics by which they could be distinguished from each other. The NHT does not prevent these black holes from having a Hawking temperature because their temperature is not an independent quantity. (given the other threee, the temperature can be calculated). <a href="../../../d/a/u/User%7EDauto_b0e7.html" title="User:Dauto">Dauto</a> 20:03, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "History" section says that Oppenheimer &amp; Snyder called black holes "frozen stars" because they thought the event horizon would show a red-shifted image of the star as its surface met the horizon. But the discussion of time dilation in "Falling into a black hole" says time dilation will red-shift the light to zero energy, i.e. there's nothing to see at the horizon. Any explanations?<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 12:40, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I understand, regardless of whether the matter was visible at the horizon, they considered it to be there, justifying the "frozen star" impression. This is mainly an artifact of the coordinate system used (described under <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_metric.html" title="Schwarzschild metric">Schwarzschild metric</a>), as opposed to representing what actually happens to the matter. So, I'm not sure why the two statements are inconsistent. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html#History_of_the_black_hole_concept" title="Black hole">Black_hole#History_of_the_black_hole_concept</a> says, "The mathematics showed that an outside observer would <i>see</i> the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where it crosses that radius." The description of time dilation and gravitational redshift in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html#Before_the_falling_object_crosses_the_event_horizon" title="Black hole">Black_hole#Before_the_falling_object_crosses_the_event_horizon</a> implies that the last light-rays from the collapsing star's surface are redshifted to zero or infinitesimal energy (zero if emitted at the horizon, infinitesmal if emitted just before) and are therefore not observable in practice and possibly not in theory. To me, "frozen in time" suggests the image lasts as long as the black hole. But that would require infinite time dilation, which would imply infinite redshift and therefore the light ray would have zero energy. It sounds like either the article or my mind needs clarification (probably both!).<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 10:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this context, "see" means "detect through some unspecified mechanism". It is not meant to suggest that the infalling matter is still emitting detectable amounts of light.

<dd>Hi, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a>. I think the fundamental problem is that the the "History" section never did have any references / citations which would have allowed either of us to check the actual words (or equations - you appear to be more of a physicist than I am), except for Michell's Newtonian theory.</dd>

<dd>I'm not persuaded by "'see' means 'detect through some unspecified mechanism'" because AFAIK the whole of relativity, starting with special, is based on the idea that the only way of detecting events is via electromagnetic radiation which has a fixed speed. ("Discovering Relativity for Yourself" by Sam Lilley; Cambridge University Press, 1981; ISBN-10: 052129780X).<br />
Can anyone supply references / citations which describes precisely but not too mathematically the reasoning behind the name "frozen star"?.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 22:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The full description, with references, should be at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_metric.html" title="Schwarzschild metric">Schwarzschild metric</a>. In Schwarzschild coordinates, infalling objects appear to approach but never reach the horizon. That is what is meant by "would see (i.e., assess) an object as frozen at (i.e., arbitrarily close to) the horizon". This view of black holes was realized to be incorrect when alternative coordinate systems were proposed that did not have a discontinuity at the event horizon. More detailed discussion should be in the talk archives for this page, as for a while we had people showing up every few months saying "black holes can't exist because of (broken argument involving the event horizon)", which resulted in detailed descriptions of all of these effects being posted. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 22:53, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1930, the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysicist.html" title="Astrophysicist">astrophysicist</a> <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar_5c09.html" title="Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a> argued that, according to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, a non-radiating body above 1.44 solar masses (the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrasekhar_limit.html" title="Chandrasekhar limit">Chandrasekhar limit</a>), would collapse since there nothing known at that time could stop it from doing so. His arguments were opposed by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Eddington_37e8.html" title="Arthur Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a>, who believed that something would inevitably stop the collapse. Eddington was partly right: a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_dwarf.html" title="White dwarf">white dwarf</a> slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutron_star.html" title="Neutron star">neutron star</a>. But in 1939, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Oppenheimer_36b7.html" title="Robert Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> published papers (with various co-authors) which predicted that stars above about three solar masses (the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff_limit_b34c.html" title="Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors used <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_metric.html" title="Schwarzschild metric">Schwarzschild's system of coordinates</a> (the only coordinates available in 1939), which produced <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_singularity.html" title="Mathematical singularity">mathematical singularities</a> at the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_radius.html" title="Schwarzschild radius">Schwarzschild radius</a>, in other words the equations broke down at the Schwarzschild radius because some of the terms were <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity.html" title="Infinity">infinite</a>. This was interpreted as indicating that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped". For a few years the collapsed stars were known as "frozen stars" because the calculations indicated that an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius. But many physicists could not accept the idea of time standing still inside the Schwarzschild radius, and there was little interest in the subject for over 20 years.</p>
<p>In 1958 <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Finkelstein_e1f8.html" title="David Finkelstein">David Finkelstein</a> broke the deadlock over "stopped time" and introduced the concept of the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_horizon.html" title="Event horizon">event horizon</a> by presenting the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddington-Finkelstein_coordinates_badd.html" title="Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates">Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates</a>, which enabled him to show that "The Schwarzchild surface r = 2m is not a singularity but acts as a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it but only in one direction".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Note that at this stage all theories, including Finkelstein's, covered only non-rotating, uncharged black holes.</p>
<p>In 1963 <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Kerr_b440.html" title="Roy Kerr">Roy Kerr</a> extended Finkelstein's analysis by presenting the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerr_metric.html" title="Kerr metric">Kerr metric</a> (coordinates) and showing how this made it possible to predict the properties of <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotating_black_hole.html" title="Rotating black hole">rotating black holes</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In addition to its theoretical interest, Kerr's work made black holes more believable for astronomers, since black holes are formed from stars and all known stars rotate.</p>

<dd>The "History" section is getting too long, but I think the Oppenheimer-Finkelstein-Kerr story is important in order to explain why interest in black holes was near zero until it soared in the early 1960s. Perhaps we need to put most of it in a separate article and just leave a one-sentence-per-item summary in the main <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black hole</a> article.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a>, your comment (22:53, 23 March 2007)appears to confirm that there is a conflict in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black hole</a> article (and in the physics 1939-1958) and to points to the resolution: Oppenheimer &amp; co-authors' use of the Schwarzschild coordinates created a deadlock because it implied a "bubble" of "stopped time", and Finkelstein broke the deadlock. I've found some Web pages that support this interpretation: <a href="http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/astrosoc/articles_blackholes.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/astrosoc/articles_blackholes.shtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> says astrophysicists disagreed over the implications of "frozen star" until "Finkelstein discovers a new reference frame for the Schwarzschild geometry and resolves the Oppenheimer-Snyder paradox";<a href="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/BlackHole.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/BlackHole.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> provides the Finkelstein quote I've used (unfortunately there are signs that <a href="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/BlackHole.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/BlackHole.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> may not suitable for the "links" section of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black hole</a>, see <a href="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/jouref.html#arxivregreq2002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/jouref.html#arxivregreq2002" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>).</dd>
<dd>Can anyone provide evidence of when the <a href="../../../k/r/u/Kruskal_coordinates.html" title="Kruskal coordinates">Kruskal coordinates</a> were first published? I've googled and got nothing.

<dd>Also can anyone provide a reference and summary for the Oppenheimer-Snyder paper. I've picked up the ref for Oppenheimer-Volkov, and that appears only to deal with the gravitational collapse, not with the "stopped time" / "frozen star" issue.

<dd>Your comment also put me on the trail of a few other things that might be worth using in various articles, e.g.: I took my first look at the articles on <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzschild_metric.html" title="Schwarzschild metric">Schwarzschild metric</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddington-Finkelstein_coordinates_badd.html" title="Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates">Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/u/Kruskal_coordinates.html" title="Kruskal coordinates">Kruskal coordinates</a>, which I'd avoided because I'm no mathematician; <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schwp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schwp.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> explains in relatively simple language the differences between the relevant co-ordinate systems and might help in adding less technical explanations for the co-ordinate systems; and I'll check the archived Talk pages for issues which have caused difficulties and might need clearer explanation.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 11:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen various plain-language explanations of why nothing can escape from within the (outer) event horizon, e.g. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html#What_makes_it_impossible_to_escape_from_black_holes.3F" title="Black hole">Black_hole#What_makes_it_impossible_to_escape_from_black_holes?</a> currently says both "bend space-time so much that, at all points within a certain distance of the center (within the event horizon, see below) all directions lead to the center" and "bends space-time so tightly inside the event horizon that: space and time swap roles." From other reading, e.g. <a href="http://www.gothosenterprises.com/black_holes/rotating_black_holes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gothosenterprises.com/black_holes/rotating_black_holes.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> I've concluded that "space and time swap roles" is the best I've seen, since it prepares the way for what the inner horizon does in rotating black holes - any event horizon makes space and time swap roles, the outer one makes the location of the singularity a falling object's future, the inner one reverts space &amp; time to their normal roles (I'm still struggling to grasp the implications, but that's another matter). But how to explain this swapping in simple terms?</p>

The concept of Newtonion black holes should be discussed in the history section only. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 19:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added the sub-section about Newtonian black holes because I thought it important to make the point that only general relativity gives a satisfactory explanation - a lot of popular science stuff falls back on Newtonian concepts, especially <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escape_velocity.html" title="Escape velocity">escape velocity</a>, either deliberately or as an accidental result of trying too hard to provide a simple, non-mathematical explanation.</dd>
<dd>I added the sub-section about the need for "abnormal compression" to deal with the fairly obvious point that enormous mass alone is not enough. But I think it's too long, and will probably remove the item which explains the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_theorem.html" title="Shell theorem">shell theorem</a>. I still think some reference to the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverse_square_law.html" title="Inverse square law">inverse square law</a> aspect of gravity is necessary.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 15:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That a star collapsing into a black hole suddenly starts sucking in everything in the vicinity is indeed a common misconception. That may deserve a sentence in the intro. The Newtionion stuff I still prefer to ban to the History. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 16:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The photon sphere section states a radius of 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. I could have sworn this was 4/3 the Schwarzschild radius.

<dd>Rotating black holes have 2 photon spheres, but I haven't found anything which states the relation between the gap and the rotation rate (there must be a relation, because current theory expects rotating black holes to lose rotational energy and, when rotation stops, there is only 1 photon sphere.

<p>A recent edit of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html#Two_photon_spheres" title="Black hole">Black_hole#Two_photon_spheres</a> has added "This beam will then split itself in two. Both pieces will move into the Hole." I think some clarifications are needed: (a) does it apply to only to the inner photon sphere (as the current wording implies) or to both? (b) why does the beam split and what causes the split? (c) why should both parts move inwards rather than e.g. one inwards and one outwards?<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilcha_6ec1.html" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 10:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can we be sure black holes actually have the high gravity that they are assumed to have? If they merely had an immensely high gavitational field wouldn't it be theoretically possible to "fill one up"? How can we be sure black holes don't simply exist at absolute zero, therefore with zero internal pressure, making a super-vaccuum of sorts that "sucks" in everything that gets close. This would also explain why nothing can escape a black hole, since at absolute zero there is no energy, which means no mass, which means the object doesn't exist. So the big question here is are we sure black holes are actual existing objects or could they possibly be an area of "non-exisitance", so to speak. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.141.105.22 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.141.105.22_515c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.141.105.22">contribs</a>) on 12:55, 6 April 2007.</small></p>
