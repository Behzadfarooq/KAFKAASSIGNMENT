<dd>If it's factual history that Arafat led Black September and was responsible for the Munich massacre, you should be able to find a citation from a reliable historical account or text better than World Net Daily and Sony Pictures.

<p>The Black September Organization (BSO) was formed in 1971 as a clandestine wing of al-Fatah. BSO was founded with the objective to avenge the expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from Jordan in September of 1970. This time was referred to as&#160;?Black September,? hence the name chosen by the Black September Organization. While Black September was originally described as a splinter group of al-Fatah, direct linkages between the groups were revealed with the arrests of BSO agents. Al-Fatah formed Black September in order to circumvent an al-Fatah declaration that they would not interfere in the domestic policies of Arab nations. However, some al-Fatah members planned to assassinate King Hussein, ruler of Jordan from 1953 to 1999. Hence, Black September was partially formed in order to pursue this specific objective. While Black September failed several times to assassinate King Hussein, the group is notorious for a number of brutal, high-profile terrorist incidents. Black September expanded their list of targets from the Jordanian government to include Israeli and U.S. citizens and facilities. The group also carried out attacks against general&#160;?Western? targets. Black September is infamous for its attack against Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Munich Olympics. In retaliation for the attacks against Israel citizens and facilities, Israel launched a significant response to eliminate the terrorist organization. Israeli security forces retaliated against BSO terrorists in Western Europe and Lebanon. Following the Israeli response, al-Fatah dissolved Black September in December 1974. <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=153" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=153" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Black September "Many terrorist experts speculate that Arafat controlled the BSO and utilized it as his primary military force.

<p>I thought it had been established that Abu Iyad, Arafat's security chief, was in charge of Black September. In his book <i>Stateless</i>, he wrote: "Black September was not a terrorist organization, but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement, at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential. The members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and Fatah or the PLO."</p>
<p>I understood this to mean that Black September was a "claim name" attached to certain operations, rather than a fixed and specific group of people; or if it was a fixed group, it was a small number of Fatah people prepared to go the extra mile when required to. In the animal rights movement, if a group of people (or even one person) carries out a non-violent act, they might claim it as Animal Liberation Front. If it's violent, then it'd be Animal Rights Militia. It's the same thing here.

<p>Regarding Arafat/Munich: Alberuni's NPOV version above is not accurate, in my view. Journalist Alexander Wolff did not write that Abu Daoud simply believed the Munich operation had the endorsement of Arafat (as though he wasn't sure whether it did or not). Rather, this journalist (and many others) reported that Abu Daoud stated, very clearly in his autobiography, that the operation did have Arafat's endorsement. Abu Daoud was in a position to know and he wrote in his book that he did know, not that he merely believed it. He was a primary source and what he said therefore has to be quoted, not interpreted. The phrase "had the endorsement of" does not mean "would have endorsed it had he known about it." It means "did endorse it" which of course means he knew about it.</p>
<p>Alberuni, I feel you may be flogging a dead historical horse here. Arafat never denied he was involved in Munich, so far as I know. There's no Middle East journalist that I know of who claims Arafat was not involved, even if only as an "endorser." My own feeling is to say he only endorsed it is already a charitable interpretation of history in favor of Arafat. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 01:51, Nov 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arafat denied involvement in the Munich operation. Wolff claims that Doaud said that "the operation had the endorsement of Arafat," although Arafat wasn't involved in planning or conceiving of it. If Sports Illustrated's translation of Arabic and quote are accurate, which I doubt, it means that Arafat generally endorsed attacks on Israel and BSO took it upon themselves to plan Munich. If Arafat knew of it in advance, they would say he helped plan it. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:42, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another proof of the PLO "influence" is right in the article: <i>"After the March 1973 attack, the organization was disbanded, apparently under pressure from the PLO, which believed that terrorist acts were damaging public perception of the Palestinian cause."</i> But, if Arafat denied it, we have no choice but to trust him, even though all the evidence and participants say otherwise. And Alberuni, you are so right to doubt the correctness of SI, after all they are just another outlet of Hasbara world conspiracy. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 06:52, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alberuni, there are three primary sources who appear to have talked about Arafat and Munich:</p>
<p>(a) Arafat -- If, as you say, he has denied involvement, please supply a quote or citation of some kind, so that his denial can be included in the article;</p>
<p>(b) Abu Iyad -- He was Arafat's security chief and he wrote a book in which he talked about Black September. Yet you deleted his quote from the article. Why?</p>
<p>(c) Abu Daoud -- He says he planned Munich and that Arafat "endorsed" it. If you're saying he wrote his book in Arabic, and that he gave the Sports Illustrated interview in Arabic, can we find the original Arabic and have it translated by some Arabic-speaking Wikipedians? My understanding is that he spoke fluent English and would have given the interviews to the journalist and the publisher in English. I am willing to try and track down the Sports Illustrated journalist to ask him if you, Alberuni, are willing to find out whether Abu Daoud's book was written in Arabic, then translated. Let me know if you think we should do that.</p>
<p>Even if Abu Daoud did give the interview in Arabic, and if the book was written in Arabic, don't you feel the translators would have been extra careful to get that crucial bit right? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 07:19, Nov 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, he uses the word "cut-offs." Cooley got this information after interviewing members of Fatah, including Arafat and Abu Iyad, and also people he believed were Black September operatives, so maybe they said "cut-offs". It was written in 1973; perhaps the word was used then. The quote's on page 123 of the original 1973 edition <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0 7146 2987 1</a>. If you think it might be a mistake that Cooley or his interviewees made, you could add [sic] after the word to signal that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 20:43, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
