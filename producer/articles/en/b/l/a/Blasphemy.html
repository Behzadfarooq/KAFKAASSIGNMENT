<p>Some US states still have blasphemy laws on the books from the founding days. Chapter 272 of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> General Laws states, for example:</p>

Whoever wilfully blasphemes the holy name of God by denying, cursing or contumeliously reproaching God, His creation, government or final judging of the world, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching or exposing to contempt and ridicule, the holy word of God contained in the holy scriptures shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for not more than one year or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars, and may also be bound to good behavior.</dd>

<p>The history of Maryland's blasphemy statutes suggests that even into the 1930s, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> was not recognized as preventing states from passing such laws. An 1879 codification of Maryland statutes prohibited blasphemy:</p>

</dl>
<p>According to the marginalia, this statute was adopted in 1819, and a similar law dates back to 1723. In 1904, the statute was still on the books at Art. 27, sec. 20, unaltered in text.<a href="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000393/html/am393--782.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000393/html/am393--782.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. As late as 1939, this statute was still the law of Maryland.<a href="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000379/html/am379--1100.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000379/html/am379--1100.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It is unclear from the statutes and notes when Maryland's blasphemy statute was last prosecuted.</p>
<p>The last person to be jailed in the United States for blasphemy was <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abner_Kneeland_fff9.html" title="Abner Kneeland">Abner Kneeland</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a>, as decided by the Massachusetts case <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_v._Kneeland_9043.html" title="Commonwealth v.

<p>The US Supreme Court in <i>Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson</i> 1952 held that the New York State blasphemy law was an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of speech. The court stated that "It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches or motion pictures."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy.html" title="Edit section: Pakistan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pakistan</span></h3>
<p>Among Muslim-majority countries, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> has the strictest anti-blasphemy laws. In 1982, President <a href="../../../z/i/a/Zia_ul-Haq_e34d.html" title="Zia ul-Haq">Zia ul-Haq</a> introduced Section 295B to the Pakistan Penal Code punishing "defiling the Holy Qur'an" with life imprisonment. In 1986, Section 295C was introduced, mandating the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> for "use of derogatory remarks in respect of the Holy Prophet".</p>
<p>In 1990 the Federal Shari’ah Court ruled that the penalty should be a mandatory death sentence, with no right to reprieve or pardon. This is binding, but the government is yet to formally amend the law, which means that the provision for life sentence still formally exists, and is used by the government as a concession to critics of the death penalty. In 2004, the Pakistani parliament approved a law to reduce the scope of the blasphemy laws. The amendment to the law means that police officials will have to investigate accusations of blasphemy to ensure that they are well founded, before presenting criminal charges.</p>
<p>However, the law is used against political adversaries or personal enemies, by Muslim fundamentalists against Christians, Hindus and Sikhs, or for personal revenge. Especially <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadi.html" title="Ahmadi">Ahmadi</a> Muslims are victims of the blasphemy law. They claim to be Muslims themselves, but under the blasphemy law, they are not allowed to use Islamic vocabulary or rituals.</p>
<p>The Pakistani <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> bishops' Justice and Peace Commission complained in July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> that since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, some 650 people had been falsely accused and arrested under the blasphemy law. Moreover, over the same period, some 20 people accused of the same offense had been killed. As of July 2005, 80 Christians were in prison accused of blasphemy.</p>
<p>Christians in Pakistan protested <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></i> as blasphemous, with support of Muslims as well. On 3 June, 2006, Pakistan banned the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_%28film%29_c54d.html" title="The Da Vinci Code (film)">film</a>. Culture Minister Gulab Jamal said: "Islam teaches us to respect all the prophets of God Almighty and degradation of any prophet is tantamount to defamation of the rest."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Blasphemy laws in England have never been repealed. The last person in Britain to be sent to prison for blasphemy was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_William_Gott_e6e4.html" title="John William Gott">John William Gott</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">9 December</a> 1921. He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets which satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem (Matthew 21:2-7), comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour.</p>
<p>In 1977, Denis Lemon, the editor of <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_News_deda.html" title="Gay News">Gay News</a> was found guilty of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemous_libel.html" title="Blasphemous libel">blasphemous libel</a> for publishing <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kirkup_6aa1.html" title="James Kirkup">James Kirkup</a>'s poem <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Love_that_Dares_to_Speak_its_Name_8511.html" title="The Love that Dares to Speak its Name">The Love that Dares to Speak its Name</a> which allegedly vilified <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> and his life (<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehouse_v._Lemon_c61d.html" title="Whitehouse v. Lemon">Whitehouse v. Lemon</a>). Lemon was fined £500 and sentenced to a <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspended_sentence.html" title="Suspended sentence">suspended sentence</a> of nine months imprisonment. It had been "touch and go", said the judge, whether he would actually send Lemon to jail.</p>
<p>In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of the poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name took place on the steps of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Martin-in-the-Fields_41e6.html" title="St Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> church in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafalgar_Square_a2c0.html" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a> and failed to lead to any prosecution.</p>

<p>However, in the simpler message of the time of Jesus, when Christian ideas relied upon the influence of natural authority against the then secular religious power of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Jewish_Temple_42c9.html" title="Second Jewish Temple">Second Jewish Temple</a> period, (positions exchanged in the centuries that followed), this admonishment may be interpreted as warning against an actual reaction from the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> in the form of a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a> that can irreparably harm a person (and thus be unforgivable but not by dictate). This statement in effect establishes the importance of this aspect of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhead.html" title="Godhead">Godhead</a>, rather than setting an arbitrary law.</p>
<p>A careful reading of <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html" title="Gospel of Mark">Mark</a> (from the American Standard) shows this: Mark <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Mark#3:29" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(World_English)/Mark">3:29</a> "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_sin.html" title="Eternal sin">eternal sin</a>."</p>

<p>Blasphemy in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> constitutes speaking ill of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, of any other prophet mentioned in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, or of any Biblical prophets. The Qu'ran also states that it is blasphemy to claim that Jesus Christ (the son of Mary) is the son of God (5.017). Speaking ill of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> is also blasphemy. In Islam, blasphemy is considered a sin. In the Holy Quran, Allah says "He forgives all sins, except disbelieving in God (blasphemy)". In Islam if a person dies while in blasphemy, they will not enter heaven, except if said person repented before death. In an ideal Islamic country, the Khalifa (President) can judge on such cases; punishments vary from a prison term to the death sentence. For such punishments, the following three need to be intact before so (a standing Islamic nation, a Khalifa and an acceptance of such Khalifa from the Muslims). Blasphemy is considered a very serious offense and may be punishable by death if charges are proven. British author <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_Rushdie_d1a4.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Satanic_Verses_%28novel%29_45f8.html" title="The Satanic Verses (novel)">The Satanic Verses</a></i> was seen by many <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> to contain blasphemies against <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iranian</a> clerical leader <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayatollah_Khomeini_8f1c.html" title="Ayatollah Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> issued a <i><a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatwa.html" title="Fatwa">fatwa</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> calling for Rushdie's death. More recently, the <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons</a> were criticised in part on the basis that they were blasphemous against Muhammad. The Egyptian government under pressure by the parliament banned the film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_%28film%29_c54d.html" title="The Da Vinci Code (film)"><i>The Da Vinci Code</i></a> and is to confiscate <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">the novel</a> for containing blasphemy.</p>
