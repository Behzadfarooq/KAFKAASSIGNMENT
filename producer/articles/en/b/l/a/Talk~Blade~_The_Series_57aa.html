<p>The pilot episode took up two time slots on Spike TV because it was a two hour special. That doesn't mean it should be treated as two different episodes. It is one episode that took up two time slots.ScrollMaker 15:10, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the Pilot counted only as one then there would only be 12 total, while the site is stating 13.

<p>I removed these quotes from the main article; they add very little except for space. I have moved them here so that if people violently disagree, they will be easy to add in, perhaps in an edited form? Also, it would be good to provide references, not just the name of the journal in which they appear:</p>
<p>"Normally I'm a sucker for a good bloodsucker, but I've seen paper cuts go deeper than <i>Blade</i>, the toothless new TV version of the comic-book-turned-film franchise … Where <i><a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i> took a mediocre film and elevated it to TV art, <i>Blade</i> doesn't even try to improve on the loud, flashily hollow movies. It's just more of the same martial artlessness. I kept expecting to see <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28TV_series%29_0877.html" title="Batman (TV series)">Batman</a></i>-style OOF! BAM! graphics on screen." -- <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></p>
<p>"Someone ought to mix a shot of liquid <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prozac.html" title="Prozac">Prozac</a> into Blade's magical serum. As played by Kirk "Sticky" Jones in the series based on the <i>Blade</i> movies, he is one very depressed human-vampire hybrid. It's not just Blade's dark sunglasses and mournful leather coat that give him away; his delivery is so wooden it could kill a vampire for all eternity...too dreary and weary for its own good. By the middle of the second hour of the long two-hour opener, the tone lightens slightly and the action takes on more narrative drive and purpose. But until then, the road is slow and aimless and so shadowy you'll want to squeegee your eyes." -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Globe_7aad.html" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a></p>
<p>"The leap from big screen movie franchise to small screen hopeful is a successful one for Spike TV's <i>Blade: The Series</i> (10 p.m. Wednesday), although it is perhaps more of a 'hop' given how small the changes are from the films' spirit." -- <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Week_6d4d.html" title="TV Week">TV Week</a></p>
<p>"The pilot episode starts out rather weak, and until about an hour in (of the two-hour premiere), I was getting pretty disappointed. I'm a bit afraid that people coming to check this show out may give up before an hour into it, as this series airs at 10PM ET. That means you need to stick it out through 11PM or else risk calling it a failure and heading to bed. Trust me, it starts out bland, but the second half makes up for it. At least I was thrown for a loop, one I just did not see coming at all (NOTE: I noticed there's a very slight spoiler on Spike's page for the series, one that gives this loop away, but you'll have to hunt for it to find it and it's very subtle)." -- <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Squad_336f.html" title="TV Squad">TV Squad</a></p>
<p>"Blade and Starr together will try to bring down the House of Chthon and its leader Marcus Van Sciver. If all this sounds like a bunch of comic-book gobbledygook, here's the translation: Blade and Starr are the good guys; Marcus and Co. are the bad guys. Count on lots of punching, shooting, blood and guts. If you're into this sort of thing, it's an admirable effort." -- TV Herald <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranscendentalstate_2fa8.html" title="User:Transcendentalstate">Transcendentalstate</a> 23:19, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This statement contradicts previous statements in the article. Neither statement is referenced. I put this statement into the talk section not because it is not important, but to hopefully trigger someone to clean up the controversy with a sourced statement. I also inserted an --uncited-- template into the main article at the other claim.</p>
<p>"The producers of the series have actually said that it could take place before, during, or after the movies." <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranscendentalstate_2fa8.html" title="User:Transcendentalstate">Transcendentalstate</a> 19:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first movie ends in Moscow and the series starts in Moscow, so unless further timeline tie-ins occur in upcoming episodes, I think this pins the timeline to somewhere between Blade 1 and Blade 2</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll settle this. The series absolutely takes place after Blade Trinity. I know this because in the first episode, there is a clear reference to the events of the movie. The character Shen mentions Natasha Lyonne's character "Sommerfield" and the inhalers she created for Blade and how her notes for making them were destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the conversation:</p>
<p>Shen: What? I got hungry too.</p>
<p>Blade: I miss those inhalers.</p>
<p>Shen: I'm working on it.</p>
<p>Blade: Work . . . faster.</p>
<p>Shen: Dude, most of Summerfield’s notes are destroyed, all right? The serum that keeps the thirst away is easy to replicate, but the inhalers work on a totally different system. You see, they allow you to generate hemoglobin. Humans have genes that develop proteins, but vampirism disables the links between those. Now, the inhalers help to fuse those chains...</p>
<p>Blade: Figure it out! You're supposed to be the smart one.</p>
<p>Shen: Yeah, and I'm the good-looking one too.</p>
<p>So I hope that settles this issue. -- <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreemarket_071b.html" title="User:Freemarket">Freemarket</a> 10:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wtbe, whoever you are, who wrote the section "About the Vampires in Blade"; When at anytime in the series, was the word Torpor used in conjunction, when Vampires lapse into a coma to heal? That word and its connection to vampires, is usualy associated with Vampire the Masquerade and such. I also don't remember a time where a Vampire slipped into a coma in order to heal. Chase doesn't really count, since She was mainly cognizant as She recovered, after being badly burnt in that explosion, in the Berlin Clinc, where Blade went to rescue Vanessa. Just asking, because I clearly don't remember that word even being used.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know it wasn't, and that is a Vampire: the Requiem term (formerly masquerade). I'm taking it out unless someone has a source. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 10:58, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is stated in the "About the Vampires in Blade" section that they are able to see in the UV spectrum. While this is said in the series, it makes absolutly no sense, because it would require that UV light is bouncing from the image into the eye of the vampire.
