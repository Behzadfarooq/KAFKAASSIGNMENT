<p>In <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethesda_Softworks_8304.html" title="Bethesda Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a> series of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_role-playing_game.html" title="Computer role-playing game">role playing games</a> entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elder_Scrolls_f72c.html" title="The Elder Scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></i>, <b>Black Marsh</b> is a swampish southeasterly region of continent of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamriel.html" title="Tamriel">Tamriel</a>. It is presented as the homeland of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reptilian_humanoid.html" title="Reptilian humanoid">reptilian humanoid</a> race of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argonians.html" title="Argonians">Argonians</a> and a race of sentient trees known as the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hist.html" title="Hist">Hist</a>. An alternate name, <b>Argonia</b>, is also used by the Mer races of the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, following the name of an obscure ancient battlefield, and to avoid the negative connotations of the term "Black Marsh".</p>
<p>As described in the series games, Black Marsh is lush and threatening, profuse with poisonous plants and violent predators. The region possesses a tropical climate, lending its plants the tendency to overgrow all attempts to tame them. Foreign agricultural, colonial, and commercial ventures beyond the slave-trade have met with abject failure. The native Argonians organize themselves on the tribal level with success and efficiency, and are only loosely integrated into the ruling Empire of the series.</p>
<p>Black Marsh appeared in <i><a href="../../../a/r/e/The_Elder_Scrolls%7E_Arena_d5c6.html" title="The Elder Scrolls: Arena">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</a></i>, the first <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series game, but has been absent in every game following. Nonetheless, despite the region's absence from the games following <i>Arena</i>, regional lore was still developed in game dialogue and in in-game literature. A continuing narrative of the enslavement of the Argonians, and of continuing conflict with and infrequent raids by its Dunmer neighbor to the north, was most recently quieted in <i><a href="../../../o/b/l/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV%7E_Oblivion_eb46.html" title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></i> by a reported cessation of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> by the newly regnant king. <i><a href="../../../o/b/l/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV%7E_Oblivion_eb46.html" title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion">Oblivion</a></i> also contained a travel narrative concerning in the voice of a reluctant Imperial bureaucrat, which is also the first substantial account of the region from the series.</p>
<p>A game titled "The Eye of Argonia", which would have involved the province, progressed through some early planning stages at Bethesda in the wake of <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/The_Elder_Scrolls_Adventures%7E_Redguard_1915.html" title="The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a></i>, but was ultimately cancelled to make way for the more ambitious <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/The_Elder_Scrolls_III%7E_Morrowind_e44d.html" title="The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></i>.</p>

<p>Within the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legendarium.html" title="Legendarium">legendarium</a>, the earliest inhabitants of the Black Marsh and environs are believed to have been the Hist, great life-giving trees of unknown capacities. According to the <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/The_Elder_Scrolls_III%7E_Morrowind_e44d.html" title="The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind">Morrowind</a></i> game book, <i>The Annotated Anuad</i>, a <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosmer.html" title="Bosmer">Bosmeri</a> creation myth, the region presently known as the Black Marsh was once part of a much greater landmass within the domain of the Hist, but the greater part of the region was flooded during the wanderings of the humanoid <a href="../../../r/a/c/Races_of_The_Elder_Scrolls_216b.html#Mer" title="Races of The Elder Scrolls">Mer</a> races. "The Hist were bystanders in the Ehlnofey war, but most of their realm was destroyed as the war passed over it. A small corner of it survived to become Black Marsh in Tamriel, but most of their realm was sunk beneath the sea."<sup id="_ref-Anuad_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anuad" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to The Imperial Library's <i>History of Tamriel</i>, based on information once held on developer Michael Kirkbride's now defunct website, Argonians came to inhabit Tamriel in small, preliterate communities by the Early Merethic Era.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> The common companion to the collector's editions of the series games, the <i>Pocket Guide to The Empire</i> holds that the term "Argonia" originated as an appelation by the games' <a href="../../../r/a/c/Races_of_the_Elder_Scrolls_3cb4.html#Mer" title="Races of the Elder Scrolls">Elves</a>, for whom it refers to an obscure ancient battlefield.<sup id="_ref-Pocket_Guide_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pocket_Guide" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Marsh_b79b.html" title="Edit section: First Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Era</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">Canonical</a> information for the period in-between the mythic origins of Black Marsh and the latter part of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Third_Era_of_Tamriel_8f6e.html" title="The Third Era of Tamriel">Third Era</a> is sparse. Most in-game fragments occur in various parts of the extensive literary corpus of the series. Ted Peterson's<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> lengthy <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind.html" title="Morrowind">Morrowind</a></i> novellas, <i>2920, The Last Year of the First Era</i> and <i>The Wolf Queen</i> respectively state that the major Black Marsh city of Soulrest had an Argonian battlechief by 1E 2920,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> and that Lilmoth had an Argonian priest-king by the first century of the Third Era.<sup id="_ref-Wolf_Queen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wolf_Queen" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Third Edition of <i>Pocket Guide to the Empire</i>, shipping with the collector's edition of <i><a href="../../../o/b/l/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV%7E_Oblivion_eb46.html" title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion">Oblivion</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup> gives the only example of Argonian territorial expansionism within the series. Argonian armies from Black Marsh are described therein as having come into conflict with the neighbouring Cyrodiilic Imperials. The last of these Argonian armies was defeated by a Cyrodiilic force in 1E 2811.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup> A possible contradiction ensues with an earlier account from <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind.html" title="Morrowind">Morrowind</a></i>, which states that "No army of Morrowind or Black Marsh has ever threatened the security of any other Imperial province, let alone the security of Cyrodiil itself,"<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> but this particular passage could be explained in any number of ways, particularly given that the book in question is generally <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemical.html" title="Polemical">polemical</a>.</p>
<p>Black Marsh was eventually to be incorporated within the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrodiil.html" title="Cyrodiil">Cyrodiilic</a> Second Empire in 1E 2837.<sup id="_ref-Pocket_Guide_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pocket_Guide" title="">[3]</a></sup> Imperial domination changed little of the tribal organization of Black Marsh's society, but wrought disastrous changes to its economy, as the small farms of Argonian peasants were replaced with massive cash-crop farms, and traditional forms of transportation were usurped by foreign methods unsuited to the native terrain. These changes were eventually remedied as the land's administration chose to return to previous methods of business. There have been some small attempts to convert the residents of Black Marsh to the Cyrodiilic pantheon of the Nine Divines, but most have been unsuccessful.<sup id="_ref-AccountF_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AccountF" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though it is not directly indicated in any in-game lore, a passage in the <i>Morrowind</i> book <i>A Short History of Morrowind</i> implies that Black Marsh was incorporated into the Empire by treaty or pact rather than by military dominion. "Resdayn was the last of the provinces to submit to <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiber_Septim_1c26.html" title="Tiber Septim">Tiber Septim</a>; like Black Marsh, it was never successfully invaded, and was peacefully incorporated by treaty into the Empire as the Province of Morrowind."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Marsh_b79b.html" title="Edit section: Third Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Third Era</span></h3>
<p>During the later years of the Third Era, Black Marsh came into conflict with its Dunmer neighbours to the north in the bloody Arnesian War. The Black Marsh's armies were destroyed, but an Argonian was able to capture and murder an influential Dunmer merchant called Roris<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup> who was later made a saint by the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribunal_Temple_8fb9.html" title="Tribunal Temple">Dunmeri Temple</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the documents prepared for <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivec.html" title="Vivec">Lord Vivec</a> by the Temple imply that Black Marsh retains control of some historically Dunmer provinces, despite their loss in the Arnesian War. In their detailing of <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagoth_Ur_4682.html" title="Dagoth Ur">Dagoth Ur</a>'s plans, they state that he wishes to "Recover ancient territories stolen by <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyrim.html" title="Skyrim">Skyrim</a> and Argonia."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup> The Dunmer and the Argonian races, perhaps unsurprisingly, have a "long standing and bitter hatred for one another".<sup id="_ref-Savant_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Savant" title="">[15]</a></sup> PC Gamer reviewer Steve Klett reacted fondly to the inclusion of racial tensions in <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind.html" title="Morrowind">Morrowind</a></i>, writing that "<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jordan_3ca0.html" title="Robert Jordan">Robert Jordan</a> would be proud of the complexities here".<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

The novella finishes by having Scotti clear up most issues relating to Imperial interests in Black Marsh, returning travel to its historical form, by boat and Underground Express, and by ceasing Imperial efforts to change Black Marsh's economy from one oriented on <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsistence_agriculture.html" title="Subsistence agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> into one oriented on export crops.

<p>Little of Black Marsh's urban culture is to be found in the game lore, though we are fortunate enough to have some sparse fragments. A traveler recounts in the <i><a href="../../../d/a/g/Daggerfall.html" title="Daggerfall">Daggerfall</a></i> book, <i>The Alik'r</i> that Lilmoth possesses "mold encrusted villas" and that Helstrom possesses "wonderful, dangerous alleys."<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[26]</a></sup> The cities of Black Marsh are also described in another piece of material, the semi-canonical city descriptions from the early development of <i><a href="../../../a/r/e/The_Elder_Scrolls%7E_Arena_d5c6.html" title="The Elder Scrolls: Arena">Arena</a></i>, while it was being planned as a fighting game.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[27]</a></sup> Each city is given a short monograph describing the player character's entry to the city and first impressions.</p>
<p>Lilmoth is described as "the home of the Dark Tide," "gloomy and foreboding," pervaded by an "unnatural fear," holding "much underneath its streets." Gideon is described as the "black city of the followers of Seth." Blackrose is located "near the legendary forest of Murkwood." Stormhold is apparently given over to tension, understandably, because of its "proximity to the Dark Elven lands." Thorn is described as the "Jewel of the East," and as "deadly as it is beautiful," where "vagabonds eye your purse strings and guards seem to turn lazy eyes elsewhere." Much of the other information is given in the same style, leading the reader to wonder if all cities in Tamriel are dangerous and deadly, or just the ones the player character visits. Not so much of the rest is useful, however, focusing the warrior teams present in each city rather than the cities themselves.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The<i>Argonian Compendium</i> postulates that the description of Gideon's reference to "followers of Seth" may be a reference to the chaos god Sithis, or an Argonian corruption thereof.<sup id="_ref-Compendium_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> Jarth's novella provides some further information on Gideon. Though never arriving there himself, Scotti describes Gideon as "a large settlement more or less laid out like an Imperial city, with more or less Imperial style architecture, and all the Imperial comforts and traditions, more or less,"<sup id="_ref-AccountT_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AccountT" title="">[24]</a></sup> "a thoroughly Imperialized city," with "gates."<sup id="_ref-AccountTh_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AccountTh" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another fragment, a series of RP posts made in a TES forum by a former dev describing Stormhold in the north, is more in-depth, but perhaps less reliable. The author of the Argonian Compendium describes the source thusly. "RPing is first and foremost an exercise in fiction and so even though this comes from an ex-dev with a continuing involvement in the Elder Scrolls games, it must be approached with caution. This may or may not be drawn from lore known to Tedders that's part of the ES canon; it may be all his own imagining."<sup id="_ref-Compendium_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> Nonetheless, it provides some tantalizing detail, if not entirely canonical detail. Using the Compendium again, to summarize:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>"The description of Stormhold is of a city suspended above a vast swamp and under constant rainstorms. Bridges are slung like spider webs between huge trees and stone buildings on stilts (presumably not wooden stilts-- such couldn't support the weight and also sit rotting in a bog). Noteworthy is the mention of three Hist trees in Stormhold alone, countering speculation by some fans that only one Hist still lives."<sup id="_ref-Compendium_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Ted Peterson, <i>Argonian Compendium</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting is the suggestion that the swamp underneath the city filters southward, which suggests a common drainage basin for the Black Marsh extending all the way up to the border with Morrowind. Locals seem to believe something along the same lines. We read the Argonian Shehs say in Waughin Jarth's <i>Argonian Account</i>: "Everything in Tamriel flows down to Black Marsh."<sup id="_ref-AccountF_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AccountF" title="">[10]</a></sup> <a name="Native_life" id="Native_life"></a></p>

<p>The Black Marsh generally has a southerly marsh-like climate, and the florae and faunae that would be associated with such an environment.

The appearance of the race has been progressively developed over the series as minor refinements in their design were made for each game, developing from a near-<a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunmer.html" title="Dunmer">Dunmer</a> variety of humanoid in <i><a href="../../../a/r/e/The_Elder_Scrolls%7E_Arena_d5c6.html" title="The Elder Scrolls: Arena">Arena</a></i> to a lizardlike variety of amphibian with digitigrade legs in <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind.html" title="Morrowind">Morrowind</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Compendium_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Argonians were characterized by game developer Michael Kirkbride in a post on The Elder Scrolls Official Forums alongside the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khajiit.html" title="Khajiit">Khajiit</a> as the <a href="../../../o/t/h/Other.html" title="Other">Other</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[31]</a></sup> Various racial categorisation schema within the series find them as "beasts", or "Betmeri", in opposition to the developed humanoid races of Elves, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_%28Elder_Scrolls%29_f530.html" title="Imperial (Elder Scrolls)">Imperials</a>, and other <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mer.html" title="Mer">Mer</a>.<sup id="_ref-Racial_Phylogeny_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Racial_Phylogeny" title="">[32]</a></sup> Argonians are often given descriptors telling of their alien nature.

<p>While keeping their general character as an 'alien' race, Argonians have been given certain new personality traits during the development of the series, specifically, an added emphasis on Argonian clan loyalty and a strong personal sense of kin. Dreekius, the sole Argonian in <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/The_Elder_Scrolls_Adventures%7E_Redguard_1915.html" title="The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard">Redguard</a></i>, an Argonian so particularly acclimatized to the customs of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerfell.html" title="Hammerfell">Hammerfell</a> that he speaks without a hiss, describes his role outside Black Marsh in terms of his clan. "'How ... does an Argonian manage to leave his tribe to wander Tamriel?' 'You refer to me? I do not wander, Redguard; this is a settled study for me, from which I'll add to the wealth of wisdoms when I return to my clan.'" Dreekius further mentions his respect for "clannish drives," "which any Argonian might admire, being used ... to honor the clan's interests above our own private affairs."<sup id="_ref-Reguard_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reguard" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>Though the enslavement of Argonians did not appear in the TES series until <i>Morrowind</i>, it was a known issue at Bethesda since the development of <i><a href="../../../d/a/g/Daggerfall.html" title="Daggerfall">Daggerfall</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Compendium_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> <i>Savant's Note On Vvardenfell</i> states that <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunmer.html" title="Dunmer">Dunmer</a> from neighbouring <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind.html" title="Morrowind">Morrowind</a> have raided the Black Marsh for slaves "for ages."

<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/c/Races_of_The_Elder_Scrolls_216b.html#Hist" title="Races of The Elder Scrolls">Hist</a> have been tossed around quite frequently on The Elder Scrolls Official Forums, all due to one dangerously mislaid sentence. In the <i>Players Guide to The Empire</i>, Argonians are said to never have left their homeland "except for a relatively intelligent strain called the hist. [sic]"<sup id="_ref-Pocket_Guide_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pocket_Guide" title="">[3]</a></sup> This statement, implying that the Argonians are a type of Hist, left quite a bit of fallout, but was resolved by a clear statement by Mark Nelson that the whole thing resulted from ignorance on the part of the editors of the <i>Guide</i>. Hist are, in fact, great sentient trees worshipping the eternal, immutable, god of chaos, Sithis. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find many canonical statements about the Hist in game lore. The <i>Annotated Anuad</i> provides some information, informing the reader that the Hist are one of two races to survive the "twelve worlds of Creation," along with the Ehlnofey, and that the Hist had a great homeland sunk beneath the sea by the wars of the Ehlnofey. It is never certain how much credence one should give to a creation myth. Any statements regarding the Hist's survival of the twelve worlds of a Creation should be treated with due suspicion.<sup id="_ref-Anuad_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anuad" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many cursory remarks from the game developers give the impression that the relationship between the Argonians and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hist.html" title="Hist">Hist</a> as nearing the level of symbiosis. From the keyboard of Mark Nelson: "I will tell you that there's more to the Hist than has been told, and they and the Argonians have a much deeper relationship than previously thought...Black Marsh is, sadly, far too unexplored, leaving the enigmatic Argonians shrouded in a bit too much mystery for my liking."<sup id="_ref-Compendium_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> Gary Noonan provides a description of the Argonians as being similar to the Khajiit, and varying from a nearly human to a completely lizardlike race much like the Khajiit vary from a nearly human to an entirely catlike race, depending on how many times "they decide to lick the tree".<sup id="_ref-Compendium_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> In further posts by Mark Nelson he commented that he was not willing to speak of the relationship between the Hist. "As for the relationship, I'm not talking yet." "There has been talk about how the Hist (and Hist sap) are related to Argonian sexuality. This hasn't changed...it's still related. And, it's not a taboo topic; I just don't think it's the most interesting one out there." The issue has not since been delved into with any more depth or clarity.<sup id="_ref-Compendium_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jarth records Scotti seeing what are called Hackwings in Black Marsh, "giant birds with long, saw-like beaks nearly the size of the rest of their bodies." A fellow traveler is written speaking of them. "like everything else in this damnable place, they'll eat you if you don't keep moving.

<p>Prior to the development of <i>Morrowind</i>, Bethesda began work on a direct sequel to <i>Redguard</i> in the <i>Elder Scrolls Adventure</i> series featuring Black Marsh, "The Eye of Argonia," but <i>Redguard's</i> lackluster sales caused them to drop the idea.<sup id="_ref-Compendium_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Compendium" title="">[29]</a></sup> In an interview <i>Morrowind's</i> project leader Todd Howard suggested that there was potential for the game to be developed on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, where action-adventure games are seen in a more favourable light, but this idea doesn't seem to have gone anywhere.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game would presumably have had the same <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third-person.html" title="Third-person">third-person</a> <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action-adventure.html" title="Action-adventure">action-adventure</a> elements of the <i>Redguard</i> game, but would focus on the quest for the mythic jewel, the Eye of Argonia, which would lead the player to the Lost City of the Black Marsh. The jewel's location was known to the character Dreekius, who refers to it as "the priceless king's jewel of ancient Black Marsh" and to its seeker Tobias as "another softskin [...] all sword and swagger."<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Eye is also mentioned in a retelling of an archaeologist's travels, where it caps off the tale as the subject of the archaeologist's next destination.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[48]</a></sup> The Eye was further referenced in an easter egg for the <i>Morrowind</i> expansion pack <i><a href="../../../t/r/i/The_Elder_Scrolls_III%7E_Tribunal_ed76.html" title="The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal">Tribunal</a></i>, where a player who describes himself as "Looking for the Eye of Argonia" is congratulated for "providing an original and entertaining excuse."<sup id="_ref-Morrowind_Easter_Eggs_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morrowind_Easter_Eggs" title="">[49]</a></sup> The Eye of Argonia remains an in-joke for the series, but hasn't been developed any further than the above mentioned fragments and remains extremely obscure.</p>
