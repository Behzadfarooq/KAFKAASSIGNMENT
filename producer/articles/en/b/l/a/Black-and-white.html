<p><b>Black-and-white</b> is a broad adjectival term used to describe a number of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monochrome.html" title="Monochrome">monochrome</a> forms of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_arts.html" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a>. Most forms of visual technology start out in black and white, then slowly evolve into color as technology progresses.</p>
<p>"Black-and-white" as a description is also something of a misnomer, for in addition to black and white most of these media included varying <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grayscale.html" title="Grayscale">shades of grey</a>. Further, many prints, especially those produced earlier in the development of photography, were in <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepia_tone.html" title="Sepia tone">sepia</a> (mainly to provide archival stability), which gave a richer, more subtle shading than reproductions in plain black-and-white, although less so than color.</p>

Black-and-White photos on a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photo_booth.html" title="Photo booth">photo booth</a> strip.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some popular black-and-white media forms of the past include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">Movies</a> and animated <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoons</a>. While some color film processes (including hand coloring) were experimented with and in limited use from the earliest days of the motion picture, the switch from films almost always being in black-and-white to almost always being in color was a gradual process mostly taking place from the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> to the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>. Even when most studios had the capabilities to make color films, they were not wildly popular at first because early tinting techniques and <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technicolor.html" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> film left much to be desired. For the years 1940–1966 a separate <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Art_Direction_b3b7.html" title="Academy Award for Best Art Direction">Academy Award for Best Art Direction</a> was given for black and white movies, along with one for those in color. Some modern directors still shoot in black and white as an artistic choice, though it is much less common for a major Hollywood production. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recent_films_in_black-and-white.html" title="List of recent films in black-and-white">List of recent films in black-and-white</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">Photography</a> was black-and-white or shades of sepia. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_photography.html" title="Color photography">Color photography</a> was originally rare and expensive, and early on often less true to life. Color photography became much more common in middle of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, and has been getting more and more common since. Black-and-white remains a niche market for photographers who use the medium for artistic purposes. This can take the form of black and white film or digital conversion to greyscale, with optional <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_image_editing.html" title="Digital image editing">image manipulation</a> to enhance the results. For amateur use, <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a> manufactures a black-and-white <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disposable_camera.html" title="Disposable camera">disposable camera</a>. Special films are produced today which give black and white images using the ubiquitous <a href="../../../c/-/4/C-41_process.html#Use_with_black-and-white_films" title="C-41 process">C41 color process</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a> was originally <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">broadcast</a> in black-and-white. Some color broadcasts began in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, with color becoming common in western industrialized nations during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> upgraded to the color standard between <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, while the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> settled on an official color system in November <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> kept airing black-and-white broadcasts until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. While no longer used much professionally, many consumer <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camcorder.html" title="Camcorder">camcorders</a> have the ability to record in black-and-white.</li>
<li>Most <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> were black-and-white until the late 1970s; <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Post_5b91.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> remained in black-and-white until the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, some claiming <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> was the major impetus for the change. Even today, many newspapers restrict color photographs to the front and other prominent pages since mass producing photographs in black-and-white is considerably cheaper than color.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_%28magazine%29.html" title="Jet (magazine)">Jet</a></i> magazine was either all or mostly black-and-white until the end of the 20th century, when it became all-color.</li>
<li><a href="../../../y/e/a/Yearbook.html" title="Yearbook">School yearbooks</a> have (historically) been printed either entirely or mostly in black-and-white. All-color school yearbooks are rare as of now, but the rate is increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today black-and-white <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> often has a "nostalgic," historic, or <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronistic</a> feel to it. For example, the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> film <i><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_%28movie%29.html" title="Celebrity (movie)">Celebrity</a></i> was shot entirely in black-and-white. Other films, such as <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_X_6ef8.html" title="American History X">American History X</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_movie%29_fbfb.html" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 movie)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i> play with the concept of the black-and-white anachronism, using it to selectively portray scenes and characters who are either more outdated or dull than the characters and scenes shot in full-color. This manipulation of color appears in the film <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin_City_%28film%29_8f63.html" title="Sin City (film)">Sin City</a></i> and the occasional <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">television commercial</a>.</p>
<p>Since the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, few mainstream films have been shot entirely on black-and-white <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_stock.html" title="Film stock">film stock</a>, even if they are intended to be presented theatrically in black-and-white. The reasons are frequently commercial, as it is difficult to sell a film for television broadcasting if no color version exists. For example, movies such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Boorman_0e3c.html" title="John Boorman">John Boorman</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_General_9af1.html" title="The General">The General</a></i> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Coen_011d.html" title="Joel Coen">Joel Coen</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Wasn%27t_There_e72b.html" title="The Man Who Wasn't There">The Man Who Wasn't There</a></i> were obliged to be filmed in color by their respective <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_distributor.html" title="Film distributor">distributors</a>, despite being presented in black-and-white for artistic reasons. <i><a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerks..html" title="Clerks.">Clerks.</a></i> is one of the few well-known recent films shot in black-and-white for no artistic purpose; due to the extremely low <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-pocket_expenses.html" title="Out-of-pocket expenses">out-of-pocket budget</a>, the production team could not afford the added costs of shooting in color (though the difference in film stock price would be slight, the store's fluorescent lights could not be used to light for color; by shooting in black and white, the film did not have to rent lighting equipment).</p>
<p>Some modern <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_director.html" title="Film director">film directors</a> will occasionally shoot movies in black-and-white because they believe it captures their vision better. This is also true of black-and-white <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a>, where many photographers choose to shoot in solely black-and-white since the stark contrasts enhances the subject matter.</p>
