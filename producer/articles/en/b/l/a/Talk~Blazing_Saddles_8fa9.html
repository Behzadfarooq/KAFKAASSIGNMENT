<p>Can anyone please look into the fact that Gilda Radner is not a cast member of this movie - especially in the church scene as pointed out by a contributor to the article. I have viewed the entire movie many times and reviewed the cast listing having found no mention of Gilda. The woman in the church scene is Carol Arthur (wife of Dom DeLuis). ESQ24</p>

<p><i>One of its most famous scenes is of a group of cowboys sitting round a fire eating plates of beans; the soundtrack has repeated, loud evidence of the most <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">notorious side-effects</a> of beans..</i></p>
<p>Huh huh, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fart.html" title="Fart">fart</a> jokes. The scene where the sheriff distracts some <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> members by yelling "where are all the white women at?" paints a different picture of this movie. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerphant_d5b4.html" title="User:Merphant">Merphant</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It's meant to attract the Klan members, so they are drawn into the ambush. One of the Klan's irrational views/fears is about helpless white women being 'soiled' by black men. 208.59.171.97 20:34, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not sure what you mean by "a different picture". I get the sense that maybe you don't approve of the over-the-top racial satire. <i>Many</i> ethnic groups get verbally "shot at" in this movie. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 3 July 2005 22:20 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wahkeenah, I noticed you reverted this 'correction' with another correction, but I'm still left wondering which is correct! This is a small point, but it would be nice to get a definitive answer. Here's what I've found so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the first pass (talking to Bart), the Gov. clearly stops at "ni--" but the DVD subtitles show "nig--".</li>
<li>On the second pass (talking to Hedley), the DVD subtitles show "can't you see that man is a nig?"</li>
<li>When I listen to the audio track, I hear the Gov. say "can't you see that man is a nit?" with an audible 't'. (which makes a certain amount of sense, because it's a real word and it's plausible that the Gov. would call him that - after all, what's a 'ni' or a 'nig'?)</li>
<li>The closed-caption on the second pass stops at "can't you see that man is a ni?"</li>
<li>The novelization has the Gov. actually saying "this man's a nigger" to Hedley.</li>
<li>I would like to get a look at the screenplay to see if this is something they changed during shooting.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? Is there any reason to favor one version over another? <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 03:41, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Forget the screenplay and the subtitling (closed-captioning). What is he <i>actually saying</i> in the film? I've never heard it as "nit", and I've seen the film many times.

<dd>I did a bit of "original research" (which, of course, is not admissible to the article) and ran the recording through a spectrum analyzer program, a "voiceprint." I also recorded myself saying "that man is a ni..", "that man is a nit", and "that man is a nig". I'm no expert on spectrograms, but the second Brooks line is clearly different from the first, and the second one resembles my voice saying "nit" more than the other two I recorded. Food for thought!&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 19:01, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting. I saw the DVD with closed captioning, and it said "nig" both times... but that's not very reliable, given the <i>many, obvious</i> differences between the closed-captioning and what they were actually saying on-screen. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:56, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Here's at least one other source (apparently NOT spun off wikipedia) that thinks he's saying "ni" both times... and by the way, I thought that was the point of the joke anyway, that you think he's going to say the "n-word" and stops himself, whereas he was just saying "ni", which admittedly is a pretty lame joke. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/10/18/15758/167" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/10/18/15758/167" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Look for an item titled "Reminds me of Blazing Saddles". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I have no doubt that there are other people hearing it the same way you are. Probably some are hearing 'nit' as well.</dd>
<dd>You got the point of the joke just fine-- you think he's going to say the 'n-word', but in fact it's a different n-word. The problem is (for me) that 'ni' isn't a real word (unless he's calling Bart the chemical symbol for nickel!) and 'nit' is. I wish they would have used 'nitwit' instead, it would have made things simpler for us! <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 19:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Calling him a nitwit would be more logical. Nit is also a word, but it doesn't make much sense, but neither does 'ni'. Maybe somebody <i>will</i> have to write to Mel and ask him. And given his sense of humor, he'll probably tell us to go talk to the scriptwriter... Richard Pryor. Maybe it would be better just to take the joke out altogether. There are still a few more others to choose from. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nah, I think we should just keep correcting the corrections to the previous corrections!</dd>
<dd>As for talking to Richard Pryor... good idea! I'll go get my ouija board. &lt;g&gt; <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 21:20, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let me know what he has to say. Meanwhile, we could qualify it by saying that some hear it as "ni" and some hear it as "nit". Maybe that would be ni(t)-picking. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's leave it as-is for now, since the subtitle agrees with the quote. If any new evidence comes along, we can always change it back. <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 15:24, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After reading the tidbit on the hebrew on the headdress, and inspecting the movie poster image, I noticed that what it said was not exactly "kosher l'pesach" because the first letters of each were reversed (it read "posher l'kesach") I edited the page accordingly, but I don't know the proper formatting for words in foreign languages so correct as necessary. 208.59.171.97 01:09, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No. Follow the links to <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pesach.html" title="Pesach">Pesach</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a> and you will see that the letters on the headband are <i>not</i> spoonerized.

<li>Well then your Jewish acquaintance either doesn't know Hebrew or he isn't looking close enough at the headdress.

<dd>Well, maybe I'm crosseyed, but it looks to me like it matches the Hebrew in the articles for the terms <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pesach.html" title="Pesach">Pesach</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a>. Keep in mind that the word order is Passover-Kosher, not Kosher-Passover. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Hebrew is read right-to-left, and the order should be Kosher (L)Pesach... the L (the letter lamed in hebrew) means 'for', i.e. kosher for passover. Also the strict hebrew pronounciation is closer to Ka'sher, not Kosher, but I think it makes more sense to use Kosher when talking about it in English.208.59.171.97 19:46, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now I see what you're getting at. Those letters are pretty similar-looking. But the first letter of "Kosher" on the headband has a dot <i>inside</i> it, not connected to the top of the letter as it would be if it were the first letter of "Pesach". So you can argue for a possible unintential spoonerism or maybe just mediocre artwork. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh that's what was throwing you off... now I get it&#160;:) in the article on Kashrut the 'backwards-c' letter thing has a dot in it. You may also notice alot of marks seperate from the main letters themselves in that representation. That is fully annotated hebrew, with vowels and marks used to help one pronounce new words, in contrast to the writing on the headdress which is done in the more traditional form without vowels. I could go on about what the dot in the 'backwards-c' (on the wiki page) means if you're curious. 208.59.171.97 23:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point exactly (don't pardon the pun). That standalone dot is a vowel point. That letter was done correctly, but they messed up the first letter of "Pesach". Again, poor artwork or some such.

<li>Hmmmm I managed to acquire an even higher-rez copy of the DVD cover than of the poster, and you while you are right that the dot is seperated, I do think that the artist was indeed drawing the (pey) letter for a few reasons... too tired to explain now. Wish I had a tablet PC to draw easily&#160;:P. I'll post a picture later with my reasons. 208.59.171.97 23:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Salon.com review really doesn't offer any substantial additions to what's in the DVD commentary. In this case, I think it serves only as a published reference for the verbal content of the DVD commentary, unless someone disputes what Brooks said there? <a href="../../../m/f/n/User%7EMFNickster_1b31.html" title="User:MFNickster">MFNickster</a> 07:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most if not all of the material in the wiki article seems to be true. However, the section describing the film's themes has the look of a film commentary that was ripped off from someplace. If it came from that salon site, or predominantly from any site, then it should be altered or abolished. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Such a citation is obvious POV-pushing. It is clear from the critiques that not everyone liked it. Adding this particular sarcasm so near the beginning of the article is inappropriate. I don't care which list of films it appears on or not. That stuff is also POV-pushing. Today, that film stands out because of its blatant political incorrectness, much more than the campfire scene, which was avant-garde in its day, but is no longer a novelty due to many less-funny imitators over the years. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm really having trouble understanding your rationale. The NFR listing is a <b>major</b> deal, and adding it can hardly be considered a POV push.
