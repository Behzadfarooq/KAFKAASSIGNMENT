The <i>Black Pearl</i> is easily recognised by its distinctive black hull and sails. This turns out to be an advantage in more than one way. Not only do the black sails act as a sort of intimidation tactic, but the <i>Pearl's</i> crew can put out the deck lamps for added stealth at night.The ship was originally named <i>Wicked Wench</i> before it was ordered burned and sunk by <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutler_Beckett_1b7c.html" title="Cutler Beckett">Lord Cutler Beckett</a>.

<p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> was captained by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sparrow_de2c.html" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> for two years. The crew was heading to the mysterious <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isla_de_Muerta_db4a.html" title="Isla de Muerta">Isla de Muerta</a> where the legendary Chest of Cortes was hidden. Captain and crew agreed to equal shares of the treasure, but First Mate <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hector_Barbossa_d2b5.html" title="Hector Barbossa">Hector Barbossa</a> persuaded Jack that equal shares included knowing the treasure's location. Jack complied, and soon after Barbossa led a <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutiny.html" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a> and marooned Jack on an island.</p>
<p>The crew found the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> gold, which they quickly frittered away on food, drink and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitutes.html" title="Prostitutes">prostitutes</a>. However, unaware the treasure was cursed, anyone who stole the coins turned into <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undead.html" title="Undead">undead</a> beings, unable to feel pleasure but suffering pain. <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonlight.html" title="Moonlight">Moonlight</a> revealed the cursed pirate's true form—hideous skeletons with tattered flesh clinging to bones. Even the <i>Pearl</i> was affected. The ship became constantly shrouded in an eerie mist, although the ship itself was not cursed, it was merely the curse's effect upon the ship's crew. After the curse was lifted, the mist disappeared. (This mysterious effect was created by two barges carrying large fog machines following the ship.)</p>

<p>The curse could only be lifted when every coin was returned to the chest along with a trace of blood from each pirate who stole one. <a href="../../../22/b/o/_Bootstrap_Bill__Turner_fd3c.html" title="&quot;Bootstrap Bill&quot; Turner">"Bootstrap Bill" Turner</a>, the only crew member who defended Jack during the mutiny, sent a coin to his young son <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Turner_d6d6.html" title="Will Turner">Will Turner</a>, believing the crew deserved to remain cursed. Barbossa had Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard in retaliation. Only later did they learn they also needed his blood to break the curse and had, in fact, doomed themselves to continued damnation. Over the next decade, the <i>Pearl</i> menaced the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> as the pirates searched for the coins until all but one was found. As a boy, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Turner_d6d6.html" title="Will Turner">Will Turner</a> brought the gold medallion with him on his journey to the Caribbean, although <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Swann_59b1.html" title="Elizabeth Swann">Elizabeth Swann</a>, the governor's daughter, came into possession of it and kept it hidden. The <i>Pearl</i> later attacked <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Royal_fa77.html" title="Port Royal">Port Royal</a> and abducted Elizabeth, believeing she was Bootstrap's child—the only source of Turner blood.</p>
<p>The <i>Pearl</i> was eventually commandeered by Sparrow's new crew. While the pirates were fighting the Royal Navy at Isla de Muerta, the crew makes off with the <i>Pearl</i>, leaving Jack behind. However, they later rescued him when he escaped execution in Port Royal.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean%7E_Dead_Man%27s_Chest_95bd.html" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></i> reveals some of the back story of Jack Sparrow and the <i>Black Pearl</i>. Originally, she was the <i>Wicked Wench</i> that was sunk. (The ship is based on the one in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> attraction that inspired the movie.) Jack made a pact with <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davy_Jones_%28Pirates_of_the_Caribbean%29_4e56.html" title="Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Davy Jones</a>, the captain of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, to raise her from the deep as Jack's own ship. In return, Jack would relinquish his soul to Jones after thirteen years, although following the mutiny, Barbossa held command for the majority of that time. Jack continuing to refer to himself as 'Captain Jack Sparrow' was sufficient reason for Davy Jones to collect the debt. Much of the plot revolves around Jack's attempt to escape his obligation. According to Leech, one of the newer crewmen aboard, the ship can be operated with as few as six hands aboard. This eventually leads to his death in a race to claim the Pearl on <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelegosto.html" title="Pelegosto">Pelegosto</a>.</p>
<p>More is learned about Jack Sparrow and the <i>Black Pearl</i> in a game on the "Dead Man's Chest's" official website. Jack was captain of the <i>Wicked Wench</i> under the employment of the East India Trading Co. (This fits with the reality; according to history, pirates did not build ships specifically to commit piracy. Instead, they either bought or stole small, fast vessels, then retrofitted them with heavy armaments.) Cutler Beckett ordered Jack to pick up precious "cargo" in Africa and deliver it to the West Indies/Caribbean. When Jack discovers the cargo is <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangular_trade.html" title="Triangular trade">slaves</a>, he frees them in Africa. As revenge, Beckett orders the "Wench" burned and sunk and Jack branded as a pirate. After Jack escapes prison, he vows to get the <i>Wench</i> back and nearly drowns attempting to pull her up from the ocean floor. He is saved by Davy Jones, and they strike their bargain. Jones raises the <i>Wench</i> from the depths, and Jack rechristens her <i>Black Pearl</i>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</i>, the <i>Pearl</i>, along with Jack Sparrow, is returned to the ocean bottom by Davy Jones' <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviathan.html" title="Leviathan">leviathan</a>, the <i><a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraken.html" title="Kraken">Kraken</a></i>. However, Will, Elizabeth, and the surviving <i>Pearl</i> crew vow to resurrect Jack and his ship. In interviews with cast members on <a href="../../../f/i/l/FilmFocus_dca3.html" title="FilmFocus">FilmFocus</a>, it's been revealed that the <i>Black Pearl</i> is at "World's End", still intact. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sparrow_de2c.html" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> is supposedly dead aboard her and will be resurrected by <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tia_Dalma_686f.html" title="Tia Dalma">Tia Dalma</a>, who has joined the <i>Black Pearl's</i> crew in their quest to find Sparrow.</p>

<p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> is heavily armed, she carries 32 6-pound <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannons.html" title="Cannons">cannons</a>: 18 on the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_deck.html" title="Gun deck">gun deck</a> and 14 on the upper deck. Its full <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadside.html" title="Broadside">broadside</a> contains 16 <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannonballs.html" title="Cannonballs">cannonballs</a> and weighs 96 <a href="../../../i/b/_/Ib.html" title="Ib">Ibs</a>. (35,8 kg). Strangely, the <i>Pearl</i> does not have any guns neither on the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow.html" title="Bow">bow</a> nor on the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stern.html" title="Stern">stern</a> which is very unusual for a pirate ship and gives her a grave tactical disadvantage during a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chase.html" title="Chase">chase</a>; the <i>Pearl</i> isn’t able to shoot the ship she chases or to reply her hunter’s fire. Only her high speed negates this handicap partially. In 'Dead Man's Chest' another advantage the <i>Black Pearl</i> has over her enemies is her ability to hide in the sea at night, if all the ship's lamps are blown out then the ship is no longer visible on the sea thanks to her black hull and sails. This is also seen in 'Curse of the Black Pearl' where she is able to sneak into Port Royal under the cover of darkness, unhindered.</p>

Blueprints for the Black Pearl.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In <i>Dead Man's Chest</i>, a cargo hold beneath the <i>Black Pearl</i> crew's sleeping quarters is seen when Jack goes to get a bottle of rum. In this cargo hold there is a goat wearing a hat that appears to be Barbossa's hat.</li>
<li>The <i>Black Pearl</i> is a "level within a level" in <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_II_23fd.html" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>.</li>
<li>One odd feature of the <i>Black Pearl</i> is the combination of the ships capstan (hoist used to raise the anchor) with the mainmast. While undoubtedly done for the sake of scene direction, in practice it is not a realistic set up, given the way a capstan operates. In addition, it would make operation of the mainmast running rigging somewhat interesting, since the space occupied by the <i>Pearl's</i> capstan is normally given to the mainmast belaying pin rail.</li>
<li>No ship is known to have ever been called <i>the Black Pearl</i>; however a ship with a similar name, <i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Pearl_05a0.html" title="HMS Pearl">HMS Pearl</a></i>, played an important part in the history of <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piracy_in_the_Caribbean_f28a.html" title="Piracy in the Caribbean">piracy in the Caribbean</a>, capturing the notorious pirate <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackbeard.html" title="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/1/1718.html" title="1718">1718</a>.</li>
