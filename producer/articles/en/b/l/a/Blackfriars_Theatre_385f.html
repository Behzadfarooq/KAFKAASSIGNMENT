<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfriars_Theatre_385f.html" title="Edit section: First Theatre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Theatre</span></h2>
<p>The Blackfriars Theatres were built on the grounds of the former <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Order_2f62.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominican</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a>; the black robes worn by members of this order lent the neighbourhood, and theatres, their name. In the pre-Reformation Tudor years, the site was used not only for religious but also for political functions--perhaps most notably, the divorce trial of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> which would, more than a century later, be reenacted in the same room by Shakespeare's company. After Henry's <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">expropriation</a> of monastic property, the monastery became the property of the crown; control of the property was granted to Thomas Cawarden, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_the_Revels_8dcd.html" title="Master of the Revels">Master of the Revels</a>. Cawarden used part of the monastery as Revels offices; other parts he sold or leased to the neighbourhood's wealthy residents, including <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Brooke%2C_10th_Baron_Cobham_57b3.html" title="William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham">Lord Cobham</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cheke_0e18.html" title="John Cheke">John Cheke</a>. After Cawarden's death, the property passed to Sir William More. In <a href="../../../1/5/7/1576.html" title="1576">1576</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Farrant_ffeb.html" title="Richard Farrant">Richard Farrant</a>, then Master of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George%27s_Chapel_at_Windsor_Castle_cb32.html" title="St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle">Windsor Chapel</a> leased part of the former <a href="../../../b/u/t/Buttery_%28shop%29.html" title="Buttery (shop)">buttery</a> from More in order to stage plays. As often in the theatrical practice of the time, this commercial enterprise was justified by the convenient fiction of royal necessity; Farrant claimed to need the space for his child choristers to practice plays for the Queen, but he also staged plays for paying audiences. The theatre was small, perhaps 46 feet long and 25 feet wide (14 by 8 metres), and admission, compared to public theatres, expensive (apparently four<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_One_Penny_coin_6587.html" title="British One Penny coin">pence</a>); both these factors limited attendance at the theatre to a fairly select group of well-to-do gentry and nobles.</p>
<p>For his playing company, Farrant combined his Windsor children with the Children of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel_Royal_998d.html" title="Chapel Royal">Chapel Royal</a>, then directed by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hunnis_a69f.html" title="William Hunnis">William Hunnis</a>. Relatively little is known of their repertoire, except that it presumably included works by Farrant and perhaps Hunnis. The landlord More appears to have remained patient with this use of his property until shortly before Farrant's death in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1580.html" title="1580">1580</a>, when More attempted to prove that his tenant had broken the lease. This attempt came to nothing; supported by a letter from <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Dudley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester_376b.html" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert Dudley</a>, the widow Ann Farrant was allowed to lease the theater to Hunnis. Hunnis continued to produce plays at the site until <a href="../../../1/5/8/1583.html" title="1583">1583</a>, when he sold his lease to Henry Evans. There followed a confused period of legal actions involving Hunnis, Ann Farrant, Evans, and More. The result, apparently orchestrated by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_de_Vere%2C_17th_Earl_of_Oxford_a5f3.html" title="Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford">Edward de Vere</a>, the Earl of Oxford, placed the theater under the control of Hunnis and de Vere's secretary, playwright John Lyly. Lyly's plays and others were, for a year or two, performed at the theatre before production at court. In <a href="../../../1/5/8/1585.html" title="1585">1585</a>, however, More obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease. The theatre was shut down after this judgement for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The second Blackfriars was an indoor theatre built elsewhere on the property at the instigation of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Burbage_4ae9.html" title="James Burbage">James Burbage</a>, father of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burbage_046c.html" title="Richard Burbage">Richard Burbage</a>, and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impresario.html" title="Impresario">impresario</a> of the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Men_4a27.html" title="Lord Chamberlain's Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>. In <a href="../../../1/5/9/1596.html" title="1596">1596</a>, Burbage purchased, for £600, the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refectory.html" title="Refectory">frater</a> of the former priory and rooms below. This large space, perhaps 100 feet long and 50 wide (30 by 15 metres), with high ceilings allowed Burbage to construct two galleries, substantially increasing potential attendance. As Burbage built, however, a petition from the residents of the wealthy neighbourhood persuaded the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_England_2d57.html" title="Privy Council of England">Privy Council</a> to forbid playing there; the letter was signed even by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carey%2C_2nd_Baron_Hunsdon_6702.html" title="George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon">Lord Hunsdon</a>, patron of Burbage's company. The company was absolutely forbidden to perform there.</p>
<p>Three years later, Richard Burbage was able to lease the property to Henry Evans, the lawyer who had been among those ejected more fifteen years earlier. Evans entered a partnership with Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal. They used the theatre for a commercial enterprise with a group called the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_the_Chapel_7c74.html" title="Children of the Chapel">Children of the Chapel</a>, which combined the choristers of the chapel with other boys, many taken up from local grammar schools under colour of Giles's warrant to provide entertainment for the Queen. The dubious legality of these dramatic <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressment.html" title="Impressment">impressments</a> led to a challenge from a father in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600.html" title="1600">1600</a>; however, this method brought the company some of its most famous actors, including <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Field_1143.html" title="Nathaniel Field">Nathaniel Field</a> and Salmon Pavy. The residents did not protest this use, probably because of perceived social differences between the adult and child companies.</p>
<p>While it housed this company, Blackfriars was the site of an explosion of innovative drama and staging. Together with its competitor, Paul's Children, the Blackfriars company produced plays by a number of the most talented young dramatists of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature_in_English_9029.html#Jacobean_literature" title="Literature in English">Jacobean</a> literature, among them <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Middleton_4ab2.html" title="Thomas Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Chapman_cdb7.html" title="George Chapman">George Chapman</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Marston_0c19.html" title="John Marston">John Marston</a>. Chapman and Jonson wrote almost exclusively for Blackfriars in this period, while Marston began with Paul's but switched to Blackfriars, in which he appears to have been a sharer, by around <a href="../../../1/6/0/1605_in_literature.html" title="1605 in literature">1605</a>. In the latter half of the decade, the company at Blackfriars premiered plays by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Beaumont_9b82.html" title="Francis Beaumont">Francis Beaumont</a> (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Knight_of_the_Burning_Pestle_95db.html" title="The Knight of the Burning Pestle">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</a></i>) and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fletcher_%28playwright%29_50c2.html" title="John Fletcher (playwright)">John Fletcher</a> (<i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>) that, although failures in their first production, marked the first significant appearance of these two dramatists, whose work would profoundly affect early Stuart drama. The new plays of all these playwrights deliberately pushed the accepted boundaries of personal and social satire, of violence on stage, and of sexual frankness. These plays appear to have attracted members of a higher social class than was the norm at the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankside.html" title="Bankside">Bankside</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoreditch.html" title="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a> theatres, and the admission price (<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_sixpence_coin.html" title="British sixpence coin">sixpence</a> for a cheap seat) probably excluded the poorer patrons of the amphitheatres. Prefaces and internal references speak of gallants and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inns_of_Court_c340.html" title="Inns of Court">Inns of Court</a> men, who came not only to see a play but also, of course, to be seen; the private theatres sold seats on the stage itself.</p>
<p>The Blackfriars playhouse was also the source of other innovations which would profoundly change the nature of English commercial staging: it was among the first commercial theatrical enterprises to rely on artificial lighting, and it featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston's <i><a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcontent.html" title="Malcontent">The Malcontent</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/6/0/1604_in_literature.html" title="1604 in literature">1604</a>) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time.</p>
<p>In the years around the turn of the century, the children's companies were something of a phenomenon; a reference in <i><a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i> to "little eyasses" suggests that even the adult companies felt threatened by them. By the later half of that decade, the fashion had changed somewhat. In <a href="../../../1/6/0/1608_in_literature.html" title="1608 in literature">1608</a>, Burbage's company (by this time, the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Men_74c1.html" title="King's Men">King's Men</a>) took possession of the theatre, which they still owned, this time without objections from the neighbourhood. There were originally seven sharers in the reorganised theatre: Richard Burbage, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Condell_6224.html" title="Henry Condell">Henry Condell</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Heminges_8731.html" title="John Heminges">John Heminges</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Sly_a31d.html" title="William Sly">William Sly</a>, all members of the King's Men, plus <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Burbage_1f1b.html" title="Cuthbert Burbage">Cuthbert Burbage</a> and Thomas Evans, agent for the theatre manager Henry Evans. Sly, however, died soon after the arrangement was made, and his share was divided among the other six.</p>
<p>After renovations, the King's Men began using the theatre for performances in <a href="../../../1/6/0/1609.html" title="1609">1609</a>. Thereafter the King's Men played in Blackfriars for the seven months in winter, and at the Globe during the summer. Blackfriars appears to have brought in a little over twice the revenue of the Globe; the shareholders could earn as much as £13 from a single performance, apart from what went to the actors.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the reign of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>, even <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Henrietta_Maria_7eea.html" title="Queen Henrietta Maria">Queen Henrietta Maria</a> was in the Blackfriars audience. On May 13, <a href="../../../1/6/3/1634.html" title="1634">1634</a> she and her attendants saw a play by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Massinger_b784.html" title="Philip Massinger">Philip Massinger</a>; in late <a href="../../../1/6/3/1635.html" title="1635">1635</a> or early <a href="../../../1/6/3/1636.html" title="1636">1636</a> they saw <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodowick_Carlell_eff5.html" title="Lodowick Carlell">Lodowick Carlell</a>'s <i>Arviragus and Philicia, part 2;</i> and they attended a third performance in May of 1636.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The theatre closed at the onset of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, and was demolished in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1655.html" title="1655">1655</a>.</p>

<p>The nature of Burbage's modifications to his purchase is not clear, and the many contemporary references to the theatre do not offer a precise picture of its design. Once fitted for playing, the space may have been about 66 feet long and 46 feet wide (20 by 14 metres), including <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_room.html" title="Green room">tiring areas</a>. There were at least two and possibly three galleries, and perhaps a number of stage boxes adjacent to the stage. Estimates of its capacity have varied from below 600 to almost 1000, depending on the number of galleries and boxes.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Perhaps as many as ten spectators would have encumbered the stage.</p>
