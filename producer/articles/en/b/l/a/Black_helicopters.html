<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_helicopters.html" title="Edit section: Black helicopter facts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Black helicopter facts</span></h2>
<p>The following are facts and explanations provided by various organizations and experts, including government agencies, regarding the alleged black helicopters:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least some sightings of black helicopters are very likely to have been helicopters on exercises and/or missions. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Armed_Services_532e.html" title="United States Armed Services">American military</a> does in fact operate helicopters painted in black or dark colors, particularly the <a href="../../../m/h/-/MH-53_Pave_Low_e56b.html" title="MH-53 Pave Low">Pave Low</a> which is optimized for long-range stealthy insertion and extraction of personnel, including combat search and rescue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Army and National Guard helicopters painted olive drab will appear to be black in the reddish light of <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn.html" title="Dawn">dawn</a> or <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusk.html" title="Dusk">dusk</a>, or under other low light conditions during the day when their shadow side is viewed against the sky with the <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_eye.html" title="Naked eye">naked eye</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Real black helicopters do exist. Some of them are flown by units of the Army National Guard and are actually black (not dark olive or chocolate brown) when seen in ordinary light.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Army regularly conducts both exercises and operational missions in United States <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace.html" title="Airspace">airspace</a>. Some of these exercises have taken place in densely populated areas, including <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Most operational missions are tasked in narcotics interdiction in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwestern_United_States_dabc.html" title="Southwestern United States">American Southwest</a> and out of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. By extensive use of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Positioning_System_428c.html" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_vision.html" title="Night vision">night vision</a> equipment, as well as other classified means, they are able to fly in zero <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visibility.html" title="Visibility">visibility</a> conditions with no running lights. At this high intensity level of operation, training is necessarily almost as dangerous to pilots, other air traffic, and the public as actual combat. Frequent practice is necessary to retain proficiency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Many <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_contractor.html" title="Defense contractor">defense contractors</a> and helicopter manufacturers also conduct public <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_test.html" title="Flight test">flight testing</a> of aircraft and components or fly aircraft in public view to test ranges or other corporate airfields for training or demonstrations. Occasionally, some of these aircraft will be made for military clients and are painted in black or dark colors.</li>
