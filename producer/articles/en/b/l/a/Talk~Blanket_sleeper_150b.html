<p>I reverted the addition of GaggoHaas to the list of brands. The brands list is for prominent, mainstream, mass-produced brands, not small-scale web businesses. The latter should go in the Web Businesses section. (In fact GaggoHaas is already there.)</p>

<p>I removed the part about infantile fetishes, because not everyone who desires to havea pair of these pajamas has a desire to wear diapers or in any way act like a baby. My husband wants a pair of these, because he has fond childhood memories of putting his footed feet on a warm radiator on a cold winter night. This is no different than having a cup of hot chocolate with marshmellows on a cold winter night.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I put it back. The passage didn't say that every adult who likes to wear sleepers is a fetishist, much less an infantilist; just that "much" of the demand for sleepers in adult sizes is related to fetishism (which is true). If you think the article places too much emphasis on fetishism relative to other reasons adults might want to wear sleepers (which may be a valid criticism), I would suggest, rather than deleting useful information, a better solution would be to add some new text saying that there are reasons other than fetishism, and what those reasons are (such as you did in your above comment).Anonymous55 18:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I moved the sentence regarding cotton sleepers and internet businesses from the "Features" section to the "Design considerations" section (and also re-phrased it a bit). The "Features" section is meant merely to describe what a typical sleeper looks like for someone who's never seen one, and IMO shouldn't go into detail about rare exceptions and unusual features (which comes later in the article). All of the internet sleeper businesses put together represent a tiny fraction of the overall market, so the fact that some of them offer sleepers in cotton IMO doesn't merit being mentioned that early in the article.Anonymous55 20:05, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I moved the paragraph about Halloween baby costumes from the "Costume sleepers" subsection of the "Variations" section to the "Design considerations" section (and re-phrased a bit). The "Variations" section is supposed to be for variations in the design/features of the sleeper itself, rather than variations in how sleepers are used. When someone wears a sleeper as part of a baby costume, usually the sleeper itself is perfectly normal, so a paragraph about baby costumes doesn't really fit into what that section is about.Anonymous55 21:10, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the <i>Stretch n Grow</i> reference, as I don't think it's really relevant here. Based on the description, and what I was able to find with some Googling, the <i>Stretch n Grow</i> appears to be a general-purpose garment, rather than specifically a type of sleepwear. It seems to be the equivilent of what in the US would be called a <a href="../../../o/n/e/Onesie.html" title="Onesie">onesie</a>, creeper, bodysuit, coverall, or <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romper_suit.html" title="Romper suit">romper</a>, all of which are rather distinct from a blanket sleeper.</p>
<p>If there's a New Zealand analogue to the British <i>sleepsuit</i>, it would be good to include that in the article. The article does mention a couple of garments that aren't sleepwear (i.e. <i>pram suit</i>), but only to dinstinguish them from blanket sleepers. Giving a regional synonym for a garment that isn't a type of sleepwear, and is no more closely related to a blanket sleeper than a onesie/creeper/etc. is, seems to me a bit of a stretch. I wouldn't want to see this article turn into a catch-all for any one-piece infant garment.Anonymous55 21:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Olwak, regarding your edits to the opening paragraph:</p>
<p>There's already a paragraph in the opening section that mentions the existence of sleepers in adult sizes, with a pointer to an entire section detailing sizing and availability issues. Your insertion of "the garment exists for all ages" in the first paragraph is therefore redundant. It's also much too early to mention that in the second sentence. There's a lot of information that has to be covered in the article, and it can't all be covered in the first couple of sentences. For that reason the article has to start with generalities, and then go into details and exceptions later. The ratio of sleepers made in children's vs. adult sizes is easily 100 to 1 or more. Most people in the US don't even know that adult-size sleepers exist. That being the case, "commonly worn by infants and young children", without any further qualification, is perfectly accurate and not at all misleading. It doesn't imply that adult-size sleepers don't exist at all, just that they're not common (which is true). With your edit, the opening sentence, taken in isolation, is quite misleading to someone not familiar with the topic (people outside the US and Canada for example). If you don't say a garment is for children, the default implication is that it's for adults, or for both children and adults but at least as much for adults as for children. The first sentence, which is the most important, and should be the most carefully crafted sentence in the article, is now critically dependent on the second sentence to be understood correctly, which is bad.</p>
<p>And why did you move the warning about disturbing material into the middle of the list of web businesses? That's just bizarre. Anonymous55 18:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
