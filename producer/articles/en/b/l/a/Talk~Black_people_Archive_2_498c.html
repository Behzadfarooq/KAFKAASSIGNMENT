<dd>Here we go with this again. Ethiopians are negroid. To say that Ethiopians are not negroid and are more Caucasian is based on a foolish 21st century revised notion of Caucasoid. Caucasoid, as merely referring to skull shapes, is not relevant in this article. 1. Caucasoid skull shapes NOW are defined in such a way as to INSURE that practically ALL White Europeans fit within this category, thus, the category must be expanded greatly and will thus include many non-white people. Imagine if the Caucasoid definition was more neutral, it would then exclude some middle easterners and Europeans. Since the anthropological community over the past 50 years or so could not accept that, they decided (probably with Coon's own initiative) to simply expand it. What would it take to make ALL Europeans considered to be "Caucasoid"? Well, it would take the inclusion of so many non-White people, to the point that the people of Ethiopia and RWANDA are included. Trust me, if Italian skulls were more shaped like Black South Africans, the Zulu would be called Caucasoids to this very day. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:06, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I stand corrected. EditingOprah has taken the ideology of using Eurocentric approximations of DNA analyses and I suppose now we have to agree with you Cluckbang. Ethiopians are not Black.

<dd>What are you talking about Zaph? As I said, we shouldn't use terms like "Negroid" and "Caucasoid." Note that Caucasoid is only apt in describing Ethiopian skull shapes. When it comes to limb ratios, Horn Africans are characterised as "Super-Negroid." Genetics, however, does not bear out the idea that Ethiopians are not black. Maternally, lineages all developed <i>in situ</i>. Paternally, the only non-Horn African lineage present in the region is Haplogroup J, which is present only in semitic speakers. However, the majority is of the type J-M267, which entered the region during the Neolithic and is connected to the sub-Saharan tied <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natufian.html" title="Natufian">Natufian</a> culture of the Levant. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 05:22, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow all of that... how about this? Why not just look at the Ethiopian, ask them, and pay attention to how they interact. I think that would make it easier to determine if they are black or not. All of this M257 and what not? Why do we have to go through all of that to determine the group ethnicity of people? Are they black or not? They are Black.

<dd>What's nonsensical about wanting to limit an article about the Black race, to the people who actually form a race? Your argument about including anyone dark skinned means the White people article should include anyone light skinned, including North East Asians. But I don't see you advocating that. So if my views are nonsensical, your views are hypocritical. And for the record, I do agree that Ethiopians are Black, but extenting Blackness all the way to South Asians and Australoids robs the concept of Blackness of any genetic, cultural, or historical continuity.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 04:47, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Since when?</span></h2>
<p>The article says 'A "Black" is a person with a majority of ancestors that lived in sub-Saharan Africa at least until 1492- a date that marks the start of massive population movement. Melanesians, Negritos, South Asians, and Australian aboriginals often have darker skin than many black people and for this reason are incorrectly described as Black but their genetic history is very different.'</p>
<p>Every dictionary I've looked at (English and American) says that 'black' refers to dark skin colour. Anyway, I was just wondering where this idea comes from.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 17:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first dictionary I could find (Dictionary.com) defines Black as "Of or belonging to a racial group having brown to black skin, especially one of African origin: the Black population of South Africa. Of or belonging to an American ethnic group descended from African peoples having dark skin; African-American."</p>
<p>Also, scientists equate blacks with sub-Saharan Africa, as other dark skinned peoples are very unrelated to those in Africa. It doesn't make sense to write an article about all people who who have nothing more in common than color. You might as well include Northern Chinese in the article about White people since Northern Chinese have white skin or you might as well write an article called brown people lumping lighter skinned Africans in with Italians and Middle Easterners. If you want a general discussion on all dark skinned people, start an article called "Dark people" but I think this article is far better off if we keep the discussion precise and relevant. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that when those dictionary definitions were first created, people assumed that Negritoes and others were actually related to Africans. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it was just a request for information, I'm in no way suggesting that there should be an article called 'dark people'. I've personally never understood the need for people to classify people into 'races'. The way people use the term 'black', it seems to be less about ancestry and more about sub-division based on differences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the definition you cited focused mainly on the skin colour, with only an emphasis on a specific ancestry. It's easy to see why someone would wonder why the usage to donote skin colour, whist prevalent, is classed as incorrect. Just thought I'd ask.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for the responses.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 18:30, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well then I must be a racist, Ethiopians and other Semitic people located in eastern africa are not of negro classification. Perhaps in a line up of various African people's from below the sahara the Ethiopians would stand out possibly in skin tone and facial structure.

<dd>We are not talking about northern Europeans with dark skin(!), but about Papua New Guineans, Indigenous Australians, Torres Strait Islanders, Andamese Islanders and other non-African peoples who are not only black, but self-identify as such. "Black" can either be an ascription placed on peoples based on subjective criteria of what Black is, or it can be adopted as an identity by individuals within the groups in question.

<p>The fact that dictionaries say "especially one of African origin" means that although there are certain less precise and less formal uses of the word "black", having an "African origin" is the more precise use of the word, and as an encyclopedia, we have to give far greater weight to formal definitions, especially formal definitions that are used by mainstream scientists, not informal definitions used by some singer in Australia. Also, keep in mind that black is a RACIAL classification, which means it describes a set of traits that are correlated through a common genetic history. Scientists have known for at least the past decade and a half that the Oceanic people do NOT have the same genetic history as Africans. They left Africa around the same time as proto-Europeans did, it's just that Europeans migrated North and acquired white skin. But genetically, the Oceanic people are part of the non-African branch of homo S. Sapians and have more genetically in common with Europeans than they do with with any ethnic group in Sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, before the days of genetic reasearch, some may have looked at their appearance and assumed they were part of the black race, but we now that this assumption was incorrect and to lump unrelated people into a single racial category is a total contradiction, because race is defined by common ancestry. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:35, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all Australian aboriginals never identified themselves as black. This was a term imposed on them by a minority of white people at a time when knowledge of genetics was limited. Second of all, even if some people wish to associate themselves with black culture and use their dark complexions as an opportunity to do so, does not mean we have to induldge them. This is an encyclopedia, not an uncritical promotional venue for trendy political opinions based on scientific ignorance. Wikipedia can't be everything to everyone, and it most certainly shouldn't contradict itself by including people with very different ancestry into a single race. I know anyone in the world is free to edit wikipedia, but that doesn't mean we have to go to the lowest common demoninator when defining terms that can much better be defined by major advances in genetic research. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 16:11, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course Australian Aboriginals never defined themselves as black. Europeans had not arrived to illustrate white-ness. But now they do. Got a problem? Well to inform everyone, many people Australian Aboriginal descent self-identify as black - I thought that was the point of this Wikipedia - to accumulate current knowledge of all users. And I'm not even revealing the tone of my skin! <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiftaling_ea09.html" title="User:Shiftaling">Shiftaling</a> 16:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the page for 'white people'&#160;: "Black" or "brown" people came to be defined by having darker skin than a "White" person, and the same "color" came to be applied to all non-white people. i.e. "Black" is a European term for the people that Europe colonised all over the world - Are you saying that Australian Aborigines are "white" - if so, visit my place and expect a vocal discussion on the matter. "White" and "Black" are terms that are highly contested and therefore we should let Wikipedia consensus resolve the issue. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiftaling_ea09.html" title="User:Shiftaling">Shiftaling</a> 16:49, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many males self-identify as females (they're called crossdressers) but that doesn't mean we have to grant them the power to contradict biology nor does it mean we have to include them in the definition of female. The idea that Australian aboriginals are black came from racial prejudice (people who did not know anything about genetics, prejudged their genetic heritage based on superficial features). The fact that this idea still lives on among a tiny minority of the world's population is a product of ignorance, and wikipedia is not a forum for repeating misconceptions. The evidence is very clear. Humans started in sb-Saharan Africa. Those that left earliest formed other races, those with ancestors that stayed longer are the black race. All the scientists are now in agreement. All the dictionaries define black with emphasis on Africa. There's no longer really any argument. Now we can certainly mention historical misconception about the black race, but since this is an article devoted to a particular race, it's very important that we not contradict the meaning of the word race which is "common ancestry". The ancestry of Oceanic people has more in common with Europeans than with Africans, so lumping all dark people into a single race shows a shocking level of ignorance. It's also very POV to include any group that some feel looks "black" into this article. The definition of black must be precise and scientific if this aticle is to remain neutral and informative. Political correctness is not a substitute for scientific accuracy. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 16:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To speak about political correctness in the way you do, yet to go to an impossibly politically correct method of scientific observation simply amazes me. The science is not the issue. The interpretation of what we consider to be 'valid' and 'relevant' is the issue. I am not going to believe that Blackness should be defined by DNA interpretations, which BTW are thus relied on by white geneticists classifying the different genes in areas they feel is convenient for their sensibilities. And you make error, how is it that the Oceanic people, who resemeble Black people in so many ways, have more in common with White people? I know of no European who even saw the Pacific Ocean before the 15th century. Where-as, on the other hand we know that the people of Madagascar speak a language that is almost identical to those of Borneo Indonesia. And yes, that activity went both ways, they didn't just come TO Africa. The neutrality of this article is dependant on how much we rely on the sensibilities of non-black people. If we choose to listen to a non-black Australian contributor vs speaking directly to a Black Aboriginal who is a part of his Aborignal community (instead of one who was raised outside of it), then this article loses it's neutrality. If we however speak to various people who are there, who are involved in their community and explain their cultural identity as black, then we are being neutral. But this... this thing where some white guy goes and points to the African and says "ok you're black" and then the African-American "ok you're black" and then to the Australian and East Indian "no, you're not black because I actually made that term up for you and it's not right for it to be used to describe you." All of this objection to using Black on people outside of Africa and African-Ameiricans... it's absurd and stinks of prejudice. Prejudice on two levels. 1. Reaffirming some still stinky notion that Black Africans and African Americans are the least desirable kind of humans... stay away from them, don't identify with them. 2. Insisting on maintaing a psychological seperation between Black Africans and other Asians, even though they share so much in common! It's a matter of imposing a foreign psychological will on those who would otherwise be interested to know how much they share in common. If you ignore Runoko Rashidi's photographs that show Indonesians and Thailanders that look like they came from Nigeria, and if you ignore the fact that Chinese, Arab, and East African cultures interacted with each other before Columbus, then you are acting out of fear and ignorance.

<p>Yeah you tell any black person "I know you think you're black but really, you're not" and witness the response. Good encyclopedias of the past were written from a certain academic viewpoint. This one has the potential to be MUCH MORE. Talk about genetic history of the human race in one section and talk about culture in another. Don't get all HUNG UP that your definition of race is questioned. People that say they are black have a perfect right to say so given the cultural context of their community.

<dd>There is no "formal scientific" meaning of "black". For example <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Black_Sambo_8e1f.html" title="Little Black Sambo">Little Black Sambo</a> was an Indian. There is a formal definition of <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroid.html" title="Negroid">Negroid</a> according to the traditional "five race" model, but this is not the "Negroid" article, it's about the usage of the word "black" <i>as applied</i> to various human population groups. Modern genetics indicates that the peoples of Africa are far more genetically diverse than the rest of the world's populations, which makes any scientific claim that this a coherent "black" race very problematic. There is no evidence that I know of which suggests that "the ancestry of Oceanic people has more in common with Europeans than with Africans", since Australoid peoples are widely regarded as descendents of an out-migration that preceded that which now dominates Eurasia. What's ironic about this talk page is the intensely contradictory paranoia. The person who wrote the (totally unreferenced) "Criticisms" section seems to believe that not <i>extending</i> the term black to cover all kinds of populations is a "Eurocentric" plot by whites to prevent the rise of a mass international black consciousness (!) <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> seems to think that "black" can only apply to something called "sub-Saharan Africans". Well no one doubts that the majority of people labelled as Black have such ancestry, and that's what most dictionaries say. But they also say that it's the majority, but not all, by a long way. The notion that "the idea that Australian aboriginals are black came from racial prejudice" is laughable. It came from the fact that they had dark skin!

<dd>It puzzles me too. We should be able to discuss the genetics of polulation-typing and the history of race classifications without controversy. We can also discuss how people self-identify in different cultures, and why in some cases it's common to embrace a black identity, while in others is more typically rejected. But some editors are obssessed with a belief that there is a "true" definition and that all others are misleading. The same problems occur over and over again in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_%28people%29.html" title="White (people)">White (people)</a> article, which is now beset by someone who insists that only peoples who created "Western Civilisation" can count as white (All Muslim peoles are automatically excluded apparently, even Balkan Muslims). <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 18:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is exactly why I asked my question above. I didn't however, expect to open this can of worms... I've always used the term black to refer to dark skinned people, and white to refer to light skinned people, and have always felt confident about doing so. At the same time, I've never seen it as a racial thing. To me, the distinction is on the same level as classifying someone as blond or brunnette. The dictionary definitions I've seen back this up.</p>
<p>Up until I read this article, I never even considered that black might be restricted to people of a common ancestry. I've always found the term 'African-American' to be strange, as I've heard it applied to people who are dark skinned, but definately not African in origin. To me, this is indicative of the fact that people, in everyday life, categorise people as black based on their skin colour, and won't usually ask for an ethnic history in order to back up their assumption.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that the term black should rightfully apply to anyone with dark skin (I'm not going to argue about that point), but it is through 'misuse' of language that English has evolved to what it is today. This is especially evident when you consider American and British English. The split was relatively recent, yet, so many words have different meanings.</p>
<p>Just something to consider.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 02:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have yet to see a dictionary that includes Australian aboriginals in the defintion of black, and I have yet to see a dictionary that doesn't focus on Africans when defining blacks. Wikipedia is an excyclopedia and must be limited to dictionary definitions. Every anthropology book I've read makes the point that although Australian aboriginals look like blacks, Africans and Autralians aboriginals are actually very VERY different groups. Now a long time ago this article was focused on Africans. Only later did people add other groups and made the word virtually meaningless. The term black does not literally mean black. In fact some blacks are albinos so get rid of this notion that we're talking only about color and realize black is a racial category. Yes sub-Saharans are the most diverse race on Earth, but they still form a distinct race on the genetic level and one that most certainly does not include Australian aboriginals.

<dd>I don't have to make coherent arguements because wikipedia has already made them for me. Wikipedia clearly states that we must go by established dictionary definitions such as the found here [<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Black+race" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Black+race" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] which clearly describes blacks as peoples of African ancestry. Your definition of black is not only contradicted by the dictionary but also by every population geneticist in the world. There's also medical books that describe black people because medical applications differ by racial genetics, and any doctor would be horrofied by the application of such medicine to dark skinned Caucasians (East Indians) or Australoids because both of these groups have a very different genetic history, because the African/non-African split is a very clear one in population genetics. You guys want us to write a encyclopedia article based upon the fact that some non-Africans think its cool to call themselves black, or based on archaic children's books and Australian folklore and racist myths that stereotyped all dark-skinned people, or based on Afrocentric ideas that all dark skinned people are Africans. It's fine to create subsections for these ideas, but they certainly shouldn't be in the introduction.

<p>And yes Paul D, we know that Australoids were called black because they're dark, but the assumption was based upon early white explorers who thought that all dark skinned people are part of a common genetic stock related to Africans.

<p>Yes but your definition defines black as a racial term. Race implies a genetic relation. By lumping all dark skinned people into the black race you are implying a genetic group that doesn't exist and making wikipedia look very foolish. Thus it makes far more sense to define the black race as sub-Saharan Africans because not only are they coherent (though diverse) genetic group that is recognized by doctors and geneteicists, but that's also how the dictionary defines black. This shouldn't even be an argument. Wikipeidia policy is to use stanadard dictionary definitions. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But you have to be able to differentiate formal from less formal definitions, otherwise we would have to include the black Irish in this article which no one is advocating. When they say especially of African ancestry, that means African ancestry is the formal definitions and formal definitions are what encyclopedia's use. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And check out the definition from the free dictionary:</p>
<p>Noun 1. Black race - a dark-skinned race Negro race, Negroid race race - people who are believed to belong to the same genetic stock; "some biologists doubt that there are important genetic differences between races of human beings" Black person, blackamoor, Negro, Negroid, Black - a person with dark skin who comes from Africa (or whose ancestors came from Africa)</p>

<p>black - of or belonging to a racial group having dark skin especially of sub-Saharan African origin; "a great people--a black people--...injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization"- Martin Luther King Jr. Antonyms: white, caucasian, caucasoid, light-skinned</p>
<p>Once again they say ESPECIALLY sub-Saharan implying this is the FORMAL definition. Also they list Caucasoid as an anotym which means that the term black does not include dark skinned Caucasians such as East Indians. The common demominator in all these definitions is Africans, and the racial split between Africans and non-Africans is further confirmed by all the modern genetic research and also by medical applications. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, not every dictionary says 'especially'.

<dd>The only reason Africans might be referenced 'especially' in some dictionaries is because the term will most often be applied to them. This, doesn't however, mean that that is the formal definition. In fact, Dictionary.com have a standard practice of marking some terms specifically as informal, meaning, what's left unmarked mustn't be informal. It's not to much of a leap to decide that if something isn't informal, it is formal.</dd>

<dd>Well I think we do need to discuss the word "especially". To me when a dictionary says "especially" they mean: although the word sometimes has this meaning, the following is the more common meaning. Wikipedia is not supposed to give undue weight to fringe ideas, and thus we really should give more weight to more common definitions, those that are used especially. And what's the alternative? To include every group ever decribed as black including the black Irish. The black Irish actually have more right to be in this article than Australoids do, because at least they were mentioned in your dictionary definitions. You might also want to look up the word "race" because you'll find that the definition Ezeu wants to use is oxymoronic because it decribes blacks as a race including Africans and Australian aboriginals. However the term race means common ancestry and while sub-Saharan Africans enjoy a common ancestry, Australoids have more in common with the black Irish. Look, I know people who are interested in these topics have political agendas, but let's please stay objective and scientific when writing for wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 01:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not trying to obfuscate, I'm trying to show through objective reasoning what happens when we include less formal definitions of "black people"-we end up including the black Irish. Not only do dictionaries emphasize (sometimes exclusively) the importance of African ancestry when defining black, but all the genetic research and biomedical reasearch makes a distinction between Africans and non-Africans. I'm not sure what's motivating you to argue so persistently to include genetically unrelated groups like Australoids, and contradict the meaning of the word race in the process. Why is it so important to you to describe non-Africans as black? Just find another word y'all. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the first I've heard about South East Asians being black. None of the dictionaries define blacks the way you want to define them, and even if we ignore English language and focus on genetics, the race you describe (i.e. Africans + Oceanic people) has no biological reality. And it was your definition that fixated on the black race, since your definition states at the outset that black is racial ethnic classification. And yes it's true that Africans have more genetic diversity than any other major racial group, but the split between Africans and non-Africans is the oldest, best confirmed, and most established split in human genetic history, so to try to deny that Africans form a genetic group is kind of pointless. And because there's o much diversity among Africans, there's really no need to include dark-skinned non-Africans, which itself is POV because as the black irish example showed, which one do you include and which ones you exclude. There's nothing wrong with the black race, so I'm not sure why people wish to water it down to the point where it doesn't exist or pretend it's only a social construction. You don't see white people doing that. They take pride in their racial heritage to the point where some believe you must be 100% white to be considered white. I don't see white people pretending to be related to people they're not related to. And South East Asians listen up. South East Asians need to take pride in their South East Asian ancestry. I suspect that calling themselves black (which very few of them do btw) is just a way for South East Asian youth to rebel against percieved European domination, associate themselves with the civil rights movement, or they're ashamed of their own heritage so they want to identify with a race that is often glamorized in sports and music videos.

<p>I am being proud of what I am. That's just it. You cannot accept something. Black people exist in Oceania, Southeast Asia, India, and so forth. You do not relinquish your Asian identity by claiming that you are Black. That's the whole point you are missing. This whole thing about forcing Black to be synonymous with "Continentally African Only" is absurd. Have you ever heard of the book "The Black Untouchables of India"? Written by a East Indian named <a href="../../../v/2E/t/V.T._Rajshekar_f11e.html" title="V.T. Rajshekar">V.T._Rajshekar</a>. There is a picture of him. That is a black man. Period. He views himself as Black. There are like 200 million of these black people in India. Yet I wonder if that high number is what motivates you to say "no they are not black!" If more and more humans view themselves as Black, somehow those who view themselves as white or not-black feel threatened by this. Also, this is a myth: The word "Black" didn't exist as a word to describe a human until the European came along. The fact is that the word black (Cush, Zanj, Ani/Ayn, etc) has been around for eons. It's not some kind of thing to avoid using. No one is disdainful of the word "white". Heck, Egyptian stories speak of the Kushites and the Nehesi. Words that mean "Black". The Jewish Bible speaks of Kushites with sun-burnt skin. The old white man in Europe didn't invent this concept or the term. I don't even know why people... oh yes I remember, we are hooked on the notion that 15th century Europeans created races, and had all this power. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:06, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a scientific definition of "black". Only people of Sub-saharan origin are black.</li>
<li>There is no formal scientific definition of "black". "Black" can either be an ascription based on subjective criteria, or it can be adopted as an identity by certain groups. Not only African people are black. Other peoples self-identify as black as well.</li>

As has been pointed out by several editors, there is no "formal scientific" meaning of "black". Papua New Guineans, Indigenous Australians, Torres Strait Islanders, Andamese Islanders and other are not only black, but self-identify as such. It is extreme POV to impose a point of view that there is only one meaning for "black".

It's sometimes used in Genetic studies, but these definitions change and are usually abandoned in favor of simply listing the lineages involved.

<p>The only POV I'm pushing is the POV of the established wikipedia rule that we must follow standard dictionary definitions. Dictionary.com says the term black ESPECIALLY refers to Africans (i.e. the most formal meaning) and the free dictionary describes blacks EXCLUSIVELY in terms of African ancestry[<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Black+race" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Black+race" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]</p>
<p>Further modern genetic research tells us that dark skinned non-Africans are either Caucasian (East Indian) or a separate race entirely (Australian aboriginals) so it's a contradiction in terms to call black a racial-ethnic classification and then proceed to lump racially unrelated people together. The term black refers to Africans. Just because early white explorers assumed all dark skinned people were related to Africans, and just because Afrocentric scholars like the idea of all dark-skinned people being united, does not mean such archaic or ideological view points should trump modern genetetic research and well established dictionary definitions that define black when used formally, as an African ethnicity. It's wonderful that so many dark skinned people around the world want to attach themselves to the black idenity because they connect with the culture but I'm not sure weikipedia is the place to rewrite dictionary definitions, especially definitions backed by genetic research and used in medicine <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 23:59, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my opinion the reason why some people wish to cling to idea that dark-skinned non-Africans are blacks is because some people are uncomfortable with the idea of non-black people getting credit for discovering the non-African world and thus wish to extend the definition of black to include non-Africans. But this is silly because when humans left Africa, they were black, so its not as though black people never discovered any lands. On the contrary, black people discovered almost every land, however they began turning inton non-black people in the process. But this idea that aboriginal peoples of Australia and South East Asia are really long lost members of the black race is an Afrocentric fairy tale. I think its an interesting theory worthy of discussion in the article, but I think putting a theory that falls so far outside mainstream scientific thought as our primary definition is not very professional.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 19:31, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why does everyone assume that anyone wanting to include non-African people in the definition are doing it based on race? Personally, I was basing my arguments on dictionary definitions.

<dd>Well maybe we're experiencing a cultural gap, because I grew up with the term Black directly equating to African ancestry. In fact I had class-mates in school (a black skinned person from Sri Lanka)who others would jokingly describe as black and he would get quite upset about it insisting that he was Sri Lankan, not black. The distinction between being a member of the black race and simply being a black skinned person was very clear. And not to sound like a cultural bully, but if comes down to a choice between an American definition and a British definition, we really have to go with the American one because America's the far more influential country, and thus American conceptions are more mainstream and have a greater impact on the world. Also, since this article describes a racial group, doesn't it make more sense to use the definition that describes an actual racial group, not the definition that describes a bunch dark skinned peoples who belong to totally different races?--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 00:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, you don't have to be racist. You could have simply said 'this is an American Encyclopaedia', but instead you decided to make a short-sighted statement about who has more influence, and who is more 'mainstream'. I'm not going to get into an argument over which country has influenced what.</p>
<p>Secondly, why does this article have to be about race anyway? There is already an article on 'negroids' which is what people here are equating black people with. Why can't this article describe what the dictionary actually describes as black?</p>
<p>To me, it seems like a handful of people have decided 'I think the term black refers to a specific race, so it's fine to interpret the dictionaries loosely to "prove" my point'. The fact of the matter is, dictionaries mark definitions that are informal, and they haven't marked the definition of 'dark skinned' as informal, they've indicated it's slightly less common.</p>
<p>The fact that most dark skinned people in the US are 'African-American' easily explains why black would be used most in their case. You can't decide that especially means 'excluding' or 'the only valid form is', and you can't decide to disregard the other definitions in the dictionaries.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 02:29, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me give you a very clear analogy. Dictionary.com defines a white as "A member of a racial group of people having light skin coloration, especially one of European origin. See Usage Note at black." Now North East Asians are a racial group of people that have skin whiter than most Europeans, but no one would mistake North East Asians for whites based on that definition, because the definition makes clear that although "white" has a vague meaning, it also has a precise one . Similarly when dictionary.com calls a black "a member of a dark skinned race, especially of African origin" all they are saying is that although the term has a vague meanining, it also has a precise one. Encyclopedias have to be precise. Just because the loose easy going culture of Brits and Ausies causes people in a very loose way to point to any dark skinned person and say "hey, that's a black" or just because South Asians may casually say "I'm so dark I'm black" does not mean this definition has much credibility. The reason that there are 2 definitions of black is because some people understood that black was just a metaphor for Africans, while others took in literally. Same reason there are 2 definitions for white. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, black is a term with a scientific meaning. This article is about black people, it's not about the term black. Because the term black has been used in so many ways to describe so many different kinds of people, including the Irish. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also, some people were arguing that there’s too much diversity among sub-Saharan Africans to consider them their own race so we might as well group them with non-African dark-skinned people. But a recent article in the New York Times shows that despite all the diversity in Africa, they do in fact form their own group, and this group is clearly independent of Melanesians. Here’s the quote:</p>
<p><b>Scientists studying the DNA of 52 human groups from around the world have concluded that people belong to five principal groups corresponding to the major geographical regions of the world: Africa, Europe, Asia, Melanesia and the Americas.</b> [<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9500E3DE1E3DF933A15751C1A9649C8B63" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9500E3DE1E3DF933A15751C1A9649C8B63" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]</p>

<dd>Yes, we want to create an article based on mainstream science, and your views clearly are not mainstream. The article in question really proves nothing more than that self-identification can be mapped on to geography, which is hardly surprising. People usually know where their ancestors came from. That does not validate a <i>typology</i>. Anyway, none of this evidence has any relevance to the issue - the history and meaning of the term "black". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 22:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the problem is the term black when used to describe a people has 2 meanings. One is a very generic definition "a member of any dark skinned population" and the other is more precise, scientific, and probably more mainstream and racially relevant definition: "a person of recent African ancestry" (I cited the scientific definition above) But I think we're far better off focusing on the more precise definition because wikipedia articles can only be so long, and the topic will wander all over the place in a very disorganized way if we include all dark skinned peoples. And how dark do you have to be to be a dark-skinned person and who decides and what commonality do all dark skinned people have beyond having dark skin? Also people come to this article looking to read about a certain race of people that has members all over the world. All dark skinned people are not a racial group. The other point is that dark-skinned groups like the Negritoes were only ever described as black because they were assumed to be related to Africans (the term Negrito literally means little Negro). That's why it makes more sense to talk about historical misconceptions of blackness when describing dark skinned people who aren't African. To me it makes for a more interesting article just to talk about Africans because they're original race of human kind, and all the great varieties within that race, medical issues related to that race, the history of that race and how it got spread around the world, all the cultures and languages of the race. But an article simply about a bunch of unrelated and completely different people who are united by nothing more than skin color sounds boring and trivial. It would be like an article about tall people that lumped everyone from the Dutch to certain African tribes into a single category and defined them as an ethnic group. Pointless.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 00:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually this article does validate the idea that Africans are one typology and Melanesians are a different typology. That's because the article shows that there are 5 major genetic groups that are correlated with 5 major geographic regions, and Africans form a single group that is not at all the same group as Melanesians. So the idea of combining Africans and Melanesians into a black race contradicts science, while the precise dictionary definition describing blacks as Africans is consistent with science. So this argument seems kind of lop sided. One one side we have precise dictionary definitions, scientific definitions, and also DNA studies validating those definitions. On the other side we have loose and vague dictionary definitions combined with obscure pop culture references that were started by people either because they assumed all dark people were part of one extended family or because they didn't understand black is a metaphor and took it literally. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, Whatdoyoudo, are you, Kobrakid and Editingoprah one and the same person? Can you be open please? The artcle as presented provides very little evidence at all. We would have to see the detailed data to know whether it provides evidence that "Africans" form a coherent race - whether there is some good reason to lump together the native peoples of, say, Mali and Angola in a single racial category. Even the traditional five race model identified <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capoid.html" title="Capoid">Capoids</a> as separate from Negroids. However, even if you are right it's not relevant to the point at issue. It would be relevant to the Negroid and Capoid articles (or rather to the merged article on the five races that was created recently). But this article is about the use of the term "black" in a racial context, and so must include and discuss all uses. The fact that in America "black" most commonly means "of Sub-Saharan African descent" is one of the meanings we discuss, but it is no more "scientific" than it would be for Native Australians to insist that the term belongs to them and Africans can't call themselves black. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 16:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No we're not all the same person, it's just that we're all working on a related article that whatdoyou started so we have a special interest in this article. I should be asking if you guys are all one person because I've never seen so many people with such an obscure definition of any word gathered in one place in my entire life. Mind you I guess it makes sense since people with a more mainstream perspective wouldn't care enough to debate this topic in the first place. And this is hardly the only study suggesting Africans form their own exclusive racial group. It makes common sense that people genetically isolated on different continents are likely to form their own races since races are a product of genetic isolation. Sub-saharan Africans in particular were isolated by a large desert, and the out of Africa migration was such a major event that some scientists have gone so far as to suggest there are only 2 major races: Africans and non-Africans. And there is no traditional 5 race model. The 5 race model was introduced by Koon who was very controversial. The traditional number has been 3: Negroids, Caucasoids, and Mongoloids (later called blacks, whites, and Orientals). But even under the outdated 3 race model, Australian aboriginals were not lumped in with blacks. Rather they were described as "archaic Caucasians". We now know that they are so divergent that they don't fit anywhere near any of the 3 biggest races, but they're closer to Caucasians than Africans. As for capoids, they were seldom considered sufficiently different from other Africans to form their own race, except in Koon's model. True, they're the most divergent ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa, but they're still much much closer to other Africans than they are to people of any other continent. All the genetic family trees of modern humans show this beyond a shadow of a doubt. Just because Africans are the most diverse population, does not mean they're not a single race. It just means that they're the original race and thus have had more time to form deep subdivisions within that race.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 19:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Koon is a postmodernist artist. You are thinking of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carleton_Coon_0b12.html" title="Carleton Coon">Carleton Coon</a>. He did propose the name, yes, but the distinctiveness of the group was widely accepted. I've no idea who described Austrralians as "archiaic Caucasians". Maybe some theorist once did, but it would be a rather marginal theory. The statement "just because Africans are the most diverse population, does not mean the're not a single race" is almost meaningless. What unites them then? They are not "the original race" either. That's nonsensical. The "original race" no longer exists. Modern Africans are as far away from the earliest humans as everyone else is - unless of course you are implying that they have somehow become "stuck" in an identity that others have moved away from. That's the classic Victorian theory of African retardedness (the "arrested development" theory}.

<p>Now to me this article is about the black race and race means part of a huge extended family, and the groups you wish to lump together are part of a very different extended families who only look similar because they emerged in warm climates. But they have no common ancestry so it makes no sense to describe them as races. For example in some Afrocentric articles you'll sometimes see references to the 2 main branches of the black race: The African and the South East Asian. But anyone who knows what the human family tree looks like knows this is utter nonsense because Africans and South East Asians are nowhere near one another genetically. So you wish to write an article about all the different uses of the term black without telling the reader that the reasoning behind calling Melanesians black has been debunked by modern genetic research? Why not write an article called black skinned people and leave this one for the black race? Or if you really feel strongly about calling Melanesians blacks, then simply say something like "although the term black most commonly refers to the sub-Saharan African race, the melanesian race was at one time believed to be related to the African race, and was for this reason called black, but recent genetic research suggests they're completely unrelated" As for the so-called black Indians, I believe they're related to Melanesians. Look, I know we sound arrogant marching into this article and saying our definition is the scientific one and we're going tell people whether they're black or not, but someone has to stand up for science and someone has to be willing to set standards. The Internet is just full of so much misinformation and garbage.

<dd>But it is wikipedia's policy to reflect the most mainstream definitions and ideas, and equating the African race with the black race is the perspective of the world's leading continent (North America) as well as the perspective of the continent with the greatest number of dark-skinned people (Africa) and also the perspective of our most prestigous and educated cultural institution (science). Now I don't doubt that drunken outback types in Australia call native Australians and any dark-skinned tourist black and that less informed native Australians themselve have internalized the label, but this kind of mindless lumping together by scattered pockets of unsophisticated people around the globe, should not contradict the precise definition of our cultural leaders, and indeed of the world's largest black population. I'm not saying the other definition can't be mentioned. I'm all for a full discussion.

Thus it seems incredibley appropriate to give the current official classification system used by the world's sole superpower. But a scientific definition for how "black" is used in medical science was provided and so was a very credible study classifying Africans as a distinct genetic population from the New York Times.

<dd>What you still are not getting is that the scientific observations that you may find most relevant to defining blackness is not viewed as relevant throughout the world and by others. It's the issue of significance that you fail to accept. Just because you find scientific... no not scientific... you find interpretations of scientific observation compelling, that does not justify your position. I do not find women more moral just because they commit less violent and sexual crime. I do not view poorer people as dumber than richer people just because they earn less money. So I do not view some people as more black or less black just because a group of guys in a lab disect and classify DNA strands unrelated to phenotype into groups they find most common across socially created "races". Nor skull shapes, nor noses, nor any of that. This topic is fluid and dynamic and you cannot pidgeonhole the word "black" into any narrow viewpoint.

<dd>I am amazed at the racism evident in this discussion page. Whatever misconceptions you have about "drunken outback types" and "less informed native Australians", they have no place in an encyclopedia in the twenty-first century. In fact, the term is common as an adjective in Australia and has fewer racist overtones in this day and age than does the term "native". How is "black" even a racial category? As Ezeu pointed out, even in America it is not used as a racial classification. To do so smacks of social Darwinism to me. Additionally, you have no right to dictate that the content of this wikipedia reflect only an American viewpoint. What is so difficult about multiple definition within the same page, or multiple pages with disambiguation. I sense some kind of political motivation.

As in "might makes right" - I find the opposite to be true, the hubris, propaganda and degree of media concentration required to support this great superpower often makes information from the United States (and allies) more questionable in my opinion. Wikipedia's advantage is that people from all over the world (black or white) have the opportunity to enter this discourse. Consensus is required rather than rigid defense of received wisdom or personal opinion. If I wanted an American dictionary then I'd buy Websters.

<dd>Of course being a U.S. definition doesn't make it more truthful (truthfulness comes from the science definition). The point is that U.S. is the most influential country in the world at this point in history, and so the way they officially define a word of such sociological significance is important. I'm sorry but wikipedia simply does not, should not, and can not, give equal weight to all perspectives, because there are 6 billion people in the world, and so there are probably 6 billion different defintions of what a black person is. Thus we must cite our definitions, and official definitions used for the purpose of gathering official statistics carry more weight, especially if they're from important countries.</dd>

<p>And you know what? I am sure there are some Sudanese people who, no matter how dark their skin, no matter how hard their struggle against Islamic oppression, no matter how much Arabization has hurt their culture, will run and say "I'm not Black!" Why? Because they hate black. They view Black as they have been told: "ABD"... Slave. No one wants to be a slave. Yet Kula Boof and others will stand on the other side, the good side, and even though they have aqualine noses and features that are less than "classically negroid", they will say without a doubt "I AM BLACK!" Do not reject that over some absurd notion of DNA or some Eurocentric notion of "black". Do not reject that over some assumption that only the African... only the English and French derived descendants of African slaves and colonial masters should be considered Black!</p>

<p>Here is what the dogmatic, self appointed, paranoid Zaphnathpaaneah said in the talk page cited by Paul. And ironically his referrence goes to the Dalit section which I coiencidentally have recently spoke of in this current article only moments ago.</p>

<li>I Think what really catches my attention is that people want to steer away from "race" in general, and specifically rather not identify asians in a racial context. However, often the same people will look at blackness from a racial context and then 'rightfully' explain that asians should not be included no matter what their experiences or phenotype. That's not a good way to handle this article. Black is an identity that varies in different parts of the world. The two main components of this identity seem to be "dark skin" and "Equatorial origins". One reason why I want black contributors to hold off on contributing is because I want to see ALL of the best objections and for us to collaborate on discussing them en masse instead of dealing with one at a time for the next 2 years. --Zaphnathpaaneah 07:49, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't believe it's come to this. First it was one person in response to me saying that America, as the more influential country, should be the origin of any definition. Now we've got people giving reasons why Australians and others don't qualify to be recognised because the US is a 'superpower'.</p>
<p>The articles I've seen, though mentioning the American definitions first, still at least note the others. Why should this article be any different? Also, there is still a fundamental flaw in the arguments against the broader dictionary definitions. Some of the definitions make allowances for the wider definition whilst emphasising the most common usage (others refer soley to the wider definition), the people arguing against the wider definition are totally disregarding it.</p>
<p>If we were to really emulate the dictionary, we'd be theming the article around black people as dark skinned people with an emphasis on the African origins. We'd also add a section to describe the term as it is in other parts of the English speaking world. The article as it was totally discounted the wider definition and called it incorrect, rather than less common in America. This doesn't reflect the dictionaries, it doesn't seem to have any sources, and represents only a small viewpoint.</p>
<p>If we strive to make this article a good representation of how the term is used and applied, we can do it, and still manage to represent both view points.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 00:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Outside comment</span></h2>
<p>I'm pretty comfortable in saying that there is no scientific definition of "Black people". The vague talk above about DNA is really beside the point. Yes, some scientists are now coming to think that there may be something to the notion of race after all, but there is no race called "Black". And, as I understand it, there is more genetic variation among the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa than in the whole rest of the world.</p>
<p>In any event, "Black" is a social category, not a scientific one. In the U.S., the term refers to African Americans and other sub-Saharan Africans; in the UK, it refers mainly to South Asians, but also can include sub-Saharan Africans and people from the West Indies of African ancestry; in Australia, I believe it generally includes Australian aborigines. The equivalent term in Russian (чёрный, chyornyi) refers mainly to the people of the Caucasus. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:32, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, but the term black is used all the time in medical science text books and refers exclsuively to peoples of African ancestry. If people get the idea that the term black is not limited to African heritage we could be putting lives at risk because people will end getting the wrong types of medical treatment. And yes, there's a ton of genetic diversity among Africans, but all Africans still have a genetic profile that distinguishes them from non-Africans. And the term black does not at all refer to South Asians, at least not among any British person with more than an 8th grade education. Read this article from the BBC [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2756041.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2756041.stm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] which talks about demographic trends and makes a clear distinction between blacks and South Asians. And educated Australians also distinguish between blacks and Australian aboriginals.</p>
<p>True, black has a very rough and ready meaning including any darkish person but this is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. For example, lizard also has a very rough meaning that is so broad it even includes dinosaurs, but in the wikipedia article on lizards, they focus on the precise meaning, because that's what has utility. There's nothing interesting to say about a definition of black that is purely descriptive and has no cultural or scientific significance.</p>
<p>And yes black is a social category but it's a social categroy that only includes all the world's peoples of varying degrees of sub-Saharan African ancestry as opposed to the biological categroy that requires at least a majority of said ancesty. Part of black culture is to call black men "brothers" and black women "sisters" and this is based on the idea that all black people come from "Mother Africa". You guys are really ruining this article by including Australians, Indians, Irish. This used to be a good article back in the day because it told the fascinating story about how people from one region of the world got spread all over the globe. As you guys have been told 100 times, create an article called "dark-skinned people" if you want to lump all dark people together, but please stop ruining this article because it has the potential to be quite good. --<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 17:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well where is this article? When i first changed it, before it was going on and on about the definition of the word "nigger". I do wonder, where did the contributions veer off? Where does one draw a line from dark skinned to black? Why does "common sense" only mean "English speaking Africans?" Come on, why is it ok for dark skinned people in India to renounce their blackness, but when a woman like Mariah Carey refuses to say "I am Black" she is viewed as a sellout? Oh that's right. She is AMERICAN, and so that means that reality has to be turned on it's head. In Iraq my friend, those Black Iraqis in Basra call each other "brothers" and "sisters". What are you looking for? There is already an article called "African-American". Don't you see?

<p>Dark-skinned women in Indian don't have to renounce their blackness, because they're not black and have never been classificied as part of the black race. You're taking the term black too literally. It's a racial group not a color description. Race means common ancestry, and the black race only describes people of varying degrees of African ancestry. I understand that some people like the idea of lumping all the most low status people in the world (i.e. untouchables of India and Australian aboriginals) into the same category because it makes stereotyping more efficient, but modern genetics, census classifications, dictionary definitions, and self-identification of people who are actually black all contradict this simple minded stereotyping by uneducated people.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 15:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We aren't talking about just women in India (why do you focus on women and not men as well is beyond me, maybe confusion?). But the fact of the matter is this: The Hindu religion regards dark skinned indians as black, the dalits themselves refer to themselves as black, their struggle against racial prejudice is identical to the struggle that black people throughout the world have faced. The term "black" is not one about wooden literality nor of extreme hypodescent (diffusionism). There is a common sense approach that you and I both know we should use, and your problem (as well as with so many white people involved) is that the common sense ends at the shores of the U.S.A. For example, you speak of "low status individuals" as a way of lumping them with black people for some reason. Yet you put the cart before the horse. The "low status" attributed by whites (upper castes) upon these people is done by virtue of SKIN COLOR. Do not even try to convince anyone in here that the untouchables and dalits in India are scorned for some "other" reason besides their SKIN COLOR. Genetics, census classifications, dictionary definitions do not mean SQUAT. And I know that when the pre-eminent Dalit Leader, the Malcolm X if you will of the dalit people in India writes a book called "THE BLACK UNTOUCHABLES OF INDIA"... then I know you don't have a clue of what you are talking about Editingoprah! With all due respect, stop speaking a <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> arguement. Stop trying to insist as if it's "without a doubt" that East Indian Dalits, Shudras, Siddis, and others aren't Black, because I know it's a lie. if you want to argue the point... Speak to the owner and administrator of the yahoo group named "Ta_Seti" He is from East India, and his contributions to these subjects have blown the lid off these myths you still hold to. I mention this person, because he is available usually to respond on that group within 24 hours. If YOU are from India, then you and him sort it out. His knowledge, research, and experience trumps your interpretations hands down. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:06, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h2>
<p>We have to keep in mind, this and many social articles on Wikipedia are not required to have a universally agreed scientific definition in mind. The word “black” exists for whatever it’s worth from person to person and is characteristically defined to describe people in a customary way. Genetic variation does not limit itself to skin color and that’s the whole point. Black skin is not a defining litmus of determining how strongly variation occurs. Not only is Black a social category, but so is White, and so forth. The best scientific term I can think of is one I invented (the word existed beforehand, but the definition used I created) and coined in the Ta-Seti Yahoo newsgroup about two years ago. I have yet to find anyone else who has used “Equatorial” to describe people of “black/negroid/directly African” origin. I use that word when the confusion arises from clearly knowing “what do you mean by black, or what do you mean by African…”. Equatorial uniformly describes people who are not considered to be Caucasoid, White, Mongoloid, Aryan (Aryan in the real definition, not the White Supremacist definition), Sinoid, etc.. It means people of direct link to African and higher temperate Equator origins. Medical science does not yield characteristic results for blacks limited to African heritage. Medical treatments for black East Indians are just as workable for Black Africans. That genetic profile that distinguishes Black people from non-Africans also is present among many East Indians and the distinguishing factors between the various groups of East Indians require the same amount of concern. Black has cultural significance despite the pleas to the contrary. The issue is that we associate “black” with “bad” and thus find a way to diminish the cultural positive reinforcement. Apply the same principal with White and see how strange it sounds to many white people. I propose to use the word “Equatorial” rather than “Sub-Saharan” because the word “sub” reinforces sub-consciously the notion of inferiority. In addition, Sub-Saharan harkens to the Sahara desert which is not a defining factor in Black people. It is merely a geographic area that contributed greatly to the cultural distinctions between people north and south of it. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The genetic profile between Africans and Indians is actually very different. East Indians are generally considered dark skinned Caucasians. They have nothing to do with Africans.

<p>Although I do not wish to toot my own horn, I do want to inform many here debating the design of this article. I was the one that originally designed it in the current fashion it is designed, and I say this because is that someone restored my original contributions (after some months prior of it being totally trashed and replaced by a totally different article that I feel did better on the organization of scientific facts, but skimped on the social realities.). Because of that, I'd want people to know that the goal I had in mind was to 1. Remind people that we cannot take one side then jump and take another side on the issue of "who is black". Those who swear strictly by a genetic definition are thus confounded by the historical implications. Those who swear strictly by a literal skin color definition are thus confounded by the historical and well the logical conclusion. Finally those who (like myself) go by a more historical and social understanding as well as literal skin color, respect the fact that one cannot take an attitude of imposing a moral "should" philosophy. We cannot say that Black SHOULD be only used to define continental sub-saharan Africans, Black Americans, Caribbeans and enclaves of slave descendants in southwest Asia. That's giving the white philosophy too much credit and power, and it's also giving too much respect to American sensibilities about other people, which might I remind you, American sensibilities are more often wrong in regards to what is credible outside of America. I personally KNOW Aboriginals who view themselves as black in the same manner a black american does. This nonsense about skull shapes and DNA hapolytes is irrelevant. You all have to accept this simple fact: There is more than one KIND of Black human on Earth. This is the fundamental paradigm shift that needs to occur in the consciousness of the west. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In fact, that last statement has even more far reaching implications. Blackness is by it's nature a more inclusive, less prejudiced, and more cosmopolitian human concept. More so than White (which socially requires a high degree of endogamy and cultural similarity) at least. I know socially that a bi-racial child is more acceptable as Black within the Black social group than it will be accepted as White within the White social group. Otherwise, we would have far more white people that look like black people. But the reality is that white exclusivity clause, that requires a high amount of uniformity to a stereotyped notion of whiteness, is in direct opposition to the ideals proposed by many who profess to be non-racist... that includes those who routinely complain of black reverse-racism. This also includes those who do annoying things like say that Ethiopians are Caucasoids, and that there is no more significant problem in our society due to the racist attitudes of individuals. This also includes those who do things like disrupt the honest flow of writing good articles on Wikipedia, by using nouns out of context and expecting people like me (and other black people who try to discuss this matter honestly) to follow along. This also includes those who do unfair things like say that Blackness should be based on DNA, and when DNA is shown to include others, they then say it should be based on something else, and then something else still... all the while trying to pidgeon hole blackness into a narrowly defined criteria that means "Sub-Saharan Africans and Black Americans only" --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>How do you inherit characteristics like "dark skin" except from other people who have "dark skin"? Thus, having dark-skin would indicate your connection to people who carry this trait, making you a part of their family (as well as a carrier of this trait)." I don't understand why this is confusing.</p>
<p><br />
Actually that's not true at at all. Australian aboriginals and South Indians are actually less related to sub-Saharan Africans than Europeans are. It's just that people in Europe needed light skin to absorb vitamin D.

<p>Enough of this myth that genetically Australians are closer in relation to whites than africans. The Australian groups DNA history shows they branched off long before the "white" group was even created, and admixture from Europeans and Aboriginals is non-existent outside of your usual random chance 1% average. The issue is not about proving that there is some eternal DNA explanation as to why all black people are black. I've said it before, and you know this is true. DNA VARIATIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO PHENOTYPE AND SKIN COLOR ARE NOT RELEVANT TO AN ISSUE REGARDING PHENOTYPE AND SKIN COLOR. This is the same nonsense that tries to give credibility to making all East Africans north of Mozambique "Caucasoid". Everywhere you see some similarity to whites... you say "oh they come from the same origins". But then you see similarity to blacks... your first inclination is to say "oh no it's just a meaningless coiencidence." This is called prejudice. Stop it. I can see right through it. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, at one point, in complete ignorance, I thought black people did not exist; Instead, white people in error called brown people "black". Then I saw on TV, people whose skin looked so dark, the color could only be described as black. So now, I use the term "black" to describe many african-americans, as well as myself. Although, in some ways, it would make sense to call myself "brown". Because I am brown, I realize that I have a diverse genetic background. I have inherited many different traits, from diverse people.</p>
<p>I find the term negroid more offensive than "black people."</p>
<p>Also, I find black people's skin color beautiful, and desirable. Why is there a belief that people do not wish to be associated with this beautiful trait? When brown people call themselves "black," it indicates (to me) the desire to be associated with this beautiful, human, trait."</p>

<p>Black skin color is beautiful and so is black culture. That's why the identity of the black race needs to be preserved. Black describes a very specific race of people that preserved the rich genetic diversity of mother Africa from which all humans emerged. The black race is not a dumping ground for all the despised ethnicities of the world like Australian aboriginals and the untouchables of India. Sadly, editors like Paul B got all their knowledge of race from Australian folk songs, instead of from medical science text books and black people themselves.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 23:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well then why are people in here so quick to distance everyone from Black Africans? Why do we want to find some comfort in that? It is not "true", it is not based on anything significant. "DNA" in this conversation should only be limited to areas that are related to skin color, hair texture, ancestral biological traits, and what not. This silliness about finding some obscure similarity between Aboriginals and Europeans (which is bound to happen with any two groups over the billions of code of DNA) is absurd. Once again people in here are scared do death of Black people in India or Australia feeling comfort... feeling pride... feeling a sense of dignity and uplift at recognizing they have a meaningful relationship with Black Africans.

<dd>My goal is not to stop people from Indians or Australian aboriginals from feeling comfort by associating themselves with Africans, in fact if you see below, I've suggested we can define blacks in 4 different categories. 2 of those groups, the one based on physical appearance and the one based on political metaphors unites peoples of African ancestry and Indians.

<dd>No the article says at the outset that Black is a racial ethnic classification in which case it ONLY refers to peoples of African ancestry. Census records in both the U.S. and Britain as well as medical science text books all agree that when black is used as a racial term it only describes people related to African ancestry. All the other dark-skinned peoples of the world have no racial relation to sub-Saharan Africans. Further, common cultural terms like Black music, and Black English all relate to peoples of African ancestry. Now if we include every ethnic group that ever loosely has been described as black we have to include the Black Irish and it would be an incredibley stupid article not worth creating. If we want an article about people who are literally black, we should call it black-skinned people and we would have to limit ourselves to an extremely small group of subraces. But lumping in obscure Australian folk songs that refer to Australian aboriginals and giving them equal weight as official census definition and medical science text books that limit the term black to the sub-Saharan African race is ruining this article. --<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 22:42, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My collegues haven't shown a damn thing. Their ignorance is alarming. Their knowledge of modern genetic research is non-existent, they confuse entire classifications in anthropology, they think that "South Asians" are called "blacks" in Britain when both the British census and the BBC says the opposite, they classify entire populations as black based on obscure Australian folk-songs, and they have no coherent vision for this article, and have actually desrtoyed an article that used to be half-decent. They're quite simply the most incompetent people I have ever seen.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 23:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You, in contrast are simply dishonest, as we know from your sockpuppeting. The Australian song (which is not a "folk song") is simply evidence of established usage. South Asians (ie Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis) are not consistently considered to be "black" in Britain, but they often have been. The Dravidianist and Dalit movements in India sometinmes adopt the notion of "black" identity on the grounds that their victimisation is analagous to racial oppression experienced elsewhere. Other Indians reject it on the grounds that it subsumes their distinctive cultural and racial identity in a rather meaningless general concept. That's why I reject the dogmatism of both your position and Zaph's. It's really quite simple. We desrcibe how the term has been used over history, how this connected with scientific models of race at the time and how it fits with, or doesn't, with modern theories. The ignorance is all yours. You are thoroughly US-centric. You seem to know nothing of cultures outside of the US or of history prior to c1990. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 23:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition to that, both of you find yourselves in a contradiction. How is it that a people outside of Africa cannot even view themselves as Black? How is it that they (not the African) has to fufill all of these criteria (which actually only point trying to prove or disprove that they are literally African). Neither one of you can let that go. "Black" does not mean "African only". It never has. Black Africans encapsulated the term, because generally speaking they are most different from the conquering Europeans. The variations, which the Europeans noticed, they related to themselves. "Black person with kinky hair is not as black as the same skinned colored person with straight hair... because we British have straight hair too!" And over in over we play this game. It's just like back home with the black american family. Some kids are lighter skinned than the others, so those kids get called "high yellow" and "not really black". You guys need to get over yourselves. Millions of Indians view themselves as Black (more than in America) and just because YOU don't like it, YOU don't think it's accurate (for the simple fact that they are not Africans), that does not make YOU right. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm thoroughly US-centric. BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't even live in the U.S. and have hardly ever been there. I'm not even goint to dignify your other accustaions with a response, because its clear that you draw bad conclusions. Ooooh wow! A few ignorant Brits call South Asians black so now South Asians must be in the article. A few uneducated Australians call the aboriginals black for rough and ready descriptive convenience, and suddenly that carries equal weight as census definitions, medical text books, and complex cultural identities that go back for centuries. Do you have any sense of perspective at all? The Irish call themselves blacks too but should that be in the article? If not, why not? It's on the same level of significance, actually more so since its widespread enough to enter dictionaries. About the only intelligent point you've made is about the Dalits using black as a metaphor for descrimination elsewhere, but I notice you didn't say where. Could it be because the analogy they're actually invoking is the discrimination against peoples of African ancestry in America and South Africa? So once again, it all comes down to people of African ancestry and that needs to be the coherent theme of the article. There can be a special section in the article for exclusively cultural conceptions of blackness which serve as metaphors for the global oppression of the sub-Saharan African race and the shared experience of having dark skin, because that's respectful and coherent. But this ridiculous idea of describing South Asian as one of the black phenotypes as if they were part of the same genetic group is really simple minded and robs the sub-Saharan Africans of their independent racial identity.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not Brits, Aussies, nor any other European that motivates me to put the Indians and Australians in this category. Common sense, any human has the capacity to see skin color contrasts. An African with dark skin is no darker than an Indian or Australian with the same skin color. Each of those three groups of people have the same capacity to OBJECTIVELY see their own skin and see that it is dark, and almost black to them. How does "black" get stuck only on the African? How is it that you can go on and on about how the white man invented this for the Indian and Aboriginal yet not for the African? Why is it a source of contempt for Indians and Aboriginals to be known as Black, yet not the African? You haven't spoken a word on the fact that the word "black" has been used throughout history long before the European to describe people outside of Africa. But no what you do is try to play a reverse psychology game. You seek to pull at the dignity of Africans by trying to make them feel robbed... as if others recognizing their similar traits would rob the African of his own. Editingoprah, let me make one thing clear to you: Blackness is not whiteness. Black people do not diminish in their purity or their essence or in their identity when others are a part of it. We do not "lose ourselves" from the social relationship we acknoweldge with others. Have you SEEN Runoko Rashidi's pictures of Southeastern Asians? Here is a link, YOU tell me why this is NOT a black person: [<a href="http://www.africanbynature.com/eyes/openeyes_lookingatindia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.africanbynature.com/eyes/openeyes_lookingatindia.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] - oh she has straight hair? Well guess what so does many African AMERICANS who are known as Black, who look ligher than she does, and whose features invoke less of a familiarity with Equatorial Africa. yet she is not American, so that means "she is not Black". [<a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/BARNUBIANEMPIRE/BLACKPEOPLEBLACK/page5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://community-2.webtv.net/BARNUBIANEMPIRE/BLACKPEOPLEBLACK/page5.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] (oh this page is not accessible for some reason as a direct link, you have to manually type it in???) Scroll down, see the black nigerian looking boy? HES FROM THAILAND! In fact out of all of these people, the AFRICAN AMERICAN tends to look less "African" than these Asians! Yet oh they aren't American. What the heck is that??? ABSURD! I bet you someone is going to make an excuse to remove these links. That being said, go to MY talk page and you'll have more access to them. What baffles me is why no one on here can see these pictures, see these people, how obviously BLACK they ARE, and still run around in circles yapping nonsense about how DNA shows how different they are from continental Africans. Make your own article called "The Genetic uniqueness of Continental Africans". Get out of here with this nonsense! I know what I am looking at, I don't need some fool telling me that the black faces I see in these pictures "aren't black, because some european this, and DNA that, and their hair is striaght, and they live over in Asia." God, this is what pisses me off. This is the kind of nonsense that aggrivates people TRYING to be honest and compromise. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Indian woman in the first link (second one doesn't work) is dark brown not black. True she is darker than many African-Americans, but that's not really the point. Black is just a metaphor, coming from the racial classification Negroid which comes from the black river Niger in Nigeria. Any way I could find images of Chinese women that are whiter than most Europeans, but waht that mean Chinese people are white? Anyway if you see below, I've proposed a 4 way organization of this article to keep everyone happy.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Irish do not "consider themselves black". Only a blithering idiot would think that. The term "black Irish" refers to dark-haired/swarthy Irishmen, associated with the West of Ireland. It's associated with connotations of prinitivism, and so certainly is relevant to the use of the concept "black" with a negative meaning. However, many peoples have have had the word "black" attached to them in different contexts. It was also used of people of the Caucasus (yes, "Caucasians" were thought of as "black" in one context). These usages can reasonably be included in the article. But they are certainly marginal. No-one has ever suggested the "ridiculous idea of describing South Asian as one of the black phenotypes as if they were part of the same genetic group is really simple minded and robs the sub-Saharan Africans of their independent racial identity". This is gibberish. There is no such thing as a "black phenotype" except in sikin-colour. And no-one says that South Asians are "part of the same genetic group" as Africans. You are making this up. Your transparent misrepresentation of what other editors have said is edidence of your bad faith. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 00:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you say the Irish did not consider themselves black when they said "black Irish" when you have no coherent definition of what a black person is? That makes you the blithering idiot. And if its so marginal how come their blackness is mentioned by dictionaries, but the blackness of Australian aboriginals is not. And I understand that no one claims that South Asians are part of the same genetic group but its implied. Look, we're not getting anywhere. Why not form a compromise? What's wrong with dividing this article up into sections such Blacks as a racial group, Blacks as a cultural group, Blacks as a political metaphor, Blacks as a physical group.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 01:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really think we need to create new articles but this article is currently very disorganized so I think it should be divided into 4 different sections. In BLACKS AS A RACIAL GROUP I propose we just talk about blacks from a biomedical perspective and limit the term to only people with a majority of sub-Saharan African ancestry. In BLACKS AS A CULTURAL GROUP I propose we include people who have only a tiny bit African ancestry but still self-identify as black for cultural reasons. In BLACKS AS A POLITICAL METAPHOR talk about the untouchables of India who compared their oppression to African American oppression and perhaps even how Toni Morrison described Clinton as the first black president. In BLACKS AS A PHYSICAL GROUP we should have a broad discussion of the darkest peoples in the world regardless of whether they're African or not.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 01:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No. You keep trying to connect "race" to "biomedical group". And we know without a doubt that is not accurate. Latinos are not uniformly of the same biomedical group, nor are whites, nor are asians, nor are East Indians. At the same token, black people esp in the U.S. come in such a wide biomedical variety that you cannot possibly objectively include them "scientifically" while excluding others who biomedically have more in common (Sheedis, Dalits, Shudras, Basra Iraqis, Yemeni, etc). The only thing you will be able to do is to further NARROW the field down to "west Africans" since the "east Africans DO share more in common with the Asians that we argue are also black. It's a game. African ancestry as a litmus is also problematic. How recent, how far back in the past? The Sheedi and those in Pakistan share African heritage that goes back 500-800 years. The Basra Iraqis came from Africans as far back as 800AD, long before Europeans. The East Indians vary and different groups come from different periods. These varied groups are collectively known as untouchables, despite the fact many within are not of the same ultimate origins. Now, I suggest we take the issue of distinguishing 'what kind of black we are talking about' and instead of using your method, simply use the local, regional, or national method. Each country, each region has their own history and cultural identities which share this. If you look at the PBS broadcast about the Basra Iraqis, you will see a very strong Black heritage which is unique, real, and as valid as any other. Otherwise, the approach you take is one of splitting the issue into your five groups and ultimately culling the reader into accepting the one you feel is most valid. This statement about using "cultural" to include those with little African ancestry shows your prejudice in this matter, because the other four groups should also include those who have or have not any African ancestry. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 05:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Can I Make An Observation Here!!! I am confused by what is meant by "...those with little African ancestry" Since I think we all have a great deal of African Ancestry. I wonder if this helps a bit...maybe we can trace our ancestry back in time; For Example, Person A would say, I had several African Ancestors 4 or 5 generations ago....whereas Persona B may say, I had African Ancestors 12 or 13 generations ago...currently I trace my ancestors (5 generations) from Europe... Wouldn't this help? I would say: I have a great deal of African Ancestory...most of my African Ancestors were dislocated to American due to the American slave trade; many of their descendents called themselves African-Americans. A few of my ancestors, 2 or 3 generations earlier, called themselves Native Americans or white.</p>
<p>Although this is wordy, I think this description reflects the truth. <a href="../../../2/c/_/User%7E2c_me.html" title="User:2c me">2c me</a> 09:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well there is enormous genetic diversity in South of the Sahara Africa, however all the populations from that region do form a broad genetic cluser which is independent of other major genetic clusters. This has been extensively documented in numerous studies. Only the genetic definition of blackness I would limit to South of the Sahara Africans. Of course when I speak of South of the Sahara Africans, I realize that this group has been spread all over the world for centuries. --<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you Zaphnathpaaneah. Shortly after you started making all your edits, Paul B reverted back to an earlier version so your edits were lost. I kept trying to revert back to versions that included your edits, but he kept reverting back to the version that came before your edits. Anyway, I always assumed wikipedia articles got better with time but that's not been the case with this article. Look at the much earlier version and see how excellent it was (scroll down)[<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/black-people" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/black-people" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]. It included all the different conceptions of Black but it emphasized the origin of the term in latin and how it originally came from the River Niger in Nigeria. Really this is a term for Africans. This article emphasized the African diasporas. It also talked about how the term was used to describe non-African diasporas people, but it kept this discussion in perspective, and din't blow out of proportion like some later editors have. And it talked about the untouchables in India but it explained the history of WHY they self-identified as black, linking it to the African American civil rights movement. This really was an excellent article at one time. Hard to tell by looking at it today.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 04:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reverted your edits because you were clearly going against consensus. If other legitimate edits were lost in the process that was a mistake. There is no evidence at all that the term "black" originated in Latin from the River Niger. Indeed the orgin of the river name "Niger" is not known for certain. Anyway, languages other than Latin also have terms for black. "Ethiopia" is usually thought to derive from the Greek for "burnt skin" and "Sudan" derives from the Arabic phrase bilad as sudan, meaning land of blacks. The Hebrew "Cush" also has the same meaning. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 15:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You reverted it because you and Ezeu can't stand the fact that science has elevated my definition of blackness head and shoulders above yours, and so you must rely on vague ancient scriptures, pop music references, while I get to point to standard dictionaries, census classifications, DNA studies, and biomedical articles. You are in clear violation of wikipedia's undue weight rules by treating your fringe POV as equal to dictionary and census definitions that are validated by mainstream science from the best universities in the world. You are also againt wikipedia policy by arguing for consensus, when wikipedia clearly states it is not a democracy. Quite simply you are not here to report information in a proportionate way, but rather, like so many people, in so many different wikipedia articles, you use wikipedia as an opportunity to take a fringe point of view and try to make it mainstream.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 15:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the version you reverted had TWO pieces of scientific evidence. The first was the Yale study which was used to give genetic validity to the census decision to group Africans into a coherent group. The second citation actually explicititly stated that Blacks are a racial group defined by African ancestry. Further the term Black as a racial category has replaced politically incorrect terms like terms Negro and Negroid which are defined by physical anthropology, and under the tradition 3 race model, Negroid refers only to peoples of African ancestry (though Coon created a 5 race model by dividing Negroids into Capoids and Kongoids and then adding Australoids) And I couldn't care less how many editors you think disagree with me. Wikipedia clearly states it is not a democracy and yor constant efforts to form a mob rule consensus are a violation of this policy.

<dd>I have repilied to this point several times already. Both you "citations" were from journalistic articles, not scientific texts. The NYT one never even used the word black in the entire article. It claimed that popular models of race had some justification, referring to a study, but giving very few details of it. I you read the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">Race</a> article you will see how thoroughly this question is debated and disputed. The other reference was a polemical essay in a political journal, again, not science. The term "mob rule consensus" is really disgraceful. You evidently have no respect for the very concept of consensus. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 19:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Paul B, you keep missing the point. No one claimed that the NY times article defined "Black people". The point of the NY Times article was simply to show that the census decision to lump all African related people together has scientific validity. It doesn't relate to the word "black" per se, but it does relate to the decision to treat Africans as a racial group which was a very relevant thing to point out if we're going to quote the census denying their groupings have any scientific validity. And it doesn't matter if the NY Times article was not a scientific text because it is a reputable newspaper that is simply summarizing the results of a scientific study. It's obvious that you're one of these biased people that holds perspectives you disagree with to ridiculously high standards. A summary from top newspaper about a study from a top university isn't good enough for you, yet Australian rock songs obviously are, since you didn't revert those edits. And the biomedical article was an essay, but no one claimed it was anything more than that. I believe the version of the article simply said that it was an article about race in biomedicine defined "blacks" in a certain way. The article was about the importance of race from a biomedical perspective. You don't find this an acceptable reference but you have no problem allowing some obscure poorly reviewd book by an Indian untouchable to speak for his entire populations self-identity? I think you need to step out of your mental box and realized how biased and hypocritical you appear to people advocating a different perspective.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:33, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are the one missing the point. There was nothing wrong with the articles <i>as such</i> what was wrong was the way you were using them to support a claim they either did not make or could not sustain. The book I cited is not only poorly reviewed, it's actually a barely coherent rant by a political extremist, like all his other books. But the point it was being used to make was simply that this usage exists and is a familiar one. That was also the point of using the song, though other citations would also have been desirable. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 07:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The NY Times article was simply used to support the scientific validity of grouping peoples of African ancestry. The article clearly stated that based on DNA, the peoples of the world belong to 5 principles groups, and one of them is Africans. That is scientific support for the way the census grouped peoples of African ancestry under a single umbrella which the census chose to call "Black". The second source on biomedicine simply demonstated a definition of black for a biomedical purpose. I thought this article was about how black people are defined in different contexts. So why are you censoring that example of how black people are defined? Because its not a god enough source? And yet, an incoherent political rant by an Indian extremist is a good enough source? I'm trying very hard to have a civil discussion, but you're not demonstrating the neutral POV on which wikipedia depends.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 15:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

EditingOprah (EO), you saw my contributions right? YOu saw how I was trying to properly show the article right? You don't see me trying to impose a retarded viewpoint on my edit. That's what I'm trying to get across. Your definition of Black and mine may differ, but you, like me must accept that others see the matter differently. It's not that a few thousand East Indians view themselves as Black. Have you read the Hindu religion? Do you understand how far back in time their own racial distinctions and issues go? We're talking ROMANS man. Back during the days of Caeser, these East INdians were fighting over skin color, caste, and black Indians are considered to be inferior even back then.

<p>Are you able to actually cite the fact that Hindu scripture described Indians populations by the color black? In any event, I have no problem discussing Indians in the article, but I think we should distinguish between Blacks as a physical group (i.e. those poeoples who were dark skinned enough to be described as blacks by a critical mass of people) and Blacks as a racial category (which is rooted in the anthropological term Negroid, is mentioned in the census of various governments, and is used in medical science text books) and also from blacks as a cultural group and blacks as a political group. If you really care about black people you'll want to create for them a full and complete and balanced article, because a lot of black students come here to do research for school and university. Let's make sure the information they get is balanced, useful, and can be cited.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Book 1 - Chapter 100 - verse 18 He, much invoked, hath slain Dasyus and Simyus, after his wont, and laid them low with arrows. The mighty Thunderer with his fair-complexioned friends won the land, the sunlight, and the waters.</p>
<p>Book 2 Chapter 20 Verse 6 - Indra, the slayer of Vrittra, the destroyer of cities, has scattered the Dasyu sprang from a black womb."</p>
<p>Book 3 - Chapter 34 - Verse 9 - He gained possession of the Sun and Horses, Indra obtained the Cow who feedeth many. Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus , and gave protection to the Aryan colour.</p>

<p>They being the Gods. The account further reports how Indra "slew the flat-nosed barbarians, the dark people called Anasahs. Finally, after Indra conquers the land of the Anasahs for his worshippers, he commands that the Anasahs are to be flayed of (their) black skin."</p>
<p>Indria is the supreme God. The Dasyus are a race of black people in this religious text. Now, Wikipedia has an article about the Dasyus. And (once again) the contradiction reveals itself. The text I quote here shows clearly that the god smote the one group "dasyus" and gave protection to the other group's color (Aryans). You cannot doubt with confidence that the Dasyus were not of a different COLOR than the ARYANS, since the scripture verse objectively and unconsciously distinguishes the Aryan FROM the Dasyus BY the skin color! And keep in mind, we to this day currently have a caste system IN india which follows pretty closely skin color. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. I have no problem with mentioning the untouchables of India in relation to their political identification with African Americans, but to have them right in the opening paragraphs of the article, as though this conception of blackness carries the same weight as the African only perspective of official census definitions, many dictionaries, biomedical definitions, anthropological classifications, is the worst violation of wikipedia's undue weight rules I have ever seen.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 18:34, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zaph, most of these translations are from the turn of the 19th/20th century, when racialised interpretations of the RV were commonplace. "flat-nosed barbarians" for example is an extremely tendentious translation. The word supposedly for "flat-nosed" is anasna, which <i>may</i> mean "noseless" (a-nasa), but the more established view is that it means mouthless or faceless. Either way it's a derogatory term probably intended to label the <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dasyu.html" title="Dasyu">Dasyu</a> as "other" - people without identities, a faceless mass ("barbarians" is just a translation of Dasyu). The idea that it means flat-nosed derives from the less likely interpretation "noseless", which is then <i>further</i> glossed as "flat-nosed", purely by guessing that they were called noseless because of flat noses. In other words it's speculation built on a minority interpretation. The Dasa/Dasyu <i>are</i> referred to as black on several occasions, but it is not known whether this was a symbolic use of colour to imply "dark forces" or a literal reference to skin tone. The latter is certainly a legitimate and well-established interpretation, but so are those that reject it. The point is that we can't be dogmatic here. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 22:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also there are no people called the "Anasahs", contrary to the quotation you have copied from here <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org/wsm-pages/religion.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldsocialism.org/wsm-pages/religion.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<p>Aww here we go. YOu are trying to coddle the thing. IT is no coiencidence that the darker skinned East Indians are on these lower castes today in the same manner as these "not black, but dark in another way" Dasar and what nots are in the Rig Veda. You remind me of the mormons whose books about the black Egyptians and the black skinned Indians are explained away as a "not really black" excuse. Let me help you, the references in the Rig Veda are obviously of skin tone, because so many references IN the Rig Veda describe them. Paul, you are trying too hard to explain away something so obvious. Furthermore the "African/African American only" definition of blackness is not based on official census definitions, many dictionaries, biomedical definitions, anthropological classifications. Census definitions, dictionaries, biomedical definitions, and anthropological classifications list many east asians as "negritos", which meant and still means "small statured black person" literally. Census records in Australia describe people as "black" and much of the Apartheid of S. Africa was inspirted by the racial prejudice instituted there. V.T. Rajshekar who is a prominent journalist in India (and is not a fringe or extreme minority viewpoint of the black perspective there) made it clear in 1987: The African-Americans also must know that their liberation struggle cannot be complete as long as their own blood-brothers and sisters living in far off Asia are suffering. It is true that African-Americans are also suffering, but our people here today are where African-Americans were two hundred years ago. African-American leaders can give our struggle tremendous support by bringing forth knowledge of the existence of such a huge chunk of Asian Blacks to the notice of both the American Black masses and the Black masses who dwell within the African continent itself." , I also pointed you to the administrator of the Yahoo group "Ta_seti" regarding this very topic, but I see you instead decided to hold on to your preconceived notions without actually talking to an East Indian who is familar with this subject. So no, you're not right. No, you're not accurate. On to your silly attempt to "redefine the nouns" in the Rig Veda: Firstly, since caste in India follows strongly skin color, i find it absurd that you would say that most of these translations are from the turn of the 19th/20th century, when racialised interpretations of the RV were commonplace. The racialized interpretations have been commonplace for centuries, we all know it. Anasna (flat nosed) Dasa (darkskinned) people who are rejected by "god" seem to mirror the same fate as the current flatter nosed darkskinned people in INdia who are taught that if their shadow touches the body of a ligher skinned caste person, then thay have poisoned that person with their filth. Now explain something to me. How does 2000 years of cultural and religious policy and teaching get explained away by Paul's own interpretation. OH right, if we use common sense, then we will more likely see that the Indians ARE black. So we have to turn this upside down. Black doesnt mean "black" in Sanskrit anymore. Dark skinned means something else. Flat nosed means no nose. Im sure curly hair will mean something else too. How is it your interpretation PAUL fails to fit in the cultural and religious practices of the Hindus event today? You mean to tell me they all made a mistake? Those darker skinned East Indians who are taught that they are of a lower caste from these Rig Veda verses... oh thats just a mistranslation thousands of years ago? Gee whiz paul, you got an older Rig Veda translation that we can use? Can you explain to India and to Hindus why they seem to take the same "wrong" attitude about the translation that I am taking? No Paul, you're response is insufficient. It does not fit consistently with the practices of the hindu religion and fail to explain away the racism that is institutionalized in India BASED ON THESE VERSES. You go and be a hindu priestly scholar, find that earlier translation and compare it to other words used IN THE SAME MANNER and come back. Till then, you're response is rejected. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No racialisised interpretations <i>of the RV</i> have not been commonplace for centuries, though it is well established that skin-colour hierarchies in India <i>have</i> existed for long time. That's probably beause most invaders of India entered from the north and established themselves in higher castes. It does not alter the fact that "anasa" almost certainly does not mean "flat-nosed". I poonted out that skin-pigment interpretations of passages in the RV are <b>well established bu also contested</b>, so there is no consensus among scholars on this. Racism in India is not based on these verses, but is a much more complex phenomenon. I've no idea what you mean by "You go and be a hindu priestly scholar, find that earlier translation and compare it to other words used IN THE SAME MANNER and come back." What "other words used in the same manner"? "How does 2000 years of cultural and religious policy and teaching get explained away by Paul's own interpretation." It doesn't. It has nothing to do with my interpretation. It is mostly Hindu scholars such as <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Aurobindo_796e.html" title="Sri Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_Dayananda_c314.html" title="Swami Dayananda">Swami Dayananda</a> who have rejected the racial interpretation as "Western" misinterpretation. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 07:17, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interesting Conversation on the White People article</span></h2>
<p>See...I know you guys in Wikipedia aren't as naively dense as you pretend to be., Here is a comment from a contributor (whose position I differ greatly on, but who nevertheless isn't playing dumb... like some people) on the White People article:</p>
<p>An example of anti-Black POV would be if I went to the page on African-American and made a pest of myself by claiming that White South African immigrants to the USA are "African-Americans" and stuff like that. <b>I could argue that one around ad infinitum</b>, however I think that's wrong and pushing a POV based upon an exception to the norm. Come on. Seriously. What was White about the Ottoman Empire and what wasn't White about the history of Western Civ? You prove your point. This is getting ridiculous. Stop playing games. P.S. Funny how on the African American page there aren't images of 4 Moroccans and only 1 Black person, after all North Africans are "African" aren't they, and why would anyone need to see more than one photo of a black person? Yukirat 20:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes but the comment is about how silly it is to take racial terms literally. For example, White South Africans who become U.S. citizens are LITERALLY African-Americans, but that doesn't mean they should call themselves African-American. So by the same logic, East Indians and Australoids are literally dark-skinned, but that doesn't mean they should call themselves black people since the dictionary.com definition of "black person" limits the term to dark skinned Africans[<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/black%20person" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/black%20person" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>].

<p>Ha. You got yourself confused. You state correctly that common sense experience trumps "technicality". Yet you say something contradictory: "So by the same logic, East Indians and Australoids are literally dark-skinned, but that doesn't mean they should call themselves black people since the dictionary.com definition of "black person" limits the term to dark skinned Africans." The dictionary.com definition is where your "tecnicality" smacks against common sense. An east indian whose skin color is just as dark as an African should not come to America, then say "Oh I read online at dictonary.com that I am not Black." So my answer is "no, I'm not playing dumb" and my question is "why do you contradict yourself". You just did a doublestandard EO. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So much of these arguments seem to be culturally based. Culture: what your ancestors and family called themselves, and what they knew. Since we have different ancestors (who may have looked alot alike, but didn't act or think alike)we have different cultural views and expectations, all of which can be very confusing! I can see how current American "norms" would be confusing to people from other countries. In reference to the above, is "Black American" a better term? or am I adding to the confusion...? What do people editing the "Black People" page think? <a href="../../../2/c/_/User%7E2c_me.html" title="User:2c me">2c me</a> 09:22, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Make a page "Black American". Whatever you want. But this page is called black people, as in humans that are black. It is so absurd that only with Continental Africans is there considered "no difference between brown and dark skinned and black skinned people". To the point that a Fulani or an Igbo Nigerian, who is certainly on average substantially lighter than your typical Dravidian or Shudra, is considered "black" while the East Indian Shudra/Dravidian is considered merely "dark skinned". See the thing is, some of you in here won't just say "It makes me feel uncomfortable to acknowledge other people in the world are black besides Africans, because i was raised to view blackness as an insult and Africans as unworthy of appreciation. If blackness is acknowledged in other areas by myself, then I will feel like my view of the world is inaccurate and biased and I do not want to admit when I am wrong." I've given you guys links, I've given you guys people to talk to, I've given you guys publications to read... yet instead of investigating the matter, you just recompartmentalize facts into your narrow view. Still, with the Rig Veda, your still left with an interesting fact: Depsite the attempt to "redefine" the words, and to symbolize their meaning (reduce them to insignificance), you're still left with the obvious descriptions "fair skinned" "aryan skin color". I mentioned this before you replied Paul, because I KNEW you would try what you tried. You would try to rehash a noun out of the context. That is why I drilled the context first. Yet you still TRY to ignore it, as if some passing compromise would be sufficient: " The latter is ceratinly a legitimate and well-established interpretation, but so are those that reject it." Shit, Paul, in that case, EVERYTHING we read can be reinterpreted differently. But the matter is, how are those at the heart of the matter... HINDUS... interpreting it. Considering the way black hindus are TREATED, it is OBVIOUS. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think most people here are from the groups they're arguing should be added to the definition of black, and with the exception of me, I bet most of these people are American are just speculating about how other countries view the concept of "black people". One of these people even said that the term black never specifies Africans in Britain so I did a bit of research from the BBC and British census and discovered their definition is identical to the American one. Notice how these people never cite the census of India or Australia to make their point about how the term is understood in those countries. Instead they cite extremely vague and ancient religous texts and obscure rock songs. But that's why these people are attracted to wikipedia in the first place. It's an excellent opportunity to take an extremely fringe point of view and make it sound dominant but unfortunately this is a total violations of the rules of wikipedia.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 16:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Census of India until 1948 was under the rule of the British. They only did "ethnic" classifications. There is no "racial". However, I've TALKED to Dravidian East Indians, I've spoken to them face to face. Especially the Christian ones, many "Dravidians" SEE themselves as black. They may not say it openly because they know the STIGMA still remains, but in general once you talk to them man to man, from one black person to another, I usually get, without any kind of pretense, an acknowledgement. And an acknolwedgement that comes with a sense of relief that they can say it openly to SOMEONE and not pretend. For many it's like passing for white in America. Just like when I talk to a lot of darkerskinned East indians about caste. They always let me know when they come to America, the upper castes dont do that bullshit, but they do it over in India. We laugh about it, because we both know what is going on. Now if you want some names, email addresses, if you feel the need to meet them in person, analyze their face, interview their family to make sure these are REAL LIVE EAST INDIANS (and not some sockpuppets online), I will more than happily do my best to get their permission and get back to you. Now I CITED resources, and no one acknowledged them. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two points. 1 the BBC is a company who provides television channels, not dictionary definitions. 2 The article you cited doesn't provide a definition at all, letalone one that conforms to your ideas. It shows a pie chart, and that's the only place where the word 'Black' is used. The only thing this shows is that South Asians and black people are separate, but only one person claimed that black applied mostly to South Asians anyway. There is no attempt to define black people in that article.</p>

Or will you guys stop going in circles, stop saying "it's true because it is" and "it's true because America says so" and "its true because the biased people who never saw the facts for themselves assumed it must be so"--<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It also can't be resolved if people don't use common sense. Obviously if the article was separating blacks from South Asians, than they weren't defining black as any dark skinned ethnicity because South Asians are dark skinned. And while the BBC may not be a dictionary, they're an extremely credible source of news and perspective from the educated segments of Britain, and further still, if I recall they were using British census data when describing ethnic groups, and census definitions used for official statistics on the ethnic composition of a population trump dictionary definitions which are often so descriptive in nature that they can include any darkish population including the Black Irish. Certainly the focus of this article is a little more precise than that. --<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your reasoning is illogical to me. You're basically saying that excluding one group from the definition means that any non-African group must also be excluded. From personal experience of censuses and other forms that ask about ethnicity, I know how they are usually divided. They tend to be divided into white, black, and Asian with several entries under each, meaning that there are several subdivisions of the word black.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The separation of Asians says nothing about the definition of black on the whole, rather it indicates that Asians are considered to be neither black nor white. As for black Asians, that's incorrect. Their skin isn't dark, it's closer to a tan, that's probably why they're classed as neither black nor white.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 01:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Classifications on census forms change over time and are not scientific. Lumping millions of people together as "Asians" has no scientific basis, it's to do with socially constructed categories, and these change over time for various political and cultural reasons. As far as this article is concerned the point is that some South Asians have been characterised as "black people" and sometimes still are in some contexts. In other contexts the designation is rejected. Notable here are various so-called "scheduled tribes" in India, and, more significantly, many Dravdian-speakers living in Southern India (who were, by the way, labelled <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Ethiopians_9385.html" title="Eastern Ethiopians">Eastern Ethiopians</a> by Herodotus). Dravidians are not an oppressed class, but Dalits are, and some of their representatives have adopted black identity based on a rejection of caste as a racialised hierarchy. In other contexts, back in the Victorian era, Indians in general were often referred to as black. In his book <i>India - What can it teach us?</i> Max Muller, for example, attacks British soldiers who refer to Indians as "niggers". We need to cover the full range of historical and modern usage including debates about the scientific validity of such racial categories. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 01:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the census decision to lump all Asians together was not scientific, and although the census definition for Blacks can be justified on scientific grounds, the point of the census citations is imply to show how Blacks are defined for official purposes. This is an encyclopedia is it not? And there's a huge difference between adopting a black identity and actually being part of the black race, and because this is an encyclopedia and not a group therapy session designed to make everyone happy, we have to emphasize that difference. And the Victorian era, in case you haven't noticed, is over-it's fine as a historical citation, but it shouldn't be used in the current definition of "black people". And the fact that they called Indians "niggers" proves that they mistook them for members of the Negroid race, so over and over again, it all comes back to Black relating to African.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 15:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What both of you are doing is ignoring what the Asians themselves say, and instead relying on reports that non-asian colonizing powers dictate.

<p>My previous argument was aimed specifically at the evidence provided by the BBC website and Editingophrah's interpretation of it.

<p>Jcamp, I apologize, but my responses are not directed to one individual unless I respond directly to their previous point. You however generalize wayyy too much. Asians are about 1 billion, and you cannot use an average to justify a stereotype. On AVERAGE they come to a middle brown, but I'm (and i dont think ANYONE) is saying that all asians, or all east indians are black or even dark skinned. I am saying that a sizeable population of East INdia is of a very dark complexion, and are known as, call themselves and are referenced as Black. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is, I've never heard darker skinned Asians called black, here. As far as I know, it is treated as incorrect to call Asians black here, which is why they won't be treated as such in the census. I was arguing within the context of the census. Like I said though, the census isn't a good source for this sort of 'evidence'. My view is that black should apply to the wider view. If some Asians meet the criteria, I don't see why they should be excluded.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 16:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us see in here who can use common sense and who relies on absurd technicalities created by ignorant people in power. Mostafa Hefny is an Egyptian. When he came to America he was forced to classify himself as white. Now. Like any Asian of the same complexion and of similar experience, he knows that he is NOT white. He is Black. He knows that when he is outside in the American cities, and walks around, people agree that he is black (unless they are told that he is Egyptian). Just like Mr. East INdian. If the East Indian dalit puts on a hat and walks around any American city, he will be viewed as black. Only when he opens his mouth and his east indian accent is heard or if his hair is shown then does the idea change. The idea only changes because the people in America will see that he is not "African" and Americans link "black" with "Africans only". Notwithstanding the STIGMA of Africans and Blackness, East Indians who are Black do not hesitate to admit this. Do I need to get some of you nay-sayers on a plane, send you to India, then to some american cities to meet some East Indians I know in order for you to get this fact? --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:33, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I also posted info from the Rig Veda which you of course retranslated out of the same common sense context that you claim to uphold. It's common sense on one hand to just use the american principle, but then later you go and technicalitize the Rig Veda like some kind of student project on evasive maneuvers.

<p>This is not fringe: In Asia, black people inhabit Yemen, some areas of Iraq (especially Basra), much of Nepal (especially Rana Tharu), the Andaman Islands ( Negritos ), the indigenous Dalit population of India (numbering 160 million) and the larger Dravidian population of India (though not all Dravidians consider themselves black, a sizeable proportion phenotypically reflect their African heritage and acknowledge it). There are more recent Afro-Indian groups, such as the small group of 20,000-30,000 black Siddis in the Gujarat province of India, the Kaffiri of the island of Sri Lanka, and small communities of Sheedis in the coastal districts of the southern province of Sindh and neighboring Baluchistan.

Im not going to rely again on just the word of a white westerner when the entire hindu population speaks volumes by acts and deeds. They do not practice racism in hinduism simply based on a 5000 year old mistranslation of the rig veda. This is where you are having a disconnection from reality. The RACIALIZED INTERNALIZED PRACTICED interpretation of HINDUISM is based on consistent TRANSLATIONS of these texts. You don't come from America in 2003 and simply erase that factual history with some kind of repackaging of nouns! WIll you please stop trying to attack my credibility by focusing on my frustrated elaborations of your feigned dimwittedness? This is in addition to the fact that the issue here is about black people anyway. I was asked to present SOME evidence that black people were present in the Hindu religious scriptures. You got it. If this is not true, then why are DALIT EAST INDIAN intellectuals speaking up against them? --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 08:17, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea how old Bryant is nor do I care. He is a scholarly authority and his book is the latest detailed discussion of this topic. Actually the translation of "anasa" to mean noseless is <b>entirely</b> a phenomenon of western 19th century scholarship. The traditional Indian interpretation is derived from the medieval scholar <a href="../../../s/a/y/Sayana.html" title="Sayana">Sayana</a> (1315-1387), who says it means "faceless". So "RACIALIZED INTERNALIZED PRACTICED interpretation of HINDUISM" is not "based on consistent TRANSLATIONS of these texts". If you stop shouting for a minute you will see that most of what I say does not contradict you. I was merely pointing out that we shouldn't be dogmatic here and we should cite scholarly sources. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 08:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the contrary Griffith (whose translation I have read) ignored Sayana on this issue, as you could easily find out if you checked the facts. I have already said "it is well established that skin-colour hierarchies in India have existed for long time. That's probably beause most invaders of India entered from the north and established themselves in higher castes. It does not alter the fact that "anasa" almost certainly does not mean "flat-nosed"." As for Hinduism as a whole the situation is far from simple. There are many dark-skinned Brahmins in the south/ Many gods are portrayed as dark skinned, most notably <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">krishna</a>, whose name actually <i>means</i> "black" in Sanskrit.

<dd>The British census defines Blacks as peoples of African ancestry, so there's obviously not a critical mass of British people who define non-Sub-Saharan DNA as Black, and I'm not convinced there ever was. You can always find obscure references here and there describing every ethnic group in the world as Black, but that's not an acceptable standard for wikpedia. As for the Asian article-Asian is a much more ambiguous term because some Asians use it to replace anthropological categories like "Mongoloid" while the census defines Asian by all the peoples of Asian ancestry. The article you should be comparing this one to is the "White people" article, and you'll see that that article is limited to peoples with a genetic relationship (I.e. Caucasoids) and there definition of White people also conforms to the census definition. There's no reason why this article can't do the same, except for the fact that some Black people have a poor opinion of African people, and thus must expand their conception of Blackness to include non-Africans in order to feel good about themselves. That's why there's so much resistance to the idea of sub-Sahran people forming a coherent genetic group. I suspect that a lot of editors here are ashamed of their sub-Saharan DNA and thus prefer to emphasize the differences among sub-Saharans and the similarities with non-African dark skinned people. It's sad that the level of self-hatred has become so extreme among our people that its caused this article to become protected.

<dd>Concepts like Asian are not outside the realm of anthropology. A number of modern anthropologists reject the Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid system as having scientific validity. In forensics, this system uses arbitrary cranial indeces. Even anthropologists who are not cultural or linguistic may find the concept of an Asian to be a race. Race means different things to different anthropologists. A number of anthropologists like the ones who wrote the US Census racial categories find that self-identity is a valid way to determine race.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 17:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite. If you're a white South African who became a U.S. Citizen, you may self-identify as an African-American, but that doesn't give you the ricght to check the census box marked Black. And race is defined by common genetic heritage. A number of anthropologists dispute the existence of race more so than its definition. But even if you wanted to define the Black race by culture or language, there's no justification to lump both Australoids and South Asians in with Africans under the heading "Black people". I have no problem with the Untouchables of India self-identifying with the African-American experience, but again, this just makes my point that Blackness is all about the pan-African gene-pool, culture, or struggle.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 18:51, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats because African and Black do not mean the same exact thing EO. African is not a race, its a geographic grouping. In addition, you're still stuck on the Classical Negro DNA profile. Why? You are no different in that regard than the Eurocentricists that swear that East Africans are "not as black" as the West African! DNA profiles are arbitrarily defined and categorized. Me, I regard Black people as genetically diverse across the world, with more than one distinct profile. I call them "Equatorials". You have three main Equatorial <b>black</b> humans. The African, the Aboriginal, and the Asian. You cannot refute that because DNA profiling to a racial category is still based on an arbitrary distinction. Thats why those silly charts with the black Africans lumped on one side and the other groups lumped next to the British is so fake. They take a select few DNA traits that link them that way. Forget the other traits that would show a totally different profile. In addition, doesn't it seem strange that the human race is classified on a Eurocentric system? It's still following the circular reasoning <b>they are black, because they are African, because they are black, because they are African...".

<dd>But why do they choose to self-identify as Black? In the case of the Untouchables of India, they identified with the African-American struggle. That's why I think it makes far more sense to equate Blackness with pan-Africanism because that allows us to both have a coherent theme that allows us to discuss non-African people from a cultural or political conception of Blackness. But we should also point out that non-African self-identified Blackness appears to have no formal or official status (i.e. census records) nor is it justified on racially genetic grounds since the physical anthropological category known as Negroid does not include non-Africans, and dark-skinned non-Africans are completely unrelated to the sub-Saharan family that dominates the word Black.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 20:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not the main reason. They were struggling BECAUSE they are Black. They identified with other Black people because they SHARED the same struggle. They didn't know enough about that because they were colonized. The word didn't get to them without any kind of communication. There was no Internet back then. Only through visual video recordings and travel between the two groups did the Dalits see the fact "oh these people are just like us!". Negroid certainly includes non Africans, why are the Asian Negritos called such? EO I really think you are a white racist guy at this point. You are following the same logic they follow. Pidgeon-hole the black people into a narrow classification.

<dd>Actually the scientific support for a sub-Saharan race is overwhelming, because Africans and non-Africans was the original division of human kind, and whether scientists use the term "race" or not, the genetic research from several different studies all confirms that sub-Saharan DNA defines a unique genetic cluster. And even before the days of extensive genetic research, the term Negro and Negroid (which is derived from the Latin word for Black) was one of the three major anthropological categories and described sub-Saharans. But even ignoring genetics and anthropology, and looking at social identity, the social identity of being Black involves being African or having ancestors from the African diasporas, or in the case of the Indian Untouchables, being able to relate to the African-American experience. Also, the fact that blacks calling each other "Brother" and "Sister" defines a unique yet global social group that comes from "Mother Africa". Even the black scholars who claim that ancient Indians are Black, are not arguing that non-Africans being included in the definition. Instead they're arguing that the ancient Indians were an Africoid people. So again, Black is all about Africa--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 16:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Negro and Negroid are relevant to the Black people article but Africoid is not. Negro means black and Negroid means similar to black, but Africoid means similarity to Africans. Even if black scholars thought Indians were Africoid (similar to Africans), the relevant information would be if they thought Indians were Negroid (similar to Blacks). Since Africoid is irrelevant, I will use the term Negroid. If the Black scholars thought Indians were Negroid (similar to Blacks), then that shows Indians are arguably Black people.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 17:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Africoid and Negroid have the same meaning. One emphasized colour, the other emphasizes place of origin, but both describe the same race. Now I'm not really interested in arguing whether Indians were Africoid or not, but what I am saying is that Indians are only considered Black to the extent that they are believed to be Africoid, or that they self-identify with the African-American struggle (i.e. The Untouchables). It's this notion of Blackness independent of sub-Sahran DNA or pan-African culture that is extremely fringe and is given way too much weight in the current article--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 18:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No They don't have the same meaning. The emphasis is critical and makes all the difference. YOU see the similarity as more meaningful than others. I do not. Your circular again. INdians are not considered to be black to the extent they are considered to be Africoid. They are considered to be black BECAUSE they look black, which is why they are ALSO considered to be Africoid. I really don't know why you think the Untouchable struggle owes it's origins to African Americans. Do you realize that MLK's peace protests were inspired BY Ghandi (not the other way around) and that it was Ghandi (not MLK, nor any other American) that created the Scheduled Caste political group? The genetic pre-disposition you have is the fringe position. Bear in mind, genetic profiling is a new concept, and I do not recall it being taught in schools and I know my younger family members are not taught this in school either. You speak much like Dienekes Pontikos, a man I have perodically engaged over the years. He swears by a genetic philosophy on classifying humans by racial groups.

Anthropology includes both biological anthropologists, physical anthropologists and cultural anthropologists as well as others. It is true that sub-Saharan Africans cluster genetically, and they also cluster into regional groups genetically, but not all biological anthropologists would agree that there does exist a sub-Saharan African race. Physical anthropologists use descriptive identifiers for archaic specimens and might use the Negroid, Mongoloid, Caucasoid system for recent remains, but could still acknowledge that social identify was also a legitimate way to classify races. Cultural anthropologists would most likely listen to self identity. All three of these listed types of anthropologists could agree that social identity was a legitimate racial designation, making social identity not outside the realm of anthropological merit.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 17:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an African American, I care very much about this article. In fact, what many users here don't seem to realize is how many people use Wikipedia as an "accurate" informative source, despite the fact that anyone is free to edit articles to their personal designs. This article on black people even comes up when people use popular search engines. Now I have seen a perfectly fine article illustrating the diversity of black people in addition to US and European definitions with great references and highly informative external links decimated by a select few users who for days debated on whether to add a sentence or two about a "scientific" definition of "black."</p>
<p>So instead of continuing to improve an article which illustrated to diversity of blacks not just of African American identity or American and European definitions, but also including great black civilizations and exposing a few commonly held misconceptions about the roles so called "black people" have played in the world history and certain civilizations. So instead of resolving this, these so called professional or well-versed users revert to an article that is months old and doesn't convey nearly the same amount of diverse information of the origins of blacks historically. This is meant as no disrespect, but it is becoming difficult to believe these users are adults.</p>
<p>If necessary, take a poll among the users who truly care about this article on which is the more diverse and informative or if users insist on being childish, then request someone from wikipedia to regulate those who edit this article or place permanent protection. I have been watching this article with great interest for several months. When I first discovered this article over a year ago, it was well-written and informative and over time people watered it down to include only specifically regional concepts of black, primarily American and European concepts, when the debate and facts of "black" identity and history extends far beyond US and or European definitions. Also, for the record, just because an article was there for months, doesn't mean it was a great article. It just means many people didn't care enough to try to improve them and diversify the information.</p>
<p>I have seen many articles on Wikipedia about some great people who articles and accomplishments are short changed and left that way for months before some bothers to come along and say, "there is much more to this topic." So will the few select users who have been engaged in these petty "revert wars" and squabbling over a few minor sentences keep their pride in check and do what is good for the informational aspects of black people historically. As someone who is well-versed in my culture and the history of black people crossculturally, I personally felt the previous version was the most accurate I have seen on Wikipedia. It explained differing perspectives on black identity around the world, exposed popular misconceptions about the role black people have played in certain civilizations, named some great black civilizations that are not commonly know in the Western Hemisphere, listed the experiences of "black" or dark-skinned people on a crosscultural level, provided great references, bibliography, and external links to well-versed and professional information sources.</p>
<p>Now, I do not know the ethnic identity of the people who edit this article, but what I do know is that I was proud of the article I just referenced and reverted on an intellectual and cultural level. That article was made by the wikipedians who realize that people, right or wrong, view this as an informative site and want as much references, external links, and bibliography as possible, people who understand the diversities ob so called "black people" and won't revert to older articles just because the can't get another select wikipedia user to agree on something. SO, not to be harsh, but for those three or four users who have engaged in this pointless **** measuring contest over this article, stop being childish, continue to improve the article if you truly care for it, and stop squabbling over one or two sentences, before protection is once again placed on this page.</p>
<p>"PS. For the record, personally, I saw no problem with the user who added the "scientific" perspective with a reference on the black people article. The fact is outside of POV and debate, there is an anthropoligical aspect of all peoples of this world from a scientific perspective as well as social and encyclopedic definitions. The dictionary and and social perspectives were given with references, and I thought it enhanced the article for a scientic perspective to be mentioned with a reference as well, even if generally disagreed with. There were only two users arguing over that and that ruined the way a great article in the making was going. SO perhaps those two (or whoever more is involved in this need to sort this out on a personal level through e-mail or what have you outside of wikipedia. I hope we can all resolve to make this article greater for the average reader. dynamicknowledge.</p>

Notice how all the diverse peoples of sub-Sahran Africa fall in the bottom right quadrent. Notice how they're nowhere near other Dark skinned peoples like Australian aboriginals and Dravidians. This is further scientific validation for the census and dictionary definitions that emphasize African ancestry when defining Black which is further confirmed by the anthropological classification of Negroid (from the Latin Black). The untouchables of India are relevant only to the degree that they self-identify with AFRICAN-Americans. I'm nost sure if Australian Aboriginals are relevant to this article at all because I have yet to see evidence that they were ever described as Black by a critical mass of people in anything more than a rough and ready descriptive sense not much different from how dark haired Irish were sometimes called Blacks.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 17:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Anything else just leads to an incoherent mess as we try to lump every one from the Australian aboriginals to the Black Irish into a vague and meaningless conception of Blackness--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:04, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And if "the theme" cannot be agreed upon, what is wrong with portrating the different viewpoints, and telling the reader that there are disagreements as to how the term should be "defined", if it should be defined at all.

If we follow your "theme" and disregard from all other views, then the article will never be NOV – leading to perpectual edit warring and an even more confusing article. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 19:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But having a neutral point of view does not mean all conceptions of blackness must be treated equally. For example that article you cited clearly shows where some of the confusion comes from. Blacks were originally defined as the dark-skinned race, especially the African branch of it. In other words, the only reason non-African dark-skinned peoples were ever called Black in the first place (to the limited degree that they were) was because people ignorantly thought that all dark-skinned people were either Africans or related to them. Webster's term "African branch of the Black race" clearly reveals the historical misconception that all dark skinned peoples of the world belonged to the same family tree. So again, even when discussing the linguistic ambiguity of Blackness, it all comes back to Africans, and others were only labled Black to the degree that they were thought to be related to them.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:50, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

It predated the "Negrito" designation.

<dd>Well what do you expect? Even the article you cited said the term Black refers especially to Negroes and Negroe is a Spanish synonym for Black, so essentially the 2 terms are equivalent. Look, this is not a controversial subject, but you guys are making it controversial. I already said that we could mention non-African people who self-identify with the pan-African experience. What more do you want? Non-African people who self-identify with Black without identifying with the pan-African experience? How many of those exist and who here is qualified to speak for them? It just seems this could be a nice coherent article unified by commn theme except for the fact that people have to make a really big deal about some extremely fringe view that they know nothing about.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 20:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>YES I want Non-African people who self-identify with Black without identifying with the pan-African experience. I want their experiences counted IN THIS ARTICLE. They are Black.

Common sense, as you harken to should tell you point blank. That's a black man. But because his DNA doesn't fit into the 'classical negro' DNA profile, you want to take the Eurocentric viewpoint.

You implied earlier about the European erroneously making these people 'black' based on an assumed link to Africa.

<dd>THe way I define Black is confirmed by the census which was referenced in the article-you're the one who muddled that discussion with genetic issues by drawing attention to the fact that the census was not endorsing anthropological classifications and citing this in the article. So you're the one who turned the census definition into a science debate and then when references from actual science studies and science related articles were added to balance your POV pushing, you reverted them so that only your POV was represented and than requested the page be protected so that your POV pushing would be preserved. I stay on the subject of the term "Black" by citing dictionaries that define it especially in terms of Africans, and found two dictionary definitions that defined it exclusively in terms of Black ancestry and an article on biomedicine that did so too. And the article you cited essentially made by point that Black and African are more or less synonymous especially since Negro means Black in Spanish. I'm not sure what the other reference you're talking about is, but as far as I'm aware, the only credible evidence that non-Africans self-identify as Black in critical mass involves the Untouchables of India, and they do so by identifying with the African-American experience. And so I ask again, who are the non-Africans that self-identify as Black without identifying with the pan-African experience and where are the references for such cultural movements? It's a very simple question and you seem to be evading it.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 21:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Go to dictionary.com and type in "Black person" and see how refuted my dictionary definitions are. Most dictionaries define Blacks as either a dark-skinned race from Africa or a dark-skinned race ESPECIALLY one from Africa. Black in Spanish is Negro and in physical anthropology Negroid is limited to Africans. Further people accuse me of taking an American perspective, and yet no one can find a single official census from any country in the world that defines Black in any way different from me, but I guess that doesn't matter because if enough wikipedians share a fringe view point, then wikipedias undue weight rules and referencing rules fly out the window. And your argument about untouchables calling themselves Black because they identify with dark Americans who aren't African is the high-point of this group's stupidity. I had no idea there were so many Australoid U.S. citizens out there marching in the civil rights movement. And all this time I thought that was an African-American struggle but Martin Luther King and Malcom X were really Australoid.

<dd>Oh give it up. The Untouchables of India related to the African-American experience (for whatever reason) and decided to call themselves Black because that's what African-Americans are called. So the central theme of Blackness equating with pan-Africanism, either genetically, culturally, or metaphorically is preserved. I'm not sure why people here are so ashamed of their African ancestry that they want to minimize its relevance both culturally and genetically and completely divorce Africa from their blackness and instead lump themselves in with non-African people. You embarrass me and you embarrass yourselves. And as for dictionary definitions, most emphasize African ancestry when defining Black (often exclusively), and the few that don't define Blackness so broadly it includes the Black Irish-though I suspect that makes several here happy.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I could produce 1000 references to describing the Irish as Black to, so I'm not sure what this proves other than simple descriptive convenience. Does the Australian census include Australian aboriginals in their definition of Black? Anyway, I'm not opposed to including Australian aboriginals in the article, but I think we need to make it clear that they were called Blacks because of their physical resemblance with Africans. This will allow us to discuss multiple peoples without destroying our central pan-Africanism theme. For example, Websters dictionary defined Negro as the African branch of the Black race which proves that lumping all dark skinned people under the Black umbrella came from a misconception, now discredited by genetics, that all dark people were related to Negroes, and thus were all Blacks. Further examples of this thinking can be found here[<a href="http://www.raceandhistory.com/historicalviews/mungoman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.raceandhistory.com/historicalviews/mungoman.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>]. So I see no reason we can't reach a consensus and compromise. I wont oppose you from including non-Africans in the discussion of Blacks, but in return all I ask is that you not censor the fact that these people were called Black either because they looked like Africans (Australian aboriginals) or because they identified with the African-American struggle (the Untouchables of India). I propose this article describe Blackness from a genetic, physical, poltical, and cultural perspective, with pan-Africanism unifying the different conceptions in an elegant way. Is that really so much to ask?--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 12:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are talking about objective (not relative) descriptions of blackness. Aboriginals skin color is objectively as dark as the African. Again this Filipino <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeta07.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeta07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeta07.jpg</a> is as black as the average Nigerian. That's just skin color. Now, if we want to take the matter further... his hair, features, etc. He is more black African <b>looking</b>, more easy to mistake for a black African than the average African-American. IF you want to take it further, his experiences are similar to that of Black Africans (feminine haircare for example is a cultural as well as physical experience. Surely you must concede that for example is a strong albeit not exclusive black experience that can be shared between his people and black african people.). Politically of course his people experienced similar oppression by the Spanish then the Americans. Yet you will swear he is not black because non-phenotype DNA is not in line with the 'classical negro' and he is physically from a place far from Continental Africa. That's absurd. Find me a Irishman that looks as black as this Filipino. IF you want to reach a consensus, you have to do away with your eurocentric and American bias. We know that the Formosa and Andamese people are the ancestors of many black Asians. But to concede i must admit we don't have enough information yet to form a clear historical link. This is why I do not put Formosa and Andamese references into the article yet. I think I did with Andamese but that was done early in the article's recreation. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nowhere does the Australian census use the word 'black'. There is a question if you are Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, both, or neither, and a question that asks your ancestry, and provides 7 tick-boxes (which, with the exceptions of 'Chinese' and 'Australian', are all European nationalities) and a space to write in 'other'.</dd>
<dd>Common usage in Australia, however is that 'black'=Aboriginal. Frankly, unless the context is international, I <b>assume</b> Aboriginality in a person spoken of as 'black'. I don't use 'black' by itself to describe African-origin people unless I'm clearly speaking in the context of non-Australian culture (such as discussing characters in foreign TV shows), and I've never heard any other Australian do it either. I do know the difference between Aboriginal and African-origin people (since somebody elsewhere on the page accused 'uneducated' Australians of confusing the two people-groups, because of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Aus. English</a> usage), it's just I'm far more familiar with the former, having only been in the same room as an African-origin person <i>once</i> in my whole life. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_holden_19dd.html" title="User:Kelly holden">Kelly holden</a> 04:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And equally important is this: If we follow your philosophy, then we are certainly back to the endless debate about Ancient Egyptians and Ethiopians. Those people whose phenotypes are more varied and who can't be put into the 'classical negro' box either. Pretty soon we are back to the Coon anthropology where Black people only inhabit the western half of Equatorial Africa, and the Eastern area is primarily "Caucasoid". --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Isolated EditingOprah's Circular argument</span></h2>
<p>EO (EditingOprah) has made this statement in various ways many times: <b>I think we need to make it clear that they (Aboriginals) were called Blacks because of their physical resemblance with Africans.</b> A question came to my mind. Why did the Europeans call the <b>Africans</b> black? The answer to that question is more fundamentally important and relevant to this article. Because the same reason is present for Africans, Asians, and Australians. Let's keep something in mind here. European colonization is around 500 years old. Africans themselves were no more nor less articulating themselves as Black than any dark-skinned Asian and Aboriginal. Yet they still DID articulate themselves, all three groups, throughout history. It is just by human (not European) capacity to see hues and contrasts, that the European also noticed this in comparision to themselves. Yet we know that Africans, Aboriginals, and others related to the European as "white" (in contrast to themselves). The same reason the Europeans called the Africans black is the same reason they called the Aboriginals black. That reason is the same reason that they may (or may not) erroneously believed the Aboriginal to be linked to the African more than they actually are. That only heightens the obvious fact that the aboriginal was recognizeable as a 'black' person. Same with those of the Asians. Only when the Asians became aware of the African stigma... only when they were colonized psychologically to <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negrophobia.html" title="Negrophobia">Negrophobia</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a> would they yell "no I'm not black, because I'm not African!". That Negrophobia is why you'll have Asians in here swearing that there are no native black people in Asia. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 08:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dasibari not Gherngher</span></h2>
<p>For the third time I have taken this statement out of the article (Reasons repeted below):</p>
<p>"The Spanish word Negro which came from the Latin word Nigris, which eventually came to denote the color black, originally was a geographic designation. The natives of what is today Nigeria were referred to by the Romans regarding their proximity to the River Niger. The Berber name of the river is Gher-n-gher. The Romans apparently Latinized the Berber name to Niger or Nigris. Hence, the people who lived around the river became known, in Latin, as the Nigritae. Eventually, the dark waters of the Niger and the dark skin of the Nigritae would combine in Roman vernacular to replace the ancient Latin word for black (ater). Negro eventually came to mean "black colored" in Latin and in its descendant languages."</p>
<p>If anyone posting this would actually READ the history of the Niger river, the romans called it "DASIBARI". The Songhay word Isa-Ber "big river" sounds a lot like Dasi-Bari, and if you are going to take and etymological approximation, at least use the one that is more consistent. The Berber people that WE recognize, and that is implied in the article (i.e. the berber people that use gher-n-gher to describe the Niger river) did not exist in the region, even. Although Romans used the word "berber" broadly to refer to barbarians (foreigners), that is not sufficient to link unrelated people (northern saharan berbers, and Niger Delta Africans) together to postulate a unified linguistic explanation.</p>
<p>This is the text taken directly from the Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger_River_8a69.html" title="Niger River">Niger River</a> article.</p>
<p>The nations of Nigeria and Niger are named after the river. The people who live along it have a variety of names for it, notably Jeliba in Manding and <b>Isa Ber</b> "big river" in Songhay. The Romans had heard of the Niger and called it <b>Dasibari</b>; the middle and lower course of the Niger was also known as Quorra, also of unknown origin.</p>
<p><br />
The mouth of the Niger river near Nigeria is no where near the bend in Timbucktu, nor the outlet in the Guinea area (where that portion of the river likely was named by the Berbers LATER). As the Nigeria Wiki article indicates clearly, there is no way the Romans had circumnavigated the entire river. THey did not KNOW the Guinea outlet linked to the Nigerian portion. In fact, that was not "discovered" until the late 19th century. The reason this annoys me is because again we are giving the European credit for "naming" the entire black people of the world, which is based on a lie. As I have pointed out before. Black people (yes, even black people) have and had the capacity to see objectively their skin color, and objecvely describe it as dark or black. In addition, as ancient documents show, the descriptions of black people are found in Egyptian writings, Biblical writings, Rig Veda, Arabic writings etc. The "ENGLISH/LATIN" word may not be found there, but we know that the word "Niger" was used to describe other people in antiquity: Acts 13:1 In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. (Look at any translation of the Bible in antiquity preceeding the EUropean colonization of Africa. Simon is called Niger all the way back to the original vulgate. He was never called "Simon called Ater" Since the contributor indicates that Gher-n-Gher is the source of this word, in antiquity, it is sloppy to rely on "apparently" as a credible way to conclude that this word originated from an uncited source, from a people who were not even present in the region. (There were no Sahari or Nigerois based "berbers" near the third course of River Niger. Since the romans would call anyone "Berber", that also makes this kind of conclusion impossible to verify. The "Berber" people are a mix and hodgepodge of a variety of related people. Some even had a written language during roman periods. This is now the fourth time I have disputed this claim and I would really like it if the next person that puts the Berber explanation in, they cite this from a credible source and put a little 1 at the end. Credible means credible, not self-published and not another website that makes the same statement with no real research. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The Spanish word Negro comes from the Latin word Nigris, which eventually came to denote the color black. - This was moved to the second paragraph for 2 reasons. 1. Black the word is used in the first paragraph as it's english definition and origin. It is not based on Spanish or Latin. No other word for black person is mentioned here. The word Negro is better placed in the second paragraph where Latin culture describes their interpretation of black and african people. If necessary I will take out the "negro" word in the top of the page and just leave this as 'black'.</li>
<li>, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginals.html" title="Aboriginals">Aboriginals</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aeta.html" title="Aeta">Aeta</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanesians.html" title="Melanesians">Melanesians</a> and others - this was restored because these three groups certainly are <b>not</b> part of the yellow, white, or red color groups based upon skin tone as perceived by Europeans of the time. They are part of the <b>black</b> color group perceived by Europeans at the time.</li>
<li><i>(Semi-voluntary because if you "look White" to the average American you have a choice; if you "look Black" to the average American you do not have a choice.)</i> was replaced with <i>The Black identity in America includes people of various mixtures, whereas the white identity does not include bisually perceptible mixtures of black ancestry.</i> because first, this semi-voluntary statement is not being described with how one chooses to look, but how others internalize their origins. You certainly cannot choose how you 'look' but there is nothing logical about choosing how others perceive you. My statement addresses the deeper point which is society refuses to accept a black-mixed person as anything other than black. If you can word it better than that then do so. But the revert is confusing, and illogical.</li>
<li>I changed <i>always lacked endogamous color lines</i> to <i>have often ignored <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endogamous.html" title="Endogamous">endogamous</a> color lines</i> because it's also true. Endogamy has to do with marriage and procreation. Latino culture certainly has segments that follow endogamy within 'white' and 'black' color groups. Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic has it's racially divisive areas. Although it's often ignored, there is no lacking of it's existence. They do practice endogamy albeit much less frequently than the U.S.</li>

<li>Literal skin color (people outside of Africa with dark skin are black)</li>
<li>Equatorial African heritage (i.e lightskinned african americans culturally are still black)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent revert by</span></h2>
<p>The recent indiscriminate revert by 67.49.221.43 is totally out of line. Firstly, the revert he chooses is an earlier version of the article that I had wrote which was seriously needing contributions, refinements, and cleaning up. Secondly, the article obviously takes EditingOprah's POV regarding the supremacy of American POV, genetic DNA interpretation since two of the paragraphs in the beginning differ from the overall article I wrote a few months back. What makes this position so annoying is that I already put a strong contribution originally, acknowledging the impact of Black Americans on worldwide Black identity. This section below highlights the ad nauseum position of EO regarding the philosophy that Black Americans have the most legitimacy in being black:</p>
<ul>
<li>There has been a strong position by African Americans that regional proximity to Africa proper is and should be the third defining characteristic of blackness. This belief has been bolstered by the Afrocentric, Negritude and Negrisimo movements of the 20th century, which focused on socio-economic unity between Africa and black people of the West. Driving these movements is a desire to improve the perception of the West African diaspora (most black people in the Western Hemisphere originate from West Africa), whose contributions to the history and culture of the West have often been maligned or ignored. Certain aspects of African American culture and history, especially the American Civil Rights and Black Power movements and the international cultural phenomena of various African American musical expressions have played a role in increasing the pride of people of black identity around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, since I put IN the article, the significance of American Black perspectives, I find it absurd that we keep pushing for an exclusivity to black americans. Enough! --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 15:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The version of the aricle I reverted back to has been in place for at least several months (maybe much longer). It s very balanced, high-lighting all the main conceptions of Blackness including non-Africans in great detail. Further it doesn't even make my best points about the united DNA of sub-Saharans or census and dictionary definitions, so it's in no way biased towards my view point. This version was so comprehensive and neutral that it have been in place since the first time I ever looked at wikipedia many months ago (with only the most mild revisions occuring). It was only July 1st did someone (you?) completely rewrite by taking extremely fringe views and elevating them to center stage. Your fringe views were already mentioned in the long accepted version of the article. Don't be greedy and POV by trying to put them all over the article. This long accepted version represents all the views in a proportional way, giving more weight to the views that carry more weight. There was never any controversy over this version over the longest time. It was only when someone completely destroyed it on July 1st and started pushing extreme fringe views did controversy start. I will not see a stable, well researched, neutral, and balanced version of the article destroyed by fringe POV pushing. This has the potential to be a feature article if POV pushers would just keep their hands off it. Indeed this version is so balanced and neutral atht even Ezeu and I agree on it, which never happens. I didn't write a single word in the version I'm pushing, so it represents no bias on my part. Please leave it alone.

<p>That version was a version I mostly wrote EO. For god's sake, are you paying attention? I reminded you that twice. Look at the article history. Next is this, you revert the article after a month of painstaking editing, and that is a unilateral action. Just because you use phrases like "State of article was excellent fro months. Got ruined July 1st, so good version has returned." and "Why is it a few users insist on challenging what had been established with refs, bibl, ex.links, etc" that doesn't fly pal. I put the biblical references, and also I saw how other people contributed, even in some ways I did not agree with and I do not take the unilateral approach you take. The version you reverted back to was sloppy and filled with incoherencies (mostly due to my grammatical rough draft nature). Now so far, you are the only fringe individual in this entire discussion and frankly I am getting sick and tired of your tactics. Now if you want this article to be permanently locked for eternity and if you want to be one of the people that contribute to making Wikipedia an exclusive edit club, then keep going. Keep playing. I WILL revert any edit you make unilaterally, I guarantee you that. YOu don't have any contributions to add then expect it. Otherwise you can do this the right way, and edit, (not revert) and show some consistency. Firstly, the nonsense about DNA... forget it, it ain't coming in here the way you want it, so you can toss that notion. The nonsense about Black Americans being the rulers of blackness, toss it, it's done. I showed you pictures of black filipinos, you say nothing. I show you logical examples from antiquity, you say nothing. You're not saying ANYTHING, except to repeat yourself and you are now resorting to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> tactics.

<p>Here is another thing about your ignorant nature which is causing this escalation. You did not pay attention to the editing history over the past month. I originally a few months ago, made a series of major changes, approximately once a month. Two months ago I had indicated that I wanted others to edit this article to the best of their ability and let no one of my position to contribute until... a month ago. Much of what you did was undo a lot of changes that need to remain. Yes I know there are sections missing, and I want to address that, but your silly attempt at being "official" sounding when you do these silly reverts is disrupting the process.

<dd>The long accepted version of this article already goes into extensive deatil about people who self-identify as Black outside the African diasporas, but Zaph apparently doesn't feel the Black race is good enough unless it's always defined to include non-Africans so he keeps trying to elevate non-African conceptions of Blackness to center stage and minimize or enetirely eliminate teh African only conception of Blackness, and in so doing he keeps messing with a long lasting stable well balanced version of the article and making serious factual errors in the process. He's now even trying to rewrite history to make it sound like early explorers were thinking of non-Africans when they defined the black race, but this is clearly contradicted by the historical record. For example, the 18th century anthropologists Carolus Linnaeus and Johann Blumenback were the first to use color coded racial classifications and neither of them defined the races in a way Zaph is tryng to suggest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can't have it that way EO. You can't have "Africans only" and "inclusivity outside of AFrica" at the same time. There is a LARGE section for your perspective STILL in the article. Why are you not expanding that section? There are actually TWO.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 U.S. society equates the label with African-American ethnicity</li>
<li>2.1 Who is a descendant of the African Diaspora?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is MORE than enough to be considered fair and balanced. His reliance on outdated and inconsistent 18th century information is not a credible way to sustain a position. I don't mention what early explorers do in the article. He has more than enough swing for his position, and I think the administrators at Wikipedia should leave it at that. No more unilateral edit wars. He's had two at least.

I personally think this is an excellent way to define Blackness and the perspective I've heard all my life, but I'm no longer trying to reshape the article into my perspective. Instead I'm happy just getting the article back to the well balanced stable form it was in before the disasterous July 1st revisions--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 17:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even though <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28historical_definitions%29.html" title="Race (historical definitions)">historical races that anthropologists have defined</a> have only rarely defined blacks to also include non-Africans, these select number of anthropologists, relying merely on their own POV, do not outweigh the many more people who would have called black-looking people blacks. Since no anthropologist could objectively define race, the weight we should put on any of these obscure racial catergorization systems should be equal to the common person's perception. Irish, Southeast Asians, South Asians, and Australians have been considered black by many more people than the few individuals who wanted to define race for the rest of us. Definitons of race all boil down to POV which were used to define all races. The common man/woman should not have their POV disregarded because they do not hold the title of anthropologist, since anthropologists who have defined race have used their POV as the final decision. -- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 17:59, 4 August 2006</dd>

<dd>The common man and woman says that Black people are from Africa. That's why the dictionary, which refelects common useage says the term Black is used either exclusively or especially to describe the African race. The stable version of the article (the one that lasted for months prior to the disasterous July 1st revision) reflected this reality but also devoted a considerable amount of attention to people who self-identify as Black outside of the African diasporas. This was an incredibley proportional and balanced article and that's why it lasted so long. And btw it is possible to objectively define race. Sub-Saharan populations form their own uniques genetic cluster that is widely separated from other major genetic clusters, and thus on the basis of DNA form their own objectively defined race. But even ignoring the scientific validity of racial classifications, it's importan to have a historical discussion about where the idea of a black race came from and not to rewrite history to push a certain POV. Even the fringe Afro-centric scholars who argue that South Asians and Oceanic people are Black argue that they are Africoid, because they're smart enough to know that being defined as part of the Black race depends on a common ancestry. So Zaphs view is not only a fringe view, but its a mischaracterization of a fringe view--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 18:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is clear that there are differences of opinion as to what "black" is. The only solution, unless we want a perpetual edit war, is to let the article explain the different view-points. This can be done by having a lead paragraph that is neutral, and sub-sections that deal with different hypotheses. Locking the article is merely a temporary solution. Unless each editor is willing to allow other opinions to be represented (from a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>), we may as well tag this article with an ugly {{this article sucks}} template. We could run a poll, or even report individual users to the Arbitration Committee, but that wouldnt help the situation. I do not agree with the opinions of Editingoprah, but I agree with his compromise to revert to a prior version. Reverting to the version prior to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=61586951&amp;oldid=61278784" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=61586951&amp;oldid=61278784" rel="nofollow">this major edit of a stable version</a>, and starting from there, seems like a good compromise. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 19:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I reverted to the stable version (i.e. pre July 1st) and this version did in fact explain all the different views which is why it was so stable for so long. But then Zaph started complaining about really trivial things like the River Niger in Nigeria so I agreed to edit that out of the stable version. But than he kept trying to make more and more changes and I thought "Hold on! This version lasted for months with very few changes and all of a sudden you're trying to make so many changes so quickly, just as you had done on July 1st, and on top of that you're speculating about history and making errors in the process." At that point I had no choice but to revert Zaph's edits because he was destroying the most stable version of the article. I believe the good balanced long lastig version of the article (with River Niger discussion removed) is now protected, and perhaps the solution is to just keep it protected because from July 1st on its been all down hill, and most of the people who want to change it want to add opinions, not facts, and those opinions are already well represented in the stable version so I'm not sure what their problem is. I've compromised by not trying to force genetic and census definitions of Blackness into the article. Not sure why they can't compromise too, since the stable version of the article represents their views in graphic detail--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 20:01, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I never made any revisions nor did I revert anything. You speak of July 1st this and July 1st that, what the heck are you talking about? In addition, you falsely accuse me of starting edit wars.

Once, and that was many months ago when the article was extremely offensive. No one argued this, and it was not during any current updating.

<p>This July 1st nonsense is revealed for what it is. Some of you need to actually LOOK at article history. On June 29th, some major changes were made, NOT BY ME. I was not even interested in the article at the time. A wide varitey of people made changes, some major reverts as IP addresses without explanations(which I find to be an act of bad faith) and should be regarded as vandalism. ONE edit was made on July 1st... and GUESS who it was. It was EditingOprah's sock puppet 67.49.221.43. The same IP that made the unilateral changes NOW that precipitated this edit war.

Zaph, I'm not responsible for the July 1st edit. Why would I revise the article to emphasize non-African conceptions of Blackness I so disagree with. That makes no sense at all.

<p>Firstly, I am not going to respond to each teeny tiny point in here that has been addressed. Yes I certainly cannot lock an article physically on my own, but obvioulsy I brought the matter to locking, and that's obviously what I would expect after a request, a legitimate request is made. I will do it a thousand times if people keep trying (whether Afrocentric or Eurocentric) to unilaterally dominate this article. So let me clear up all of the points that make a difference in here</p>
<ul>
<li>Zaph apparently doesn't feel the Black race is good enough unless it's always defined to include non-Africans so he keeps trying to elevate non-African conceptions of Blackness to center stage and minimize or enetirely eliminate teh African only conception of Blackness, - EditingOprah</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>False. EO, Yes you certainly are pissing me off with your silly conclusions. The Black race is good enough, African-Americans are good enough, there is no concept of "good enough" to contend with. ACCURACY is the issue here. You are so guided by "massa" when he tells you that you are nothing and inferior to the rest of humanity. It is white massa that tells you that your seperate from the rest of humanity. Massa tells you that even though other people are of varying degrees of mixture, varying degrees of ancestry, varying degrees of historical interaction... you poor negro historically don't have the capacity to do or be anything outside of Africa unless you are a slave. Come on EditingOprah, tell the audience here ONE Black civilization that you know of that existed historically outside of Africa? You can't name one. Why? Because in your slave mind, we don't have that capacity. Us negroes, once we leave Continental Africa, become something else besides black people. Black Africa is a protective shield that keeps us locked in. And those who were adventurous and strong enough to leave that shield.... well they aren't black now are they. -- Even though you don't realize it EO, this is the philosophy you are teaching. I will never let your philosophy enter this article for the rest of my life. I swear to God. So from now on I refer to your philosophy... the philosophy of black people not existing historically outside of Africa (unless they are slaves) as the "massa's negro" philosophy. Now what?--<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 02:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dark Tichondrias whom has earned so much respect for me is one of many Asian people who obviously understand the importance of making this connection more significant than the "massa's negro" ideology. Whether in antiquity, or middle ages, or recently, black people, whether connected via genetics, or ancient historical similarities, or regional acknowledgement of blackness of any combination of these, it is ESSENTIAL that we understand this fact. <b>The common man/woman, the culture, the people, should not have their POV disregarded because they do not hold the title of anthropologist nor geneticist, since anthropologists and geneicists who have defined race have used their POV as the final decision, through their own usually white interpretations (not by asking the people themselves).</b> Thank you Dark.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The common man and woman says that Black people are from Africa. The common man and woman ALSO says that Black people are from India, and across Asia. They have known themselves to be black for eons, and they share the same ultimate similarities towards Black Africans that would cause one ignorantly to misidentify as African anyway. Regional and DNA differences do not change that fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Another redundantly annoying verson of "massa's logic" by EO - And btw it is possible to objectively define race. Sub-Saharan populations form their own uniques genetic cluster that is widely separated from other major genetic clusters, and thus on the basis of DNA form their own objectively defined race.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In other words massa says your black because massa decided which DNA is black DNA and which isn't. Look at those negro genes floating in those Africans, obvioulsy if you look at them hard enough you can see that they are black genes. Of course massa decided to isolate Black Africans and make them appear so different from humanity that you literally have two kinds of humans "black humans" and "humans"... the "black humans" being Africans. The 'secondary ' human. The way I have been pushing the article is that Blackness is not resorted to massa's defined criteria. Blackness is an objective visual understanding of how humans perceive themselves, not how one human (who is not even a part of the experience) defines other humans. What EO fails to understand... no, what EO disregards intentionally is this fact: Genetic differentiation occurs on all levels, and across all boundaries, and can only arbitrarily be defined as "racial". I say that Black humans are widespread to the point of going back to the orignal man and woman, and that over time, some dispersed and yes, genetically changed in OTHER WAYS NOT RELATED TO THEIR SKIN COLOR OR RACE. The Dravidians, Australians, etc changed in other ways, but their blackness did not dissappear obviously.</dd>

<p>(I will be back to finish this. I swear I have no qualms about being blasted back or RfC'd.

<p>Continuing, I don't know how many ways to explain it, I do not know why it won't sink into your ears. Color models, DNA interpretations, and all this other white-smarty-pants inspired nonsense about how THEY (white people) determine who everyone else should be called is invalid. Why don't you EO, and whoever else make an article called "White definitions of Black people". Until you guys start quoting or responding to quotes about Black Asians (which you have NOT) and address the evidence presented (which you have NOT), this article will eternally be in contention, where I will keep reverting areas that disavow the true blackness of black people outside of Africa. ETERNALLY. Things like this are absurd:</p>
<ul>
<li>20th century anthropology the Negroid race (which means black) is totally seperate from Australoids who are sometimes lumped with Caucasoids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is that comment absurd? Because it defies common sense and obviously what we see. I see a black man, with experiences that are more important and meaningful than what some idiot in some classroom in the 1950s thought up with his racist tendecies. F*** THAT! I know Australians, I know East Indians, they are Black. I am so sick of hearing this "Niggers never left Africa except as slaves" garbage. EO and those of you who swear by this philosophy in heart but deny it outwardly with your words... name ONE Black civilization that existed outside of Africa. (Don't say AXUM either, because they came from and remained in Ethiopia and ruled over both Ethiopia and Yemen).</p>

<dd>So, I'm right. This edit war is all about you being ashamed that our ancestors were slaves, and thus you must define your blackness by people who you're not even remotely related to (i.e. South Asians) because you're ashamed of the people who are related to you (slaves). I think its quite terrible that after all our ancestors went through to free themselves from slavery, and build a better life for the descendants of the African diasporas, we now have people like you who are so ashamed of our race that you want to define it out of existence and transform Blackness into this vague meaningless category that contains all dark skinned people, and not just the people were related to. You don't even want there to be a word to describe that describes people of sub-Saharan African ancestry. You don't even want to entertain the idea that you share a unique genetic bond with these people. You obviously don't feel the Black race is good enough because if you did, you wouldn't feel the need to keep inviting people into it, hoping the newcomers will improve it. White people take the opposite view. They treat the white race as an exclusive club. We need to show the same pride here. Instead your so desperate to recruit people into the Black race that you're even willing to accept people who you yourself said wont even publicly call themselves Black. Instead of taking pride in your Blackness, and your rich sub-Saharan DNA, your attitude seems to be "if I have to call myself Black, then these other dark skinned people do too". I'm really starting to think you need professional help. And the group of Black people that historically existed outside of Africa was the group that left Africa 70,000 years ago and spread to every corner of the globe, giving rise to all the other races.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Can you prove to the audience, with all of your supposed love for black people, can you prove that black people weren't stuck inside the continent of Africa? Can you prove that Black people were intelligent enough to move outside of the confines of AFrica? I can name many white scholars who agree with you EO... there were no black civilizations outside of Africa. Once they left, they no longer became Black, and guess what, that fits the stereotype of the black African being a short sighted fearful savage. When you include the fact that most of your scholars and anthropologists that YOU support for this debate... those same scholars also swear that the Egyptian and Ethiopian people are Caucasoid. Now what? When are you going to take a stand and stop running to the Louis Farrakhan thinking? You remind me of the phenomonon in inner city schools "if you are smart you are trying to act white"... it's all here "if your ancestors left africa voluntarily, you are no longer black." --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:15, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zaph, you're not making any sense. Black is just a word. You can broaden the definition of the word to include as many people as you want, but it still doesn't change the reality that the people we're most related to stayed in Africa. The fact that all the races of the world come from Africans obviously proves the fact that Africans were capable of leaving Africa, because at the time that they left, and for thousands of year there after, they were still Africans. And what's the big deal about leaving Africa or staying in Africa? Everyone has to live somewhere, and the fact that our ancestors didn't have to leave means they were obviously successful where they were.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:54, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

You use that silly rear-end logic to get a point across and you don't answer a question directly. Or maybe you are Indian or something else and you hate the idea of some of your people being Black. You remind me of that Egyptian guy that complained about black people trying to steal Egyptian history. He kept saying that blacks shouldn't have to resort to such things, they should be proud of what they have and he mentioned the Kushite empire. The Ancient Egyptians weren't black to you either were they? Come on. It's just a few hundred miles to Asia from Egypt. May as well throw them out too. Heck, the Ethiopians aren't really black either. I am sure you agree with your white scholars who told you they are genetically closer to Europeans than Africans.

You can broaden it OR you can restrict it. The reality is that black people are certainly in Africa and outside of Africa. But now you try to play a game. I asked you. WHAT BLACK CIVILIZATION EXISTED HISTORICALLY OUTSIDE OF AFRICA. I did not ask you if you believe that every human being on earth is black or not. I did not ask you if thousands of years before the written word if some million year old bands of people left Africa. I asked you a simple question and you are trying to dodge it. You in other words say that there were no black people outside of Africa. In other words you support the Eurocentric view that we only left Africa in chains. Good boy.

<p>EO, this is about you being ashamed of being a part of what you are told. It is about you accepting that ALL you were was a slave or stuck in Africa. Those south Asians also suffered from slavery and oppression, they do not have “one ups” in any way. But that’s the thing. You look at your experiences as a black African person as uniquely separate. You, and only you are so disenfranchised, that even others who have shared some of the experiences, whether Jesus Christ for being a Jew and a Christian, or Dalits for being too black, you go on and on “They are not like me”. Our ancestors had worked with people all over the world to freedom. MLK worked with Ghandi to achieve freedom through the non-violence method. Yet you feel ashamed of seeing others and want to covet yourself a uniquely separate identity. Much like white people wanting their own continent (Europe is not a continent) you want to covet your own humanity. Black people are not the only ones who were oppressed for their skin color. “Sub-saharan”… who coined that word? Sub… White people did. Equatorial is the right word, or just Black. Or just African. But you like that submissive word. Sub-saharan. You say I don’t like the idea that I share a unique genetic bond. What is so sad is that you look to things that are not worth looking into for some kind of unity. You won’t find yourself in Africa making any kind of sacrifice EO. You won’t die for the freedom of an African, nor a Dalit. I will for both. I will not take one and leave the other. And like I pointed out before, you are using massa thinking. Like I pointed out long ago on this article, some Black people think that adopting the white supremacist thinking process and just erasing “white” and using “black”… then they are doing something. If you want to adopt the white racist notion of whiteness (which I find utterly repugnant), then take it to it’s logical conclusion. How many Black Americans are mixed anyway. And how much less black are they? Not as black as the “pure” ones? Do what the white man does! <b>White people take the opposite view. They treat the white race as an exclusive club. We need to show the same pride here.</b> Your words. Yaaay. Follow the white man’s lead, do what massa does. Good boy EO.

<dd>Zaph if your so against letting white people define your Blackness, then why do you call yourself Black at all? It's a white man's word.

<p>So white Europeans wrote this passages in the Bible describing Kushite people (Kush is a hebrew and egyptian word that translates as black human). The word Nehesi which also means black skinned person (purely based on Egyptian racial-geographic ideology) was invented by a white man. It was white European slavemasters that wrote passages from Herodotus describing black people. It was white Egyptians that described the four races of Egypt showing the Nubian and Egyptian in the same manner, with black and brown skin. It was white people who sculpted those heads in Mexico that resemble African black people. And finally it was white people what wrote the Rig Veda. In fact, it was white people who were the first to notice that people called black actually have dark skin. I notice you STILL are not answering my questions. Yet you continue to assert. No I will not leave alone, YOU leave it alone, you and your sockpuppets.

<dd>So because there were no sub-Saharan civilizations outside of Africa, we must now reject our sub-Saharan DNA and define Blackness so broadly we must include people we're not related to? How pathetic is that? Being so embarassed of your own people that you have to associate yourself with unrelated dark skinned people; dark skinned people who don't even want to be related to you. Essentially what you're saying is that sub-Saharans are losers and so anyone who defines Blackness by sub-Saharan DNA is somehow dehumanizing black people. That's the most Afrophobic thing I've ever heard.

<dd>So your answer is "there are no black civlizations outside of Africa". Cool. I just wanted to see you finally say it. Now, on to the next miserable belief you have. "reject our DNA and define blackness so broadly we include people we are not related to". Ok I am going to teach you something:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Accepting others does not cause us to reject ourselves.</li>
<li>Associating with others does not mean I am ashamed of who I am.</li>
<li>Black is a skin color.</li>
<li>I do not distance myself from Black Americans, Black Africans, when I take an interest in the parallel experiences of black Asians and Australians.</li>
</ul>
<p>See this is the part about your personality that I am focusing on. You cannot reach out to others without feeling a disconnect, nor can you feel connected with others without feeling a seperation from who you are. I on the other hand can do both. I can feel the concept of those being my people, in Africa, in America, in Asia, in Australia, in Latin America. Your conclusions are drawn by the same tired political doubletalk. I like ice cream because I like cold water (both are cold so that must be why!). I hate to break your 1980s belief system, but the fact is, I relate to Black Americans, Black Africans and Black Asians equally. Can talk to and interact with each in the same way as a black man and not feel the disconnect you feel. I don't see them as "others". Nor do I disrespect their struggle by ignorantly pretending to act like their struggle was unrelated to prejudice due to their skin color. I wish you <i>would</i> go to Australia, and go to an Aboriginal area and tell them they aren't black, tell them that their oppression wasn't due to the racism they experienced due to their skin color. They would whoop your butt for being so ignorant. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zaph, taking a word that is used to describe your unique genetic bond with sub-Saharans, and destoying its meaning by including non-Africans, means that you are rejecting the unique genetic bond you share with sub-Saharans. No one's stopping you from uniting with Australoids and Indians, but why do you have to use the word "Black" to do it? Why not just call this broader goup dark skinned people? Why do you feel the need to take from sub-Saharans a word that describes their unique genetic kinship, unless you reject said kinship? If you used another word like "dark skinned people" to describe your bond with non-Africans, you could accept other dark skinned races without rejecting your own, but you show no interest in doing so.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:27, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

EO - that's just the universal concept of being human you are describing. Certainly 70,000 years ago, when no human could read nor write, before any civilization was developed, certainly so we have ancient humans who were black leaving Africa at various times.

<p>Let me remind all of us in here how dumb some people think black people are. Although "NOW" we negroes can see that our skin is generally darker and use the word 'black' to denote it, we were too dumb to see the contrasts in the past, and only through the white man's mind control are we now able to look and say black and white. Heck the whole world was too dumb or too dense to see that dark skinned people were dark skinned people and light skinned people were light skinned people.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Final Word</span></h2>
<p>I grew up ignorant of much of history as most black kids in inner city American schools. Even though my social studies teacher in middle school did a lot to educate us about Africa. It wasn't until high school (predominantly black high school) that I was awakened about some fundamental things. 1. Europe is not a continent, and slavery was never something that was morally justified, even when the Europeans tried to. Slavery started with arbitrary laws identifying Black Africans as "aliens" and that, not Christianity, not anything else, gave credibility to the first black slavery laws in America. However, what baffled me was this one simple question. Why were there no black people outside of Africa. Why did we stay in the continent. So I did a search to see historically what was going on. I thought maybe we had been slaves since the dawn of recorded history. Lo and behold, what do I find? Only the opposite. Black civilizations all along the Indian Ocean from Africa to Indonesia existed long before Europe. In addition Nigerian civilizations had been seafaring for millenia, and had created elaborate macroscuptures. I saw pictures of East Asians that looked just like Nigerians and Native Americans that built the stone heads in southern mexico. But there are people out there who seek to misconstrue history. They are the ones that go "no no no, those weren't black, they were not like you. They were different because they have different DNA that you don't have. They are different because they weren't in the same region of the world as you. Their accomplishments are not your own." I find that odd. Most Europeans are not greek nor Egyptian, neither East Indian nor Australian yet they claim that because Egyptian and Greek people ultimately share some common traits, they are of the same common sense origins. Even though some of these traits are just universal, like having five fingers and two eyeballs. Skull shapes of Hebrews are extremely different than Europeans, but somehow, both are considered "caucasoid". Ethiopians look nothing like Europeans but both are Caucasians. Yet the East Asians that resemble black Africans are not black. Why? Because of other reasons. Reasons not used to differentiate whites from "their caucasoid brethren". Reasons not considered relevant to white historians. I came across those swearing that the Zimbabwe civilization was only created due to the presence of Semetic and Jewish ancestors, the blacks couldn't have done it on their own. And on and on, everything that shows anything of a civilized accomplishment with black people is just a desperate hope now. So what's left. We adopt that kind of thinking and focus all of our attention on Nigeria? The only Black civilization left? I certainly agree that Nigeria has it's own historical accomplishments and I would certainly put their antiquity on par with any other great civilization. But that's not the facts, I shouldn't have to dwell on some absurd notion of blackness to see that black HUMANS (that includes Africans) were capable of doing what they did. Then I find out about the Dalits, the Aeta, the people of Basra, and how they suffered and struggled and how they, like us were told how little we contributed to civilization and how we were just slaves. Fascinating. Because each of these people are described as 'black' in variously common ways. Yet again, here we are, discussing this matter from the butt-ended side. Even to the point where we are being told to adopt white racist racial thinking about blackness. Isn't blackness unlike whiteness? Isn't the experiences of black people different and should be treated differently? But, no, to some, we can't even leave the shores of Africa without being in chains. Heck, we were content to just... what was the words, do great things in the continent. How long do we have to endure this bubble thinking? How long do we have to adopt a 19th century divide and conquer "us and them" philosophy to have pride? I do not see how a dalit, with different DNA or a Aeta, with different DNA is any more different than the DNA is different between Martin Luther King, David Dorr, Malcolm X, and so on. These people are mixed with Native American, and White ancestry. Should their accomplishments be contextualized by the fact that they are "partly genetically different than the pure African"? How much of that contributes to them? All of this nonsense about DNA only helps to affirm that myth. Every black leader out there nowadays is always mentioned to be mixed. The president of Liberia, who I believe and hope is turning things around, look at her article. So that is what I see when I see DNA being used as a 'reason'. It's used to justify racism, and justify racial stereotyping. It's just used to pidgeon hole people, especially black people into narrow social constructs that, like the continent of Europe, only change to suit the needs of the people in power. I see it for what it is. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 05:14, 5 August 2006 (UTC)\</p>
<p>I guess the part that disgusts me and annoys me is how mechanically obvious the rejections are. I can almost predict the reactions of others when I make this, and i found that Afrocentricists on the extreme type mirror image white supremacists in this regard. I could literally compare the comments of EO with many white fringe racists in regards to black history. It's like "no no no nigger, don't touch that, that's not yours". I don't need to, nor should I feel a disconnect from another group of people in the world in order to feel good about my people in Africa. If White people want to feel good about themselves by seperation, then let them. Let the white race be an exclusive club. I don't want it, I never have found it appealing. But concepts like "intelligence, accomplishment, science, and ingenuity" are not "white". And on the same token, blackness is not about looking solely through a regional fixation of Africa. EO, i find you contradicting yourself. You speak about how great it is for white people to be an exclusive club... but look at how "exclusive" it really is. Jews, Greeks, Slavs, Arabs, East Indians and Latinos can be white. In fact, many pass AS white and never look back. Furthermore, the "white" race does not, no longer at least, stay stuck in Europe. Whites will tell you how they helped found Egypt, civilizations outside of Europe. "White" civilizations. Yet, you see the red sea, the Sinai peninsulia and you act like a slave afraid to leave the planatation. You can't find freedom in exclusivity. The unity of Black people is only found in our strength and acceptance. That... not anything else is what allowed us to survive despite slavery. Now you find other black people in the world who can tell you "we went through the same thing". You gonna look down on them... just like white people have looked down on you?

They are not the same race as we are, and no amount of calling these people Black or of posting photos of dark skinned South Asians is going to make them related to us. And this is not me internalizing some arbitrary Eurocentric bias, it is an objective reality of science. Look at this chart.[<a href="http://www.rafonda.com/assets/images/fig.2.3.542pop.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rafonda.com/assets/images/fig.2.3.542pop.jpg" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>]</dd>

<p>It shows the genetic distance between populations and shows who is related to who, and to what degree. Now you can focus on some superficial thing like skin color and say "hey, they're like me" but the fact of the matter is those are not our people. They do not have the same ancestors as we have. You need to learn to love your sub-Saharan DNA and stop looking to people outside it to feel good about yourself. Denying science just makes you look ignorant. And by the way, white people have to accept the fact that they're not Oriental. They didn't invent the printing press, navigational equipment, gun powder, money-all of those things were invented in China, and no amount of white skin among the Northern Chinese will ever change the fact that Chinese people are not white--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I dont give a mother---- about genetic distance. Does that compute? Now, this is an article called black people. Black is a word that describes the skin color of humans. You going to tell me that some genetic drift takes prescidence over that? This is not about science, because you know damn well you will be the first person to call a mixed black American a sellout. You will be the first one to take in all the bi-racial black/white celebrities as black. Their genetic difference certainly is far from a strictly African. This isn't about China. I never mentioned China. How many times are you going to dodge? I will say it again, and continue to say it: NAME ONE BLACK CIVILIZATION THAT EXISTED OUTSIDE OF AFRICA. And so far you don't have the guts to take a stand on that question one way or another. Either NAME some or say that they didn't exist. Don't give me your crappity crap about China and Sub-missive Sahara talk. Our people are quite diverse and the threads of human history over the past 10,000 years show that the human condition and experience outweighs genetic ancestral lineage in regards to what it means to be black. I have already made it clear, there is more than one group of black people, i have made it clear that acknowledging the DNA differences between the black people in the world is certainly a valid thing to mention in the article. What is NOT valid is to violate Wikipedia policy by asserting, postulating, and creating a conclusion that the DNA is the determining factor in determining if someone is black or not. DNA molecules that are NOT related to generating higher concentrations of melanin and some phenotypes are not valid indicators of black racial groups.

<dd>I'm not pushing for the DNA analysis to dominate the article. I want to leave the article as it is. All I'm saying is that your connection to other dark skinned people in South Asia is only skin deep and thus is by definition quite superficial so I have no idea why it gives you so much comfort. And Black has come to mean far more than just a skin color. It's come to represent a huge extended family that was scattered all over the world by slavery and not all dark skinned people are part of that family so calling all dark people Black is confusing. Now I have no problem with you bonding with dark skinned people, but I personally (and this just my opinion) think you should all unite under the heeading "dark skinned people" because calling non-Africans Black creates confusion. And I'm not ashamed to admit there was never a Black civilization out of Africa, unless you count America, which Black people helped to build, and have contributed quite a bit to culturally (rock, jazz, gospel, hip-hop).--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You sound absurd again. My connection is only skin deep? HAhaha. Do you ever study history? Do you know anything about how these people endured the same shit we endured? Did you know that many Mexicans are also part Filipino? Do you know anything about <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmares.html" title="Palmares">Palmares</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminole.html" title="Seminole">Seminole</a> Nation? The extended family my friend is more extended than you wish to accept. Black Africans were not the only black people to be enslaved and oppressed. The only contributions you know that Black people have given to America culturally is music? Ok let me help you. Black people contributed to America these additional things (besides singing and dancing). Many train inventions were done by black people (a host of inventions). The wooden first grandfather clock, major contributions to the design of Washington D.C. and Detroit michigan, the traffic light, Gas masks, first blood transfusions, first open heart surgery, , the first medical hospice infrastructure (the medics that help the soldiers), sigh... the first use of multiplex communication, the invention that gave use of Bus Controlling on microprocessors to allow highspeed communications between external computer devices... and on and on and on... So. Now, I think we don't need to question my interest or pride in the accompishments of Black Americans. Back to the matter at hand. You do not have to be historically African to be black. Now, you want to make that mean this or that, make it mean I am ashamed of my black heritage, or my african roots, or whatever. You just knock yourself out. I have discussed innumerable times the relevant and important connections contributions and necessity of maintaining unity between Black Americans and black Africans... yet another issue that has caused people to complain about my lack of pride in being a black American.

<p>But here is ANOTHER thing that popped in my mind. I don't know why I didn't realize this before. You have gone on and on about how blackness is commonsense wise only recognized by black americans to be strictly black americans and black africans. Yet, in all of my experiences, when i talk to black people, black americans, when i show them these pictures, these references about black asians, they will say without any prodding on my part "oh look at that, they're black! Where did you find these pictures?" I show them references, and what not and they are not like you EO, they are accepting, and fascinated with this. Now you explain to me how your average everyday black person, teacher, coworker, and what not, at least 9 out of 10 times accept these people as black, yet here you are calling this viewpoint fringe. You talk about DNA, and their attitude is 'that doesn't matter, they are black, i know a black person when i see one!' You want me to do interviews and post them on Youtube for you? Even then you might accuse me of of doctoring up or scripting the results anyway. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, here is something interesting to consider. The Aeta, the word, means Black in old Tagalog (the dominant language of the Philippines), and many Aeta find that word offensive because it IGNORES their tribal origins (there are a wide variety of Aeta). Ok thats understandable. Here is a question. What black African tribe is INDIGENOUSLY known as the "black" people? So how much more or less weight should be given by one group over the other in this respect? None. it cancels out.

<p>I certainly believe the picture of the man looks no different than any other black person and I find that more compelling to identify him as a black man objectively. I certainly would respect his tribal name, as I would by recognizing that Yoruba people are distinct from Igbo, and I would respect that. I certainly see him as black. I do not see what the DNA chart has anything to do with it. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 06:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zaph, this is an English language version of wikipedia so the fact that someone's name means Black in another langauge is little more than trivia. And although out of compromise I'm no longer trying to force DNA into the article, its something we should keep in the back of our minds if we're writing an article about Black as a racial concept. If you're interested in a literal definition of Black, then write an article called "Black skinned people"; why don't you go harrass the article on white people by showing photos of all the pure white skinned Northern Chinese women and arguing they qualify as white people on that basis. See how silly it is to take racial terms literally.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:38, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, black comes from a visual color, not from a DNA sequence. So for me to make an article called 'black skinned people' is redundant and won't be even allowed. LOL. Furthermore, this is an english language version of Wikipedia. LOL. East Indians and Australians speak ENGLISH TOO! 50 years ago, Jews, Slavs, Arabs, and others weren't even white! In addition, you were insiting that the concept of blackness was invented by white men. Yet I show the concept present before and without white men, and you now say I am playing trivia persuit. Does that inconsistency filled garbage mean anything to you? I never said to keep DNA out of the article, i said do not make DNA sound more significant than it truely is. You have not spoken to any black people in Asia nor Australia have you? You do not know how much or little they recognize themselves as black, nor do you really know how much their recognition is based on their own experiences. You have made a lot of assumptions. I have talked to people. Obvioulsy what I bring has more weight. Why is it for example, when York, Louis and Clark's slave, when he went through native america, why was he worshipped as a god by the different Native American groups he came in contact with? Why is it that every African i talk to regards Chinese people as "white"?

<p>DISCUSSION ENDED!</p>
<p>Zaph, look at this photo of a Chinese man[<a href="http://www.planetsave.com/ps_mambo/images/stories/news/ice%20swimmer.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.planetsave.com/ps_mambo/images/stories/news/ice%20swimmer.jpg" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>] His skin color is identical to a European's so you should be arguing that Noth East Asians dominate the white people article, especially since he enjoys the privelige of light skin. And seriously, you should create an article called Black skinned people (and yes it would be allowed), because the word Black has evolved a very African connotation, so if you called an article black skinned people everyone would understand that you're talking about Blacks defined by their appearance as opposed to Blacks defined by racially genetic sub-Saharan ancestry.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 07:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Well you figure out how you want to handle that. i told you that Blackness is not a mirror of whiteness. I said that eons before you ever brought yourself into this discussion. Europeans designate whiteness to describe THEMSELVES, not other people. THEY decided to adopt that term for themselves and determine who is and who isn't. ASIANS as well have yet to speak against that, and for much of their history, they regard themselves also as "yellow" although now thanks to the white color wheel, that is now offensive. In any event this has nooooooothing to do with black people. You are trying to make a parallel, by relying on what white aristocrats did to describe themselves and what white (not black) aristocrats did to describe other people (black people). That is not going to be a credible way to speak objectively. You still cannot explain why the DNA in Africans makes them black vs the DNA in Asians (who are just as dark and kinky haired) does not make them black. What does your submissive ideology about African DNA have to do with making them more or less black. You go from arbitrary eurocentric perceptions to a belief in some rock hard DNA "evidence". YOU should make an article called Genetic pecularities of Black people. I should not make an article called anything and I will never make an article called "black skinned people". If Black Asians and Australians did not share in the same experiences we shared in, then you might have an arguement. They are not more or less black because of their DNA. They did not experience less oppression nor less identification as Black. The average American (white nor black) had never even SEEN a black filipino, nor australian, and knew nothing about them. Another thing you have failed to see is that white Americans filtered all other cultures, except Black Africans, through a romantisizing glass. They would paint pictures of other people in more 'white' features, and more 'eurocentric' ways. By the time painted pictures of Australians reached America, they probably looked more like tanned Arabs. I remember reading books growing up of Egyptians that always looked no different than Italians. You are basing your conclusion on faulty things. You still do not have any valid reason. Saying that African DNA is more black than non-African DNA in black skinned people is meaningless. It is a circular argumenet. That is a violation of Wikipolicy. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as you using a photograph to out photograph my photograph. One essential difference remains. You posted that photo to illustrate strictly how the skin color of the chinese man resembles that of the white man. Yet here is the funniest part, Chinese people never shared the experiences of Europeans. No, they got the ass-end of Eurocentric imperialism. Chinese people are distinctly different in appearance from the average European (usually thair hair is not blonded in any capacity, their features and what not). They are visually distinct from Europeans and their experiences are certainly more distinct. Black Africans and Black Asians do not have a history of conflict with each other, and both groups show interactions in both directions. Look at Madagascar. They are a complete mix of Indonesian and East Africans over the past 2000 years or so. They primarily speak Indonesian (not an African language). Are they not Black either? How many hairs will you split with your DNA before you realize how absurd it is to go in that direction? You cannot define blackness the way you define whiteness.

<p>Ok as far as I am concerned this issue is resolved. You've shown your DNA, I've shown my pictures. I feel that I have refuted you far more than you have refuted me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common sense from black Americans, I show black asian pictures, they say they are black.</li>
<li>DNA is not something that can be objectively made to distinguish people into color 'races'</li>
<li>Literally black skinned people would describe black people before anything else would.</li>
<li>Anthropological research has been done in ways that have placed Asians as "negrito" literally meaning Black</li>
<li>African heritage is found throughout Asia, and Asian heritage is found throughout Africa neither side would lessen the blackness of either group.</li>
<li>Darker skinned Asians with kinkier hair should not be considered less black than lightskinned mixed African-Americans, especially if one considers DNA wise that the mixed Af-AMs literally have more white caucasian genes in their body than the Asians!</li>
<li>Blackness should not be pidgeon holed into any American sensibilities.</li>
<li>East Indians and Australians speak English widely. This Wikipedia caters also to their interactions.</li>
<li>DNA that involves pigmentation and hair texture is more significant in racial determination than DNA that is not involved in pigmentation nor hair texture. DNA shows that there are three vastly different KINDS of Black people.</li>

<p>Zaph, not all Europeans have blond hair and many are far darker than Northern Chinese, especially those from Southern Europe. Further, if blondness were the definition of white, that Australoids are white, because they frequently have blond hair despite their blackish skin. Get it through your head that Black and White are racial terms using color as METAPHORS, not literal color descriptions. In any event, I'm not sure what your problem is since the current version of the article represents your views because it describes people who were considered Black for no other reason than their skin color (Australoids) or their experiences (the untouchables). I on the other hand see Blackness as a racial concept, and so no wonder I take a genetic perspective. But the current article represents all of your views, much more so than mine, so the level of controversy you're creating is unjustified.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 07:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I highlight the word REMAINED, because what I am trying to tell you is that the Negritos and other Black Asians, they REMAINED Black. They didnt' change to white then back again. They REMAINED BLACK. That means that over the millenia, they never LOST their Blackness. You can't tell me now that they are not Black just because of some philosophical debate about African-Americans! he also mentions in the page that there is more than one African.

He is Asian, or if not Asian, something else then: Non-white is more accurate to describe this individual then black in my honest, humble opinion. He is Filipino, that's accurate, he's not black. You see the repetition of my immediate impressions and thoughts? It's consistently that this picture is not that of a black man. On this Discussion Page the arguments made by and exchanges between persons such as Zaphnathpaaneah and Editingoprah are far too emotional for me, a typical Wikipedia encyclopedia reader to trust either you guys to write it. I vote this article gets set aside to be written by black and white professional academics and scientists who can collaborate. Sometimes Zaphnathpaaneah seems too close to the issue to write objectively about it. For instance, being oppressed as a race has nothing to do with being a black person. I see no direct correlation between these two facts, 1. "I am black" and 2. "I am or come from a history of being oppressed," and Zaphnathpaaneah seems to have made a connection between them anyway. By the way, I just accidently came upon this page, so I'm not preferring one or the other parties on this page; I just thought you guys might like a person not so emotionally close to this situation to give input. Some of the arguments here are based on superficial reasoning, and not logical reasoning.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I also commend everyone here trying to write this difficult article. It may be helpful to keep in mind that this issue of being black, who is or isn't, is very unsettled in academic circles, even now. The arguments are still going back-and-forth today, which is reflected in the spirited discussions I've read here. That's why I think this entry should be set aside for academics and scientists to write who've spent 20 years of their life in research studying the ins and outs of this highly contentious subject. I also think these professionals while writing the entry should seriously address and answer (as best they can) all the arguments, questions, and ambiguities raised here in the Discussion page and the main Article page as it presently stands. This way, there is collaboration between the Wikipedia and academic communities. Thus, you guys here, such as Z and E &amp; others, would still be a part of writing this article, in a sense, because the academics and scientists must address (and not disregard) *your* concerns recorded here, that is, the concerns of the Wikipedia community, which I find to be very important and enlightening.

<p>This is merely a suggestion, and skimming the above suggests that a pinko grey person like myself may not be acceptable as a contributor, but should there not be a mention somewhere of people described as Red?

<dd>I'm not sure what you are suggesting.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Get past the nonsense</span></h2>
<p>A recurring issue here is very lenghty posts reasserting past thoughts. Bloviation is not going to make anyone seem more intelligent or lend more weight to a point addressed over and over again. It will in fact have the opposite effect. There is a lot of <b>circular argumentation</b> going on here. Editors need to find common ground and work from there. <b>Look for the positive</b> in the comments made by those with differing views and work with it. If you see some point you don't like, avoid it for now and you may likely find it gets worked out later once good communication has been established. I see a lot of agreement in basic ideas here but no work towards consensus. From what I can tell everybody seems to agree on the issues they just don't reply as such. There is way too much <a href="../../../e/g/o/Ego.html" title="Ego">ego</a> and not enough compromise. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 20:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok. So, it seems positive that there are two sections in the article for the viewpoints that have been in contention. I think at this point we should unlock the article and keep the divergent view (of EO) within that section. I already have ended my part in the bloviation above. I haven't even read it, and I am not going to. Anyone wants to continue, they can put it on my talk page. Let's unlock the article.

<dd>Zaph the editing you want to do is all original research which is not allowed in wikipedia. The version that is locked in place now lasted for 6 straight months with no major changes untill July 1st when the article was ruined. You don't have the right to just march into an excellent stable article and rearange the world's conception of Blackness with your extremist views. The version in place is well balanced and proportional and frankly already gives your fringe views more weight than they deserve, and edits that you wish to make which will treat your own eccentric views as if they were equal to the mainstream. This is a violation of wikipidea's no undue weight policy. The people you feel are Black are people most of the world knows nothing about so the world really hasn't had an opportunity to decide if those people are Black, and so claims that they are Black are mostly anecdotal and unencyclopedic in nature. Sure some might be called Black in other languages, but this is an English language version of wikipedia and so the norms of English language must be adheared to in the strictest possible way. There are hundreds of millions of people of sub-Saharan ancestry in the world today, and so their exclusive claim to Blackness is the status quo in virtually every English speaking culture in the world and frankly between the 7 foot tall Watusis and the 5 foot tall Pygmies, between the pure Black tribes of Africa and nearly white looking Blacks in some parts of the U.S., from rich African kingdoms to poor African-American slaves,there is so much diversity among sub-Saharans that these other unrelated dark skinned people are really just a superfluous distraction.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your own contributions are also original research. You are desperate to jerry mander your position, and you fail to accept the fact that your opinion is not the "default" opinion. it is the AMERICAN opinion. That is the opinion of 5% of the world's population. That's not a majority. IN addition you make a faulty statement <i>people you feel are Black are people most of the world knows nothing about so the world really hasn't had an opportunity to decide if those people are Black</i>. This is the egotistical western perspective. We decide if THEY are black... not nature, not their experiences, not mutual respect... no WE American arrogant smartasses make the final call. NO. I reject that. English comes from ENGLAND, not AMERICA. The contributions of people all over the world are given the same respect, not just American contributors, not just American perspectives. So your ideology does not meet the strength of consensus, does not meet the strength of common sense, and does not meet the strength of objectivity. All you are doing with your talk of watusis and pygmies is making an emotional appeal to a biased perspective. It's like some racist Israelis saying that Ethiopian Jews are not Jews because they are too dark. It's like some Latinos who insist that African Black latinos are not really latino because they are too dark. You are using the same racist attitudes and just covering them up with sweet words of Black AMERICAN solidarity. You even admit to it, asking people to take the white racist approach to their own race and apply it to our own. <i>exclusive club</i> you said. You're not getting one more iota of compromise from me. You got more than enough already. And for anyone else in here, stop asking me for compromise to his position. I am so tired of 1980s racists being given violins of sorrow. You rely on <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a> as a way to explain away the lack of stronger Asian admission of blackness, pretending it's objectivity. You has to get over the fact that the world is no longer isolated in pockets. And hopefully more people will speak up.

<dd>Yes my opinion is the American opinion, but it's also the British opinion, the Canadian opinion, the South American opinion, the African opinion,<cite style="font-style:normal" id="CITEREF"></cite> the Middle Eastern opinion <cite style="font-style:normal" id="CITEREF"></cite> , the scientific opinion <cite style="font-style:normal" id="CITEREF"></cite> . <cite style="font-style:normal" id="CITEREF"></cite> It's the opinion of virtually every country in the world <cite style="font-style:normal" id="CITEREF"></cite> that uses the English word Black in a racial context and its so wide spread an opinion that its even been institutionalized into census definitions and thus mandated by law .

All you can do is show picture of dark skinned Asians and misinterpret ancient scriptures that aren't even from the English language perspective the English language version of wikipedia must follow. You talk about the experience of Blackness that these non-Africans share. Sorry but that's all POV and original research. Native Americans have been treated very badly too.

<p>Your opinion is the opinion of some or all of the Western countries, that is not "the world". Census records predating the 1960s are filled with nonsense, from using "colored" to differentiate EVERYONE from "white" (making no distinctions) to using "Black" and "white" in social engineering ways. These same census reports have people who were once "not white" as "white" now. So you're not saying ANYTHING. The ONLY thing you CAN cite is census definitions and dictionaries (this which I am refuting). And you even admit that most of the world (that is those who wrote the census and dictionaries) are not even aware of the black people in Asia. DNA alone does not show blackness or a lack thereof. DNA strictly shows ancestral lines, and can show with a reliable degree of certainty the ancestral origins of people. That has noooooothing to do with blackness on a human scale. DNA that shows genetic melanin and phenotype content shows blackness, and that DNA proves MY point. YouR definition is not THE definition. The english language version of Wikipedia does not follow a policy of identifying people solely within the english language sphere of the world, and excluding others "de facto". LOL, if that were the case then only English speaking Europeans would be considered white, all others would not! Mative Americans have never been known to be called Black. Yet another idiotic statement <i>All you can do is show picture of dark skinned Asians and misinterpret ancient scriptures that aren't even from the English language perspective the English language</i> Thats clever. you used the word <i>misinterpret</i>. Tell me again, what does the word "Kushite" mean in Hebrew and Ancient Egyptian? What does "Nehesi" mean in Egyptian? What does Ayn mean in Arabic and Zanj mean in Farsi and Chinese? Please, present your interpretation.</p>
<p>Your whole argument is one silly statement "You're not black, because you're not African". That is a circular argument and is bullshit.</p>

<p>I've never read "The Black Untouchables" but editor Paul B, who considers himself to be quite credible, seems to be of the opinion that the author is a very stupid man. I think he described him as an incoherent extremist or something like that. But yes the untouchables SELF-IDENTIFY as Black so there's nothing wrong with including them in the context of SELF-IDENTIFICATION. And DNA has everything to do with Blackness. Your definition of Blackness is only skin deep, and thus superficial and insignificant. DNA tells us who's black underneath the skin. And DNA shows that the Negritos have been outside of Africa so long that the only Blackness they have left is in their skin. It doesn't show up in their DNA in the sense that when their DNA is compared to the DNA of most of the world's darkest people (Africans) there's no continuity, and thus no objective reason to include them as Black. Perhaps you can find anecdotal reports of them being called Black, but that's already mentioned in the current article and so there's no reason to take it any further. I agree that Ethiopians are Black, because they're not Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Australoid, so Negroid is all that's left. Further, the DNA chart I cited showed East Africans clearly clustering with other sub-Saharans--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:27, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>NOW We are TALKING. You are EXACTLY right logically. There are a lot of Somali and Ethiopians who reject being Black, and on the other side, there are Yemeni who accept being Black. There is no sharp dividing line. The red sea isn't a magical barrier. What also plays a part though is the stigma against being called black. In Arabic culture a black person is called literally Abed... slave. It's like calling us <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> in America. No one wants to be like that. Unfortunately in Arabic, the culture and the history goes back much longer with oppression of Black Africans. It also cuts along religious lines (Christians being primarily Black Africans, and the Arabs being non-black, or at least perceived as such). For the most part, to the Black Christians, the Arabs (Whether black or not) are perceived as 'white men' even if their skin is close in color to their own, and they live in Sudan (africa). Now, if gradually go northward we come to Egypt and see a certain disconnect of AFRICANS from being called BLACK. Although I personally know Egyptians who consider themselves Black (most are called Saeedi) in the SAME manner, when EO talks about Genetics in Asia, the Eurocentricists try to cut a line with DNA between "Arabic Egyptians" and "Sub-Saharan" Africans. This is why I brought up Mostafa Hefny. Now I imagine EO woulld embrace Mostafa Hefny as a Black man becuse he was born on the African side of the Red Sea, but on the Arabian side, if Mostafa said he was black, looked the same, and had the same DNA, EO would say he is not really black.

<p>No it's actually very very simple. Now lets go back to our chart showing the genetic distance of the populations.[<a href="http://www.rafonda.com/assets/images/fig.2.3.542pop.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rafonda.com/assets/images/fig.2.3.542pop.jpg" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>] Now the people that are typically described as Black all form a unique, widely separated genetic cluster in the bottom half of the bottom right quadrent. This is clearly a race and is genetically quite distinct from any other race. All sub-Saharans fall in this cluster. No one from a race that formed outside of sub-Sahara falls inside that cluster. There's no ambiguity. The line is very claer. This is not a close call.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah I noticed that too. It's a poorly worded sentence. I guess the point that they're making is that Black is all about having African ancestry and has nothing to do with color, since a Negroid albino is still Black and since there are non-Black ethnic groups that have Black skin.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a position made from silence. Basically the person is trying to assert that blackness is bound to proximity to Africa, and not skin color. Yet that ignores the fact that there are albinos in all races, and albanism itself is not related to ethnicity nor historical group experiences. "non-black ethnic groups with black skin" is a contradiction on an objective level. Only when the idea black=african and vice versa is upheld would this idea be credible. However, that is the issue in contention here. So here is what I am going to do. Since we are arguing that there isn't enough real reseach on asians being black. I am going to get it, because I know about it. The silly idea that black asians can only be black if African Americans ssay so... that must be rejected at all costs. I understand that we are not talking about brown or mixed looking asians. I am talking about BLACK Equatorial Asians. There is no reason to go all over the issue just to reject them being black. Whether we talk about Albinos or angels from heaven or aliens from mars, the point is, you don't use an unrelated topic to push an idea. The logic of Albinism, or Chinese skin color is not going to make or break either side of this issue. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the edit was directed no to Albinos perse, but to a white person who has probably blonde, curly hair, just like an Afro-American. In Puerto Rico we call this "Jabao" and its probably the result of a mix from one of the parents (or ancestors)black and the other one being white.-<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto.rico_e49a.html" title="User:Puerto.rico">Puerto.rico</a> 03:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientific interpretation revisited</span></h2>
<p>Let's start from the top, scientifically speaking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black - literally at the basic term refers to dark color. In the basic sense refers to humans with dark colored skin. So on that level, I certainly am right. Black people are black skinned people. Europeans and non-europeans alike all over the world, and all throughout history wrote this without reservation. From Herodotus to Arab Scholars to the Chinese. They all used words to describe black skinned people as black.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DNA - DNA strands are atoms connected via molecules. Scientifically one cannot determine anyone's skin color from looking at any DNA strand except those related to melanin content. To a lesser degree phenotype plays a role as people with Equatorial (that is places where hot humid weather reigns and darker skin is most likely) origins. That also will be shown in some DNA relationship. However, it is UNscientific to arbitrarily decide what UNrelated DNA strands should indicate 'blackness' or not. Any attempts to do so are UNscientific and are based on 19th century prejudices and western sensibilities, NOT objective science.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Historical origin - When the original emigrants of Africa left for the first time and crossed the Sinai peninsulia, or crossed the red sea into Yemen, they did not magically (nor scientifically) cease to become black. Scientifically speaking, some retained their blackness, throughout the millenia, whereas others did not. It is unscientific to state that Asians and Australians lost their blackness over time in history simply because they left Africa. African-Americans have not lost their blackness some being gone for 500 years. At some point, whoever wants to push this absurd notion that non-Africans are categorically not-black, they will have to explain how (with science) they lost this, at what period in time, and under what circumstances caused it. To merely say "their DNA differed from Continental Africans" is not enough, because as I stated above, DNA that is unrelated to phenotype and melanin does not determine how black someone is. Secondarily, DNA in people of mixed descent (once considered octoroons, and quadroons) is also extremely diluted of any African relationship, and those people also have a lot less physical similarity to black africans. It is UNscientific to call them black still, yet reject Asians as black.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Social Engineering - is not science. Social engineering is NOT SCIENCE. I will repeat it again. SOCIAL ENGINEERING IS NOT SCIENCE. Do not call social enginnering "science" because that is a lie. If one arbitrarily decides that a group is of a "race" based on subjective relationships unrelated to their appearance or experiences, then they are being UNscientific, UNobjective, and DISHONEST. You cannot go to a place where you see a jet black, kinky haired nigerian looking Pinay filipino Aeta and watch a lightskinned straighhaired european looking African-American say "I am black, you are not". It is ABSURD. Notice I do not say that the African-American is not black either. I say that he has no right to tell the black Asian no.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regional affiliation - Africa certainly plays a role in how we have SOCIALLY defined blackness in the west. But that is NOT SCIENTIFIC. When one relates back to historical DNA relationship to Africa, all they are doing is talking about ancestral links to African people. This is NOT the same thing as showing DNA relationship to black skin or black heritage over the course of time in pre-history. Regional affilliation to Africa plays a great role in shaping our perceptions of blackness in the west, however the experiences of black people in Asia are largely unfamilar to us. This is where it is critical that we not take an ignorant <i>exclusive</i> attitude. It is that same attitude that has caused people to view whites as inherently racist and prejudiced. In addition, the concepts of black and white have changed frequently over the past 200 years, going back and fourth across mixture and regional affiliation. Relying on census data is also UNscientific.</li>
</ul>

<p>Zaph, Black as a racial term in the English language version of wikipedia refers to the Negroid race. All other definitions are secondary. And being Negroid is determined by ancestry, not skin color. Now Black skin is a common trait of Negroids and one of the most salient, but albinos don't stop being Negroid just because their skin is white, and Negroids share many other traits too, 99% of them we can't even see and can only be detected by DNA. Now Asians and Australoids lost their Blackness when they diverged from the ancient African population that would eventually evolve into today's Negroid race. Sure they may have retained the dark skin of the ancient African population, but all modern humans have retained certain traits from the ancient African population-just because the traits retained by Australoids and South Asians are visible, does not make them anymore important than the ancient African traits retained by Caucasoids. All non-Africans lost their blackness when their DNA accumulated enough changes from the parent population in Africa that it no longer clustered with the population that evolved into today's Negroids. That's what happens when groups become genetically isolated over long periods of time; they divide into different races which can be objectively seen by the way the DNA of different populations cluster together seperate from other clusters.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zaph, Dictionary.com defines "Black person" exactly as Negroid is defined and so does the census. In the English world, when Black as an ethnic identity describes Negroids and Negroids are NOT Australoids in anthropology[<a href="http://apologeticspress.org/articles/2007" class="external autonumber" title="http://apologeticspress.org/articles/2007" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>].--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Still bobbing and weaving... Negroid literally comes from the word "negro" which means "black" in Latin EO. YOU even mentioned that fact as something you thought I somehow overlooked. That has nothing to do with your silly notion that humans should only be black if they come directly from Africa. I am still trying to figure out biologically how humans in one region of the world with dark skin are more black than humans in another region of the world with the same dark skin. Do the DNA strands on an African black person write the letters 'b l a c k' in the chromozomal soup or something? Bobb and weave! Be assured EO, I am calling out to a wide variety of black people to come in here and comment, and none, I repeat NONE so far have agreed with your silly nonsense. The only fear they have is that this place is so Eurocentric, and unfairly biased, and a waste of time to stand against. They don't think it will do any good to speak out. So hope and pray that I cannot convince them otherwise. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 01:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zaph your being absurd. Black and Negroid are just names that are used to describe people with sub-Saharan DNA. Other people may be just as dark skinned, but they're generally called something else because the word Black is taken and calling Australoids and others by the same name that sub-Saharans use creates the impression that they're part of the sub-Saharan race which they're not. It has nothing to do with color. Maybe one day we'll discover a tribe of albinos hidden deep in the jungles of sub-Saharan Africa, and they too will be called Black. What your arguing is that the Black race should be redefined to include all the dark skinned peoples of the world, but that's nothing but opinion and original research which is against wikipedia policy, and so is recruiting a bunch of meat puppets. You have no right to steal my race's name and unique identity away from us and give it to other people who btw don't even want it. I've done a lot of research on Black identity, and no matter what country I looked in, Black was equated with African ancestry. I looked up article on the Blacks of India expecting to find a ton of articles on the untouchables. Instead I found a bunch of articles on tiny population of Africans who were scattered through India during slavery. I looked up "Blacks in Brazil" and found only articles about "Afro-Brazillians". So again, the idea of Blackness being defined by African ancestry is very universal and must be reflect in an accurate article. The few counterexamples you cite are the exception not the rule, and wikipedia policy states that marginal views should be marginalized within the articles. The people you describe as Black share only my skin color. I want an article about people who are Black to the bone. I take great pride in my sub-Saharan DNA and want an entire article devoted to people with sub-Saharan DNA, that explores the global experience of people with sub-Saharan DNA. And the hundreds of millions of people with sub-Saharan DNA unite under the heading BLACK and we have no interest in sharing that title with others. People like you who can't feel good about your Blackness unless it's redefined to include non-African DNA, are essentially saying that sub-Saharans are not good enough by ourselves and so we must leach off the accomplishments of other races. In other words you take so little pride in your sub-Saharan DNA, that you don't even want their to exist a word that groups you exclusively with your genetically similar others. Thus you are trying to water the concept of Blackness down by including as many unrelated people as possible. If our ancestors were alive they would be so ahamed in you for not taking enough pride in them and their struggle and instead acting like South Asians are your ancestors.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:21, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is you comrade who brings shame on your ancestors and descendents - on yourself! To talk about 'sub-Saharan DNA' (dna does not have a geographical location - because people who are no longer in the sub-Saharan region share DNA types with those that are - ie PEOPLE MOVE - and are always moving!!! even the call to ancestry is dud because as u assert - all humanity comes from Afrika - ie is sub-Saharan!) - to refer to a human as 'black' is just ridiculous and racist! it is a historical term - a product of reductionist thinking - seeing the world as black and white, and a product of white supremacy - it will last as long as white power lasts and no longer! Scientifically, Black refers to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hole_eb0e.html" title="Black Hole">Black Holes</a> - <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_matter.html" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> - it shows the limits and racism of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> science - it is reflected in terms such as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Fair (disambiguation)">fair</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">enlightenment</a> - because they cannot even see non-european peoples exisitng as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>. it is why tens of thousands non-europeans can die of hunger every day and all european and colonial powers contimue to be responsible for their murder! 195.92.40.49 15:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't. If Zaph and Editingoprah would be less dogmatic we could proceed without too much dispute. No-one denies that the dominant modern use of "black" as a racial label in English-speaking countries refers to people of sub-Saharan/Tropical African descent. The partial exception is Australia, for obvious reasons. This usage is not "scientific". Whether sub-Saharan African peoples constitute a unified "race" is another matter. It is disputed, and we can certainly discuss this debate. Likewise we should discuss the fact that the appelation "black" did not orginate with science but with simple observation of distinctive physical characteristics. Yes, there is a good argument that the label "black" has at various times been applied to non-Africans without any suggestion that they were related to Africans, indeed by people who were probably unaware of Africans. There's no real problem here. We should just discuss the full range of meanings both in modern times and historically, looking at how usage has developed throughout the world, and what that has meant in different cultures. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 13:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hard too proceed without too much dispute when this article attracts so many self-hating sub-Saharans whose primary goal is to water down the concept of Blackness to the point where they get to associate themselves more with Indians than Africans so they can claim to be responsible for early Indian civilization which itself is controversial. On top of that we got a few self-hating South Asians who are so desperate to fit in and be cool that they want to call themselves Black so they can leach off the stereotype of Negroids being good and sports, rhythm, and being sexually well endowed. And then on top of that we have to deal with White anthropology majors who think they're educated, even though they couldn't pass a course in genetics if there life depended on it. And if that wasn't enough, we have to deal with white mates from down under who have been raised with so much racism that they're incapable of telling dark skinned people apart and are trying to impose their ignorant world-view on the rest of us. And then comes the original research. Pal B writes: <b>Yes, there is a good argument that the label "black" has at various times been applied to non-Africans without any suggestion that they were related to Africans, indeed by people who were probably unaware of Africans</b>. I don't care how good you think the argument is. Unless you can provide reliable references, it's not allowed. I'm so sick of people thinking they can just ignore the no original research rule. I've actually done research on where racial color metaphors came from, and cited the two anthropologists above who were responbible for divinding the races of the world into color categories in the English speaking world. Both described exclusively Africans as Black.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 18:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Paul B, it was Carolus Linnaeus in 1735 and Johann Blumenbach who were to my knowledge the first in recorded history to apply the label Black as a racial or ethnic classification and both of them equated it with Africans-indeed Blumenbach described the Malays as the Brown race. <b>I don't think Australia was settled by Europeans before 1788, and you've provided no evidence that the practice of calling Australian aboriginals Blacks predates the Linnaes or Blumenbach</b>, and certainly the Europeans who settled Australia would have heard of African Blacks by that time. Indeed Webster's dictionary defines Negroid as the African banch of the black race which means the belief that all dark skinned people were related to Africans was the English speaking norm, so if we're going to speculate, it makes sense to speculate that the English speaking Australians assumed Australoids were related to Negroids. You can argue that dark skinned people were called Blacks in other languages by people unaware of Africans, but the label "Black" was not used and the literal translation usually means "extremely dark" and not black per se.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that Australia wasn't settled by Europeans before 1788 and there was almost no contact before said settlement, why would you expect Linnaeus, writing half a century earlier to use such an application? Using Paul's Caucasian application, that's like saying that since the original use of the term "Caucasian" (in whatever language) only refered to people inhabiting the Caucasus mountains, any changes in meaning since then should be ignored. Likewise, the article on Asia should only concern itself with the Middle East, since India and East Asia weren't considered part of Asia in its original meaning. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 03:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I'm glad you mentioned the origins of the word Caucasian because it makes my point. The original meaning of Caucasian may have applied only to the the people of the Caucacus mountains, but it was expanded to include people who were assumed to be related to the people of the Caucasus mounatains. Similarly, the concept of a Black race was originally used by Linnaeus and Blumenbach to apply to the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, but in Australia the meaning was expanded to include the Australoid population who resembled Africans, and thus were probably thought to be related to them. Paul's argument was that the label "Black" was applied to dark skinned people completely independently of its use to describe Africans, and by people who were unaware of Africans. Perhaps he means words in other languages that mean "Black", and not the word "Black" itself. Even assuming the former which sounds quite possible, finding references claiming the useage was independent of knowledge of Africans sounds difficult.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 04:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The use of Caucasian today is obviously not limited to inhabitants of the Caucasus mountains; in fact, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic.html" title="Nordic">Nords</a> are considered the epitome of "Caucasians" today. Whether the application of "black" was independent of knowledge of Africans doesn't matter (think Caucasians again), and I don't know what exactly you're talking about by "words in other languages that mean 'Black', and not the word "Black" itself." Obviously this article isn't supposed to simply concern itself with the usage by the English-speaking world, so whether the English word "Black" or an equivalent is/was used is inconsequential. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 04:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It makes my point in the sense that the word Caucasian was expanded to include people thought to be related to those from the Caucasus mountain, and so the word Black was probably expanded to include those who were thought to be related to Africans. Now the reason the expanded meaning is retained today for Caucasians but not Blacks is because people got it right when they assumed that Nordics were related to folks from the Caucacus mountains, but they were made to look very foolish for ever thinking that Australoids were related to Africans. And personally I think it's a dumb idea to write an article about all the people in the world who were ever called by the color black (i.e. Black Irish) throughout the entire course of world history. Such an article would be better called dark-skinned people or the sociological significance of the color Black. I would much rather see an article about Blacks as the term is defined today, and an article not about the term itself but rather about the race of people it describes-an article about African ancestry and the significance it had throughout world history. This semantic discussion about the history of the word "Black" is really quite boring and trivial. Now an article about the sociological significance of African ancestry across times and places would be absolutely fascinating.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aw, come on. You fall for that game? I am black, I am american, and I am telling you Shiftaling that the concept of black people existing outside of Africa has nothing to do with prejudice. It has to do with regular old living. EditingOprah can't speak for the world in regards to who is and who isn't black. We know where the concept originated and either way you slice it, you can't restrict it to simply Africans. EO even believes that Black people never built civilizations outside of Africa, so all of those civilizations throughout Asia and Europe, those were done exclusively by non-blacks. (Thats a crock of crap). Furthermore, this whole thing of his is inspired by how the white race established itself as... what was his words... "an exclusive group" as if that was something to imitate. Heck, white people, the white race, even on the census doesn't even do that anymore. Now anyone north of the Sahara desert, West of the Gobi desert and calcutta is white. this isn't about Lumping anyone. this is about a shared human experience, and to be seperatist about it, especially in regards to the anti-black "anthropology" and "history" that has been going around, it's a shame. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:16, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Why is there no controversy about Europeans or Caucasoids not sharing the title White with light skinned North East Asians, but Africans or Negroids are supposed to share the title Black with South Asians and Australoids. I mean there is just so much debate and controversy within the African only definition of Black between the degree of African ancestry required in the U.S. vs Latin America vs. medical science vs. legal requirements that this whole aside about the marginal use of Blackness to describe dark-skinned non-Africans just seems like a superfluous distraction. Yes, we can mention it, but keep it it in perspective.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because that's not how the term "white people" has been used. You are fetishising the word. It would be like objecting to the word "Caucasian" applied to people who are not from the Caucasus.

Also, please stop vandalising the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_British_b172.html" title="Black British">Black British</a> page as you evidently do not know about the particular circumstances there. For example the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runnymede_Trust_709d.html" title="Runnymede Trust">Runnymede Trust</a> and Radical Statistics Race Group, in the glossary to their joint book <i>"Britain's Black Population" (London, 1980)</i> define <i>black</i> as follows: <b>"Generally used in this book to refer to the population of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Commonwealth_6682.html" title="New Commonwealth">New Commonwealth</a> countries and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> origin, that is the population born in New Commonwealth countries and Pakistan and their children born here. When used this term does not imply a cultural homogeneity among the various groups to which it refers. (This corresponds to the definition New Commonwealth and Pakistani origin used by <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Population_Censuses_and_Surveys_c3af.html" title="Office of Population Censuses and Surveys">Office of Population Censuses and Surveys</a>)."</b></dd>

<p>In the introduction to the book, the editors <a href="../../../u/s/h/Usha_Prashar_0e6d.html" title="Usha Prashar">Usha Prashar</a> of the RT and Dave Drew of RSRG explain that: <b>"What immigrants from New Commonwealth and Pakistan (NCWP) and their children have in common is the material consequences and, in very many cases, the direct experience of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>. Discrimination, as the studies by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_and_Economic_Planning_0427.html" title="Political and Economic Planning">Political and Economic Planning</a> (PEP) have demonstrated, is based upon colour. Hence, the reference to Britain's black population. It can, of course, be argued that some immigrants and their children do not want to be labelled as <i>black</i>. That is not denied, but the defence of this terminology in this context lies with the fact that, irrespective of their own particular beliefs, experiences and the wide range of cultural variations, racism and racial discrimintation is a crucial determinant of their economic and social <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation.html" title="Situation">situation</a>."</b> It may also interst you that the same glossary refers to <i>race (racial group)</i> as follows: <b>"A term which was used in the late eighteenth and duruing the nineteenth century by scientists and public to refer to a supposedly biologically distinct section of <i>homo sapiens</i>. The scientific basis for such distinctions has now been discredited. However, the general popuilation continues to use the terms to refer to a group of persons who they identify as having different physical features from themselves. Because this usage has no scientific validity, the term is not used as a descriptive category in this book, except where usage by others requires."</b> Hope that is useful... 195.92.40.49 09:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is plenty of controversy on <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites.html" title="Whites">Whites</a>. What we have over there is people who said that Mexicans/<a href="../../../m/e/s/Mestizos.html" title="Mestizos">mestizos</a> are "White" and "Turks are White" and also just about everyone from the honorary Japanese, to the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bai.html" title="Bai">Bai</a> of China, to the Arabs, North Africans, even <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> etc are all "White". Under that definition, practically everyone on the planet is "White", and that's just not true. It's ridiculous and there is some anti-White POV producing it all. When shown that these aforementioned groups are not White, then they say b-b-but "White is just a social construct" and "there really are no White people", forgeting that they started from the position where they were pushing Whiteness for their POV group! It's ridiculous and hilariously absurd. This happened with a guy who insisted Turks were White, and then later said that Whites don't really exist and it's all made up.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The problem with this article</span></h2>
<p>The problem with this article is that it's far too broad in scope. It would be like having an article called "Indian people" that focused on both people from India and Native Americans because they've both been called Indians at different times in history. Of course no such article exists because there has to be a better reason to group ethnicities from such different races and cultures into one article than just the fact that they've been called by similar names and both have experienced racism at the hands of whites. That's why I think it makes far more sense to limit this article to Blackness as defined by African ancestry. Blackness as defined by color has had much less significance across history.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 21:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The difference is that people who identify with blackness identify with the black skin they share in common, but Asian and American Indians both use the word Indian, but do not identify with each other at all. It does make sense to have all black people in one article, yet separate the two types of Indians into different articles.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 02:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What are you talking about? I actually am a black person and I don't identify at all with dark skinned South Asians. When I was in school the South Asians hung around with the Chinese kids, not those of African ancestry. I don't recognize myself at all in South Asians. I did know one South Asian who tried to pass as African American but he did so to convince women he had rhythm, athleticism, and a large sex organ. He was constantly asking me what it was like to be black, so clearly South Asians do not experience Blackness the way I do. Thier personalities are totally different, and it has nothing to do with culture either, because the black people I met in Africa have the same personality as me. I think it's in the DNA. I think South Asians are feeling lost and are identifying with Blacks because we're all that's left. They're Caucasian but they're not accepted as whites. They're Asian but they're not accepted as Orientals. And they're dark skinned so they assume blacks will accept them as one of our own. Well in all due respect to South Asians, your skin may be darker than mine, but whatever blackness you may experience is totally alien to mine.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said black Asians and black Africans both identify with "black skin". I did not say that all black Africans identify as the same people as black Asians. Your opinion, as a black African, that black Asians are a separate people from black Africans only shows some people choose to put more emphasis on origin and less on common skin color to determine race. Your opinion that black people should only include black Africans does deserve a place in the article, but the other opinion that black people includes black Asians also deserves a place in the article. Both views are needed in the article to keep it representing a neutral point of view.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 05:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your point that being black is a social categrory in addition to being a genetic category; indeed if it wasn't a social category, people with only 1/16th African ancestry could not have been considered black in various times and places. What I question is whether the social category of being Black has any cohesion when the definition is expanded so broadly to include any dark skinned group regardless of African ancestry. Okay, so African Americans are called black, East Indians have been called black in Britain, the aeta of South East Asia literally translates to mean black, Australoids are called black by some white Australians, and even segments of the Irish have been dismissed as black based ontheir Spanish looking appearance. Do all these different groups really share a common identity of any significance, or are they a bunch of totally different groups who just happen to have been called by the same name for very superficial reasons (just like the Indians of India and the Native American Indians)? Perhaps you could argue that all the non-white peoples of the world share some degree of mutual identification, but I'm not sure all the peoples of the world who have ever been called Black share anything deeper. Do you honestly think the aeta of South East Asia and the Australians aboriginals have a unique connection with African Americans? Yes they all share black skin, but so what. The watusi of Africa and the Dutch of Europe both share above average height which is arguabley an even more culturally significant trait that they can both identify with, but that doesn't mean they should be grouped together. And many African-Americans have very light skin, yet still have African features and thus will always be stigmatized as Negroid, while dark skinned Dravidians of India have Caucasian features and often suffer much less stigma despite their much darker skin because they don't have the stigma of being from Africa. I guess my fear is that by defining blackness broadly enough to mean everything to everyone, it will eventually not mean anything to anyone. All my life being black has meant African ancestry, and that carried a huge amount of cultural baggage because of the history of slavery, all the stereotypes about peoples of African ancestry, the entire mythology of coming from Africa and all that that means. But defing blackness so broadly that even dark-skinned non-Africans can be included seems kind of empty. It strips Blackness of all its rich cultural meaning and history and reduces it to nothing more than a superficial one dimensional physical description.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is meaning in being black which is separate from being African. If you think expanding black people to include everyone makes the term meaningless, then call yourself a "black African" to distinguish your identity. People recognize you as a black African even if they have usually called you just a black person. No, I do not think that the populations of Australians and black Asians I advocate for including in the black people article share the same experiences or necessarily identify as the same people, but some share experiences relative to their black skin. Black Asians usually are visibly distinguishable from black Africans based on their physical features, so I agree people might stigmatize the black African more than the black Asian. Even if people can distinguish these two types of black people, their blackness remains. It's skin deep, but readily apparant. Their label of black, applied by themselves or others, has been documented by Paul B and Zaph, so there does exist a history. This history is referenced in citations placed by these two users, making the inclusion of these populations good additions based on Wikipedia's policy for verifible content. On the other hand, white skin is different. The concept of black people is not the concept of white people. To answer your analogy about white Asians, white supremacists and a history of legal regulation has restricted the definition of white people more than black people. White Asians are mentioned in the white people article as having been considered honorary-whites at a time for the purposes of privledges. In my opinion, white Asians are considered closer to white Europeans than other non-white-skinned populations. Black skin is socially significant and white skin is too. In summary, black skin is socially significant for determining a group of people whereas white skin has been less inclusive and African ancestry is a separate concept from black skin.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 08:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No I wont call myself a black African. You stop calling non-Africans black. Don't tell people of African ancestry they have to specify what type of Black they are, besides the term black African refers to black people who live in Africa since all black people originate there. Our right to call ouselves Black is confirmed by the census and dictionaries. The right of the other groups to call themselves black is nothoing more than anecdotal (i..e people can only cite examples, not official definitions defining those specific groups as Black). Racists sometimes call Arabs "sand niggers" and that can be referenced so does that mean Arabs are now Black too? Your obsessing over skin color so why don't you write an article called dark skinned people. It makes far more sense to just do that than to try to hijack a word that is widely used only for those of African ancestry.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 14:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You sound like you lived in the back of Greenville Mississippi while the rest of the world has been realizing things you can't comprehend. I, and no one with a free thinking mind gives a care what census and dictionaries say at this point. Because those census and dictionaries are wrong. The Census in America has been saying that Black peopel are the only group whose ancestors aren't "original" inhabitents of Africa. They don't use the word "original" to describe our racial group. So quit acting like you need a white paperholder called a census or a dictionary generated by people who fear black unity or what? What black person wrote that dictionary? Have you called the office of management and budget? Did you talk to any of the current administrators involved with the handling of the racial aspect of the census report? No? I have. Do you know that you sound retarded since racial classification in the U.S. and Britain only pertains to citizens in those countries? Do you realize that these people make inconsistencies on the census reports? Here and I quote from <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> * "As an extreme example of inconsistency in the classification by race over time, a person who was included in the Asian Indian category in 1980 and 1990 census tabulations might have been included in different categories previously: Hindu in 1920-1940, Other race in 1950-1960, and White in 1970." So EO, what you are saying is that if the white census writer makes a mistake, you will honor his mistake as fact until he realizes it? You gotta be kidding me. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're the one who wanted to distinguish what type of black you are. I never tried to deny your blackness, but why do you deny the blackness of other people? Dictionaries confirm that black people refer to non-African blacks as well as African blacks. The proposition that labels apply the properties they denote is easily disproved by counter example. Random insults do not necessarily solidify the accusations they make. To call an emaciated black man a <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhalsim.html" title="Dhalsim">Dhalsim</a> does not give him the power to breathe fire in a Yoga flame. Likewise, calling Arabs "sand niggers" does not make them turn into Africans and does not change their skin color.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 01:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dictionary's also confirm tha the Irish are black if you apply their most loose definition which is anyone who is kind of dark or swarthy. But this article is not about a mere physical description, it's about a social identity, Black with a capital B, not black with a small b, that's why while some dictionaries may say that yes technically any darkish person can be black, most dictionaries emphasize that the term refers ESPECIALLY to those of African ancestry and the census and biomedical textbooks exclude non-Africans from their definitions of blackness. So no I can't deny that there are non-Africans who have black skin and thus are technically black, but this article isn't about being literally black or even about being called black, it's about blackness as a global social identity and this has its roots in members of the Negroid race. This doesn't mean there aren't other races that have dark skin, dark enough that others may have called them black too, but this doesn't mean they belong to the same social category, anymore than Native Americans and the people of India belong to the same category because they looked similar enough to both be called Indians. Now there are cases like the untouchables of India who specifically said that they identified with African-Americans and decided to use their dark skin to self-identify in the global Black social category so they should be mentioned in the article. But groups like the aeta who just coincedentally happen to be called black in another language because they just coincedentally happened to also have dark skin are a totally separate type of blackness that shouldn't be mixed with the one I'm describing, any more than American Indians and East Indians should be lumped together. Same goes for Australian aboriginals. They are called black only in a descriptive sense that has nothing to do with my black social identity, and the fact that they share dark skin is just a coincedence. They have their own identity and rich history that is completely separate from mine. The only way it makes sense to incorporate all these groups into one social category is if we mention Afrocentric scholars who claim (incorrectly) that they are part of a broader African diasporas and thus are welcoming them into the global Black social identity. But an article that just lumps all dark skinned people together for no other reason than that someone somewhere has called them black and they've experienced racism is meaningless.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most dictionaries say blacks are of African origin. That's not exactly the same as saying they're Negroid, since Negroid is a biological group while Blacks are both a biological group and a social group. That means it's possible to have only a tiny bit of African ancestry and still qualify in the social group that is Black but not the biological group that equates Blackness with Negroid. But these non-African groups with dark skin are a totally separate topic. The fact that you keep bringing them up means you can't comprehend the difference between Blackness as a concept and Blackness as a description. It's a very subtle difference and perhaps not everyone here is capable of grasping this no matter how many times we explain it.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 00:55, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The topics you brought up have their own articles and the black people article does not prevent these article from existing. The black people article does not deny that black Australians, black Asians or black Africans exist as separate entities. The black people article does not destroy their uniqueness. "Indian" is a disambigulation article that mentions the Asian and American type. Even though Asians and indigenous Americans have the word "Indian" in their name, they still keep their uniqueness.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 01:04, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well this article should just be a disambiguation page too, because there's no more reason to put all the dark skinned people of the world into one article anymore than there's reason to put the two types of Indians in one article. The issue of Blackness as defined by African ancestry is so deep and complex and have so many different mainifestations in so many different cultures that that it should be its own article. Lumping these totally descriptive types of Blackness has absolutely nothing to do with Blackness as an ethnic concept. The socalled Blackness of Australian aboriginals and the negritos are best described in their own articles. The overwhelming majority of the world equates Blackness with African ancestry, so there's no reason to confuse this mainstream understanding with totally unrelated and descriptive uses of the term.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 01:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This shouldn't be a disambiguation page because, while Indian Indians and Native American Indians never identified with the same "Indianness," blackness is a social construct with which multiple groups identify. It's not simply a mislabeling of groups that are in other ways unrelated, but a self-identification with each other, which is what makes it worthy of an article of its own right. Blackness is an ethnic concept only in its social existence. There's no certain genotype or phenotype that defines black people aside from having dark skin, and, to a lesser degree, curly hair. Given that Australian aboriginals and negritos are black-skinned and identify with blackness, they should be described in this article, though obviously the central focus should continue to be black Africans. Note that all of the sub-groups you described already have their own articles (see <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-Saharan_Africa_8ab6.html" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negritos.html" title="Negritos">Negritos</a>, and the subset <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aeta.html" title="Aeta">Aeta</a>, etc.).

<dd>There should be a disambiguation page because Blackness describes two totally different social constructs. The primary construct is African ancestry. The second one is just dark skin. The two types of Blackness have totally different meanings. Black as defined as African ancestry carries a much deeper and complex history and evokes all kinds of stereotypes, attitudes, and images, that other dark skinned people can in no way identify with. In addition to that, there are tons of people with some degree of African ancestry who are very light skinned so there self-identification as Black has nothing in common with the Negritos. There should be a separate article on dark skinned people, and leave this one for peoples of African ancestry. And of course everyone comes from Africa originally, but those that left Africa in the original maigration(s) some 70,000 years ago transformed into other races. Only people who are Negroid or part Negroid have recent African ancestry.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 15:54, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that we need to increase our understanding dimensionally - that includes spacial, temporal and semantic dimensions. To return to your original comparison, there are different reasons why an Indian people article does not exist and a Black people one does, with regards to the semantic dimensions that go across spacial and temporal dimensions. For one, India is a nation and there is no 'Black nation' - although I have read racist fantacies of a 'white nation'. In what is called 'britain' there is a group called Ligali.org that is against useage of the word black and prefers African (and Asian etc) but i think this is also too simlistic. Also, Indians are sometimes refered to as 'Red' rather than black, while in what is known as 'india', there is a long history of racist persecution of <a href="../../../u/n/t/Untouchables.html" title="Untouchables">untouchables</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalits.html" title="Dalits">dalits</a> which is also based on shade and complexion of skin colour. This is a very complex issue and there are no easy answers - as mentioned above, and I agree, this is to do with what I personally perceive as a holocaust happening right now that is claiming around a million lives every few weeks, world wide - mostly in Africa. I also, personally see the need for a black power movement - but not one based on nationalism or even continentalism. I also see this issue as related to European science ideas of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> - and the racial superiority of Europeans as a justification for colonialism and mass murder.

<dd>Ethiopians have sometimes referred to themselves as "red" since ancient times as well, yet they are also socially "black," and identify with blackness as well.

<p>With that being said, I think it's right and just to hear your position. What bothers me is that if you were Indian and were on here and you said you were black, and you spoke of the persecution you experienced because of your skin color in India... You are black and you are not less black because of this "continentalism" that is obviously coming from some ignorant segments of American society. It would offend me as a BLACK AMERICAN to hear someone ELSE say that you are not really black because you do not come from Africa. Just like it would offend me as a black american to hear someone say that another black american is not black because their skin is not dark enough, or they don't "talk black" or they don't "dress black" or fit any stereotype. I find this ignorance intolerable. And so I know some Indians who are black just like any black person in America, I don't see them any less black, and I don't see blackness being "taken away" from Africans. That kind of racist paranoia thinking process belongs with Adolph Hitler and the white KKK of America. So as far as I am concerned, Wikipedia can lock the article for all of eternity, I will be here waiting for the day they unlock it, because I will be making this truth known. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:06, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have SEEN East Indians and Palestinians who live as black people, relate as black people, calling themselves black people. No one black that I know of who knows them has reacted in any other way other than to accept that. In fact, the black people I know of would call them out for trying to chump their ways into Indian culture. The only ones that act wierd about it are the thugz, the niggaz, the idiots that go around pretending black is some American ghetto thug badge to use to scare passers by on the street. I know the difference between "dark skinned" and "black", you still are stuck on "African-American" and "Black". But check this, i am done with this BS. You can thank DeeCeeVoice primarily, but you certainly did a good job of using Wikipedia, violating the policies, and manipulating the thing, but really thank her for her ignorance. She made me feel disgusted being here, although i was contemplating leaving anyway. So they should unlock the article next week, and you can put "Black people are only people from Africa and Americans that came during slavery" all over the article. I will be back in a later time with many contributors when Wikipedia gains more recognition in schools.

<dd>The article says almost nothing about "Iberian culture" nor does it suggest that the concept of "blackness" does not exist in Iberia - that would be very odd indeed! The point of the section is to discuss <i>Latin America</i> (i.e. former Iberian <i>colonies</i>), and it argues that there is no "endogamous color line" (in other words there is no sense of separate "black" and "white" communities who rarely inter-marry). It then discusses the variety of terms used for differrent tonalities and ancestries and concludes that there is no equivalent to the US usage of "black". All of the terms you list are already there. Of course there is no suggestion that there is no word for black, just that the term is not used as a racial label <i>in the same way</i> that it is in English. Now, I can't vouch for the accuracy of this, and the section is entirely unreferenced, so there are potentially problems with it, but it does not say what you claim it says. If there are specific inaccuracies please point them out. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 01:18, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those of you who are so worried about Zaph trying to make everyone black, rest assured. I never put that in the article. I personally know of no spanish anybody since the 17th century who regards themselves as black. The Portuguese royalty may have been at some point due to the intermixing with Africans after the 15th century, but that's not related to the cultural identification of any groups of people. Despite the fact Portugal had more interaction with West Afrrica culturally than the other European colonies, the cultural identification in PORTUGAL (not Brazil) never seemed to lean in any towards being black. In otherwords I am not on a quest to make everybody black. I really do not see any evidence of black identity in Portugal. Anyone want to present evidence otherewise, I am certainly objective anyway. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 02:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as word play goes, you know the irritating contributor on here keeps playing with words, Portugal and Spain has yet another word for black. "Moor" which literally means "dark skinned person from Africa". I don't see how much more clear it needs to be. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:01, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are using the Afrocentric definition of the word.</p>
<p>"Moor" comes from the Roman Latin word "Mauri" or Greek word "Mavros" or the derivative Maures, which described the peoples of North Africa in the Maghreb (west of modern Tunisia). The Roman word for black was not "maur" but "niger", or "Fusco" for “very dark”. In some but certainly not all, cases, Moors were described as “fuscus”. Moors were distinguished from what the Greeks labeled "Aethiopes", or Ethiopians.[citation needed] Herodotus in his “the Histories” described two types of northern Africans: the light skinned Garamentes of northern Libya and the dark-skinned, “Trogdolyte Ethiopians” in the southern Fezzan and northeast Africa. In Frank Snowden’s book “Before Color Prejudice” the Garamentes were sometimes spoken of as “white Ethiopians”: “Melanogaetuli (black Gaetuli) and Leukaethiopes (white Ethiopians). Some Garamentes did live in the modern Fezzan of northwestern Africa and were described by Lucan as nigri (black), furvi (swarthy) and other diverse adjectives. According to the 1st century AD Roman poet Manilius, there was a wide spectrum of color schemes: Ethiopians, the darkest; Indians, less sunburned; Egyptians, mildly dark; and the Mauri (Moors), the lightest.</p>
<p>The Moors were Arabs and Berbers who mixed to an extent with black Africans. The elite of the Moors were Arab. I suppose you would want us to think that the Moors were a wholly black African kingdom that conquered evil whitey in Spain.</p>
<p>The portuguese were not greek and like most languages, their words did not retain the identical meanings. IT also makes no sense to call a black skinned (ethiopian) person (white skinned). Obviously Snowden is meaning something else. Lightskinned people lived in Ethiopia perhaps, but that does not make them "white". But back to the point. The PORTUGUESE (not greek, not romans) were familiar with the Moors and were not familiar with the Ethiopians. The Moors in Portuguese history were described from middle complexioned to black. They did not destinguish the black african moor from the mid-toned moor. Again Moor literally means dark skinned person from Africa "Mauri". Not "lightskinned but just a shade darker than a white portuguese". And so the point is, you, not I want us to think the Moors were a wholly tanned white civilization that conquered. And what's with the evil whitey stuff? You taking politics to the 80s level again? --68.60.55.162 17:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See you gotta understand, white people are the ones that live by a purist mentality. They are also the ones that relate to others in a strictly color scale mentality. I speak of black people, I speak of a strong cultural and ethnic sense, not merely a color shade sense. You distinguish yourself as a black person by more than just your skin color. Your family ties, your heritage, your culture and so forth. Moors had, as you so cautiously try to politically qualify, been mixed with Arab, Berber, and BLACK. The extent of which is a matter of further debate, but the presence was substantial, not meager. You gotta remember my position: I believe that black people have been present in relevant numbers in many areas throughout history outside of Africa, and that has been ignored or downplayed for political reasons throughout the past 500 years. All I am doing is restoring what was suppressed. If you want to dispute the extent thats your deal. All I care about is that the blackness is mentioned and cited in some reliable way. Black people are in India, now how numerous? I suppose we could have devoted all this wasted time on discussing that. But nope. Like I say Eurocentrists on the right, Afrocentricists on the left, Afrophobics in the center. All three of you believe that there are no black people outside of Africa unless in chains. --68.60.55.162 17:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

So rest assured you have the Wikipedia Eurocentricists on your side, no matter how badly you want to provoke that I am on some anti-black-american agenda. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 03:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look at how they "became" officially white in America, then in the 1990 and 2000 census they lost their whitness and became "Asian" again. Gee, does the Census and dictionaries have that much power over people's lives? As an East Indian would I be compelled to intrinsically view myself as white for 10 years then Asian, then soemthing else, then whatever? Hilarious. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 04:27, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zaph, Zaph, Zaph. If the East Indians so identify with being Black, how come they begged the census to classify them as Asian? They prefered to self-identify by geographic origin, and not skin color. And unlike you, I've actually been to India with a huge group of Negroids and my experience was that East Indains HATE black people with a passion. We could not even get service in any restaraunts. Even restauants owned by the darkest skinned Inians (those with pitch black skin ten times darker than mine) told us "no blacks allowed". Some of us actually live in the real world and as much as you fantacize about being accepted by the Indians (since apparantly sub-Saharans aren't good enough for you) your dreams of a bortherhood between all dark skinned people is the world's biggest joke. I bet Indian people are reading your crap and laughing at you. LOL! You don't even know how naive you are. Try reading up about India-African relations in South Africa and the riots between those groups and the huge political differences.--<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 16:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats because EO, EO, EO, most of the East Indians that come from India are not of the lower castes. My ex-girlfriend explained this to me... she's from Calcutta. The majority of East INdian IMMIGRANTS are not untouchables, just like the vast majority of Cuban immigrants are not Black (even though Cuba has a predominantly black/mulatto population). Just like everywhere else those upper castes do not want to be associated with being black, and I certainly do not wish to see them classified as such. In addition, India as a WHOLE cannot be classified as a "black" or "white" country anymore than the U.S.. It's a diverse country. I certainly know that many hate blacks, the same ones probably that hate the untouchables. Some untouchables, hating themselves so much, hate each other. While those indians laugh about my position, others are resonating with it. Like I say, go to the Ta_seti newsgroup and post what you just posted here. No, heck, I'll do it for you. I have no respect for you whatsoever. What city in India did you go to? What was the name of the restaurant? Was it a restaurant catering to the "white american" clientele? Were you interacting with Indian untouchables or just smartalecky restaurant owners? See, I can tell you the same story anywhere. You are going to have the ignorant ones, and you know what a sellout is. YOu know how Afrophobia is in the hearts and minds of people darker than you. Yet you know damn well that same crap goes between black people IN Africa. Rwanda, North Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, all places where black people fought and hated each other over a shade of brown. The Tutsi regarded the Hutu as "blacker" and less deserving of respect they oppressed and murdered thousands a couple of decades back. The Hutu then, out of their own anger of oppression slaughtered them back. And if you look at the history of those two groups, they have been fighting each other in part due to England's racist meddling. So you tell me your Indian experience, but don't pretend you cannot draw the line between ignorance and facts. Don't come in here trying to tell me your silly experience with other "negroids", which sounds rediculous. You went to India with other BLACK PEOPLE. Black Americans, or AFricans, or whatever. Other "negroids"??? Come on man. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 22:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am certainly willing to be mature about this, but there is another person who will disrupt that. Here is what I understand about race and India. The whole racial lightskin/darkskin racial issue originated in India with the caste system and spread westward. That's how I understood the history of skin color racism. That is why I find it fascinating that we don't incorporate the history of this into the article. In india, they were skin color conscious thousands of years ago, and at some point it spread westward. I don't know if it were the ancestors of the gypsies escaping aryan domination or what. Maybe someone can find more info about it. But the concept of blackness did not come from the mind of an Englishman nor a Spaniard, that I know for sure. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 15:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Are we going to sit aside and watch a potential nuclear holocaust wipe out about one third of the world's Black population? Indians and Pakistanis as well a people in Africa, the America and elsewhere should consider that. Neither the Semites who have forced their religions on Blacks nor the Europeans care one bit. As long as Black (darkskinned) peoples of the earth are destroying themselves, that is less they have to worry about. That is why the promote abortion and birthcontrole in nations likeAfrica, India the Caribbean and Black America, Black Latin America. That is why instead of helping to destroy AIDS, they are charging fortunes for AIDS medicine...and right now, they are praying that India and Pakistan destroy each other, that AIDS wipe out Africans in Africa, and racists in South America continue to eliminate Black people in places like Brazil.

<dd>Firts of all the statements above are fringe and they don't at all get to the heart of being Black. Yes it serves a political purpose to lump all dark-skinned people together, but he could have just as easily said "non-white people of the world" inviting Orientals and Arabs into the club (they too have experienced racism) and the statements would have had the same meaning. Your conception of Blackness is absurdly inclusive (anyone dark enough to experience racism). I think it's far more interesting to write an article about Blackness as defined by African ancestry because all over the world there's a huge cultural difference between being a black skinned person and being a black skinned person from Africa.

<p>Here you go again, avoiding and dodging. Who do the dark skinned arabs in the middle east experience racism from? Where did the middle east get their slaves? The cultural difference between black people is not an issue I am here to discuss, that's not a matter of contention. But the fact is, you pretend that there are no black skinned people outside of Africa except those who left in chains within the last 500 years westward. That's absurd. What you are speaking of with your insistence on the "whole Black experience" is not "whole", it is "the African-American" experience. How many fucking times do you have to go in circles with this? I am so tired of you acting like a republican politician, you know what I am talking about and you are so obsessed with your self centered American attitude. I am qualified to edit because unlike you, I consider the aspects of all the peoples, not just these or those. The American diaspora of Africa is not the only Black people.

<p>I certainly understand there is a nuance regarding the difference between blackness as a social concept and as an ethnic identity. But this page is not about the "ethnic identity", why? Because the "ethnic identity" is "Afro-" in orientation. That's the "ethnicity". Afro-American is an Ethnic identity. African-American is an ethnic identity. Being Black is not something that should be distinguished to such a degree by region (at least not in this article). For most of us who are black in here know this: You can find Australian (and I personally know a few) aboriginal who could interact in America, and socialize as a black American. IN no way would their "ethnicity" seperate them from other black people in America. That nuance would become highly irrelevant, and the only way that Aboriginal, in the U.S. would seperate himself is by his or her adherence to Aussie/British cultural nuances and norms. You would not find an aboriginal trying to distance himself from a black american by virtue of his Aborignal heritage, it doesn't make any sense and you know it. I have talked to aboriginals who are black. They don't understand or conceive the concept of "not really being black". Certainly as black people we can all still see and respect each other's diversity within our black identity, however we do not play "one upsmanship" by competing or comparing blackness. That reminds me of those white supremacist teenagers who would get into fights over whose skin is the lightest and who has the most german ancestry. We as black people don't think like that. The ethnicities of blackness are plural, not singular. Each african group out of the hundreds or so are distinct identities. You respect each one, because they are very diverse. So too is it with those outside the continent who, for all intensive purposes are as black as anyone within the continent. And by the way, considering the Ethiopians. Many have emigrated to Israel as Jews... I suppose they are no longer black either? We in the UNited States are no longer in Africa, yet we are still black. Go figure! The Afro-Canadians, and Afro-Russians that escaped slavery... with that same attitude we regard them as just "slightly" less black. That's just the carry over of white supremacy in our minds. SPit it out, stop holding on to that self-centered notion. <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/thomp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/thomp.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a><a href="http://inourownright.e-contentmanagement.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://inourownright.e-contentmanagement.com/" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> read and get it through your head. Since it is through slavery that the social concept of being black has engrained itself in the consciousness of black Americans, the REASON we struggled. The same is for these people in Asia and India. The physical location of their continent does not diminish the significance of this. No white or "non-black" asian, nor american is going to consciously embrace this legacy as their own while still calling themselves "white" or "not-black". That's been my biggest point. Man forget it, this is too deep for some people.

<p>Dude I know people FROM India, why don't we let THEM tell the story? I don't need to worry about your judgement. You're telling me your experience in New Delhi or wherever. Go to Kerala, or the South. I am not interested in addressing those who have nothing to do with us, I am writing in this article about those in India who ARE connected with us. This article isn't called "find a segment of a population that is black in order to label the WHOLE population AS Black", I didn't say that India is predominantly Black, or even 50-50. I originally wrote that about 20% would be considered black. So that means 1 out of 5 is likely or partly black. Out of that even cutting in half (1/10th) you still have over 100 million people. That's a lot of black people. And I would bet you anything, ANYTHING, that the majority of those consider themselves black, and do not take the ignorance you assume about them. So now that you have insulted me, I am making sure to expose this discussion far and wide. You just keep flapping your gums. Oh and as far as you calling me out? Besides vandalizing pages, what real contributions have you made? Look at my contribution history. Look at the Yoruba, the Orania, Volkstaat, the Ancient Egyptians, the Negroid and Caucasoid articles, Ethiopians, Nubians, and others. So kiss MY ass. Oh and in addition, why don't you READ my user and talk page before you start flapping about my hatred of my own people. You don't even KNOW who Kola Boof is, or Freida Ekotto, or Manu Ampim. Half of those Black inventors I listed, you never heard of them, so get real. YOu talk about being black and what it really means, then you get off the computer, go into your living room, listen to hip-hop gangsta rappers stereotype our people like blackface mimicry. Go to your Oprah, tabloid, billionaire, and gay icon articles and then come in here like you are the quiet leader of the black perspective. I don't see ONE contribution about Black history or african history that has been constructive. You can learn a lot about a person seeing their contributions here. That's why I don't even bother to hide. You see me for what I am. But you're showing yourself as well. For one, you confuse "African Diaspora" with "black people", two you keep running to a catch22 in that you believe that acknowledging the blackness of others diminishes the blackness, or the power of it in ourselves.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Problematic Australian assertion</span></h3>
<p>Since the page is protected, I can't add the citation I would like to the assertion <i>Australian society labels Indigenous Australians as Black.</i> I think that is an inappropriate generalisation. Australian society lables Indigenous Australians as "Indigenous Australians", "Aboriginals or "Torres Strait Islanders" Black is informal, deprecated by non-indigenous Australians and gets into issues about history wars, saying sorry, all sorts of things. What is meant in this context by "Australian society"? The assertion is simplistic and really wrong. I note above a citation to inourownright.e-contentmanagement.com - that isn't an "Australian society" label. There is also citation to the National Library of Australia and an article <i>White Australia has a Black History': Sources for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in the National Library of Australia</i> - that punning article title refers to Indigenous Australians throughout the article and is about <i>"Its neat ambiguity summed up two important issues central to any understanding of this country. In the first place, it was an affirmation by indigenous Australians that their long history in this country had primacy, legitimacy and a rich and positive integrity of its own. Secondly, it was an accusation, a reminder to those celebrating a mere two hundred years of European settlement, that this celebration was based on a false premise. The slogan was a reminder to the country that a dark pall of shame lay over the history of European settlement in Australia and that until this was recognised and acknowledged the prospects for reconciliation were bleak."</i> For the wiki articles on this see among others <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_wars.html" title="History wars">History wars</a>; <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_armband_view_of_history.html" title="Black armband view of history">Black armband view of history</a>; <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_War_2894.html" title="Black War">Black War</a> - the use of Black in this way is not labelling Indigenous Australians as "Black", not these days. Perhaps the most conclusive evidence I can offer that this assertion is inappropriate is to suggest a search of the article on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> for the word "black". This article is the main article on the people and extensively edited and quite lengthy with a number of subidiary articles. You will find "black" twice: <i>Dr Lang said "There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains."</i> and <i>In the resulting historic and controversial Gove land rights case, Justice Blackburn ruled that ...</i> I think this is a clear indication that "black" is not used in formal Australian society today to refer to Indigenous Australians. That it may be used in informal language is a different thing and the assertion needs to be qualified as such and offer up some citations giving context.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 09:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What does having dark skin and suffering exploitation have to do with descending from Africa? Melanesians are NOT part of the African diaspora, Europeans are more closely related to Africans than Melanesians are. 86.141.217.187 00:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>DeeCeeVoice and EditingOprah, great job. I want to commend you for your ignorance and your commitment to causing discord. Without you I would have not decided to leave this Eurocentricipedia. I would like to award you the African Dictator Award if they had one, so instead I offer you a Mugabe for your self-centered viewpoints on blackness and on all and all general self-destructive behavior. Great JOB! See yall in a few months. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
