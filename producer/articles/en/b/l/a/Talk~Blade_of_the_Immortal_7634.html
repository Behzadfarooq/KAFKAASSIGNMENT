<p>i wish we (or the main writer) could post thumbnails next to the character descriptions...that would really help in identifying who is who, making it more of a character guide.</p>
<p>I agree there is a good head to toe pic of each character dispersed throughout the trades displaying them would help people know who’s who and give good examples of the artistic quality present in the book.</p>

<dd>Since this hasn't been addressed yet -- I have the Japanese volume 15, which has several pages of small head shots of most of the characters, in order of introduction, with their names in kanji. I'll cut out some individual pictures from scans of those pages and put them into the character descriptions; they won't be very large, so they shouldn't mess up the formatting of the article.--Madame Manga 20:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've put in head shots of Manji and Rin. How does that look? A good size? I could keep it consistent, or make the pics smaller for minor characters. These are taken out of a multi-page character list in the Japanese volume 15. All of those are color-coded to show who is affiliated with whom (Itto-ryu, Mugai-ryu, unaligned, and so on); I could put in an explanatory line to that effect. --Madame Manga 21:42, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the headshots, though they are a bit large. I noticed that Itto-Ryu section was a bit distorted with the Magatsu section being pushed to the center of the page, so I did a little editing to fix it. If you add more though that could become a bit of a problem and is probably something to look out for. Otherwise I'm all for the headshot idea. --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostPhrack_17a0.html" title="User:LostPhrack">LostPhrack</a> 12:16, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The center of the page? Hmm -- I did some formatting on the first pass to solve that very problem, so the layout probably shifts according to how wide the browser window is set. The main trouble with that section is that Anotsu doesn't have enough text to fit his picture. The only fix that the various help pages suggest for that problem, which is apparently a common one... is adding more text! Certainly an option for him, since he rates a larger entry anyway. Yes, I was thinking that the supporting characters might rate smaller pics, and that would solve a few formatting problems. My monitor is set to 1280x1024, which is probably a little high compared to the average user.--Madame Manga 19:06, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Garr -- extra carriage returns get automatically stripped. Which broke the formatting again. Sorry about the mess; I am used to HTML, and this is obviously a less predictable beast.

<dd>Good, then it worked! I gave up on flowing the text around the images, and settled for putting each on its own line. Not precisely what I had in mind, but at least that doesn't break anything. I've got a lot more headshots to install, though I will concentrate on the more prominent recurring characters. --Madame Manga 04:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In makis description is written, that she is Anitsus lover. I do not agree on that point. She is is love with Anotsu, but he does not love her. he only admires her for being so skilled with the sword. I'd like to change that in her description. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFranczeska_150d.html" title="User:Franczeska">Franczeska</a> 19:22, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anotsu's actions and words as of the "Dreamsong" arc, as well as his actions after Makie's intervention near the end of the "Last Blood" arc seem to indicate more than admiration of her skill on his part. While I agree that "lovers" is too broad and general a term, it's also unfair to dismiss the relationship as having no romantic undertones whatsoever. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigital_Watches_3132.html" title="User:Digital Watches">Digital Watches</a> 08:50, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I think he’s right while he dose not overtly love her his interest in her dose seem to go beyond just admiration of her skills. But my opinion comes from speculation based off their depicted actions its not really enough that it should be put in the article, like I said before the article should mention that they have a complex relationship.</p>

<p>I think what they mean about them being lovers was that they had been intimae. Either way their relationship is more complex then the article leads the reader to believe.</p>

<p>I think we should move towards giving major, and possibly later supporting and minor characters their own articles, and then a category. This would, in my opinion, help the article to be much more complete and informative. I was part of the project to do the same for <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilty_Gear_c1d1.html" title="Guilty Gear">Guilty Gear</a> characters, and I think that this was a resounding success.

<p>I think that may be a good idea, the characters are more in-depth and complex then the article leads the reader to believe and makes little mention of how many of the characters relate to each other.</p>
<p>Leon Evelake 01:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, wiki newb here. I was wondering about templates for the character articles? I was browsing through the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">Comics</a> project section and found the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_templates_ed7c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/templates">Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/templates</a>. Would it be possible to modify that and use it for the character profiles or...? I wasn't sure if there was a protocol for this kind of thing and didn't want to anything major before finding out one way or another. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostPhrack_17a0.html" title="User:LostPhrack">LostPhrack</a> 11:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if there's an overt template per se, but, as I've said, there's a basic template for <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilty_Gear_c1d1.html" title="Guilty Gear">Guilty Gear</a> characters, and whoever did the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_3_8c43.html" title="Street Fighter 3">Street Fighter 3</a> characters did it really well, too. There doesn't appear to be a uniform policy, so as long as it looks good and presents the information well, it should be fine. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigital_Watches_3132.html" title="User:Digital Watches">Digital Watches</a> 07:40, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, apparently the articles been marked for clean up. I couldn't find anymore info on it though so I'm not sure what needs to be fixed. I was thinking of removing the notes in the story arc section though, they're just glossary material from the books and serve no real purpose here. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostPhrack_17a0.html" title="User:LostPhrack">LostPhrack</a> 20:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Several things can be fixed. Characters - Itto-ryu - Doa &amp; Isaku. The grammar and spelling here can be greatly improved, although the information itself is solid.</p>
<p>Also, the "notes" section found within the First Arc information can be made into its own section, although it should be supplementary information. In other words, it should not repeat information that can be found elsewhere in the article, though I suppose it could be used to expound/explain other sections of the article. Much like the glossary found in the manga.</p>
<p>Also, for the characters' info, it might be helpful to list where each character first appears and if they died, in which episode. In many cases, it is already listed by whom. For example: Shingenyoto-Ryu: Kozue: First appears in "Secrets Part 1"; presumably killed by Magatsu in "Last Blood Part 5". Roel 02:56, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll do a little work on the appearances, I'm limited to the first six volumes at the moment. I'd still prefer to remove the notes material, but that's just me.

I'm a little iffy on it myself. It does give a nice consistant look with some of the other anime/manga entries, but that big empty space beneath it is a little bothersome. I also removed the april clean up tag since it seemed rather pointless to have one up there for april and may. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostPhrack_17a0.html" title="User:LostPhrack">LostPhrack</a> 11:48, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any reason why the names of the characters are currently given in the Western style, with the family name second, instead of the Japanese style, with the personal name second? The Dark Horse English translation was erratic on this point at first, but has settled down to a consistent Japanese name style for many years. Anyone reading this article in English will probably expect to see character names given as they are in the licensed translation; it seems confusing to have it any other way, as well as technically incorrect. If there is no objection, I will modify the character entries to reflect Japanese name style. --Madame Manga 08:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blade of the Immortal is set prior to 1868, circa the mid-1780s. As far as I can tell, if the article were to abide by the stated guideline, the names of the characters should be put in Japanese style, not Western.

<dd><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> doesn't actually say anything about fictional characters that I can see (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html#Names" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA#Names</a>).

Since this page falls under that project's scope, that's probably why the names are written that way in the article. I glanced at the editing history and it looks like the names used to be written in the Japanese style but were changed at some point.

Could be that Blade of the Immortal can be considered an exception to that general rule. -- <a href="../../../9/m/u/User%7E9muses.html" title="User:9muses">9muses</a> 20:25, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the Naruto discussion reference via the anime/manga talkpage, so I'm right with ya. Per your suggestion, I've stated the question outright on the talkpage. I am still getting the hang of Wikipedia etiquette (despite having made various contributions long before actually signing up) so any recommendations on how long I should wait for feedback before carrying out any changes? This isn't the most actively watched article in the anime/manga section, obviously.--Madame Manga 00:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd wait just a couple days. I doubt there'll be anyone against it since like you said, BotI isn't the most active of articles so it doesn't attract the heated conflicts you find in the Naruto and One Piece pages. But just to be safe. The only reason I brought it up is because if the names were originally written in Japanese style and later changed to Western style, there's a chance it'll happen again later down the road. I have a feeling that was done here because of the "Character names must be written in Western order" guideline stated on the project page. I can't be sure of that, of course. I wasn't able to find that specific edit in the history, but it looks like at one point each character had their own article. The best I can figure is that when the character articles were nominated for deletion/merging (I can't tell which exactly it was because this article's edit summaries aren't the best), someone changed the names to the Western order around the same time.</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with the change, and greatly thank Madame Manga for her work on the article recently. I've also been curious about expert request as well, not to mention what would qualify someone as an expert on BotI to begin with. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostPhrack_17a0.html" title="User:LostPhrack">LostPhrack</a> 11:51, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Since no one seems to know and I didn't find anything on the main expert request page, I'm going to remove the tag. -- <a href="../../../9/m/u/User%7E9muses.html" title="User:9muses">9muses</a> 14:49, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
