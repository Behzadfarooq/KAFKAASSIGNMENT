<p>Carlo Giuliani was wearing a white T-shirt, not black. Someone dressed his body in black after he was shot.</p>
<p>Who ever got the idea that a black bloc was a militia? A militia is an armed organization that usually operates along national lines; when black blocs use weapons at all, they tend to have only ad-hoc arms, such as sticks and stones and bottles; besides black blocs are not organized and they reject nationalism. So how could they be militias?</p>
<p>Also, what the heck is a union flying squad? And I have never heard of Situationists or Pagans engaging in black bloc activity. While individual Situationists or Pagans may take part in the occasional black bloc, Pagans tend to organize in Pagan clusters, which play music, sing, and conduct rituals and magic in demonstration settings, and Situationists are artists; they practice guerrilla communication, not rioting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A union flying squad is an autonomous group of workers who engage in various actions, sometimes with the official support of unions, to further the workplace struggle. The rest of your paragraph reads to me like stereotypes and generalizations. Any given bloc will be made up of any number of different people with different thoughts, beliefs, lifestyles, etc. <a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 04:50, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't doubt the information presented in the article, but this is one of the most slanted articles I've read in wikipedia. All the way through, it's slanted in a way to put "black bloc" demonstrators in a positive light.</p>
<p>It read more like a slanted newspaper article trying to be neutral than an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>Take for example the section about a "documentary" which apparantly slanted things in a way to try to proove that the police cooperated with fascist groups.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is a great discussion topic, but this article reads more like an attempt to defend the "black bloc" demonstrators than just a simple explanation about what a black bloc is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. This article is a mess. It should be a to the point explanation of what exactly a "black bloc" is. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 13:47, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not only is this a slanted article, it's complete BS. Black Bloc is not a movement? Sounds like someone has just redefined the word "movement" to me. For f**k's sake someone re-write this.203.134.135.55 09:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose reverting. I don't like his "street fighting" crap and saying that anarchists train to use baseball bats and rocks. Total nonsense. Most anarchists hate the "anarchist cookbook," even the black bloc types. Black blocs aren't about street fighting and rioting. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 19:22, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Black Bloc is about fighting for your rights. You obviously were not there, never was among the hundreds of Anarchists fighting it out in N30 against WTO and cannot speak for all Anarchists, just your version of Anarchy. Some Anarchist appreciate the Anarchist Cookbook for what it is, a starting point on how to fight back the cooperations. Yes they do train with rocks, yes they use slingshots, and yes they use bats. Crude but effective. You need to look at the photographs from N30 more carefully before you jump to conclusions.Masssiveego</p>

<dd>There's something really clever and witty in the cooperations/corporations typo that you made, and I'm wondering what it is. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendelkhan_c5fb.html" title="User:Grendelkhan">grendel</a>|<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrendelkhan_bc03.html" title="User talk:Grendelkhan">khan</a> 03:02, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you use the cookbook you're more likely to blow yourself up than "fight back against the cooperations." I've never heard of people "training" to use rocks. It's more just picking one up and throwing it at a cop if the need arises. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 19:54, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take issue with the "Violence by Black Bloc activists" section of the article because it appears to be written with the intention of being disparaging. However, the Washington Post and several other sources do cite the same incident. Additionally, I was at Malcolm X Park on J20 and have my own photos of the Protest Warriors dressed in full black bloc holding their banner.</p>
<p>I also question whether this is the most appropriate place for this section in the first place. I've been contemplating the possibility of creating an article for J20, entitled <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_counter-inaugural_protest.html" title="2005 counter-inaugural protest">2005 counter-inaugural protest</a> or something like that as part of <a href="../../../w/p/a/WP%7EWPA_b939.html" title="WP:WPA">Wikiproject Anti-War</a>. If I do create the article, I think that would be a more appropriate place for this bit than the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_bloc.html" title="Black bloc">Black bloc</a> article.</p>

<dd>The incident occurred as stated. The Washington Post article left some things out that led up to the violence, but I can get you multiple sources given time. I could also get you the testimony of Kobrin himself, but that would probably violate the no original research policy. If it would be more appropriate to put in another article, then I'm amenable to that. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 19:12, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't dispute the factuality. As I mentioned, I have read pieces from both sides, and they tell the same basic story.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at the Black Bloc article as a whole, the section doesn't fit because it's a substantial section on a specific event, while the remainder of the article speaks in more general terms.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I mentioned earlier, I consider it worthwhile to start an article about J20, but I've got a few things ahead of it on my priority list. That would be the place for this bit, as I can imagine it being a sub-section of a larger section on the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Anti-War_Network_2666.html" title="DC Anti-War Network">DAWN</a> rally and march. For an article about the entire day, that would fit quite well, and I'd love any help I can get on the day. (Not going any further on that tangent, since I'm starting to drift off topic.)</dd>

<dd>The article for J20 is now in place, but it's really stubby. <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20%2C_2005_counter-inaugural_protest.html" title="January 20, 2005 counter-inaugural protest">January 20, 2005 counter-inaugural protest</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">Schuminweb</a> 22:57, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could get some people I know who were there to work on it, but the problem is that they might not be able to maintain neutrality; most of them were on the receiving end of the assault. I'll do what I can with it. As for the section here, do you think we should take it out entirely, or modify it to make it more general? I had a plan of expanding it to include more instances, but that was the only one that I had a ready description of at hand. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 01:26, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I went ahead and completely moved it, since at least in my opinion, regarding specific events, it should go more in the context of the black bloc's activity at the event, rather than with the concept of Black Bloc. As for <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20%2C_2005_counter-inaugural_protest.html" title="January 20, 2005 counter-inaugural protest">J20</a> (though this is getting outside the scope of this talk page), go ahead and get people to work on the section. Don't worry about NPOV so much. Do your best to stay neutral, but remember that there are a bazillion wikipedians out there who are also concerned about keeping it neutral, and one way or another, we'll get it right. And I think that anything further on this ought to go to the talk page for J20. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">Schuminweb</a> 02:42, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please keep in mind when editing this article that Wikipedia has strict rules against using the encyclopedia to advocate political positions – Wikipedia does not take sides.

<p>I think the words "direct action" are too techno-babbly. Almost nobody outside of the anarchy movement knows what they mean -- I know what it means, but only because I was at WTO '99 in Seattle, and saw it, but I think that's a unique experience not shared by many. Please try to find simpler English terms to describe what that is. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 01:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it's use is quite prevalent in activist movements in general, not just the anarchist one. The best term for direct action is direct action. We are not <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a> here and we are not afraid to use technical terms, especially when there is an entire article on the term's meaning and history. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 04:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did, which is why I tried to explain why it's important. If your idea is to replace it with property destruction like you have in the past, then I will say right now definitely not. That is not accurate and is highly biased, as property destruction is only one type of action black blocks engage in, and most of them probably don't. If you have another idea, can you present it? I could understand your concern if there wasn't an article on direct action, but there is (and it's pretty extensive). It is a common term in activism and this <i>is</i> an article about activism. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 08:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Sure most will say, yeah, Alex Jones, but he claims (and provides some convincing evidence mostly TV reports) that the Black Bloc is often used (or agents are dressed as Black Bloc) by the US government in order to ensure news reports of protest can report violence, thus vilifying the protesters and their message. Sounds like a cheap, easy way to do it...</p>

<dd>Consider the source, Alex Jones. Conspiracy theorist and bullshit artist. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about most of the time he opens his mouth and he obviously doesn't know anything about the subject of black blocs. I've organized several black blocs and participated in others. There were no agents in the black bloc other than the occasional undercover officer. The black bloc is a tactic used by anarchists to further our agenda.

<dd>Never really noticed that. It could be seen as a temporary affinity group though.

<dd>Hmm... infoshop.org says "The black bloc is a TACTIC, not a group or organization. Just like there cannot by the "Civil Disobedience Group," neither can the black bloc be an organization." It also says that "A black bloc is a collection of anarchists and anarchist affinity groups that organize together for a particular protest action." The site is down right now, but you can find those quotes in the google cash. I think that it's much more accurate than simply calling the black block a temporary affinity group.

<p>The article describes black blocs in several different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the intro as "an affinity group..."</li>
<li>As an action: "the tradition of black blocking..."</li>
<li>As a group: "typical actions of a black bloc..."</li>
</ol>
<p>Outside the article there's the expression "bloc up!" which suggests that the tighter formation is the bloc and the looser one, not the bloc. A bloc can be hundreds or thousands strong; an affinity group is much smaller. The ACME Collective's post-Seattle statement described the bloc there as "a cluster of affinity groups." (A cluster was two or more affinity groups with the same mission. At N30, one or more clusters held each slice; at A16, if the sources are complete descriptive, and if I have read them right, several clusters/slices formed into superclusters.)
