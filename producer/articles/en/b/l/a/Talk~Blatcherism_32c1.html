<p>Another characteristic of the complex phenomenon we know as 'blatcherism' is covered by the German word, 'kinderfeindlichkeit'. When Germans use it they mean societal or official coldness or hostility towards children.</p>
<p>Arguably, a wave of British kinderfeindlichkeit first openly manifested as Education Minister Thatcher's withdrawal of school children's free milk, was amplified later by a government culture coloured by the personal/political philosophy indicated by Prime Minister Thatcher's notorious "there is no such thing as society" outburst, and subsided during a brief spell of relatively benign 'one-nation' Conservative government.</p>
<p>Reinvigourated by 'new' blatcherist government in forms typified by Prime Minister Blair's 1997 high profile 1997 discriminatory campaign against single-handed parents and their children, and by lower profile actions like that of his Health Minister Dobson's concurrent abolition of school dental services. It peaked in the repetitive electionering promises by both main contestants to "hard working families" (code for part-time parents) and is displayed in 2005 by Prime Minister Blair's declared "war" on society's own alienated children as "yobs", aggravated by his presidential government's 2005 implementation of a "toothless" <a href="http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,1074,1347110,00.html/" class="external text" title="http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,1074,1347110,00.html/" rel="nofollow"><i>"glorified TV presenter"</i></a> as England's Commissioner For Children, in contrast with powerful Children's champions in mainland Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Kinderfeindlichkeit, it can therefore be argued, is one of the defining characteristics of blatcherism that helps us clearly differentiate it, not only from "previous postwar political consensus" in Britain and from current mainland European culture, but also from mainstream <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatism.html" title="Neoconservatism">neoconservatism</a>.</p>
<p>Another secondary characteristic, government dominated by leaders characterised by huge egos supported by less than commensurate intellect is suggested by recent implementation of a series of toothless "Commissioner" offices (HealthCare, Information, Children's, et al) populated by jolly good chaps who can be relied on not to rock the political boat in the way that Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin did a couple of years ago - and by recent books written by associates <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050923/ap_en_ot/books_tony_blair_1&amp;printer=1;_ylt=AlwnL5GdYmxtzIRf5EoE1ONY24cA;_ylu=X3oDMTA3MXN1bHE0BHNlYwN0bWE-/" class="external text" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050923/ap_en_ot/books_tony_blair_1&amp;printer=1;_ylt=AlwnL5GdYmxtzIRf5EoE1ONY24cA;_ylu=X3oDMTA3MXN1bHE0BHNlYwN0bWE-/" rel="nofollow"><i>associates</i></a></p>

<p>'Blatcherism' was used rather earlier the article suggests, and not by a critic of neo-liberal economics; it's used in an approving article of May 2001 by Brian Lee Crowley, the President of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies (I don't know if he invented the term). Crowley writes:</p>
<p>'Like Clem Attlee before her, she [Margaret Thatcher] refashioned the mould of British politics. Her greatest political victory was the fact that she made the Labour party unelectable as long as it clung to the failed tenets of democratic socialism. Michael Foot, the socialist conscience of the Labour party of the 1960s and '70s, cut a Quixotic figure as Labour leader in the early '80s, promising to roll back the privatizations, the fiscal discipline, the reforms of welfare. Only a Thatcherite leader could bring Labour within the new political consensus in Britain. Tony Blair was that leader.</p>
<p>'In fact, the new political consensus in that country is now sometimes called Blatcherism.</p>
<p>'Blatcherism was born when Tony Blair saw off the trade unions that demanded the party toe their line, when he agreed to leave the Thatcherite legacy largely intact, and to be as fiscally disciplined as the Tories. In fact, he also embraced the consumer-oriented philosophy of the Tories in other areas and maintained, for example, tough testing in the schools, publishing annually the league tables of how every school in the country performs, over the objections of the once all-powerful teachers' unions.'</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aims.ca/cm_Print.asp?cmPageID=200&amp;typeID=4&amp;id=474&amp;fd=0&amp;p=10&amp;pg=newsletters.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.aims.ca/cm_Print.asp?cmPageID=200&amp;typeID=4&amp;id=474&amp;fd=0&amp;p=10&amp;pg=newsletters.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aims.ca/cm_Print.asp?cmPageID=200&amp;typeID=4&amp;id=474&amp;fd=0&amp;p=10&amp;pg=newsletters.asp</a></p>

<dd>It was also in use rather earlier than the Crowley article, by myself among others. - but aside from that Crowley also asserts&#160;: " Blatcherism was born when Tony Blair... agreed to leave the Thatcherite legacy largely intact.... In fact, he also embraced the consumer-oriented philosophy of the Tories...." adding momentum to the slide into a gluttony driven economy that produces nothing that other societies want to buy and a society that makes "war" (nice mr. Blair) on its own alienated children.</dd>

<p>Would blatcherist zealots kindly refrain from vandalising the page and its text hyperlinks and reference links.

<p>Thank you for the invitation - I'll try to find the time, although as kinderfeindlichkeit is a defining characteristic of blatcherism before and after the Major years of 'one-nation' Conservatism, it should be at least superficially covered by, and for the same reason should not be excluded from, development of the 'blatcherism' topic, otherwise we end up with a page of porridge about something other than 'blatcherism' - meantime do you, unlike whoever is deliberately vandalising the main page, have anything useful to contribute towards the development of the topic "blatcherism", by for example tendering some supported/supportable argument in place of personal attack on other contributors?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to be intimidated out of editing the page into shape by cliched verbals, actually. So just drop the 'vandal' this and George Orwell that. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 06:15, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In other words your answer is 'no' - you do not have anything supportable to contribute in place of the 'me, me, me' focus. If and when you decide to focus on constructive development of the topic, do let us have your (supported) input for consideration.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You just don't get it. I should be able to edit the page, in accordance with Wikipedia's policies, without silly shouting about 'censorship'. Some of the references on the page are on-topic, some are not. I'm going to tidy it all up again. When I do, displays of 'attitude' on your part are not going to be in my mind, but the requirements of policy, on neutral point of view. After about 41000 edits here, I think I might know what the policies are. There is little point you abusing me further. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 08:01, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In other words you cannot plead ignorance when making time-consuming work for busy contributers who don't enjoy the amount of spare time that you brandish, by breaking links, deleting on topic references and supported comment - and substituting shallow unsupported personal opinion. The meaning of "blatcherism" is determined by the majority of users of the descriptor, not by a tiny opinionated minority who wish to believe that censorship can change the reality of usage, in the manner of a 21st century Ministry of Truth. If you can unearth usage that supports your prejudices, submit it as a minority opinion without deleting majority references and usage, otherwise shut up. Better still use some of your apparently ample spare time to do something useful by for example polishing the page instead of vandalising it, since I and others dont have the time to.</p>

<dd>That's a good question, but does the answer content matter? Maybe the French language evolves either not at all, or differently. English language developement/evolution is essentially brute usage driven. Somebody invents a neologism. It takes root and spreads as a virus does, thereby enhancing the thought processes that differentiate humans from other apes, or it doesn't and dies.</dd>

<p>As a replacement student allocated, by the 'owning' (that means original page initiater) school, the job of overseeing the evolution of this page, I've removed the following para (feel free to discuss if you wish) on the ground that it plays into the hands of the thought police because it does tend to reflect Blairism back onto poor ol' Thatcher to an unsupported extent - however do by all means deliver the support if it can be unearthed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Less easily related to the 'banana republic' theme, because the connection is made more tenuous by existence of some actual banana republic's the leadership of which does not wage "war" [quote Blair], on their own alienated children, is the announcememnt by a 'minimaggie' (excuse the neologism - it's shorthand for the succession of child 'free' women who appear onstage as fronts for blatcherism) today, that teachers are to be authorised to 'physically restrain' alienated children.</dd>

<dd>Flagrantly prejudiced 'editing' (replacement of supported content by unsupported woofage and even misrepresentation of sources like Cockburn), tallies with both apparent inability to differentiate beteen " 'owned' " as I used it and "ownership" as you used it, and admitted reliance on a commercial source "google" What *is* your native language?

Oh and btw, about your conceptual confusion over - or is it 'English as a second language' misuse of - the English language descriptor 'left-wing' as a term of intended abuse, the thought police are according to Eric Blair and usage, an arm of a 'left-wing' State, and the TP are *not* on this side here.

<p>This is the edited version :</p>
<p>Blatcherism is a term formed as a combination of the names of two British politicians, Tony Blair (Labour Party) and Margaret Thatcher (Tory). It is used by critics of neo-liberal economics to refer to the thesis that a policy model of the devisive Thatcher government as distinct from the 'one-nation' Major government, was resumed when Blair came to power.</p>
<p>An early sighting of this term was in 2001, used by Brian Lee Crowley[1], a Canadian commentator. It mimics the much older Butskellism frequently used to describe the post-war consensus established on the UK's welfare state. It has been used, for example, by the journalist Alexander Cockburn, in preference to Blairism. Cockburn would be extremely angry if he knew his content was being misrepresented as above.</p>
<p>Much earlier ones exist but are presumably deemed to be unacceptable on a scale of political correctitude by Wikepdia's censors.</p>
<p>The term is also used as shorthand by Ananyeva (Polis Journal - Political studies - No.5, 2001) and others. It then refers to that which is "personified by T. Blair" and has "substituted for the previous postwar political consensus", as an approach to a solution to Britain's modernisation problems that is compatible with Thatcherism. Ananyeva would be horrified by the half-truth. What a fraud! The correct quote is as follows : "consensual with neoconservatism as embodied in thatcherism"</p>

<p>You can say that again. There follows my editing this morning. Watch to see how long it remains free from vandalism and flagrant misrepresentation of sources : Blatcherism is a term formed as a combination of the names of two British politicians, Tony Blair (Labour Party) and Margaret Thatcher (Tory). It is used by critics of neo-liberal economics to refer to the thesis that a policy model of the Thatcher and Major governments was retained when Blair came to power.</p>
<p>An early sighting of this term was in 2001, used by Brian Lee Crowley[1], a Canadian commentator. It mimics the much older Butskellism frequently used to describe the post-war consensus established on the UK's welfare state. It has been used, for example, by the journalist Alexander Cockburn, in preference to Blairism. An earlier "sighting" is usage in 1995 when Hilary Wainright (Red Pepper) observed "Beware Blatcherism - the new Labour leadership has appropriated and rejigged the framework laid down by Thatcher" (as distinct from Major).</p>
<p>The term is also used as shorthand by Ananyeva (Polis Journal - Political studies - No.5, 2001) According to Ananyeva (Polis Journal - Political studies - No.5, 2001), "blatcherism" is currently "personified by T.Blair", has "substituted for the previous postwar political consensus", and is "consensual" with "neoconservatism as embodied in thatcherism" in the approach to a solution to Britain's modernisation problems.</p>

<dd>My point is that they did not say that they used the <i>word</i> "blatcherism" in 1997. They said that they accused Blair of blatcherism back then, but that leaves open the possibility that they used a different word. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 15:59, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The term then favoured by the Media unit at GU was "New Right" which didn't take root and was effectively displaced by more precise and accurately descriptive (of the local British phenomenon) 'blatcherism' - the article outlines the birth of what we now call 'blatcherism', that effectively communicates the 'New Right' root of what we now call 'blatcherism' - to complete the picture and help you 'get head around' it I've added link 'Television Politics and the New Right' <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external free" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a</a></dd>

I am also surprised by the insistence to separate Major's policy from Blatcherism.

<dd>the term is 'blatcherism' not 'blajorism' or 'blajoratcherism' - the distinction speaks for itself about its meaning to users - look for a single instance of usage that does not imply the direct (often with sub-surface referrence to its neoconservative charactersitic) cultural link between Thatcher and Blair, bypassing Major - in fact had Major culture (as distinct from the day to day operations of a weak and distracted prime minister) not been quite different, then the term would not have taken root as a neologism referring to a real phenomenon - you need not take my word for it , take it from Blair who is a widely reported admirer and sometimes cardboard caricature (when the prevailing wind is that direction) of Thatcher not Major - there are also some reports that the admiration is mutual - at another level both have the same backers/allies - at another level, Thatcher and Blair both rank as clinical 'successful sociopaths' and Major doesn't - the proof of the pudding is the usage and the usage is a product of the birth of a clear public perception of a phenomenon in need of a shorthand descriptor to aid effective communications - as someone has suggested, ask Red Pepper's Ed. why she used 'blatcherism' as distinct from 'blajoratcherism' or 'blajorism'</dd>

<dd>You can add in that as a hypothesis (Major ≠ Thatcher) to the whole thing. I'm not convinced about that: there was a small change under Major on public spending, but perhaps not a real change of attitude. Anyway that is small potatoes, compared to other issues about the page.

<p>You know, it is difficult enough to write sensibly about politics within our 'neutral point of view' policy. Deliberate slanting of what is on the page, and abuse in discussion, make it much harder. This is not, in fact, a particularly important or widespread term in political discourse in the UK. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 10:04, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>wrong - it refers to a significant sociopolitical shift from "butskellism" to 'blatcherism' - the fact that it not in widespread use in the mass media referred to in 'Television Politics and the New Right' <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external free" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:mlOatOZEzZMJ:www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/units/media/television.pdf+Television,+Politics+and+the+Rise+of+the+New+Right&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a</a></dd>
<dd>or in the mass media owned/influenced by the backers of both Thatcher and Blair, is symptomatic of another facet of blatcherist culture that has a tentacle in this space - its sometimes referred to as 'news' management, I prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Blair" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Blair" rel="nofollow">Eric Blair</a>'s concept floating on a raft of patronage systems and 'shoot the messenger' (or '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_David_Kelly" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_David_Kelly" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>') syndrome</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think there is any conspiracy not to use this term. People just don't use it. I don't think a journalist on the <i>The Guardian</i> thinks, <i>ooo, better not use that word</i>. All Wikipedia does in such a situation is to document usage. The article now seems to me to be proportionate, and to use neutral language. No doubt it can be improved. Most articles here can. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 11:09, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is a culture not a 'conspiracy' and a significant defence mechanism among its adherents is to resort to labeling critics as 'conspiracy theorists' - I am inclined, subject to reconsideration when more spare time available, to agree that the page now fairly accurately communicates a flavour of the (significant) phenomenon.
<dl>
<dd>correction - at this level its a culture, at the level of nice messrs Blair, Murdoch, Black and the new intimidated BBC management, et al, its a conspiracy</dd>

<dl>
<dd>it's essential (as was demonstrated above by your chum) to anybody without first hand relevant experience, to understanding of the sinews of growth and propagation of the "New Right" as precursor of "New Labour" as a vote winning facade/vehicle for 'blatcherism'</dd>

<dl>
<dd>in your opinion, the unbalanced flavour of which is adequately illustrated above - the shift from butskellism to blatcherism could not have happened, in fact was enabled if not driven by to some extent, by crude mass media engineering - the most recent example we have of the bits thereof that surface, is the intimidation of the BBC over its failure to misrepresent the killing of whistle-blower Kelly, by sacking its top brass and stuffing the top job with a reliable 'crony' (Grade) equipped/armed with billions in hypothecated taxes - if only <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Blair_75e8.html" title="Eric Blair">Eric Blair</a> could be here to comment....</dd>

<dd>I think this article should only discuss the term "Blatcherism" by itself: it is a contraction of Blairism and Thatcherism, it is used by so-and-so, etc. The article should not discuss the thesis that the political consensus in the UK shifted to the right in the last two decades,</dd>
