<dd>Done, but I see that the same could be said about many of the rules. E.g.

<p>I don't quite understand how insurance works. As I understand it, you place another bet, worth half your original bet, that the dealer will get a blackjack. If you're correct, then you lose your original bet because you lost, but you get twice your insurance bet, so overall, you get and lose nothing. If you're wrong, and you beat the dealer, then you lose your insurance and gain your original, so you gain the equivalent of half your original bet. If you're wrong, and you don't beat the dealer, then you lose both your insurance bet and your original bet, which means you lose the equivalent of one-and-a-half original bets.</p>
<p>I don't necessarily say that the section needs rewording - it might just be my incompetence, so I'll leave you to figure that part out - but if someone could clarify that for me that'd be great. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 08:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Here's another look at Insurance. Its a side-bet that has about a 7% advantage for the House. Card-Counting can predict when the Player should take the bet, as there are an excess of 10-valued cards remaining in the shoe. In fact the card-counter can have quite an advantage. This has become known by the House due to the Griffin reports made availible. As such, taking insurance, and winning, is a signal that a Player is counting cards. Its best not to take Insurance even if counting cards. [[[User:ZenTaoKarma|ZenTaoKarma]] 18:28, 5 January 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<dd>Isn't all this covered in the article already? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Gnome_6d64.html" title="User:The Gnome">The Gnome</a> 08:52, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Whats the reference for it being to the player's advantage to take insurance if there are no tens showing and 7 players at the table? The house edge on insurance is only eliminated if there's a greater than 1/3 chance the dealer has a 10 underneath, and even in 4-deck its only a 64/193 (just under 1/3) probability the dealer has a 10, assuming an always shuffled shoe. And you'd have to play an awful lot of hands to ever see that situation arise in less than 4-deck. Or does this "advantage" just mean the insurance bet has a lower house edge than your regular blackjack bet, so that taking it will lower the overall house edge? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangermouse29_30e3.html" title="User:Dangermouse29">Dangermouse29</a> 6:25, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a good point. According to my calculations, even 3 tens showing at single deck is profitable (e=5.4%, like double zero roulette but in your favour). With no tens showing, insurance is worth almost 30% by my calculations (15% of your original bet). But this assumes you can see all the player's cards; I guess this is why you never see face up single deck. At double deck, you would see insurance profitable with up to two tens visible. Perhaps single deck face down is assumed, and somehow you use the fact that no-one has declared a blackjack? Or you are supposed to peek at the dealt cards somehow? Neither of these seems likely. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Van_Emmerik_d54b.html" title="User:Mike Van Emmerik">Mike Van Emmerik</a> 00:41, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just curious how you know that online casinos shuffle every hand. Do you have access to the source code for the host program, or do you just base this on the lack of correlation of the count and the distribution of tens and aces next hand? I suppose it would be easy at a single deck game, e.g. 6 of spades was seen last game, there was no shuffle animation, yet the 6 of spades turns up again next deal or in a hit card. With multideck games, this would be much harder to spot, presumably. Finally, are you fairly confident that practically every online casino does this? I guess if I were offering blackjack online, I'd shuffle every hand, since it only affects the counters, costs almost nothing to do, and makes it very difficult for smart customers to beat my game. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Van_Emmerik_d54b.html" title="User:Mike Van Emmerik">Mike Van Emmerik</a> 21:24, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>online casinos have a rules section that will state how often the deck is shuffled, IMO it is accurate to say that most shuffle after every hand.--Fieldcommand 04:13, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When Gambling online in the game of blackjack the cards are shuffled every hand at every casino so card counting is useless. The only advantage or strategy you can use is basic blackjack strategy. Land based casino's you can count cards. An advantage of online blackjack play is that you get bonus money offered by online casino's because they realize, that there's no way they can take away land based casino business unless they offer some kind of incentive. This incentive is usually 100% bonus on your deposit and requires you to meet some kind of wagering requirement. By getting a bonus you are essentially gambling with the casino's money for free. By making low wagers every hand say like $2 you lower the standard deviation from the mean (or the amount of money you started with plus the bonus) so if you play using basic perfect strategy since the house edge is usually less than 1% you should be able to maintan moneys close to where you started and meet wagered requirements and still have money left from the bonus the casino gave you thereby never even wagering your own money.</p>

<p>Is anyone able to verify that the soft total table is 100% correct? I've compared it to the table given in Edward Thorp's book, and although I expected some discrepancies, the differences are massive.</p>

Thorp's book is nearly half a century old, and blackjack has changed quite a bit since then.

<p>Most basic strategy tables that I have seen (for the American and European version) recommend a stay when the player has a soft 18 and the dealer's upcard is 2, Wikipedia's table recommends a double. Also, all tables recommend a stay on all soft hand 19s, while the wikipedia table is the only one I have seen where it recommends a double if the dealer's upcard is 6. Can someone clarify these two situations, and if the table is correct, bring give sources. Thank you. 88.255.1.180 23:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)Aryan</p>

<dd>I see what you mean, but the fact that you don't actually place an insurance bet makes it slightly different than taking insurance. What you're doing is making sure that you win with your blackjack instead of possibly losing your bet along with everyone else if the dealer has a blackjack and you don't take the even money payout. I have only played at the casinos in Tunica so I didn't know if this was a policy that all casinos followed or if some did it and some didn't. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> 04:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You cannot "lose your bet" when you have a natural and refuse to take even money. If the dealer turns up a natural of his own, you do not lose your bet: You are just not paid anything, because it's a tie. If the dealer turns up anything except a natural, the dealer pays you the regular 3:2 before proceeding with the rest of his hand.</dd>

<li>Yes, I've been in some casinos in Australia that forbid splitting say a jack and ten, they have to be both jacks or both tens. This despite the fact that usually it is in the casino's favour to allow splitting of tens. Splitting of tens is favourable only when the count is high, and then only against a weak dealer card like a 5 or 6. Most authorities state that it is not advisable to split tens even when favourable, as it is a strong indication that the player is a card counter (if not obviously an idiot). --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Van_Emmerik_d54b.html" title="User:Mike Van Emmerik">Mike Van Emmerik</a> 13:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Players so rarely split tens that you make take the casino by surprise when you try to do so. The floor supervisor may make up a "rule" on the spot. (S)he doesn't want to appear unknowledgeable. And if you ask, "CAN I split these?", you obviously want to, so the casino might think that "restricting" you is the safer call, even though they'll make more money if they let you split willy-nilly (assuming you're not counting cards). I'm reminded in one of Ian Andersen's books where he got early surrender by carefully phrasing his question: "Can I wait until the dealer checks her hole card before I surrender, or would I have to surrender now?" -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 03:34, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The reference to card counting in the rules section seems flawed. The page says "although this reduced payout has generally been restricted to single-deck games where card counting would otherwise be a viable strategy, the move was decried by longtime blackjack players." The trouble is that card counting doesn't work in single-deck games, because the deck is shuffled after each hand in single-deck games. -DelRayVA 2 January 2007</p>

<p>Almost every country has laws governing how blackjack plays. Because most casinos are so big most casinos have there own whole acts, I know this is true in Australia and alot of other countries. If we let the UK stuff in we really need to let everything in. Maybe there should be a seperate article for UK laws and any countries that get popular. The huge paragraph in the rules section in particular really drags the article down. It is meant to be the general rules of the game, not the rules according to UK law or any other countries law.--155.144.251.120 05:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This relies on a thing called "backline betting". If this is not allowed, then you can't use the information in this section. Many European and Australian casinos allow up to three bets per box. I'm sure that this would be covered in one of the main blackjack theory books; I haven't played in years and I can't find my texts. Can someone with say Snyder or Uston look up this keyword and find a reference?

<dd>I think you have misunderstood the section completely. It isn't talking about backline betting nor playing different with different sized bets out. Its talking about getting players to buy bad hands and buying good hands from them. Nothing to do with back betting. What you are talking about (back betting your own bet with a much larger back bet so that you can move the large amount to a single card when favourable) is most definately illegal. Most laws state that a back better has to not be you and not be colluding with you to play the game, nor should you be associated. I don't know the decrease in house edge that would be obtained from implementing it, but it surely wouldn't be enough to remove the house edge.--155.144.251.120 22:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
