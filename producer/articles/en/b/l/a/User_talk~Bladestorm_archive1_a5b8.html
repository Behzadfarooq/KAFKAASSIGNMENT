<p>Look, I am getting sick of this.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances are you going to accept that Slingshot Paintball and Just Plain Crazy do not belong in the article? There is no proper source substantiating their inclusion. Even if there was, their association with the actual sport of paintball is dubious at best, and their prevolence is certainly so minor as to not merit inclusion on the same level as things like Capture the Flag, Centerflag, and Pump markers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you are blanket reverting other edits by myself and others. You need to take a step back and look at what you are reverting and explain why you are revertying it, because I honestly can't see any actual reason for it other than you won't accept any changes until you agree there is consensus.</p>
<p>If you don't want an edit war, actually read up on and follow Wikipedia policy instead of trying to vehemently protect things that don't belong in the article in the first place.</p>
<p>I would like to know under what circumstances you would actually accept removing SLingshot paintball and Just Plain Crazy from the article - because I can't see any, and if there arn't any, one has to ask who is really causing the problem here.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that "just plain crazy" needs to be included because it's tradition. You want citations? There used to be a picture of it in the article. If you want, I'll find more listings for it, no problem. But it's hard to do proper research when you keep reverting.<br />
As for why I want to keep slingshot paintball, well, it's because I want to change it into paintball slingshot. But first removing it entirely is a step backwards. I want to modify it to include other devices for marking. However, some of those devices are directly related to topics that are part of the main article. So I simply want to approach it from the right perspective.<br />
<br />
As for wikipedia policies:<br />
<a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimplified_Ruleset_d454.html" title="Wikipedia:Simplified Ruleset">Wikipedia:Simplified_Ruleset</a><br />
When in doubt, take it into the talk page. And, uh, mutual respect? Try showing some by addressing my issues directly instead of picking one or two to clumsily bash, and ignoring the rest.<br />
<br />
<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a><br />
You've attributed some inappropriate behaviour and viewpoints to me, just because it makes it easier to argue. Including references to 'pet subjects'? My interest is in consistency and accuracy, not 'pet subjects'.<br />
<br />
<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditing_policy_7a1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Editing policy">Wikipedia:Editing_policy</a><br />
See the "policy in a nutshell"? Avoid deleting information wherever possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
So... let's see... you didn't want to take it up on the talk page like you're supposed to... you didn't assume good faith... you didn't show mutual respect... And you deleted information in dispute over and over again.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather address each point individually, rather than making it just a matter of policy. But you're the one who brought it up.<br />
So, feel like working on something that'll actually <i>stay</i>?</p>
<hr />
<p>You're assuming doubt.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I know you're new to the paintball article, but people frequently come in and fill the article up with very specific, uncommon 'house rules' that they assume are notable because they happen to be the way that particular person plays paintball at their particular field, not realizing that their variation is one of THOUSANDS of similarly obscure ways to play paintball. It has been standard practice for quite some time to keep the 'basic formats' section exactly that - the basic formats that are fairly universally common, which are capture the flag, centerflag, and elimination. When people put in their house rules, they get (appropriately) deleted. Remember that information in the article should have it's significance in article reflect it's significance in the world, and the two specific items we're fighting about here are jsut plain not significant. Something played by a few hundred or thousand people just just not significant in comparison to something played by 10 million.</p>
<p>As for deleting information, Wikipedia has change control, so information is never completely deleted. Regardless, one should avoid deleting pertinent, accurate information. Deleting things that are not paintball from a paintball article just makes sense.</p>
<p>I don't disagree that some people play 'just plain crazy' or some variation of it. HOWEVER, it's prevolence is so minute that it is properly OMITTED from the article, especially when it doesn't, as a format, really meet the definition of paintball in the first place. Paintball is a game/sport where players try to mark each other with paint. "Just Plain Crazy" is a game where people try to inflict pain on each other, and HAPPEN to be using paintballs to do so. Putting it in a paintball article is like putting 'Chicken' in an article about auto racing.</p>
<p>You also accused me of gutting the woodsball article, but I Actually just removed fctually incorrect information. One paintball marker is just as accurate as another, save velocity fluctuation. The two paragraphs about how 'woosballers strive to be more accurate' is just a reptition of an over decade-old bias-driven fight between woods and tournament paintball players, where each side claims the other is unskilled, blah, blah. Truth is EVERYBODY wants accurate, reliable, and fast-firing paintball markers (with the exception of some people who place a higher priority on the appearance of their equipment than its function.) But a paragraph that says one side likes accuracy while the other side does not is just straight bias and shouldn't be there. And it's bias that frequently creeps into the article (there is sections in the discussion page about this) and it has been, and should continue to be, standard practice to delete that bias when it emerges.</p>
<p><br />
I agree that a lot of this deserves a better rewrite, but I just dont have the time right now to do a full rewrite and it is, unfortunately, much easier to delete things that are false than write new things that are true. I've none-the-less chosen to delete things that are false, as no information is better than wrong information.</p>

<dd>I have no idea what your particular beef is, or why you're dragging yourself into this dispute on an article you've never edited, on a topic you've never edited.

<dd>If you want me to refrain from commenting further on the issue on your talk page, then I'll oblige. I wanted to mention that I was also concerned, so you wouldn't think it was just a single person. If you look in your archive (page 20, I believe), then you'll see the last specific issue I had with your conduct. It just so happens that it was so agregious and troubling, that I've been trying to keep a vague eye out for similar behaviour. (when a person creates an "aspergers" list to describe problem users, that kinda stands out. and when an admin declares that she'll vandalize pages if it means interfering with an editor, then that definitely stands out as well) That said, I really don't have anything more to contribute to the subject. Listen or ignore, I've nothing else to say. Either way, assuming nothing terrible happens, you won't have to deal with me ever again. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 04:19, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the compliment! Ah, that was a crazy night, the launch of the Wii. On that Saturday I happened to be at Target, and they were selling controllers early!

<p>I think the most recent edit I made is a fair compromise. I know Nintendo stated they aren't competing, but you and I both know that they are the only ones saying or thinking that. They may say they aren't competing, the Wii is in competion with the Xbox 360 and PS3 whether Nintendo wants that or not. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 22:37, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only way to make it seem as if you are logged in to User:Bladestorm is to do what you have been doing. However, this is misleading because it would be impossible to tell if the IP address was you, me, or anyone else.
