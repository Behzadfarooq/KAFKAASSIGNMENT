<p><i>Blade of the Immortal</i> follows the deeds of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manji_%28Blade_of_the_Immortal%29_80de.html" title="Manji (Blade of the Immortal)">Manji</a>, a skilled <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> who has a decisive advantage: no wound can kill him, except for a rare poison. In the past, his criminal actions led to the death of 100 other samurai (including his sister's husband). He becomes immortal at the hand of a 800-year-old <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nun</a> named Yaobikuni, and is compelled by the death of his sister to accept the quest that will end his agelessness. He has vowed to make amends by killing 1000 evil men, and until he does Manji will be kept alive by <i>kessen-chu</i> ('sacred bloodworms'), remarkable creatures that allow him to survive nearly any injury and reattach severed limbs even after hours of separation. They work by sacrificing themselves to seal the wound - they're worms that were bred to be as close in their chemical and physical make-up to humans as you can get without being human. They cannot handle regrowth on a large scale, but, for example, can reattach a severed limb or seal a hole in the brain.</p>
<p>Manji crosses paths with a young girl named Asano Rin and promises to help her avenge her parents, who were killed by a cadre of master swordsmen led by Anotsu Kagehisa. Anotsu killed Rin's father and his entire <a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojo.html" title="Dojo">dōjō</a>, making them a family of outcasts. Anotsu's quest is to gather other outcasts and form an extremely powerful new dojo, the <a href="../../../i/t/t/Itto-ryu.html" title="Itto-ryu">Ittō-ryū</a> (a school teaching any technique that wins, no matter how exotic or underhanded), and has started taking over and destroying other dojos.</p>
<p>In addition, another group calling itself the Mugai-ryū has emerged, in opposition to the Ittō-ryū. Its true leadership and motives are initially a mystery, but its methods (any tactics that leads to victory) resemble those of the Ittō-ryū. They try to enlist Manji's help as they seem to want the same thing. Eventually Manji joins but quickly pulls out after he finds out a member, Shira, is way too sadistic for his tastes. After a while Manji finally discovers that the Mugai-ryū work for the government. They are all death row inmates who are allowed to live only if they serve the shogunate . While Manji and Shira quickly grow to hate each other, after Shira runs off, Manji remains on friendly terms with the other members of the group.</p>
<p>In a broader context, the series covers the effects of death and the consequences of not being able to die, as well as the meanings behind living. Most of the principal characters have some sort of purpose which they inexplicably discover through the events that transpire.</p>

While not lazy, he is very laid-back, often seen sleeping. Manji also has a strange sense of "honour" that is in many ways similar to the fighting-ethic of the Itto-Ryu. The fallen <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> Manji served the <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatamoto.html" title="Hatamoto">Hatamoto</a></i> Horii Shigenobu, a local <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimy%C5%8D.html" title="Daimyō">daimyō</a>, enforcing his brutal rule (unknowingly) on the local populace until he found out his lord was corrupt and killed him. For that he was considered an outlaw and hunted down by the same daimyō clan, achieving the nickname "<i>Killer of 100</i>" after the body count. He planned to flee to his sister's house even though she had married an officer of the law, Saitō Tatsumasa. Manji ended up killing his sister's husband out of self-defense when he attacked Manji. His sister witnessed her husband's death at the hands of her brother and went insane, reverting to a child-like mindset. Manji settled down to take care of her. At some point during this time, he met Yaobikuni (her name literally means "nun of eight hundred years"), a mysterious <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nun</a>, who gave him the kessen-chu, or sacred bloodworms that make him immortal. Despite the obvious advantages of being nearly invincible, Manji dislikes being immortal. He tries to get Yaobikuni to remove the kessen-chu, finally making a deal with her. He has to kill 1000 bad men, to make up for the 100 good men he killed, if he does this Yaobikuni will rid him of his immortality. It's worth noting, one reason he doesn't like being immortal is he feels it is making his swordsmanship rusty, because he doesn't have to be as good to win. After his sister is killed (due to a revenge for his actions) he met Rin, whom he accepted to help since he felt she was very much alike to his deceased sister. Manji is constantly trying to make amends for his past actions: he kills his lord to atone for those he killed on the Damiyo's orders; looked after his sister to atone for the deaths of the one hundred cops he killed; and makes the deal to kill one thousand bad men and to look after Rin to make amends for the death of his sister. However each time Manji tries to do something "good", he tends to only make the situation worse (the death of his lord leading to the deaths of one hundred cops, for example). He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shidō (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes have no name. His double bladed sword-breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil). He first appears in <i>Criminal</i>.</li>

She has mediocre swordsmanship skills but an intense desire to avenge the brutal death of her family. At the beginning of the series is she portrayed as somebody who is trying to act mature, but is still very childish - as the series progresses she steadily "grows up" and loses much of her naivety. She hires Manji as her bodyguard in this quest. However, it's not as simple as that - Rin is constantly torn by doubt over the righteousness and validity of her mission and fears becoming a hypocrite as Anotsu claims she is more like the Ittō-ryū that she realizes because she chooses to use throwing knives instead of a sword like the "Mutenichi-ryū" teaches. She comes into contact with Anotsu at one point, but his claim that she is becoming more and more like the Ittō-ryū as she progresses down the path of revenge causes her even more doubt. In recent chapters she realized she can't defeat Anotsu. She has found Anotsu again, and is now traveling with him hoping to catch him with his guard down. Anotsu is no fool and is fully aware of what she is doing, despite this he allows her presence. She has since left his company, vowing that she will eventually kill him; yet she will stand back for the time being and watch how the events unfold. It is also worth noting that she kisses a sleeping Manji in the fourteenth volume, Last Blood, and has shown on numerous occasions her developing feelings towards him. They are as of now largely unreciprocated. She has three weapons, a Chinese sword named Kutoneshirika which she carries in a Toju (purse-like scabbard of sorts), a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tant%C5%8D.html" title="Tantō">Tantō</a> type dagger and a set of small throwing daggers named Ogunchu (Golden Wasps). Even though she is only mediocre in terms of fighting ability, Rin is still more skilled with weapons than most women of that time period and the fact that she carries a small arsenal of weapons with her makes her somewhat unique.

This emotionally cold young man has prodigious skill with the sword, and leads the Ittō-ryū in order to form a dōjō dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior lethality. Brought up by an abusive grandfather (a swordsman disgraced by the Asano dōjō), Anotsu is as pragmatic and shrewd as he is deadly. He isn't as inhuman as originally believed, as he even allows Rin to live after she attacks him; even letting her follow him everywhere. While painted as the "villain" of the series at the start, he has had many scenes devoted to making the reader sympathetic to his views and goals. Is currently at "war" with Habaki Kagimura, the leader of the Banshu. He has two weapons. The first, his main weapon, is a Nepalese-based axe named Kabutsuchi (Head Hammer). The other is his rarely used sword of the same name. It is not much of a backup weapon, as even Rin referred to it as "pathetic" in Last Blood part 4. First appears in <i>Conquest</i> part 1.</li>

Of peasant origin, he became a swordsman to avenge his sister, who was killed as a child by a samurai. Taito is one of the few swordsmen who has fought Manji and survived. He has also fought by Manji's side as well. He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> class. His lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-ren was killed by Shira. He quit the Ittō-ryū, although he is still friends with Anotsu. He ends up following Manji around due to the fact he knows Shira is after Manji. Although they argue a lot, Manji and Taito have a relatively friendly relationship. In the end Manji allows Taito to find Shira, and despite how much Shira wants to kill Manji, he lets Taito take him. Eventually Shira loses the one hand he had left to Taito and presumably falls to his death. Later concerned by something Shira said, Taito goes to meet up with Anotsu and eventually rejoins the Ittō-ryū. Taito's weapon is a gladius-like triple-sectioned sword named Grand Turk. The main blade is a gladius, the second is a smaller, shorter sword hidden in the handle, the last is a spear-head like dagger hidden within the second blade. The sword is curiously missing a sword guard. First appears in <i>Conquest</i> part 1, first named in <i>Fanatic</i> part 1.</li>

Defeats but does not kill Manji, apparently turning her back on Anotsu. Later found living alone, having bound her hand in an attempt to destroy her own skill in combat after her father's humiliating death. She reappears in recent chapters, having followed Anotsu since he left Shirakawa when she realized his body was weakening, and destroys the men under Iriya who were pursuing Anotsu. After Iriya's death, she leaves with Anotsu and Magatsu. As said by Anotsu, she is the only one that can beat him.

Doa always travels with her friend Isaku and the two have developed complementary fighting styles. This usually consists of Doa providing the offense with her speed and dagger, while Isaku provides the defense with his armored arms. Her tendency to jump right into battle with little to no provocation often lands her and Isaku in trouble. She ends up befriending Asano Rin. She and Isaku are both originally from Hokkaido, where Doa lived defending <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainu.html" title="Ainu">Ainu</a> land from samurai who attempted to take it by force, despite the fact she is not Ainu herself.</li>

Unlike most members of the Ittō-ryū, Isaku has no weapons to speak of, instead he wears various piece of armor and tends to act defensively. He is also Doa's best friend and the two always travel together. Isaku often finds himself rescuing Doa, apologizing for her and keeping her from killing others (usually by picking her up and running away). He and Doa have also developed complementary fighting styles, with Isaku acting as the defense and Doa as the offense. He ends up befriending Asano Rin. Is also Christian. He is not incredibly intelligent, but is kindhearted. Is cut in two as a result of the experiments in Habaki's compound, only to be reassembled by Doa - he now has similar regenerative abilities to Manji.</li>
<li><b>Koji Kashin</b>: A spy and doctor for the Ittō-ryū, one of the ten core members of the group. He is an elderly man with a long white beard and unknown to Habaki, Kashin has been making highly detailed maps of his castle as he performs medical services in Habaki's strong hold. These maps are later used to aid Rin and Doa as they infiltrate Habaki's castle to find and rescue Manji and Isaku.</li>
<li><b>Ozuhan</b>: A masked member of the Ittō-ryū who appears to be deaf and communicates through the use of sign language and simple sounds. He is one of the ten core members of the group. He is known as the "the guy no one wants to fight beside" because of his use of a hypnotic flute to fight. Ozuhan, himself, is immune to the effects of his instrument.</li>

Hyakurin was the wife of an abusive samurai, Hayakawa Kakōsai Genkei, who was obsessed with trying to gain fame by training Matsuhiko, their sickly son, to become a strong swordsman. She later kills her husband to avenge the death of her son by his father's hand and is then arrested and sentenced to death. Her case came to the attention of Kagimura who subsequently recruited her into Mugai-ryū. Hyakurin's most unique physical trait is her blonde hair, which she maintains by bleaching it with a strong chemical as a compulsive desire to remove bloodstains from it. While her skills with a sword are unremarkable, she has an extensive knowledge of poisons. This knowledge carries over into her choice of weaponry, a collapsible wrist mounted crossbow with poisoned bolts named Burafuma (Little Steps). The crossbow also possesses two blades such that when the weapon is collapsed, Hyakurin can use it to stab her opponents. After volume 11, Beasts, her skills are impeded after having her arm broken. She later becomes pregnant and ends up "retired" from the Mugai-ryū because a deal between Habaki and Giichi when Giichi earns his freedom. She has no desire to keep the child because she believes she will be reminded of Shinriji's death and the faces of the Ittō-ryū men who raped her. She first appears in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 1.</li>
<li><b>Shira</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">尸良</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Shira</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>: A cold-blooded killer in the Mugai-ryū. He's responsible for the death of Magatsu Taito's close friend, O-Ren. Shira's a sadistic psychopath who derives sexual pleasure in the torture and murder of his victims, particularly young women. After an attempt to ambush Anotsu goes horribly wrong and he tries to take it out on his attackers. He uses the saw-blade side of his sword to hack of some of their limbs, and then tries to rape a prostitute that was with them while cutting her up at the same time. Rin tries to stop him but is slapped away, Manji arrives and manages to take off Shira's hand before he runs off. Following this incident he cuts some flesh from his injured arm, and sharpens the bones into spikes. His hair turns stark white due to the trauma he caused himself. He develops an obsession with revenge on Manji which leads to him betraying his Mugai-ryū comrades, causing the death of Shinriji. Later, his quest for revenge against Manji leads to a battle with Magatsu Taito, who was traveling with Manji specifically so he could find Shira. This battle further cripples him with in the loss of his remaining hand. Recently he's been shown to be imprisoned in the same prison Manji is currently being held in, and has been set parametres/list as to who he shall face before being allowed to fight Manji (this list includes Magatsu). He also states that he has since lost one eye, and has a new 'weapon' of sorts. He uses a ninja-to sword, with a saw edge on one side of the blade. He usually uses the regular side to immobilize opponents by cutting off their legs, and then uses the saw-blade to cut off other parts of the body and cause maximum pain. This sword is named "Hotosogi" or woman shadow eraser. However, there is a second meaning for "Hotosogi" which also fits Shira's sadistic nature; when the kanji for woman and shadow are used together they become vagina. He first appears in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 2 and is first named in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 3.</li>
<li><b>Giichi</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">偽一</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Gīchi</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>: A highly skilled Mugai-ryū killer. Little is known about his past or reasons for being sentenced to death, though it's suggested that it might involve his sick son, Tojiro, who suddenly dies. Giichi is also one of the most skilled fighters in the series, having killed a total of 59 Ittō-ryū swordsmen on his own. Of the Mugai-ryū, he is the only member who manages to garner enough kills to earn his freedom. He works closely with Kagimura Habaki and cares for the other Mugai-ryū, attempting to buy Hyakurin's freedom as well, unsuccessfully. He disappears when Habaki dissolves the Mugai-ryū and is later found living in among the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burakumin.html" title="Burakumin">burakumin</a> by Rin and Hyakurin, where he provides Rin with information concerning Manji's whereabouts. Now a broken man, he deliberately distances himself from Hyakurin to keep her from suffering any more pain and is aware of her pregnancy - when she tries to kill her baby, he stops her and persuades to carry the child to term and allow him to raise the baby after it is born. He uses a unique weapon which resembles an oversized bladed handcuff attached to a length of chain. The weapon, Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami (Guardian of the Three Paths), was adapted from a thresher or similar farming implement, and allows him to sever or entangle limbs, necks and weapons from a distance. It is hard to block as the handcuff like action will wrap it around what it hits, but is broken by Manji in Volume 14: Last Blood. Giichi's first appearance is in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 1.</li>
<li><b>Shinriji</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">真理路</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Shinriji</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>: A bumbling Mugai-ryū swordsman. He was apparently a pickpocket and thief prior to joining the Mugai-ryū. After attending a sword school, he worked for a silk merchant. Disgruntled by his low wages, he stole money from the merchant and left. Shinriji intentionally stole 1 ryo less than 10 ryo to avoid the death penalty. Unfortunately for him, they added the money he earned legitimately to the total. He worked most closely with Hyakurin and developed a crush on her, viewing her as a surrogate mother, her blonde hair reminding him of his foreign mother. While he's not highly skilled with a sword, he does have a firm grasp of dimensions as noted by Kinuka, and is implied by Kagimura to have much potential. He first appears in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 1, and is later killed by Kinuka, but not before taking out four Ittō-ryū. As he dies, he positions himself to point south-east (archaically called <i>tatsumi</i>) in order to tell Giichi that Hyakurin has been taken to the <i>Tatsumi</i> district of Edo. As a sign of respect, Hyakurin cuts her hair and places the tied locks on his gravesite.</li>

During his time in the Ittō-ryū, he served as a page for the senior members often carrying letters and taking care of their weapons during meetings. He was a key player in the massacre which occurred during a feast meant to celebrate the official union of Ittō-ryū with Banshu, slipping poison into the Ittō-ryū's food.

Kagimura also masterminded and took part in the massacre that occurred during a feast welcoming the Ittō-ryū into the Banshu. Abayama's comments imply that he is incredibly skilled with a sword, as evidenced by his attack on Manji in Trickster, volume 15. He first appears in <i>Dark Shadows</i> part 1.</li>

<p>These refer to the English editions published by Dark Horse Comics. Blade of the Immortal can be (so far) roughly divided into four main storyarcs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Introduction: Volume 1 (<i>Blood of a Thousand</i>) ~ Volume 5 (<i>On Silent Wings, part 2</i>)</b>
<ul>
<li>In this story arc, the reader is introduced to the main characters, plot, central conflict and overall theme of the series ("documenting the human struggle"). The plot is superficially simple: Manji and Rin wander around Edo, occasionally meeting members of Ittō-ryū on their quest to find Anotsu. However, the bulk of Samura's philosophical ruminations can be found in this introductory story arc, from obsession (<i>Conquest, Genius</i>) duty (<i>Dreamsong</i>) the burden of time (<i>Cry of the Worm</i>) and revenge / redemption (<i>On Silent Wings</i>). Part of Samura's appeal is in not painting his "villains" with black-and-white strokes; even the supposed antagonist Anotsu, who espouses an "end justifies the means" philosophy, elicits sympathy from the reader via his ultimate goal - in that, fighting the widespread corruption of his era and therein fashioning a stronger Japanese society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mugai-ryū: Volume 6 (<i>Dark Shadows</i>) ~ Volume 9 (<i>The Gathering, part 2</i>)</b>
<ul>
<li>This story arc introduces the Mugai-ryū, a mysterious sword school intent on hunting down Anotsu Kagehisa. After killing several minor members of Ittō-ryū, Mugai-ryū enlists Manji and Rin to help them track down the elusive Anotsu. The evolution of Samura's style can be seen particularly in this story arc: gone are the elaborate "death murals" and the stronger focus on inking denotes a preference for 'hard' technique in contrast to 'soft' depiction (very little penciling). The first truly despicable villain is also introduced in this story arc, the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopathic.html" title="Psychopathic">psychopathic</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenary</a> Shira who delights in blood and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>. The climax of this story arc involves the separation of Manji and Rin, as Rin decides it would be better for her to hunt Anotsu alone; Manji attempts to track her across <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">province</a> borders and ends up in a vicious fight with three Ittō-ryū members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Aftermath / Last Blood: Volume 10 (<i>Secrets</i>) ~ Volume 14 (<i>Last Blood</i>)</b>
<ul>
<li>The third story arc follows the separate characters as they pursue their various goals: Anotsu to unify his sword school with the remote Shingyoto-ryū in <a href="../../../k/a/g/Kaga_Province_6965.html" title="Kaga Province">Kaga</a>&#160;; Rin on her quest to locate Anotsu; Manji's recovery from his wounds taken in the previous story arc and, eventually, his search for Rin; Magatsu's hunt for the murderous Shira; the consequences dealt upon Mugai-ryū by the vengeful Ittō-ryū members. By volume 13, <i>Mirror of the Soul</i>, the divergent threads begin to come together and the series (as a whole) reaches a climax with volume 14, <i>Last Blood</i>, wherein most of the principle characters meet and engage in some form of battle. <i>Last Blood</i> also includes the beginning sections of the next and current story arc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Prison: Volume 14 (<i>Last Blood</i>) ~ present</b>
<ul>
<li>Finished in japan in volume 20; currently at least four trade paperback volumes have been published chronicling the latest adventures of Manji and company. Volume 15, <i>Trickster</i>, was released by Dark Horse as of February, 2006. This fourth story arc concerns the events after <i>Last Blood</i>, beginning with a few apparently-random fights that, in consequence, lead Manji to join up with the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogunate.html" title="Shogunate">shogunate</a> in fighting Ittō-ryū. However, the government has a more devious plot, and imprisons Manji for issue after issue of experimentation, hoping to reproduce the effects of the kessen-chu. This story arc has concluded <i><a href="../../../a/f/t/Afternoon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Afternoon (magazine)">Afternoon</a></i>.</li>

<p>A fifth (and final) arc has begun in the Japanese run of the comic, but has yet to be translated into English.</p>

<p>A bloodworm (kessen-chu) is an unexplained little worm-like creature, which lives in the bloodstream and tissue in a non-parasitic way. It heals all wounds acquired by its host, replacing the missing tissue and organs with their own bodies as well as reattaching limbs. The only way to kill a bearer of the bloodworms is to use a bloodworm poison, although it has been implied that cutting off their head may suffice if it is not reattached quickly. During his battle with Makie, Manji said the only way to stop him would be to cut off his head. But whether this would kill him or just leave him unable to function is debatable, because in his battle with Eiku Shizuma, Manji cuts off his head after poisoning him with his own sword, and he does not die until after the kessen-satsu (blood worm killer) takes effect. Further adding to the debate were statements in Wizard magazine that Manji could survive a severed head, but it would take at least a year for the blood-worms to regenerate that much tissue. It is worth noting that, while not yet covered in the English version of Blade of the Immortal, another immortal is partially beheaded (to the point where only a flap of skin is keeping it's head attached) only for the wound to heal within a few seconds This essentially confirms that Manji's regenerative abilities would allow him to survive a beheading. The time in which it takes for regeneration varies: Manji can reattach a limb within seconds and can partially recover from a bullet or stab wound to brain. However the wounds to his head did have a negative effect (incapable of moving his lower body or weaker vision). Apparently, the kessen-chu give immortality to its host and everlasting youth (the host retaining the age he/she had at the time he/she was fed the kessen-chu). It's unknown how to infect a person with the kessen-chu, but Shizuma indicates it takes a lot more than blood to blood contact with someone who's infected. In later chapters the question how to transfer them becomes a major part of the story.</p>

<p>The weapons found in Blade of the Immortal are largely <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional.html" title="Fictional">fictional</a>, most created by Samura, who confesses he has no idea what some of them are supposed to do. Usually, major characters have unique and specialized weapons - hidden crossbows, throwing knives, poisoned blades, and even weapons meant to inflict maximum pain.</p>
<p>Manji himself carries a number of blades - Sukehiro Amatsubaki ("Rain Camellia"), Kotengu ("Little Devil"), Okorobi ("Man Toppler"), Merabi ("Lady Gadfly"), Karasu ("The Crow"), Shidō ("The Four Paths"), Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa ("Sister Defender Tatsumasa"), a spear-like weapon called Aun, and an unnamed hooked weapon.</p>
<p>Some of Samura's other creations include Giichi's <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thresher.html" title="Thresher">thresher</a>-like throwing blade, known as Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami ("Guardian of the Three Paths"), which he uses to sever the heads of his enemies, and Anotsu's large Kabutsuchi <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle-axe.html" title="Battle-axe">battle-axe</a>, which was based on an example from <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features of "Blade of the Immortal" is its beautiful, realistic artwork. Although Samura stylizes and elongates his human figures to some extent, especially early in the run of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, he has a thorough knowledge of anatomy that allows him to create uniquely expressive poses and angles. His unusual use of accurately detailed shots of hands and feet makes them almost as reflective of character and mood as his faces. Atmospheric backgrounds and landscapes round out the look of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, which incorporates many panels done in a finished, shaded pencil style rather than in inked line art. His superb drawing skills are shown to their best advantage in these penciled panels.</p>

Hiroaki Samura</div>

<p>Samura says that he always wanted to be a manga artist. However, unlike most <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangaka.html" title="Mangaka">mangaka</a>, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He says in interviews that he disliked the smell of oil paint, and openly admits to hiring another artist to help him get through a required <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_painting.html" title="Oil painting">oil painting</a> course. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050216061036/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~cmould1/bonus/qjint.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050216061036/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~cmould1/bonus/qjint.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Although he prefers to work in black and white, and does many freelance illustrations in graphite, Samura has painted some color promotional pieces and book covers in <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrylics.html" title="Acrylics">acrylics</a> for the collected volumes of Blade of the Immortal, such as the cover for 'Blade of the Immortal #111: Shortcut #5 (of 5)' <a href="http://images.darkhorse.com/covers/10/10406.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://images.darkhorse.com/covers/10/10406.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Samura never completed his art degree, because he left school before graduation to create Blade of the Immortal for <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afternoon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Afternoon (magazine)">Afternoon</a>.</p>
<p><b>Cut and Pasted Panels</b></p>
<p>To preserve the integrity of his art, Samura requested that the publisher of the licensed English translation, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Horse_Comics_d50b.html" title="Dark Horse Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>, not "flop" the manga (that is, reverse the pages as if in a mirror). At the time the English translation began its publication in individual monthly issues (1996), flopping was an almost universal practice for translated manga. Instead, Blade of the Immortal was modified for Western readers by the unusual method of cutting up the panels and rearranging them on the page in order to have the action flow from left to right.</p>
<p>Although American industry practice has now largely changed over to publishing translated manga in its original right-to-left orientation, Blade of the Immortal has retained the labor-intensive cut-and-paste method. (It is probably also the only translated manga still being published in monthly issues as well as trade paperback collections.) The publisher cautions that rearranging the panels is not foolproof, and can lead to continuity errors. Some individual panels are flopped to try to correct this, and occasionally the artwork is modified accordingly. For instance, a retouch artist may draw a scar over Manji's left eye to disguise a flopped panel. Sound effects within the panel may also be retouched out and re-lettered in English. Japanese sound effects that are an integral part of the artwork are usually left as is.</p>
