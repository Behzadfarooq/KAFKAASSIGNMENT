<p>Since Bruce's main claim to notability is his colour, isn't it curious that he is very clearly white in the portrait? I think the caption should make some mention of this. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Soo</a> 11:30, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess that depends on what your definition of "black" is. To most Americans he is definitely black. In 19th century America he might have been considered "<a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulatto.html" title="Mulatto">mulatto</a>," a very un-politically correct term today. In other cultures, he might be considered mixed or white. Almost all "black" Americans are of mixed European and African ancestry to varying degrees. Recent DNA studies suggest that American blacks are 30-40% European on average. The article does note that his father was white, so no additional clarification is necessary, I think. --<a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">D&#160;Monack</a> 20:59, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Noting "the first black" is hardly a recent phenomenon in the United States. Its been going on since the colonial era.

<dd>Early in 1961 I was eating a bowl of cereal and watching television when the newscaster (anchorman) said that President Kennedy had mentioned "Blacks." That was the first time that I ever heard Negroes being called "Blacks." Prior to 1960, the term "colored" suited the aims of the Americans, so they said either "<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colored.html" title="Colored">colored</a>" or "<a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro.html" title="Negro">Negro</a>." I had passed my 21st birthday by 1960, yet I had never heard anything resembling the phrase "the first black" before 1960. A news reporter named Mal Good was the first <b>Negro</b> to hold a microphone on television, but he was not called "the first black." He was a brown-skinned colored man.</dd>

<dd>How is it "re-writing" history? It's merely adding to our understanding of history. To most of those "firsts" you mentioned I would say "Who cares?" Nevertheless, if they are true, those facts should be mentioned in the relevant articles. <i>Black</i>, <i>colored</i>, or <i>Negro</i>, whatever the term, Blanche Bruce was, in fact, the first one in the Senate.

<dd>Numerous terms were employed long ago. <i>Slave</i> was probably the commonest term. The closest term to "black" was probably <i>Guinea negro</i> because he had no white or other qualities. <i>Cuffy</i> was a term. There are many pages on the Internet which speak of "the first black" while ignoring the former terms. I believe that people are re-writing the history of the United States.</dd>

<dd><i>Slave</i> was never synonymous with <i>black</i> or <i>Negro</i>. Even in the bad old days people made the distinction between slaves and "free Negroes". The shock you felt when your heard someone called "Black" in 1963 is probably then same as the shock I'd feel if I saw someone described as "Negro" in Wikipedia. Similarly, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Keller_8c40.html" title="Helen Keller">Helen Keller</a> is not described as "blind, deaf and dumb", which is how she was described while alive, because the language has changed. We use modern English in this encyclopedia. <i>Black</i> is not the same as <i>Guinea negro</i> as you describe it because almost all black Americans have some white ancestors. The difference between them and Blanche Bruce is a matter of degree. In America, for better or worse, people are not black based on their skin tone but based on their ancestry. Some black people are so light skinned that they can "pass" for white, but they're still considered black by most Americans. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg_0a8c.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg/30px-Flag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg.png" alt="" width="30" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg_0a8c.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">D.M.</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/_/m/User_talk%7ED_Monack_f4c7.html" title="User talk:D Monack">(<i>talk</i>)</a></sup> 20:37, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally agree that "black" is a poor descriptive term for human beings, but then, so is "white". Humans come in many colors but black and white are definitely not among them. (Brown and pale pink, however, are. &#160;:) The reason why "Negro" and "colored" passed out of usage owes more to their history of use by those who oppressed and mistreated them; they provide an uncomfortable reminder. Therefore it seems that many today prefer the term "African-American", which of course does not apply to everyone who was once called "black" because of course not all "blacks" necessarily are of African stock... The issue is so complex that I try very hard to stay neutral. Let them be called whatever they want to be called, and why get so worked up about it? -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 12:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
