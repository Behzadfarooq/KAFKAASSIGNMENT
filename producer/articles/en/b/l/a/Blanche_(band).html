<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blanche_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
<p>The origins of Blanche can be traced back to the early 90's band <a href="http://www.gooberandthepeas.net" class="external text" title="http://www.gooberandthepeas.net" rel="nofollow">Goober &amp; The Peas</a>. Led by Dan "Goober" Miller, the Peas were devoted to an alternative rock-oriented brand of honkytonk country music (labeled by many observers as "cowpunk"), and dressed in honkytonk attire.</p>
<p>After the break-up of Goober &amp; The Peas, Miller next formed <a href="http://www.grunnenrocks.nl/index.html?bands/0/2startabernacle.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.grunnenrocks.nl/index.html?bands/0/2startabernacle.htm" rel="nofollow">2 Star Tabernacle</a>. Miller co-led that band with <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_White_%28musician%29_81b4.html" title="Jack White (musician)">Jack White</a> (who had previously been a drummer for Goober &amp; The Peas). After issuing one .45 record with <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Williams_f8fb.html" title="Andre Williams">Andre Williams</a>, the band split. White focused on his other project, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>, and Miller formed Blanche with his wife and 2 Star Tabernacle bassist, Tracee Mae.</p>
<p>According to Dan Miller, Blanche was formed after he, Tracee Mae, Feeny, Patch Boyle and Jaybird committed to learning new instruments and to play a variation on American roots music.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blanche_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Discography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
<p>The first Blanche release came in 2003 in the form of a 6-song CD titled "Demo EP". The featured tracks are "Intro", "Do You Trust Me?", "Garbage Picker", "Another Lost Summer", "Superstition", "Someday", "So Long Cruel World" and an "Outro". The CD also features a video of "Do You Trust Me?" directed by <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carrico_fb4f.html" title="Kevin Carrico">Kevin Carrico</a>.</p>
<p>This recording was soon followed by an EP released in 2004 titled <i>America's Newest Hitmakers</i>, on Loose Records, and the demo "Never Again", which appeared on the 14th compilation CD for the publication <i>Comes With A Smile</i>. The band's first full length album, <i>If We Can't Trust the Doctors</i>, was initially released on Cass Records that same year, but was picked up for wider release by <a href="../../../v/2/_/V2.html" title="V2">V2</a> records soon after. The initial line-up also released a single on Cass Records with "Who's To Say" on the A-Side and "Superstition" on the B-side. The single was released on green and black vinyl. Blanche's official releases in Europe have been on the Loose music record label.</p>
<p>Blanche released an EP on V2, <i>What This Town Needs</i>, featuring five tracks and a video, on October 24, 2006 in the U.S. It was released in Europe on Loose on December 4, 2006. The EP title track appeared on a V2 records sampler CD in September 2006. A second full-length album, <i>Little Amber Bottles</i>, was to be released in early 2007 but the demise of V2 Records as a current label put the US release date into question.</p>

<li>Those involved in the production of the <i>Someday...</i> video report that not only did Tracee Mae hold her breath for the entire last shot (no camera or editing tricks were used), but that the entire length of time she spent underwater is not fully used in the video.</li>
