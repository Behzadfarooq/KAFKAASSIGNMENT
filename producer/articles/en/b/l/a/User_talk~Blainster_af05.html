<p>Blainster:</p>
<p>(I am so new to Wiki that I am not sure this will reach you. Please let me know if it does.)</p>
<p>The concerns of the public and of our regulatory agencies with what comes out of the flue gas stacks from power plants (or any other large combustion furnaces) have increased ten-fold or more during the twenty years since you worked in a power plant. A great many people have the mistaken idea that coal burning creates a great deal more total flue gas than a "cleaner" fuel like natural gas. As shown in my table, coal burning does create more flue gas, but only marginally so. I did not want to dwell on that in the text of my contribution lest I sound biased in favor of coal burning ... which I am not. I wanted the table to show the facts and to speak for itself.</p>
<p>Deleting the table and only leaving the comparative scf/106 of flue gas for each of the fuels pretty well "guts" my contribution because:</p>
<p>The credibility of my calculated results depends upon readers being able to see the compositions that I used for each fuel and to ascertain that they are typical ... not selected to bias the results. With those compositions, readers could actually perform their own calculations to check my results if they wanted to do so. Without the compositions, they could could not make independent checks.</p>
<p>The credibility of my results also depends upon the readers being able to see what percentage of excess combustion air I used ... again to ascertain that I did indeed use typical values. And those excess combustion air values are also needed to permit independent checks of my results.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of my table concerns how to convert the results into units used by some 99% of the world (the USA is the only nation still using scf and Btu's rather than metric units). Believe it or not, the vast majority of people on the planet don't know or care how many inches there are in a foot.</p>
<p>All steam tables contain the same data because water has a fixed set of physical and thermodynamic properties. There are literally thousands of different composition natural gases, fuel oils and coals, all with different heating values, carbon-to-hydrogen ratios, and different physical properties. That is another reason why the readers should have my table to look at rather than just the final results.</p>
<p>As for my table being a graphic image that is not editable, I would point out that photographs are also not editable. I don't see where that is relevant. I created that image some time ago so that I could use it on a number of Internet forums without having to cope with the plethora of markup languages in use (HTML, BB code, PHP code, Wiki markup, etc).</p>
<p>As for your finding the color "obtrusive", one person's "obtrusive" may be another person's "favorite color". Does the Wikipedia have a "color" standard somewhere that I haven't yet found? Or do the Wiki editors have some "color police" looking for inappropriate colors?</p>

<dd>I don't see the need to discuss what is now hypothetical, because the issue is not straightforward, but I will correct the number of persons involved to what is posted on the web site reporting the study, and delete the editorial commentary in the article. You can take it from there. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 08:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The need is to understand the WP policies. The case where there is no reputable publisher for a study that is part of a TV show or a movie, etc. seems to be a very typical situation, even if it is not the current situation. The situation is very clear. We have an experiment that is made public through some media, but there is no reputable publisher. Question: Can we say something scientific about this experiment? It seems to me that the answer is NO. Otherwise, it would mean that we break a rule, which is necessary to guarantee some minimal quality, only because the experiment was highly publicised. Perhaps we can mention the experiment, but only if we can find something that is well supported, but yet not scientific, that is interesting to say about this experiment. If it was only publicised for its scientific content and there nothing else to say about it, then the whole thing should be ignored. I want to know if you agree, and if not how do you justify it in terms of the policies. --<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumiere</a> 08:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was also tempted to remove the apparent nonsense, but on second thoughts I thought it was an attempt at a genuine question, just in very very mangled English. I couldn't make it out however - so my response, though admittedly flippant, was meant to suggest that if it could be rephrased a sensible answer might be forthcoming.

<p>Blainster, thanks for your note about having found a way to create somewhat smaller font characters using the Wikipedia math markup. Although, they still are not as neat and compact as the WikiCities math markup produces, they are an improvement. I have a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you manage to get smaller characters under the square root sign?</li>
<li>Now that you have seen my text-based table of flue gas emissions and the explanatory lead-in discussion to the table, do you think it would now fit in with the article on fossil fuel power plants?</li>
<li>Is there a better way of replying to a message received in one's User Talk page other than going to the responder's User Talk page to post a reply? In other words, can I reply on my own User Talk page to your message received on my User Talk page ... and somehow automatically alert you to my reply?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just for your information, I posted my suggestion to Bugzilla about making the WikiCities math markup available as an option on Wikipedia. They have accepted it for consideration and it is Bug #4915.<br />

<dd>Just some comments that might clear up some confusion:
<ul>
<li>The writeup on how to use TeX markup is the same at WikiCities as at Wikipedia because they both use TeX.</li>
<li>Note that the developers at Bugzilla named my suggested bug as "Use Wikicities' TeX fonts for rendering math on Wikimedia projects". That indicates to me that the fonts used at WikiCities are smaller than the fonts used at Wikipedia even though they both use the same markup methodology.</li>
<li>I did a search here on Wikipedia for TeX and for LaTex and found articles for both of them. If you read those, it becomes obvious that there are literally dozens of versions and implementations of Tex. It is my guess that WikiCities just has a version that uses a smaller font.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could play the laywer and point out that this is a personal userpage and not an article, but you are right and I will provide the proper links in due time. Notice that some quotes are famous because some important persons REPEATED them, and not because that person invented them. Strangely, I allways heard the quote: "There are only two things who are infinte..." as being of Einstein, but wikiqute does not place them at his page. But if you search for "universe" his name and the quote appears. Cheers <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 20:09, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have found it! It is (buried among many others) in his page in WikiQuote: "Only two things are infinite, the universe and the stupidity of mankind, and I'm not sure about the former." Its a bit diffrent from the one I had, but I corrected the quote in my userpage. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 20:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Man, I confused Wikicommons with Wikiquote (what a mess, but I corrected the messages above) well to clarefy it once for it all: all his quotes (and this one, you have to look for it, but is there) are in Wikiquote. Sorry for the mixup. As for the quote: "I am become death the destroyer of worlds." it is from ancient hindu text, but it was popularized by Oppenheimer. It also is in wikiquote. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 20:53, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you are going to add these navigation boxes to many articles, you might take some care in placing them so they don't affect the page formatting and run into the text. Part of a good encyclopedia is good page design. Some articles have pictures, content boxes, and other illustrations arranged carefully so that they complement the article. You placed boxes in Compact Cassette and Phonograph in an apparent haphazard or hasty fashion. Please be more careful, or the additions will spark negative reactions before it can be determined whether they are useful or not. --Blainster 04:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC) Retrieved from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lindosland" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lindosland" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lindosland</a>"</p>

<dd>I was not actually so hasty, and did experiment a bit on these pages realising that the images already there were causing an untidy result. Your changes are probably an improvement, and I'm grateful for any help, but of course the final appearance does depend on the page width you view with. It also seems to me that there may be problems with Wikipedia in the control we have over image placement, for example right-justified images don't seem to come in line with right justified text boxes. In general I like to put the navigational template first on the page, with the vague idea that this might make it easier to find by an automated system or software bot, but this is probably not necessary. Do you think the system helps on these audio pages or do you dislike it? In searching around I found that like many big topics <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_reproduction.html" title="Sound reproduction">Sound reproduction</a> has many pages that are not easily found, and then on finding <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_recording.html" title="Sound recording">Sound recording</a> I wondered whether the two should be combined, as many items of equipment are used for recording and reproduction. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindosland_587d.html" title="User:Lindosland">Lindosland</a> 11:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Following Lindos reply on my page— fair enough. On pages with no image at the top, I think your navbox works pretty well. When there is an image there, placement requires more judgement, and individuals opinions will vary as to what is best. I have noticed that the Contents box self-adjusts its width, and it can be a good place to put the navbox, at least for screen sizes of 800x600 to 1024x786, which should cover typical screens today except for hand-held displays. The question which will remain is, how do we deal with a proliferation of navigation methods (categories, portals, various navbox templates, "See also" lists, etc.) I guess we will just have to keep experimenting, and probably several methods will coexist. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 19:27, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree about careful placement and have today placed several navboxes alongside the contents box just as you suggest, being a little more careful after your prompt! How to deal with a proliferation of methods - replace them with the Rootpage concept! I dislike big navigational boxes/series templates as they clutter the page and are too confusing to be of help. My scheme, with its nested listing, seems much neater and more effective, and now recruits the idea of the navbox and takes it further while attempting to encourage coordinated editing.

<p>This is an equation created with Wikipedia's TeX font for math markup:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/3/2/f323a96df960f68ce3639fed81e510c2.png" alt="Q\;=\;C\;A\;P\;\sqrt{\bigg(\frac{\;\,g_c\;k\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{2}{k+1}\bigg)^{(k+1)/(k-1)}}" /></p>
<p>This is the same equation created using WikiCities' TeX font for the very same math markup:</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/o/Image%7EChokedFlowCAPUS.png_77b6.html" class="image" title="Image:ChokedFlowCAPUS.png"><img src="../../../upload/f/fd/ChokedFlowCAPUS.png" alt="Image:ChokedFlowCAPUS.png" width="306" height="56" longdesc="../../../c/h/o/Image%7EChokedFlowCAPUS.png_77b6.html" /></a></p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the WikCities TeX font is smaller than the Wikipedia's TeX font. In my opinion, the WikiCities font is also much neater and tidier. What I mean by neater and tidier is that it is much closer to the size of the regular text so that the overall look of an article that uses equations is more balanced.</p>
<p>Also, the smaller TeX font allows for displaying longer equations (within the limited display screen width) than does the Wikipedia font.</p>
<p>I submitted a request to Bugzilla about a month ago asking that Wikipedia make available the smaller WikiCities font as an alternate option ... not to replace the font now used by Wikipedia, but only to offer the smaller WikiCities font as an optional choice to Wikipedians. My request was assigned the bug number 4915. Anyone can vote in favor of proceeding with the bug request at <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4915" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4915" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla Bug 4915</a> and thus far I am the only one who has voted to proceed.</p>
<p>If you agree with me that the smaller font should be offered as an alternate, please visit the bugzilla page at <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4915" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4915" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla Bug 4915</a> and scroll down to the page bottom where is says "Vote for this bug" and do so. If you are not already registered with bugzilla, it will ask you to do that first ... but it only takes a minute to do so.</p>
<p>If it isn't correct for me to lobby you for the smaller font, please let me know. Thanks and please vote.<br />

<p>Hi&#160;:) In reference to the thumbnail of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Cassette_628e.html" title="Compact Cassette">Compact Cassette</a> on the article of that name, your edit summary says you've put it back to being large (300px) so that it's close to actual size. I've no wish to get into an edit war, so I've not made it smaller again, but I do think it wrecks the page for people with lower screen resolutions, by consuming potentially half of the available content space. (Some people still use 640x480!) This lack of accessibility is a shame. I'd see your point though, <i><b>if</b></i> it were possible to make things look actual size; that might be useful. But it's not what you've done here by specifying a number of pixels. The tape looks about half actual size on my widescreen laptop, for example, because it has very small pixels. If it looks actual size to you, that's a factor of your monitor. I'd suggest taking a new photo of a tape alongside a ruler or reference object. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 00:48, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mmx1 is taking the fight that I have over the F-14 and F-111 to the failure page, and he has nominated them for deletion. The wiki-thugs are all voting to delete the page. Mmx1 has reversed the F-14 page to state that it is not, and has never been designed as a maneuverable air superiority fighter, and is not accepting any contrary citations up to and including a F-14 test pilot, Janes Defence, and Aviation Week. He is apparently taking revenge against other pages. Please go to the deletion page and tell the administrators what is going on. Look at the patterns of MMx. He regular accuses others of gross misinformation and summarily reverts most edits as a self-appointed judge of all truth, but in fact should not be allowed this leeway. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 10:57, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The synonym makes perfect sense. The devil is considered to be the king of all demons. Red is a biblical color used of in reference to the devil and hell in general. So, King crimson is referring to the devil. Beelzebub is simply another name for the devil. The words mean the same, and therefore, they are synonymous.--24.72.197.148 01:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, Blainster, you removed my comments on the intention of homosexuals to legitimize their behavior by insinuating that famous people are gay. Do you think that such comments have no importance? If so, how important are the comments that you don't delete, such as the anonymous "I heard of him being gay. Is that true?"? Was that comment worthy of retention? Yes, it seems that such a comment is allowed to stay, but my comment on intentionality and purposiveness is deleted. What if there was an article on User:Blainster and someone wrote, "I heard of him being a shoplifter. Is that true?" Would you retain that one?<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 23:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<p>Hello, Blainster. Sorry we are not getting off on the right foot about Open Theism. I still don't follow why the 'Con' section is little but 'Pro' rebuttals in content and rather weak. I still don't get why every edit made has to be substantiated with a cited reference when there is little in the way of such referencing in the entire Open Theism Topic Page written and edited by who knows who, which is so biased against Settled Theism as to make a mockery of the concept of neutral objectivity. The article as it has stood and now stands, without even modest amendment, not only does injustice to Open Theism as a robust alternative, but gives even less credence to the Settled Theism position. I have personally read and researched most of the books in both 'Pro' and 'Con' sections, yet only find 'Pro' edits acceptable but not 'Con'. Help me out here so I know how best to proceed in fairness to you, the site and potential readers. Much thanks, Theo. 17:49, September 7, 2006 User:70.59.198.127</p>

<p>Yes, 99% of people you ask on the street will say "Jimmy Carter" and not "James Earl Carter". How do you determine what's best for historical people that have no name recognition? I follow what is in other encyclopedia entries such as Britannica and the Columbia encyclopedia, and whats in "who's who". Also for Jimmy Carter, the full name is a redirect to let people know that the full name is recognized and doing that blocks people from moving the entry.

<p>I have added comments to the Talk Page about fossil fuel power plants. I was wondering why trouble is taken in converting steam into water after the steam turbine, only to be turned right back into steam again later in the furnace. You could just send the steam from the steam turbine straight back into the furnace. I thought you may be able to educate me as to why this is not done. *Just thought* Is it because the vacuum created by the condensing water helps drive the turbines faster?--JB001 14:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. About six months ago I penned this article, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Springs_Massacre_6692.html" title="Rock Springs Massacre">Rock Springs Massacre</a>, which I have been working hard to cleanup and reference and de-POVify, now being, of course, a much more experienced Wikipedian (I think I wrote that about two weeks after registering). I remembered you giving some helpful tips and edits in the past so I thought I would contact you. Anyway, its up for <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Rock_Springs_Massacre_20c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Rock Springs Massacre">peer review</a>, and as I said I have been working to improve it, any input or edits you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Was Tillich so much a 'Lutheran', or in actuallity from the German Evangelical tradition (the union of German Lutheran and German Reformed churches in Germany)? My understanding was that he was brought to America connected with the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_Synod_of_North_America_f542.html" title="Evangelical Synod of North America">Evangelical Synod of North America</a> (the same denomination of the Niebuhr brothers), which subsequently became part of the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_and_Reformed_Church_bcd5.html" title="Evangelical and Reformed Church">Evangelical and Reformed Church</a>, and then finally part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Christ_7fcb.html" title="United Church of Christ">United Church of Christ</a>. Also, I suspect one could probably make the case that Tillich's influence was probably greater on moderate-to-liberal Reformed type folks (the United Church of Christ, moderate-to-liberal Presbyterians, etc.) than it has been on Lutherans. I will confess that I don't have much at hand in the way of sources/citations for any of this at the moment. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmerymat_b135.html" title="User:Emerymat">Emerymat</a> 15:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
