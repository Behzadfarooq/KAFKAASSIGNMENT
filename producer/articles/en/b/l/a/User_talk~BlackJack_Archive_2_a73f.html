<p>I'm more likely to contribute to the soccer and cricket projects than to philately but I'll see what I can do besides reading all the articles. I'm just a collector of British stamps really. Thanks anyway for taking trouble to say hello.</p>
<p>Your compendium is impressive. I'm glad to see that you are going to add images, which it needs. You're being very ambitious hoping to have so many main articles but if you're going to do the job you've got to aim to do it right. Keep up the good work. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertMW_cc0d.html" title="User:AlbertMW">AlbertMW</a> 06:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's hope this approach will work. If we keep it simple enough then all should be good. Regarding the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postage_stamps_of_Ireland_eeda.html" title="Postage stamps of Ireland">Postage stamps of Ireland</a>, it took me about 3 months to do and now that I moved house I have few of my philatelic books available right now to work on the Postal history of Ireland. However, Stan thought it was good enough for a featured article but I still feel there is a small amount of work to do and besides which I would not nominate what is essentially all my own work. I do own a book called <i>World Stamp Atlas</i> that would be great for initially writing up many of the country related articles as it has dates, etc. Cheers. <a href="../../../w/w/2/User%7EWw2censor_e512.html" title="User:Ww2censor">ww2censor</a> 04:29, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem was not the philately section but all the disconnected ends which removal of its material left in the article - references to pictures which were no longer there and so on. The stamps had been used to illustrate points about Aden's development so had become integrated into the text. Now the story of the stamps and their use can be developed freely.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I went through Category:Philately by country and removed all articles who's subject is unrelated to philately. Note that most of the remaining articles doesn't belong to this category either because the name of the category implies that it should include articles like Philately in Albania to Philately in Zimbabve. Most of articles that are now in Category:Philately by country belongs to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilately_71c6.html" title="Category:Philately">Category:Philately</a> or to some new sub-category that you could create.</p>

<li>I knew it was you, well I guessed, because of your comments at the CfD. I am not wedded to the higher level categorisation. I thought memorable moments in sport was a useful category for it. Anybody wants to get me stirred up, mention Greg Chappell - I can still remember the whole thing vividly and feeling so ashamed to be Australian. My interest in cricket declined enormously after that incident. I basically don't watch it any more. If I want to illustrate that my fellow countrymen are bad sports, that incident exemplifies it. It was appalling. Sorry for the rant, I feel passionate about it. I don't mind t being categorised into NZ and Aust history, though I wonder if it didn't help to define the game internationally because <i>As a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as not within the spirit of the game.</i> But I don't feel that passionate about it and I leave it to the wikipedia cricket community&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 21:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Poor Trevor was supposed to be the better cricketer and was certainly trained up to be so, but there is obviously more to cricket that talent for batting and bowling! As a child I actually saw all 3 play together at the Adelaide Oval - probably Sheffield Shield, I believe it didn't happen very often and I think I remember that comment being made at the time.</li>

<p>Jack, I hope you won't mind but given your suggestion on project talk page that we should use the history by country articles to be going forward, I noticed a couple of the sub-cats that have useful info for articles in them so I created a couple of new articles to suit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">CfD process</span></h2>
<p>I understand your concerns, but I really don't think your suggestion is going to help anything. You are, in effect, taking away the voices of people who have chosen not to participate in the project - yes, they can make their arguments, but in the end they will feel like they're not being heard since they're not counted in the final vote. It seems elitist, and goes against the idea of <i>everyone can edit</i>, which Wikipedia is built on - which is why you won't get much support for it even though it may work out better than the current system.</p>
<p>The odd thing with the category system is that it takes very little effort to create multiple subcategories and make a total mess of the whole system, but to properly organise it you need to go through a morass of bureaucracy - and if you do attempt to structure it, people may not immediately see your point of view because they haven't been using those particular categories and realising how useless they are. I do think something needs to be done to address that, but to give project members some special power on organising is not the way to go about it.</p>

<dd>Thanks for your replies. Larry McCray of Protoball is equally pleased with references to ACS members research such as "In the Mists of Time". Regarding North American cricket, I will order the Philadelphia volume from ACS. Regarding Early Cricket History, since last week I am in touch with Andrew H and Ian M by email. If you are formally working on that project, maybe AH sent my email letter to you as he did to IM, whose focus is the log of 1700s matches, entirely an English matter. (Briefly, based in Boston myself, I expect to poke around in primary, secondary, and tertiary resources during the next year, learning more about baseball and clubs, noting and passing on any tidbits that pertain to cricket per se, all this 1850s-1870s in North America.)</dd>

<dd>Jack, Wikipedia can be addictive, and addiction to the Talk pages lacks one redeeming quality of addiction to writing or editing articles. Is User talk worse?</dd>
<dd>Let me pass on our research and writing interests away from Wikipedia. I will look at <a href="../../../1/8/t/Category%7E18th_century_in_sports.html" title="Category:18th century in sports">Category:18th century in sports</a> and 19th century. When I arrived, I got lost in categories and in pages about categories&#160;:-(</dd>
<dd>On general sports history before WWI, my thought is that you should try contributing more on that period to the existing articles. There may be resistance and it may be ungainly, same as if you write 500 words on old Sussex County teams into the Sussex CCC article. Both intellectually and organizationally(working it out at Wikipedia), sports history before WWI may be Old County Teams cricket write large. If you try a WikiProject I will join it but I will not be a heavy lifter this year. Note, I don't have enough experience to know whether WPs work; cricket is encouraging, sports and baseball are discouraging. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 18:31, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category: 18th century in sports</span></h2>
<p>I see the point. Of course, the subcategory for cricket has exceptional integrity because you practically control it as the author of almost all the articles. Otherwise it would be tempting to mimic a Category on a page in your User section: personally endorsed articles. By the way, I visited Richard Newland and tried "the famous match" but that link is broken now.</p>
<p>On periodization, I suspect you may feel secure in 1697-1815 for "18th century" cricket in England, although 1815 is generally in the 19th century. By the way, many social/dining/smoking Clubs were established in 1814, says Paul de Serville.</p>
<p><a name="19th_century"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h2>
<p>Your "19th century" cricket is 1816-1918. For various purposes other historians have focused on the time between the wars, commonly dated 1815-1914, and called it the 19th century or even the (long?) Victorian era. Of course historians don't generally need to work strictly with time periods, certainly not to the point of allocating whole years, where for sports history it is necessary to allocate playing seasons wholly to one period or another. (By the way, you mentioned pre-WWI to me privately and your own "19th century" table does not have even red links for 1915-16-17-18.) (For Americans there was no war 1914-1916 except the Federal League War in baseball. But the war wasn't big enough to make 1918, 17, or 16 an appealing end date to a period. In baseball 1920 or 1921 (better but less traditional) traditionally begins a new era, because of baseball events unrelated to world ones.) --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 19:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On your pre-WWI idea in general, looking over the 18th century cricket shows why it must be attractive to get going early, laying the groundwork before there are many articles (before ACS colleagues arrive, for example). But it also shows how much work you have to do on cricket alone. Considering that there are so many stakes already in the ground for pre-WWI sports, I think you should madly write cricket articles (and Wikiproject Cricket stuff) until the end of the year. Re a matter that I passed over last hour, research and writing away from Wikipedia: I suspect that you must do a vast amount of original research to complete these pages and I am awed by the past work of cricket historians if it isn't true! --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 19:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No change to most of that but I see that there may be numerous quasi-articles that would deal with the same issues across sports and regions. For a leading example, "firsts" articles: first professional team, first professional player, first compensated player, first commercial event, first commercial venue, first refereed event, first career referee, first championship, first newspaper coverage, first league, and so on.</dd>
<dd>'Quasi-articles' because as Wikipedia articles for fans to read these might be worse than nothing, each a potpourri trying to cover multiple sports and multiple regions, maybe wallowing in trivia. But the conceptual clarification and methodological education in writing them with a group of people who know different sports and regions would be immense. Since they shouldn't be articles, they should be pages in someone's Wikiproject&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>But it's a fantasy, eh? It works if two dozen thoughtful folks come together, knowledgeable about sports history with expertise scattered across the field. --<a href="../../../p/6/4/User%7EP64_9db0.html" title="User:P64">P64</a> 01:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I just spotted this discussion. Evans is definitely the cricketer second from right, and I'd estimate the picture in the mid to late 1960s, because by about 1970 Evans had grown substantial mutton-chop sideburns (it looks like he's started growing them in this picture, but they're not at their full luxuriance yet). Also the other people in the photo look 1960s rather than anything much later. Surely the cricketer on the right is Jim Laker and I don't think the interviewer is Peter West, who I remember having very smooth, unruffle-able, Brylcreemed hair. I think it looks like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Bough_d6e2.html" title="Frank Bough">Frank Bough</a>. Is the chap being interviewed Doug Wright? Or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Ridgway_f8aa.html" title="Fred Ridgway">Fred Ridgway</a>? I don't have a picture of Ridgway and the only one I can find of Wright looks a bit like this one, but only a bit. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 11:41, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I found a picture of Ridgway, and it definitely isn't him! Wright is likely, as he's wearing a Kent sweater, and your thought that it might be an International Cavaliers game is a good one, because I remember they were televised on BBC2 in the late 1960s before the advent of the Sunday League. Evans and Laker certainly played for them. So did Bert Sutcliffe of New Zealand, who looked a bit like our mystery chap, but I can't think why Sutcliffe would wear a Kent sweater. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 14:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It suddenly looks the obvious explanation when the 1960s is mentioned. It says <a href="../../../c/a/n/Image%7ECanterbury001-02.jpg_9395.html" title="Image:Canterbury001-02.jpg">in the image</a> that it was taken in 1991.

It's about whether it's permissible to change an article from an accepted format because of stylistic preferences. Even if you dislike the "W. G. Grace" style, you must admit that other editors take exactly the opposite view. In that situation, long-standing Wikipedia rulings forbid changing the article to one's personal preference, because it leads to edit wars.</p>

<p>It is not what anyone has said. I have had reservations about the value of the "cricket project" for a long time and these can be summed up by pointing out its failure (apart from a few individuals) to address cricket's heritage and history; and the failure to perform valuable and useful research. Regurgitating stuff from current media about the last couple of seasons is not useful to researchers or general readers who are using Wikipedia to try and find out more about cricket than what they can read in today's paper or what they saw on TV last weekend. The sport did not begin with Botham.</p>
<p>My objective is to use Wikipedia as an accessible storage medium for information that has effectively been "lost" given that it exists in old newspapers, rare books and dusty archives which are all but inaccessible to the man in the street. Cricket is one sport that lends itself to such a pursuit admirably because of its age, history, culture and its stock of archives. I am not here to write about alleged "celebrities"; or to tell the world about Richie Benaud the commentator whilst failing to mention what a great player he was; or to dredge up recent and largely irrelevant drivel about Cronje; or to write volumes of useless contemporary material that is readily available on more relevant sites that are focused on current or recent events.</p>
<p>If the "cricket project" wanted to do something worthwhile, instead of wasting acres of space with coverage of the 2005 season and thus duplicating the contemporary media, why didn't they perform some real research among genuine archives and provide a category about, say, the 1905 season in which there was also an Ashes series?</p>
<p>From now on, as I wrote above, I will be concentrating on the historical aspects of sport, cricket in particular, and I will be looking to form a dedicated sports history project with membership open to all genuine historians. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 06:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hear what you say - and that is why you are such a valuable (and valued) contributor. I suspect that more of our readers want to read about in the 2005 Ashes series than the series in 1905, but I agree that our coverage is heavily skewed to recent events, and it would be nice to have a better historical context. Sad to say, many of us don't have access to the rare books and dusty archives, which is why we rely on the websites to such an extent, and why we need contributors with those resources to help us where they can. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 09:31, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are both right. I should have left that in: my mistake. Someone brought champagne onto the field at Taunton even though Hobbs was a very modest drinker. There has been some controversy about WG's total because some in the ACS think two of them were scored in minor matches (but the same is said of two by Hobbs as well, though they were in 1931).

I didn't expect the title to stay for very long but I think they could at least have discussed it first. Never mind. I agree with you some people in that project are out of order.</dd>
<dd>It's fine pointing out a Wikipedia policy and doing so as an individual editor but coming along and reckoning to have some clout because of a project consensus is just false pretences.

<p>I'm puzzled as to why you have moved Surrey's B&amp;H wins to go under "Other Honours". If even the Twenty-Twenty competition wins go in the main list of honours, then I can't see why the B&amp;H shouldn't do so as well. Also (and I see that you have done this for other counties as well) you have renamed their NatWest Trophy wins as C &amp; G Trophy wins. It seems to me that doing so is seriously misleading. I know that they are effectively the same competition, but I don't see how you can use a name that didn't yet exist. How about restoring the name NatWest Trophy, but adding a footnote "Subsequently renamed the C&amp;G Trophy"? Or even putting "NatWest Trophy/C&amp;G Trophy"? (With "Gillette Cup" as well perhaps.( <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 17:04, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message.</p>
<p><i>Re the B&amp;H, I'm open to offers. Now that you've seen my rationale, if you still think it should go back in the main section I'll move it as I'm not bothered. It's just that I think, long-term, people will eventually relegate it as it is obsolete.</i></p>
<p>I think that, as a major competition for over thirty years, it belongs in the main Honours section. It's not like some short-lived trophy that only a subset of teams competed for, such as the Tilcon Trophy. Putting it in the Other Honours section would lead people to assume that it was in some way inferior to the other competitions, which during its existence wasn't the case. In a sense, the pre-1890 Championship could be considered "obsolete", but those titles - quite rightly, in my view - are included in the main honours section.</p>
<p><i>I'm happy to have a forum about all this on the WikiProject page but it's one of those things that needs doing first so people can look at it and then decide.</i></p>
<p>Discussing it on the Wikiproject page would probably be a good idea. As for the name to use for the Knock-out Cup (except that this season they removed most of the KO element!), would putting "Gillette Cup/NatWest Trophy/C&amp;G Trophy" in the honours list be too unwieldy?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">W. G. Grace &amp; F. R. Spofforth</span></h2>
<p>Hi, BlackJack.</p>
<p>In a Usenet discussion (see below), we've been delving deeply into the infamous run-out of Sammy Jones by W. G. Grace in the 1882 Oval Test Match. This, of course, is believed to have been the event that inspired Fred Spofforth to take his seven for 44 (to add to his first-innings seven for 46) in the England second innings, bowling them out for 77 and winning the match for Australia by seven wickets. I brought up the question of the relationship between Spofforth and Grace, and also that of Grace and the umpire who gave Jones out, namely Bob Thoms. John Hall told me that, although he couldn't really help, he knew that you seemed to be quite knowledgeable of the Nineteenth Century game and referred me to you. I'd greatly appreciate your help in the aforementioned regard.

<dd>Re Grace &amp; Spofforth. I'm afraid I know little more about that incident than you've already described. WG was not well like by the Australians because of his mercenary attitude when he went on tour there some years earlier and the run out of Jones was yet another in along line of dubious actions by him. It certainly does seem to have fired up the Australians but it is questionable if they would not have won anyway without the incident. Sorry I can't be of more help but actually it's the 18th century that is my special area of interest.

<p>You wouldn't be able to cite a few examples of the long-running bad blood to which you refer, would you? I know about the Midwinter kidnap, but is there anything else? By the way, who would you recommend as the contributor to whom I should go for help on the matter of Grace's relationships with Spofforth and Thoms?

<p>Jack, I've added a Championship table to a random one of your cricket season articles: the 1964 season. If you reckon the style and positioning is all right, I can probably generate a few more over the next few days when I have time. I've also added leading batsmen and bowlers to 1930 and 1951, aiming to pick the top five English players for each season, but also adding in any touring players where they qualify. Again, I'd value your opinion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 17:43, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alresford</span></h2>
<p>In your series of articles on 18th century cricket clubs, do you have any plans to do one on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Alresford_77c6.html" title="New Alresford">Alresford</a>? I've just been rereading <i>Arlott on Cricket</i>, in which there is a chapter about the club. According to Arlott, between about 1770 and 1795 "Alresford was second in Hampshire cricket only to Hambledon, and Hambledon was second to none in the world. Hambledon, though, even in its finest days, was happy to include Alresford players." If you'd rather, I'd be happy to write a paragraph or two myself. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 18:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Hi John. I'd love to see an article about the Alresford club. I'm still researching the early 18th century and I don't have Arlott on Cricket so I suggest it would be best if you were to create the article using that book as the main source. John Arlott came from Hampshire, didn't he?</i></p>
<p>I've now got something written. I'll call it <a href="../../../a/l/r/Alresford_Cricket_Club_3537.html" title="Alresford Cricket Club">Alresford Cricket Club</a>, with links from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Alresford_77c6.html" title="New Alresford">New Alresford</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Alresford_21b1.html" title="Old Alresford">Old Alresford</a> articles. Yes, John Arlott was very much a Hampshire man, born and bred. (As is John Woodcock. It's remarkable that two of the three leading English cricket journalists of the 1960s and 1970s (the third being Swanton) should have come from the same county.)</p>
<p><i>I have Alresford playing major matches from 1779, when they played Berkshire, and they were certainly eminent into the mid-1780s. Tom Taylor and RA Veck seem to have been the most famous players and, as you say, they were both first-choice for Hambledon.</i></p>
<p>Arlott mentions Alresford playing Hambledon home and away on level terms in 1778. In 1776, "Alresford with three of Waltham and two of Warnford" played "Petersfield and Catherington with the famous Messrs Small, Brett and Barber and H. Bonham Esq." Arlott comments: "...these matches, invariably played for wagers, were based on teams of more or less even strength; and to set three such eminent Hambledon players on the other side means that Alresford must have been immensely powerful." Cricketarchive only has scorecards from 1779 onwards, but Arlott points out that in many cases all we have is an announcement in the press that a match will be taking place, with no scorecard or even result being recorded.</p>
<p><i>One thing I've wondered about before is if the Alresford club organised the Hampshire matches on Itchen Stoke Down; rather than Hambledon Club which has always got the credit for organising all Hampshire matches? What do you think?</i></p>
<p>Arlott says: "The standing of Alresford... is indicated by the fact that a number of the Hambledon matches - including even major fixtures with England - were played there." So he evidently thought that the matches were organised by Hambledon. He was writing in 1978, so it's possible that new information may have come to light since. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 19:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why Bob Taylor for your all-time England and world teams? An odd choice! As a pure wicket keeper surely Evans would get the nod, as keeper / batsman Ames is streets ahead or perhaps even Knott who kept him out of the England team for so long? For the world team you have players like Gilchrist, Clyde Walcott and Andy Flower amongst others. You aren't related by any chance? --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 23:47, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to agree on the thinking that the best gloveman should get the test slot. Thats why I never really agreed with Alec Stewart keeping in tests, ODI's he would have been my pick though. Jack Russel was in a different classs as a keeper, and not a bad batsman - imo our best keeper of recent years. Picking Stewart I think we lost out twice, firstly Russel's keeping would have been worth maybe a wicket per test and then the double whammy - as a keeper Alec averaged 34, as a batsman 46 so we lost out on his runs too! To my mind Taylor, Knott and Russel(I have had the pleasure of watching all 3 and playing with Knott) were all first rate keepers and in choosing between them they only differ in batting prowess rather than glove work. Its odd your dad doesnt rate Evans that highly. He'd be worth a place in most teams on entertainment value alone. The more I read about him the more I'm impressed. Can you imagine standing up to Alec Bedser? From cricinfo... "After the 1946-47 tour, Bill O'Reilly wrote that wicket-keeping was the only department where England matched Australia. In 1950-51, according to Trevor Bailey, Evans did not miss a chance, and took one at Melbourne that still amazed Bailey years later, when he caught Neil Harvey standing up to Bedser one-handed, horizontal, and airborne down the leg side off a genuine leg-glance." Now thats what I call keeping. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 21:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for writing a piece about Tom Lockyer. He was one of the Surrey players on my "to do" list, whom now I won't need to do. I must see if I can find amongst my books a reference for the famous story about a boxer seeing his hands, with the fingers all mishapen thanks to inadequate gloves and standing up to fast bowlers, and saying that he would sooner go 15 rounds in the ring than keep wicket, or something to that effect.

Canada won 1 match, lost 3, had 2 rain-spoilt draws, and 3 matches had no play at all.

<dd>Page 1021 of the 1975 Wisden mentions the 1974 tour of the United Kingdom, the first for 20 years and the sixth ever. There were 16 games: 5 wins, 5 draws, 6 losses. Five of their matches were against county second XIs and Minor Couties. The NCA was played at Lord's on a rain-affected day. They also played the Club Cricket Conference and DH Robin's XI. No scores or even individual match results are given, unfortunately. The captain was R.J. Stevens. Tony Clarke scored most runs: 478. W. Braithwaite and M. De Souza each took 29 wickets.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lets avoid sponsors names in article titles</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have re-moved <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Championship_0ec7.html" title="State Championship">State Championship</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_first-class_cricket_championship_ca9d.html" title="New Zealand first-class cricket championship">New Zealand first-class cricket championship</a>, because the article covers the history* of first-class competition in New Zealand. "State" is State Insurance, the current naming-rights sponsor for whatever period they have negotiated. There are precedents such as New Zealand national soccer league, which covers all the various incarnations of NZ's top soccer competition since the 1970's. After all, we don't have Emirates Melbourne Cup, do we, although that is currently the 'correct name' of that event. For an even worse example, look at the Australian one-day competition - to find the article a reader has to know who the current sponsor is.</p>
<p>The use of current names when they are not applicable leads to Wikipedia being the source of innacurate statements such as "The Black Caps won the Ford Ranger One Day Cup in 1974-75" (both tea name and competition name are wrong), or "Bevan Congdon played for the Black Caps" - he was well and truly retired before the team took on that name.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to create separate articles for each incarnation of a competition (containing only data for the relevant years), but they would still benefit from a generic article to link them together and provide continuity. (Separate articles would make documenting players careers more tedious though). This approach could be developed if the generic article becomes too long.</p>
<p>I a thinking of proposing a Wikipedia policy on this.</p>

<p>It looks now that your RfA won't achieve consensus at this point in time. The main reasons appear to be the explanation of your understanding of the XfD process and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Cricket&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95602458" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Cricket&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95602458" rel="nofollow">canvassing for participation</a>. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">explanation of the deletion process</a> should resolve most questions; the central thrust of the oppose votes was that the number of votes is not as pertinent to the discussion as the quality of the policy-backed 'keep' arguments. You can also be proactive at XfD - 'speedy keep's can be closed by all responsible editors, not just admins, and articles can be rewritten in five days, or at least fleshed-out as stubs with sources provided for expansion once the deadline has past. Trolling on discussions can also be handled in the standard way, with warnings and then attention at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> if your warnings are not heeded. Adminship doesn't involve extra power so much as extra duties - blocking vandals is part of due process, something in which we all participate.</p>
<p>The other objections are easily negated - changing your preferences to force edit summaries can be done in moments and keeping your mentions of your RfA to a minimum is also easy. Canvassing is a definite no-no - no one at RfA likes to see vote-packing, even if it is done with the best of intentions! Don't take this as a knock-back; the people who commented did so because they want you to be the best admin candidate that you can be. Try again in three months or so, keeping the comments in mind from now until Easter, say. I reckon that you will achieve consensus if you follow the constructive criticism.

<p>Good work on the Pakistan cricket seasons, but I have a query. You've given the title of the main first-class competition as the "Qaid-I-Azam Trophy", but all references I can find (including Cricinfo and Cricket Archive) call it the "Quaid-e-Azam Trophy". Is this a mistake? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_nixon_99cc.html" title="User:Andrew nixon">Andrew nixon</a> 12:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's two renditions in English, Andrew. Apart from Wisden, the books I've quoted use <a href="../../../q/a/i/Qaid-i-Azam_Trophy_3cbd.html" title="Qaid-i-Azam Trophy">Qaid-i-Azam Trophy</a> and I had created the trophy's own article before I realised there was an alternative (I have pointed out the alternative usage in the trophy article). I believe Qaid is an older version than Quaid. If you'd rather change it to Quaid as the more recent version I have no objection. All the best. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 13:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, here's an alternative solution - instead of deleting the article, I could get rid of this section in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioquia.html" title="Antioquia">Antioquia</a> article, but putting a link to your article in a 'see also' section at the bottom. That way, it won't just be the same information repeated, as it is now. Ygoloxelfer 11:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought senility had finally set it as I could not remember finishing this article and publishing it. Then I saw that you had moved it from my sandbox to the real article space. Thanks for thinking it was ready, although it actually is partly unfinished. I guess you have just prompted me to get a rattle on and finish it. Cheers. <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudgey_0719.html" title="User:Pudgey">Pudgey</a> 08:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
