<p>I removed the following paragraph from the entry, which is speculative ("some fans"?):<br />
<i>Oracle and Black Canary behave so affectionately towards one another that some fans have begun to speculate as to the possible lesbian undertones of their relationship, much to the dismay of older, purist fans.</i>--<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalliaz_237a.html" title="User:Galliaz">Galliaz</a> 01:32, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>She should be a fictional blonde because she is always shown that way. In addition, she used to wear a blonde wig but has now dyes her hair blonde, so I think she sees herself as a blonde and so should be considered one.</p>
<p>The category Fictional Blondes has been deleted. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 03:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Galliaz, it was good to remove the paragraph. Anyone following the Birds of Prey storylines knows that Babs has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Dick Grayson, while Dinah has had a series of short relationships. The embracing that the two have had is one borne of genuine friendship (Babs essentially rebuilt Dinah's Black Canary career); it has never been hinted that a romance exists between the two.<small>—The preceding comment is by <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuidam65_8a5e.html" title="User:Quidam65">Quidam65</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/i/User_talk%7EQuidam65_dbd0.html" title="User talk:Quidam65">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quidam65_4763.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quidam65">contribs</a>) 12:53 November 3, 2006: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Please sign your posts!</a></i></small></p>

<p>How is she rated as one of the top when she couldn't beat Strike? Nightwing defeated him, and defeated him rather easily. Another thing In BOP Black Canary admits that Nightwing is better than she is in the fight with "The Brothers Silk." And you people still can't give Nightwing his credit as being one of the best DC martial artist alive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a conspiracy, I tell you. Does anyone think Nightwing isn't good?

<dd>Trying to make this category a little more consistent. (By the way, if your copy of the Brothers Silk story has her admitting that, you must have added a line in with a pencil. Nothing like that is ever said in the book).<a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 19:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not add speculation about Dinah's role in the founding of the Justice League. We don't know yet, so there's no need to anything to the article. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 21:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree; one of the main points of Infinite Crisis was to return Wonder Woman to her role as a JLA founder, and this was clearly depicted in the comic. I did not say Dinah was now definitively not a founder, but merely said things were now "unclear," which is true. What is wrong with factually pointing out the issue raised by the end of IC, properly couched and qualified? Would you care to offer some language regarding the possible implications of IC? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris1435_402a.html" title="User:Chris1435">Chris1435</a> 21:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. There is no news, and we don't need to include the fact that there is no news. This is the general policy of the Wikiproject. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 01:33, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fact that Wonder Woman has been restored to Silver-Age JLA history is not "news?" The article's statement regarding BC's "retroactively replacing Wonder Woman in all Silver Age appearances with the team" is now at best questionable and at most patlently false. How can she have "replaced" Wonder Woman if Wonder Woman was there? All I'm asking for is a simple statement acknowledging the IC business in some brief way; otherwise the article is misleading. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris1435_402a.html" title="User:Chris1435">Chris1435</a> 18:21, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right. Take a look at the Infinite Crisis section. Don't worry about the present tense. I am going to go over this whole article within the next few days.

<p>I feel that a very small paragraph could be included about various uses of the Canary Cry over the years, although I lack the expertise necessary for writing it. I do recall Mr. Terrific having her knock out all the guards in the White House by altering the pitch of her cry, during a JLA-JSA crossover, and (if memory serves), in Batgirl her cry was sufficient to destroy a stone dam or something along those lines.<a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 07:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The effects of this experience, both physical and mental, were severe. Dinah suffered not only the loss of her Canary Cry, but also her ability to have children." I know she was tortured, but exactly where does it say that she was unable to have children because of it? User: Oncedead</p>
