<p>From the end of the nineteenth century until 1978, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> did not allow men with black skin to be ordained to the priesthood or to enter its <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_fbc2.html" title="Temple (Latter Day Saints)">temples</a> to perform ceremonies such as the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endowment_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_9759.html" title="Endowment (Latter Day Saints)">Endowment</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealing_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_8b92.html" title="Sealing (Latter Day Saints)">sealing</a> that the church believes are necessary for the highest degree of salvation. In addition, many church leaders taught that black skin was a punishment for wrongdoing in the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-existence.html" title="Pre-existence">pre-existence</a> or for the <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain_and_Abel_df7c.html" title="Cain and Abel">murder of Abel by Cain</a>, whom they thought was the ancestor of people with black skin. In spite of these restrictions and doctrines, many African Americans joined the Church and served faithfully. In 1978, after years of internal debate among church leaders, the church lifted this ban based on what it said was a revelation from God. Though some church leaders have renounced previous doctrines distinguishing black people theologically on the basis of race, the church has made no formal or official statement denouncing such doctrines as of 2007.</p>

The citizens of Missouri suspected that the mere presence of non-slave African Americans would incite rebellion, and so the state legislature enacted some very peculiar laws regarding colored immigration to the state. To help members understand the laws, President Phelps published an article in the church press instructing African American saints who might wish to immigrate to Missouri (<a href="http://www.centerplace.org/history/ems/v2n14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.centerplace.org/history/ems/v2n14.htm" rel="nofollow">Phelps, 1833</a>).

<p>In an attempt to correct the misunderstanding, Joseph Smith issued a number of statements<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> over the next few years stating the Church's position against the abolitionist movement. This position expressed concern that a sudden and unilateral abolition of the institution of slavery would lead to lawlessness.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Joseph Smith preached the importance of upholding the law of the land<sup id="_ref-aof12_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aof12" title="">[1]</a></sup>, which included the institution of slavery. Church policy prohibited missionaries from baptizing slaves without the permission of their master.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> To support his arguments, Joseph Smith borrowed heavily from the southern fundamentalist rhetoric of his time. Of these popular arguments, the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Ham_4ff3.html" title="Curse of Ham">curse of Ham</a> endured the longest.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Ham, the son of Noah, was cursed to be a "servant of servants" as recorded in the following passage from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark were Shem, and Ham, and Japeth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japeth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father, and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, <i>Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japeth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant</i>. (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/9/18-27#18" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/9/18-27#18" rel="nofollow">Genesis 9:18-27</a></span>, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It had been popularly taught, at least since A.D. 200, by both Christian and Jewish scholars, that the descendants of Ham or Canaan form the present day African races. Southern fundamentalists used this scripture to justify the enslavement of the African races, for God cursed them to perpetual servitude.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Later in his life, living in Illinois and running for the presidency of the United States, Joseph Smith wrote a platform containing a plan to abolish slavery.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The tone of his rhetoric changed substantially after he left Missouri.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It is important to note that although Joseph Smith spoke on the issue of slavery, none of his statements ever mentioned African Americans and the priesthood (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 54-65</a>).</p>

<p>Although Joseph Smith never spoke or wrote about African Americans and the priesthood, he did ordain an African American to the office of elder. Elijah Abel was baptized in Maryland, in 1832, just two years after the organization of the Church. He moved to Kirtland, Ohio to join the Saints and was there ordained to the office of elder in 1836. Six months later he was called to serve in the third quorum of the seventy and received a patriarchal blessing from <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr._21fb.html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">Joseph Smith, Sr.</a> who seems to have been quite aware of Abel's unique status as an African American, for instead of declaring his lineage from one of the tribes of Israel, he was declared "an orphan," but promised equality with his brethren in the eternities. Elder Abel served his first mission for the Church to New York and Canada. In 1836, he moved from Kirtland to Nauvoo where he participated in the temple ordinance of baptism for the dead. In 1842, he moved again from Nauvoo to Cincinnati where he married Mary Ann Adams. In 1843, a traveling high council visited Cincinnati but refused to recognize Elder Abel for the sake of public appearance and called him to his second mission to the "coloured population" of Cincinnati (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 130</a>).</p>
<p>Elder Abel rejoined the Saints in Utah in 1853. By then, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> had greatly strengthened the church's policies towards African Americans. Elder Abel petitioned President Young for his and his wife's temple endowment and sealing, but he was denied; however, no attempt was made to remove his priesthood or drop him from the third quorum of the seventies. He remained active in the quorum until his death. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%281808-1887%29_5374.html" title="John Taylor (1808-1887)">President John Taylor</a> also denied his petitions, but called him to serve his third mission to Ohio and Canada.

<p>Brigham Young subscribed to another common, although less popular theory that the descendants of Ham were also the descendants of Cain, Ham having married a woman of that race. The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_and_mark_of_Cain_bb01.html" title="Curse and mark of Cain">curse of Cain included a mark</a> as recorded in the following passage from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? And he said, what hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And <i>now art thou cursed</i> from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I hide; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold, and <i>the Lord put a mark upon Cain</i>, lest any finding him should kill him. (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/4/9-15#9" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/4/9-15#9" rel="nofollow">Genesis 4:9-15</a></span>, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scholars interpreted the mark placed upon Cain as the black skin of the African peoples. It is also believed though, that black skin is the mark of the curse, with the curse itself being the separation from the spirit of God, including the Priesthood.</p>
<p>President Young remained very strict in his interpretation. He believed the curse included not only priesthood restriction but also black skin and perpetual servitude. He believed the curse could be removed only by God and that the Civil War effort to free the slaves was in vain. He believed that the Civil War would destroy the United States and spread to every nation until the Saints could return to Missouri and build a temple in Jackson County. The slaves could be freed only by a decree from God by revelation to the prophet accompanied by the removal of the mark of Cain. It was not expected before the millennium.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first statement linking priesthood denial with the curse of Cain is dated <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>. It was given by Brigham Young in response to the question, "What chance is there for the redemption of the Negro?" Young responded, "The Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the Priesthood." (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 70</a>)</p>
<p>President Young never cited Joseph Smith for the source of his doctrine but stated it in his own authority as a prophet, even in the name of Jesus Christ on a least one occasion, as did multiple apostles, including <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parley_P._Pratt_3801.html" title="Parley P. Pratt">Parley P. Pratt</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/b/Heber_C._Kimball_c728.html" title="Heber C. Kimball">Heber C. Kimball</a>. In 1852, while addressing the state legislature, Young stated: "Any man having one drop of the seed of [Cain]...in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spoke it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true and others know it." (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 70</a>) He did not say that it was revealed to him but that it was known. He may have meant the same thing, or he may have been relying on his own feelings.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Young's views on inter-racial relationships were also unambiguous. In his 'Journal of Discourses' he even claims that "If the White man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain (those with dark skin), the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so."</p>

When <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilford_Woodruff_1c3c.html" title="Wilford Woodruff">Wilford Woodruff</a> became president of the Church, he compromised and allowed Sister James to be sealed to the family of Joseph Smith as a servant. (It is customary, in the LDS Church to seal children to parents, and spouses to each other, but this seems to have been an exceedingly exceptional case. No one else has ever been sealed to anyone as a servant.) This was unsatisfying to Sister James as it did not include the saving ordinance of the endowment, and she repeated her petitions. She died in 1908, true to the faith, bearing testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel. President <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_F._Smith_08f9.html" title="Joseph F. Smith">Joseph F.

<p>Samuel D. Chambers was another early African American pioneer. He was baptized secretly at the age of thirteen when he was still a slave in Mississippi. He was unable to join the main body of the church and lost track of them until after the Civil War. He was thirty-eight when he had saved enough money to immigrate to Utah with his wife and son. Although he did not hold the priesthood, he participated actively in his ward by assisting the deacons, offering public prayers, and bearing his testimony. He was grateful to the Lord for having lead him from bondage to live among the saints in Zion (Embry 1994: 40-41). Brother Chambers found joy and peace in his membership with the Church in spite of his restricted participation.</p>

<p>President Joseph F. Smith dominated the African American issue during the first quarter of the twentieth century. The death of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> and the presidency of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%281808-1887%29_5374.html" title="John Taylor (1808-1887)">John Taylor</a> brought many questions to the issue of African Americans. Although Young left no doubt that they should not receive the priesthood, he left other issues unresolved. The most important developments of this period are the change of authorship for the policy of priesthood restriction from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> and the use of the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_of_Great_Price_%28Mormonism%29_6d68.html" title="Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)">Pearl of Great Price</a> in the justification of this policy.</p>
<p>First, as the author of the restoration, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> has always been held in high regard, and all church doctrines have been traced back to him. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> relied on his own charisma and prophetic authority. He never attempted to cite Joseph Smith as the author of this policy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%281808-1887%29_5374.html" title="John Taylor (1808-1887)">John Taylor</a> and his successors apparently felt less sure of themselves, for there arose a great desire to attribute the policy of priesthood denial to Joseph Smith. Attempts to shift authorship of the policy from Brigham Young to Joseph Smith were thwarted more by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah_Abel_e159.html" title="Elijah Abel">Elijah Abel</a> than any other thing. Brother Abel was living, breathing proof that an African American was ordained to the priesthood in the days of Joseph Smith. The issue came up repeatedly in quorum meetings as Elder Abel continually petitioned for his temple endowment. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_F._Smith_08f9.html" title="Joseph F. Smith">Joseph F. Smith</a> stood up for Elijah Abel testifying of his rightful claim to the priesthood while others said that he had been dropped from the quorum. Eventually, even Joseph F. Smith began telling the story that way, reporting that Abel's priesthood had been declared null and void by the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, though this seems to conflict with Joseph F. Smith's teachings that the priesthood could not be removed from any man without removing that man from the church (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 76-86</a>). From this point on Joseph Smith was easily and repeatedly referred to as the author of many statements, which had actually been made by Brigham Young, on the subject of priesthood restriction. (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 76-86</a>)</p>
<p>Second, the Church leadership began using the newly canonized <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_of_Great_Price_%28Mormonism%29_6d68.html" title="Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)">Pearl of Great Price</a> to justify the priesthood restriction. Before 1900, leaders needed only to cite the cursed lineage as reason to deny the priesthood, but near the turn of the century scientists dismissed the reality of a universal flood and identified the descendants of Ham to be Semites, modern Jews and Arabs. Popular opinion shifted as well. People no longer accepted the traditional African genealogies linking them with Ham and Cain. Church leaders needed something else to justify priesthood restriction. The following verse is what they found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that order established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with the blessing of the earth, and with the blessing of wisdom, <i>but cursed him as pertaining the priesthood</i>. Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of the priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was lead away by their idolatry. (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Pearl_of_Great_Price/Abraham#1:26" class="extiw" title="s:Pearl_of_Great_Price/Abraham">Abraham 1:26-27</a>, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this verse makes it clear that the descendants of Ham were denied the priesthood, it does not link them with modern Africans.</p>

<p>Most African Americans joined the church after much soul searching or a powerful spiritual experience. Their children seldom shared their faith. Sister Bankhead is an exception to that scenario. Sister Bankhead comes from a proud pioneer heritage, descended on her mother's side from both <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Elizabeth_Manning_James_57ce.html" title="Jane Elizabeth Manning James">Jane Manning James</a> and Green Flake, (who drove <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a>'s wagon in the Salt Lake Valley). She was baptized at the age of eight and remained faithful to the church all her life (Cherry 1985).</p>
<p>When asked about her feelings concerning the priesthood restriction, she commented that she knew the restriction would someday be lifted, but when the announcement was actually made, she was astonished (Cherry 1985). Although she was very happy about the change, she also recognized that lifting the priesthood restriction would not cure racism and that many members were heading for difficult times if they would someday have to accept an African American bishop (Cherry 1985).</p>
<p>Sister Bankhead's unique lifetime experience in the Church speaks to the great diversity to be found among African American Mormons.</p>

<p>The most influential position taken during the second quarter of the twentieth century on Blacks and Mormonism was stated by Joseph Fielding Smith. Joseph Fielding Smith stated an opinion that attempted to resolve the theological problem faced by the policy of priesthood restriction when he published a book titled, <i>The Way to Perfection</i>. Here was the first extensive explanation of this peculiar church policy. In addition to describing the ancient genealogies, the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Ham_4ff3.html" title="Curse of Ham">curse of Ham</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_and_mark_of_Cain_bb01.html" title="Curse and mark of Cain">curse and mark of Cain</a>, he also explained at great length a theory which had grown in popularity among the grass roots of the church since 1885 but had never received official endorsement from church leaders. This theory was that African Americans were denied the priesthood in this life because they had been less than valiant in the premortal life. Smith reasoned that during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_War_in_Heaven_bdf1.html" title="First War in Heaven">war in heaven</a> some spirits would logically have been less valiant in following the Savior than others, therefore the priesthood was restricted from the least valiant.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> This theory had great appeal among the members of the church because it made things fair. Church policy was not arbitrarily racist but African Americans actually deserved this restricted status as a result of their lack of faithfulness before birth. This theory had been condemned by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> who saw no need to go beyond the cursed genealogies, but as mentioned before the theories concerning the genealogy of Africans had been losing popularity due to new scientific evidence to the contrary. Soon after the publication of this book, some church leaders began referring to the war in heaven for justification of the African American policy. (Since 1978, church leaders including Elder Dallin Oaks have stated that Smith's theory was his own opinion, which was since shown to be wrong.)</p>
<p>Joseph Fielding Smith had answered the theological problem concerning the African American policy, but he had done nothing for the practical problem of determining who should be allowed to receive the priesthood.</p>
<p>In the United States, priesthood eligibility was determined by appearance unless it was known that a man had an African ancestor. In the nation of South Africa, British and Dutch settlers were required to trace their genealogy back to Europe. In Brazil, however, it was a completely different matter. The people of Brazil were of such mixed ancestry that there was no way to exactly determine whether an individual had African ancestry. In the Pacific Islands, there were non-African people of even darker color than most Africans (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1982: 86-91</a>).</p>

<p>President McKay did more than any other man to begin eliminating this policy without actually eliminating it. He presided over the church at a time when the entire country was on fire about <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_55ab.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">civil rights</a>. Official church statements of this time supported the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_55ab.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">Civil Rights Movement</a>, but it should be noted that holding the priesthood is not a "civil" right.</p>
<p>During this time, the church came under severe attacks from those promoting civil rights. Temple Square and the church office building were picketed and many universities boycotted sport competitions with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a>.</p>
<p>Joseph Fielding Smith had stated in the "Way to Perfection" his opinion that:</p>
<p>"Of the two-thirds who followed Christ, however, some were more valiant than others....Those who were less valiant in pre-existence and who thereby had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the negroes. Such spirits are sent to earth through the lineage of Cain, the mark put upon him for his rebellion against God and his murder of Abel being a black skin. (Moses 5:16-41; 12:22) Noah's son Ham married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain, thus preserving the negro lineage through the flood. (Abraham 1:20-27) Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty. ...The present status of the negro rests purely and simply on the foundation of pre-existence....The negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain spiritual blessings are concerned, particularly the priesthood and the temple blessings that flow there from." 3</p>
<p>Mormon elder Mark E. Peterson addressed the issue of race priesthood in his address to a 1954 Convention of Teachers of Religion at the College Level at Brigham Young University. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a Negro is due to the restriction placed upon them. 'No person having the least particle of Negro blood can hold the Priesthood' (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth Negro or one-hundred and sixth, the curse of no Priesthood is the same. If an individual who is entitled to the Priesthood marries a Negro, the Lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the Priesthood will come to that marriage as children. To intermarry with a Negro is to forfeit a 'Nation of Priesthood holders'....<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_race.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_race.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peterson held that male descendents of a mixed-marriage could not become a Mormon priest, even if they had a lone ancestor with African blood dating back many generations. However, he did hold out hope for African Americans, in that a black person baptized into the Mormon faith and who accepted Joseph Smith as a prophet of god could attain the highest form of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a> known to Mormons, the Celestial kingdom. Peterson said, "If that Negro is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get celestial glory."</p>
<p>The advances made by President McKay went mostly unnoticed. He approved a petition from a white man with known African ancestry to receive the priesthood after his patriarchal blessing assigned him to a non-cursed lineage, which was in opposition to the doctrinal stance of such elders as Peterson. He also approved the petition of a white couple who had adopted two African American children to be sealed to them in the temple. More significantly, he shifted the responsibility of genealogical research from the members to the local leadership and later to a committee in Salt Lake City to determine the eligibility of individuals in places like South Africa. And finally, President McKay declared all peoples of the Pacific Islands eligible to receive the priesthood regardless of their color, for they were descended of the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamanite.html" title="Lamanite">Lamanites</a> rather than the Africans.</p>
<p>He himself, felt that the policy was just a policy and would require no special revelation to reverse it, but he also expressed some sadness in not having felt pressed upon by the spirit to make that change. The most significant statement made by President McKay on this issue is contained in a First Presidency message explaining the policy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning of this dispensation, Joseph Smith and all succeeding presidents of the church have taught that Negroes, while spirit children of a common Father, and the progeny of our earthly parents Adam and Eve, were not yet to receive the priesthood, <i>for reasons which we believe are known to God, but which He has not made fully known to man</i> (Bringhurst 1981: 223, emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>

With that statement, President McKay stripped a controversial church policy of all justification. It could not stand long (<a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">Bush &amp; Mauss 1982: 92-96</a>).</p>

<p>In 1970, Sister Martin gained the distinction of being the first African American member of the faculty at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a>. She was born in Los Angeles, California and grew up in a very racist environment. She had been greatly dissatisfied with her religious upbringing and always sought spiritual fulfillment. Her family participated in a rich musical tradition and she developed a voice talent. Some time after her first marriage failed, she met a Mormon mother in the hospital after having a minor surgery on her legs. She requested that the missionaries visit her, and she prepared for baptism. She had many wonderful spiritual experiences while investigating the church and had this to say about the priesthood restriction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>These two things: baptism and the Holy Ghost are the only requirements, contrary to popular belief, for entering the celestial kingdom</i> and being with God for eternity if one is worthy. Therefore, the Priesthood covenants of the Temple which we are not allowed at this point are not really so crucial as popular belief dictates (Martin 1972: 56, emphasis her own).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: This is a correct statement of Church doctrine. The ordinances of the temple, including marriage, are required to attain the highest degree of the celestial kingdom called Exaltation but not reguired to enter the celestial kingdom itself. In the Doctrine of Covenants it says "In the Celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;". A lesser but, still celestial glory can be obtained with out the temples ordiances preformed in mortality.</p>
<p>After being baptized, her greatest desire was to sing with the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_Tabernacle_Choir_522f.html" title="Mormon Tabernacle Choir">Mormon Tabernacle Choir</a>, so she moved with her two daughters to Salt Lake City and auditioned. She is thought by many to be the first African American to sing in the choir, but no one knows for sure. She greatly enjoyed her role as one of the first. She accepted it as her personal mission to prove to the world that there were in fact African American Mormons and that the Mormons were not racist. She toured with the choir for two years before accepting her appointment on the faculty at BYU. She was employed in the training of nurses and tried to help them become more culturally aware (Martin, 1972).</p>

<p>Many members were privately uncomfortable with the policy of priesthood restriction, and some took actions to publicly express their concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sterling M. McMurrin, a controversial Mormon philosopher and writer, publicly opposed the "Negro doctrine," and was nearly excommunicated for his outspokenness on the topic.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<li>Byron Marchant, a member of the church and a scoutmaster of a Mormon-sponsored <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scout_e311.html" title="Boy Scout">Boy Scout</a> troop, notified the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People_38e5.html" title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> that an official church "correlation policy" required all troop leaders to belong to the Mormon Aaronic Priesthood, effectively preventing him from promoting two non-Mormon black scouts who were members of his troop. After the NAACP filed a lawsuit against the Scouts, the church publicly apologized and abandoned the correlation policy that affected its scouting programs, but Marchant was excommunicated in 1977 following repeated public statements in which he continued to challenge the priesthood ban.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<p>President Kimball was an old man when he became president of the church. No one expected anything radical to take place in his presidency. National attention had turned from the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_55ab.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">Civil Rights Movement</a> to the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>. President Kimball was especially interested in the international aspect of Church growth. He took <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_conference_%28Mormonism%29_052e.html" title="General conference (Mormonism)">General Conference</a> on the road, holding area and regional conferences all over the world. He also announced many new <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Mormonism%29_097c.html" title="Temple (Mormonism)">temples</a> to be built both in the United States and abroad. If there was a point of no return concerning the demise of the Church's African American policy, it was the announcement of the <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Brazil_Temple_f24b.html" title="São Paulo Brazil Temple">temple in São Paulo, Brazil</a>. The problem of determining priesthood eligibility in Brazil was nearly impossible due to the mixing of the races in that country. When the temple was announced, Church leaders realized the impossibility of restricting temple attendance from persons of African descent.</p>
<p>However, President Kimball was also painfully aware of the discord a change of this policy would create, even among his own quorum of the Twelve. Elder <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_R._McConkie_f422.html" title="Bruce R. McConkie">Bruce R. McConkie</a> had published in his <i>Mormon Doctrine</i> that African Americans would not receive the priesthood until the millennium. President Kimball reportedly worried about revealing the change in policy to the point in which his wife Camilla actually worried about his health. Finally, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Presidency_8f82.html" title="First Presidency">First Presidency</a> released to the press an official declaration, now a part of the standard works of the Church, which contained the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has heard our prayers, and <i>by revelation</i> has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that follows there from, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male-members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/2" class="external text" title="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/2" rel="nofollow">Official Declaration 2</a>, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reactions to the declaration were mixed. Most were elated; some were confused; a few were outraged. African Americans who joined the Church after 1978 were seldom taught about the previous policy concerning them, indicating a general discomfort with it among the membership. When they did learn of it, it was sometimes difficult to come to terms with, but not always. When Cleolivia Lyons was interviewed in 1988, she had this to say on the subject,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never did give that too much thought because I figured the Church was being organized. When people are being organized, there's a lot they don't understand. It's a lot of what I call 'brain washed.' A lot of whites have been brainwashed to think that Heavenly Father doesn't want a certain race of people to do a certain thing." (Cherry 1988: 16.)</p>

<p>Helvécio Martins was the first person of African descent to be called as a <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Authority_bdbc.html" title="General Authority">General Authority</a> of the Church and the first to serve in a <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum_of_the_Seventy_26c3.html" title="Quorum of the Seventy">Quorum of the Seventy</a> since <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah_Abel_e159.html" title="Elijah Abel">Elijah Abel</a> more than 150 years previous. Elder Martins was born in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazi.html" title="Brazi">Brazil</a> to parents descended from African slaves. He had found success in his professional life but felt unfulfilled with the religious life he was pursuing. The missionaries visited his home in 1972 while he was going through a difficult spiritual crisis. The missionaries visited his home late one night and were worried about how to teach an African since the church had not yet reversed its policy. Indeed, Elder Martins' first question upon inviting the missionaries into his home concerned the Church's attitude toward race. The spiritual experiences that the Martins family had while investigating the Church superseded their concerns for the racial policy of priesthood restriction, and they were baptized. They experienced much resistance from members of their extended family and former church friends, but eventually found peace with them. Elder Martins served in his ward as a Sunday school teacher. He was not troubled by the priesthood restriction, but others were. Often, members of the ward would ask him how he could remain a member of the Church without the priesthood. It was never an issue for him. He had resolved the issue in his own mind and never expected to receive the priesthood.</p>
<p>When the announcement came, he describes his reaction and that of his wife as unbelieving. It was something for which they had not dared to hope. Elder Martins then served as a member of the stake presidency, bishop, mission president, and finally second quorum of the seventy. His son was one of the first three Africans to serve a full time mission for the church in nearly 100 years (Martins &amp; Grover, 1994).</p>
<p>With the calling of Elder Martins to the quorum, the Church had, in a sense, gone full circle on this issue. The African American policy evolved in a peculiar way, from exclusion, which was the status quo of the time, to equality, which is the ideal for the future. During its evolution it was justified in many ways: The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Ham_4ff3.html" title="Curse of Ham">curse of Ham</a>, the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_and_mark_of_Cain_bb01.html" title="Curse and mark of Cain">curse and mark of Cain</a>, the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_of_Great_Price_6f45.html" title="Pearl of Great Price">Pearl of Great Price</a>, and the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_War_in_Heaven_bdf1.html" title="First War in Heaven">war in heaven</a>. This policy has affected people very differently, as it is sure to continue to affect those who investigate the Church.</p>
