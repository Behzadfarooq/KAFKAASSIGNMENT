	    <p>My grandmother (as a child) saw some Black and Tans dragging a man out of his Dublin house in front of his wife and children and shooting him in the street. <b>Can NPOV apply to that?</b> Sean White</p>

<dd>I agree, though their actions are no doubt atrocious, the article reeks a little too much of a rant based on too much hearsay and too few factual resources. Some elaboration and citations of claims would leave this article much improved. opelwerk 20:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, its you. I can assure you it is quite restrained compared to what I would have written about that lot.</p>

<p>This is always going to be a difficult article to get right as the Black and Tan's actions no doubt varied from place to place and only the larger atrocities were recorded. I've heard alot of similar first hand accounts over the years of their actions in my local area which I am fairly sure are accurate but I couldn't cite anything written. Allegations of state sponsered terroism may seem a little strong but that in the twenteth century government troops were indescrimitly physicly attacking catholics because of their relegion can't be described many other ways, esspecially considering Llyod George was well aware throughout.</p>

<p>When I get a chance, at some point in the near future, I am going to re-write this entire article:</p>
<p>--it does not reflect the results of recent research by historians like Elizabeth Malcolm, W. J. Lowe, and myself;</p>
<p>(Despite the fact that it relies heavily on Dr. Malcolm's article on the subject in the <i>Oxford Companion to Irish History</i>.)</p>
<p>--it contains a number of mistakes;</p>
<p>(In fact, there is a mistake in the first line: the Black and Tans were <i>not</i> the RIC's Reserve Force. The Reserve was a separate force quartered at Phoenix Park, most of whose members came from the North: John Brewer interviewed one of its members for his oral history of the RIC.)</p>
<p>--and it is not NPOV.</p>
<p>(It does not mention, for example, the fact that many reprisals were committed by Irish members of the RIC--a fact to which Dr. Malcolm alludes in her article.)</p>

<p>"..atrocities were committed (in most cases as just retribution for Irish brutality).."</p>
<p>I'm astonished that anyone would seek to justify or excuse atrocities against civilian populations. I've removed the reference to 'in most cases as just retribution for Irish brutality'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would have thought that the sentence was fine just so long as the word <i>just</i> is removed, provided that a cite can be provided that most atrocities were committed as retribution. Saying they were retribution then becomes nothing more than a statement of fact; it's only POV when we start saying that this justifies them (or, for that matter, if we start saying that it <i>doesn't</i> justify them). <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 01:45, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eric Barnett</p>
<p>The King made no secret of their horror at the behaviour of Crown forces which made international headlines, damaging British credibility. All Catholic's were branded even those who carried King Georges papers with appointment as an officer and served durring World War I, with distinction. I state the words " And we hereby Command them to Obay you as their superior Officer." Forced immigration was their plight as no protection could be had! Signed: someone who knows what happened. Terrorism no's no boundary, nor do's bigotry by those improperly trained and ill equiped to perform the task at hand.The British &amp; Irish peaple are good peaple if they can see beyond their own pride.</p>
<p>M. Barnett. I am not a fan of the crown, but I have to call "bullspit" on that claim. That kind of claim requests and requires a citation. I studied the Rising and WWI in some detail, and nothing like that was required for Commonwealth Officers, Catholic or Jewish or Anglican, at least not that I've seen. At least during that time period. Catholic officers surely faced some discrimination, but nothing like that. All British soldiers were/are required to swear loyalty to the "Crown in Parliament," in any case. Ireland was never subject to conscription during the Great War, either. It was the "looming conscription" that led to the rebellion, as well as timely German aid, delivered by one <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Casement_44aa.html" title="Roger Casement">Roger Casement</a>. In other words, please cite your ancedote. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 08:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'Saying they were retribution then becomes nothing more than a statement of fact'- Em, highly unlikely considering we are talking about the British crown forces of occupation taking action in Ireland against the native Irish. Only a British person could even attempt to claim that the colonial occupiers were taking "retribution" upon the, em, natives.

<p>Well, here's how the above mentioned encyclopedia start their entry on the Black and Tans: 'In their efforts to thwart the terrorism of the Irish Republican Army...'Well, that was enough for me.

<p>Encyclopedia Britannica is American. It has been American since the early 20th century. Just because it is "Britannica" doesn't mean it's British. You think Domino's Pizza is Italian?

<p>Like it or not the Rising was not a protest, it was an armed uprising. Rightfully so, or not, irrelevant, it was a revolt, not a protest, as IRA men, British soldiers and Irish and British Civillians all lost thier lives. I'm going to change that if it isn't fixed soon <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V.

<p>The Black and Tans and British government were painted in too good of a light in this article. The Black and Tans were the often the worst of British society as the British government actively recruited criminals. Also the British failed to control these men as they were allowed to do whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>The <s><a href="../../../a/d/a/Adare.html" title="Adare">Adare</a></s> Scarteen Hunt used (uses?) black-and-tan <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxhound.html" title="Foxhound">foxhounds</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the name "Black and Tan Hunt" its official title or just a common nickname? Or perhaps it changed it after the negative connotations?</li>
<li>I presume the Hunt used/s traditional riding gear coloured hunting pink, not black-and-tan</li>
<li>Presumably, the name of the breed of dog came before the name of the hunt. Is there proof the RIC force was named after the Hunt rather than named after the breed of dog? Either is plausible.</li>
