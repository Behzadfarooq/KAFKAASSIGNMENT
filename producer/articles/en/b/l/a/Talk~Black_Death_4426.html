<dd>The reduction in French language due to the shortage of french speakers is cited in British Food, Colin Spencer but its not a primary source. However the meat thing is not mentioned and seems exaggerated - many animals died too or were untended. The main effect mentioned is the fact that the peaants got more land and cottages not hovels, so they got their own ovens rather than having to use the Lord's oven and pay a tithe for it. Meat was eaten more mainly because the people left were richer, and did demand better food and working conditions but I cant verify the specific claim. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 19:56, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I would like to point out (here seems appropriate) that the description of three forms of plague is incorrect:</p>
<p>"The three forms of plague brought an array of signs and symptoms to those infected. Bubonic plague refers to the painful lymph node swellings called buboes. The septicaemic plague is called "Blood poisoning", and pneumonic plague is an airborne plague that forms a first attack on the lungs."</p>
<p>This is incorrect as there are two primary forms of plague: Bubonic and pneumonic. It's important to bear in mind that plague as caused by <i>Y. pestis</i> is spread through blood and naturally, for the organism to get back out of a host it must get out into the victims bloodstream in large numbers so it is sucked up by the flea. This causes widespread internalised bleeding, sepsis (blood poisoning) and eventual death. There is no 'third' form of plague called septicaemic plague, just bubonic and pneumonic which both kill by widespread septic shock. The key difference between bubonic plague and pneumonic plague is the time it takes for the organism to kill the host. In bubonic plague this can be several days, while pneumonic plague is already adapted to the human host and so infections caused by it progress more rapidly. Unusually, whoever wrote the remainder of the entry appears to have realised there isn't a "scepticaemic plague" and doesn't mention it any further. -J. O'Donnell. Addition: Actually, I've had a look at a more recent paper from the PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) that suggests that bacteria delivered through a flea bite may directly cause scepticemia. I had assumed that the condition was simply a subclinical form of bubonic plague, where the bacteria still pass through the lymph nodes but do not cause direct infection. It appears that <i>Y. pestis</i> injected into a host through natural means, in this case a flea bite, may indeed cause a patient to proceed directly to a scepticemic form of plague.</p>
<p>The paper is free if anyone is curious to read it: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/103/14/5526" class="external free" title="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/103/14/5526" rel="nofollow">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/103/14/5526</a> -J. O'Donnell. (<i>added 11:25, 8 April 2006 (UTC) by 139.80.123.38</i>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes it's incorrect to talk about three. WHO, DCD and other authorities actually identify nine types of the disease plague (<i>Pestis</i>) (ICD-10 code A20), giving six of them separate ICD-10 sub-codings and grouping the other three milder versions under one joint sub-coding: bubonic plague (<i>Pestis bubonica</i>), cellulocutaneous plague (<i>Pestis cellulocutanea</i>), pneumonic or pulmonic plague (<i>Pestis pneumonica</i>), meningeal plague or plague meningitis (<i>Pestis meningealis</i>), pharyngeal plague (<i>Pestis pharyngeus</i>), septicemic plague (<i>Pestis septic(h)aemica</i>), and the three milder abortive plague, asymptomatic plague and pestis minor.</dd>
<dd>Discussions about the disease itself is, however, best kept on the talk page of the article <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubonic_plague.html" title="Bubonic plague">Bubonic plague</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/b/Talk%7EBubonic_plague_26f7.html" title="Talk:Bubonic plague">Talk:Bubonic plague</a>), as this article deals with the Black Death pandemic, which probably was a <i>pestis</i> pendemic, although some scientists question this. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 01:51, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your statement about no takers isn't necesarily true. While I'm not well versed in the Black Death, we've been studying it in my Western European history course at Concordia University.

<dd>Umm... Snopes is hardly apocryphal. It's one of the most reputable sites on the Web, and it always has a bibliography/list of references to go along with its articles. Meanwhile, you can dredge up any number of criticisms of high school textbooks wherein they are accused of perpetuating misleading or outright false information. I would easily trust Snopes over any high school textbook. Furthermore, I see no problems with Snopes' arguments or methods.

<p>Shouldn't we mention that one of the accepted results of the Black Death was the massive peasant revolts (i.e. Jacquerie, Great Peasants' Revolt in England, revolts across south France, Italy, and Germany) that affected mostly Western Europe, rather than Eastern Europe which was hit much less by the disease. Other factors include the famines, wars, skyrocketting food prices, and the landlords' efforts to fix wages and generally restrict the now-scarce peasants. This may have led to greater freedoms for the peasant class and the roots of capitalism.</p>
<p>Additional consequences -- the massive drop in European population led logically to to a similar reduction in workforce. Workers were more valued and the aristocracy began to provide incentives to keep and attract workers. This ultimately led to an upgrade in the rights of peasants, the decline of fuedalism and the establishment of guilds and merchant groups. A teacher of mine quipped that the Black Death "birthed" the middle class. 2/05 -W (an anonymous)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is true but it didnt happen right away, it took 150+ years for the aristocracy to lower rents.. see <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_revolt_in_late_medieval_Europe_657b.html" title="Popular revolt in late medieval Europe">Popular revolt in late medieval Europe</a> which goes in to this in more detail (and mentions the black death as one of the causes).

<p>I have a few suggestions that I think would make the article much more comprehensive:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think a map of the spread of the plague (using arrows or colors) would be great, and they seem to be common in all of the books I have read.</li>
<li>I think there should be a lot more about the hygiene and diet of the medieval Europeans, as it was a major factor in the diease's spread. Isn't this the reason it doesn't happen in modern times, after all, we are not vaccinated for it.</li>
<li>I think we can also spend much more time talking about the statistics in "Depopulation". For example, I know there are in fact many varying opinions of the mortality rate, many much higher or lower than 25 million. It should also be mentioned where and how hard it hit (i.e. was the mortality uniform throughout Europe, are there areas of particular interest that were ravaged/spared and why?).</li>
<li>Also, there seems to be a "Alternate Explanations" section, but no there is no major discussion of the Yersinia pestis theory before it. It should include how it is spread, how communicable it is, the relative mortality, and others pertinent to the main theory itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats all I have for now, I will contribute more (to the actual article again) once I'm not so busy. I've noticed there have been some changes for the better recently, so this is not meant to be a criticism, but a suggestion. So carry on! --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 23:35, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"On some ships no one remained alive when they reached their port."</p>
<p>I see an almost scary absence of logic in that sentence. If someone can justify not removing it, please do so.</p>
<p>++</p>
<p>I think a few notes on earlier occasions of "plague" may be in order. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles record a series of "plagues" between 526 and 1087 CE (particularly in 664 CE) afflicting England, but as with the Black Death the cause or causes are disputed (anthrax, cholera, bubonic plague). There were also numerous outbreaks of pestilence in the classical world (Athens c. 400 BCE among others). The vagueness over the causes would serve to illustrate the susceptibility of historical cultures to disease and the difficulty in in establishing their origins.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been suggested changes in agricultural practises, specifically longer and better ploughs, may have facilitated the bringing of bacterium, viruses and spores to the surface of the soil. This may be sufficient for a major pestilence alone, or it may have also resulted in the disruption and displacement of ground dwelling rodent populations and resulted in higher human-rodent contacts as the animals were forced to seek food in grain stores.

"They were terribly fierce beasts, who eat our hapless soldiers with their gigantic tongues." In terror, the inhabitants fled to the town hall, and bombarded the invading hordes with cannons and mortars. Eventually, the mayor of London sallied out with a formidable force and routed the frog army. Despite heavy casualties, they were successful. But if plague, fire and frogs wasn't enough, ten years later London was struck by a succession of tornadoes, that sweeped down from the Shetland Islands. The event was blamed on the carnies, who were subsequently driven out of town. However, bands of militant snowmen allied with the exiled carnies and attacked the city in 1679. After several fierce running battles, the Londoners were driven out. But David Beckham became their saviour and just three years after the carnies' victory, he led a force of Ewoks riding spiders that invaded the city. The carnies were defeated and slaughtered to a man, though the snowmen escaped. They would continue to harass Beckham's empire late into the 19th century.</dd>

<p><i>The exaple of Poland is especially notable, because it was the king Casimir_III_of_Poland goverment who stopped the spread of plague. The 40 day quarantine of foreigners and free distribution of food prevented black death from spreading in Poland.</i></p>
<p>This addition by an anonymous was reverted by a brand new contributer - Oo64eva - but with no reason given. Anyone know anything more about the plague in Poland? <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 23:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-With 62.87.224.216’s poor grammar and spelling aside, there is no indication that the stifled spread of the Black Death in Poland had anything to do with actions taken by Casimir III. This is merely speculation and Wikipedia is no place for speculation. If somebody could cite some well documented evidence of Casimir III's prevention of the Black Plauge, that would be sufficient. Sorry for my failure to report the reason for removal on the discussion page. It is apparent to me that this practice makes a good contributor great. <a href="../../../o/o/6/User%7EOo64eva_a324.html" title="User:Oo64eva"><i><b>oo64eva (AJ)</b></i></a> 00:56, Apr 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../o/o/6/User%7EOo64eva_a324.html" title="User:Oo64eva"><i><b>oo64eva (AJ)</b></i></a>. While the quarantine may have been in effect, Poland is a landlocked country. So, whereas Ireland and Iceland may have had some success, it's obvious as to why a quarantine in Poland would have been both impossible and ineffective. Some theories state that Eastern regions like Poland, Bohemia, and parts of other local kingdoms may have been spared because of the cold temperatures caused a dormancy (if you ascribe to the bacterial <i>Yersinia</i> theory). That Casimir is responsible is simply an untenable statement. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 01:03, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The Black Death - the bubonic plague - is primarily spread through an animal vector, fleas. One flea bites an infected animal/person and then transmits the disease to all other animals/persons it bites. However, when human beings get the plague, it can manifest itself in several ways. Two of these, pnumonic and septicemic, can actually become communicable person to person because of infected body fluids. When this happens, the rate of infection increases rapidly. Most scholars believe that the pnumonic plague, which settles in the lungs, and transmission from coughing, is the mechanism that made the Black Death so widespread in Europe. See <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubonic_plague.html" title="Bubonic plague">Bubonic plague</a> for more detailed information on the disease itself. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 19:02, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Also keep in mind that not all scholars agree that it <i>was</i> bubonic plague. In general though, I do think most scholars will agree that the disease, whatever it was, was communicable, as the spread seemed to follow the trade routes, moving inland more slowly.--<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 22:30, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In regards to this recent addition:</p>

<dd>Some historians credit the Black Death for helping or opening the way for the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and even the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, as a direct or indirect result of peasant freedoms gained in the social upheaval left in the plague's wake. However this has been rejected as some who view the time passed between the events to have been to great for such an effect. Notably, these kinds of peasant revolts were more uncommon in more sparsely populated and less affected Easten Europe. As the social upheaval caused by Black Death has been seen by some as a factor that helped to bring about the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and even the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, historians have cited this as a reason for Eastern Europe's failure to experience either of these movements on a similar scale as the West. Extrapolating from this, the Black Death may be seen as a contributing factor for Eastern Europe's considerable lag in scientific and philosophical advances as well as in the move to liberalise government by restricting the power of the monach and aristocracy. A common example is that England is seen to have effectively ended <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Serfdom">serfdom</a> by <a href="../../../1/5/5/1550.html" title="1550">1550</a> while moving towards more <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representative_government.html" title="Representative government">representative government</a>; meanwhile, serfdom was not abolished in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> until the autocratic <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">tsar</a> decreed so in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a>.</dd>

<p>There are some problems with this. First, I don't know any serious historian who says the Black Death caused the Renaissance, in fact the Renaissance is such a large, diffuse event taking place over hundreds of years across vast geopolitical areas there is no single cause, like turning on a faucet. It would be like saying there is a single cause of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernity.html" title="Modernity">modernity</a>. Indeed, the Renaissance is an invention of the 19th century, it was not an actual thing, no one alive at the time heard of it. Also, what we envision as a Renaissance, was well underway in Italy prior to (and during) the Black Death. Second, who are these "some historians"? That is often code-word for "in my opinion". Next, the theory that the Black Death is the reason for Eastern Europe developing more slowly.. again, this is a highly simplified approach to a very complex question. Who came up with this idea, who can I read to learn more about this theory and the supporting evidence behind it? I would suggest reading <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_demography.html" title="Medieval demography">Medieval demography</a> which discusses the question on why there was a delay between the "crisis of the 14th century" (reduced population) and the increased incomes of the lowerclass because of more available land. This is not a simple topic and cant be boiled down to a single cause of just the Black Death. Finally I would add, if you want to discuss in detail the question of social upheavels, Black Death is just one of many social upheavels, see also <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Famine_of_1315-1317_cd22.html" title="Great Famine of 1315-1317">Great Famine of 1315-1317</a> and Hundred's Year War and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_revolt_in_late_medieval_Europe_657b.html" title="Popular revolt in late medieval Europe">Popular revolt in late medieval Europe</a> .. there are more but not yet on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:20, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't quite see where you are seeing this from what is written. Nowhere does it say "the Black Death <i>caused</i> the Renaissance". Everywhere this <i>suggestion</i> is couched in terms like "helped" and "contributing factor", that it is a <i>factor</i> at the very least, like the rest of the crises, cannot really be denied. You seem to be denying that it was a mojor cause, but that is simply not sain in the text. I would suggest you read McKay (if memory serves) and similar historians, as well as to some extent Cantor. many suggest that it was a foctor of varying degrees. I would never suggest that it is a simple idea, but I think you are simplifying what is written. Also, I <i>do</i> think you are trying to reduce the importance of this plague, as it is easy to see why it would have been a contributing factor or even cause of the peasants' revolts and economic devastation (other crises). Also it is downright myopic to say that the Hundred Years' War caused much of the effects of the fourteenth century crises, as it effected only England and France, whereas the upheaval was Eurpoe-wide for the most part. As for your assertion that the Renaissance began <i>before</i> the Black Death, I would point out that few "serious" historians would place it that far forward, and certainly none of its defining aspects came until much later. In short, please reread the passage and notice that it is not unequivocal or POV. I would encourage you to expand on the opposing view if you believe it is neglected. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 03:27, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, we are on the same page. Someone without any background of other events to guide them could read this sentence "Some historians credit the Black Death for helping or opening the way for the Renaissance" and come away with a strong sense that the Black Death caused or was the primary cause of the Renaissance. In any case, this topic is large and needs a seperate article to explore in detail, perhaps Crisis of the 14th century, which ties together the other events (famine, war, revolt), and presents the various theories of how they fit together; the one presented here is one view, but it's not the best place to discuss the crisis of the 14th and 15th centuries.. not tucked away in half a paragraph of the Black Death article, without citations, and without sources. This is just the nature of an evolving Wikipedia. Once we have a Crisis.. article, then it's possible to write a Origins of the Renaissance article, which then becomes the lead section of the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> article. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:07, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wait now... Your last edit just totally got rid of any mention of the Black Death --&gt; Renaissance theory. I realize you may not agree, but think about Wikipedia's NPOV policy. It means giving a fair shake to all sides, whether you agree with it or not, even whether its the more popular one or not. Your new wording is much too definitive on a contentious issue, and you talked to me about simplification. To say that it is simply "not satisfactory", is too imply that the theory's proponents have <i>no</i> evidence, which isn't true. The fact is that Britain, for one, passed the Statute of Labourors, which fixed wages, as the nobles' reaction to empowered peasants. I suggest you read the acconts of Agnolo di Tura and (if I remember, I'm accessing this from a computer away from home) Henry Knighton, who both complain of peasants moving off the land to find and demand better wages (sounds a little like capitalism). This kind of legislation passed across western Europe was largely unsuccessful, as it was unenforcable, there were always landlords willing to pay more for labor. Also it is simplistic to suggest serfdom disappeared spontaneously in the sixteenth century. There was no decree as in Russia, instead it had been a slow evolution, so the time frame arguent does not necessarily hold up. Not to mention the fact that the Black Death cannot be so easilt defined between a five or ten year range, it continued to return for centuries, even more reason that the time-frame argument is not the indestructable article you claim. Please NPOV the article so both sides are treated fairly.--<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 01:26, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, it was the nobles reaction (fixing wages, etc) that caused the 150+ year delay in benefits to the peasant class. I'm not sure your reading what I wrote correctly. Have you read the Demography article? As I said before, this is a large and complex topic that should not be in the Black Death article, it needs a seperate article, called Crisis of the 14th and 15th centuries, that goes into the causes and theories in detail, without being restricted by the context of the Black Death article.. I dont disagree BD was important, very important, but its not that simple. A single paragraph or two is going to be simplistic no matter what. Also, the renaissance theory is still there. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:38, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point was, and I suppose I didn't make this clear, wage-fixing legislation was almost universally unsuccessful, as only the landlords who broke the law would be the ones to get the laborers. The wave of peasant revolts largely came after the reactionary legislation: Statute of Labourers (which I was surpried has a - poorly written - article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_Laborers_913d.html" title="Statute of Laborers">here</a> under the American spelling) was in 1351, and the English Peasant Revolt was in 1381. But anyway, what I'm saying is, in the interest of POV, you <i>must</i> say also the merits of the BD leads to Ren theory, and not merely dismiss it as is your personal opinion. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 04:40, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"<i>Another possible theory as to how the plague spread so quickly is that by killing many of the cats (believed to be witchs' familiars) during the witch hunts caused the rodent population to rise, and with them rose the probability of infection</i>."

<p>I've heard this one, but don't have the materials on hand to substantiate it. Actually it was probably a social result of the ongoing waves of plague. People looked for scapegoats -- some reason why these horrible things were happening to them -- and often focused on older people who may have survived earlier rounds of the disease (and Jews, of course). The number of accusations of witchcraft increased, and measures became more draconian. These people's pets and livestock were often burned or hung along with them as "familiars." I also remember that it was about this time that the genetic mutation that results in black domestic cats emerged. The sudden appearance of these "black imps of Satan" was mentioned in a couple of sources. This led some historian(s) to speculate about a massive roundup of cats. An interesting bit of information, but perhaps not for the article. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 20:20, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This theory, while widespread, is wrong in part because it suffers from a peoblem with cronology. Witchcraft persecution (and the recognition of the crime of witchcraft) did not begin to emerge until the mid 15th century -- roughly 150 years AFTER the plague. Malleus Maleficarum, for instance was published in 1486, and even that predated the main witchcraft hysteria of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p>Point taken. I restructured the article and added information on the Middle Eastern outbreak, and a little more about China. I have no information on India, although popular sources insist they were involved. Some additional information about social/political consequences in eastern areas of the world is available. I'll try and weave that in. Non-European sources are difficult to find in English. Has anyone checked other language Wikipedias?

<dd>I'd vote in favor of keeping the "Black Death" title simply because our English speaking audience will reference the material by that name. "Plague in the Fourteenth Century" might do though. Naming pandemics for public consumption is an awkward thing - while historians like dates, the public does not. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 00:32, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Given the overwhelming number of books, academic and otherwise, that refer to it by "Black Death", there is precedent for the article to remain as is. It would be original research to rename the article, unless someone can show strong evidence to the contrary. We only report on what exists, even if what exists is not optimal. There are lots of things like this, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_1e14.html" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a> for example. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:17, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a reference in Defoe's "Diary of a Plague Year" which reads: “Therefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats, but because as they were domestic animals, and are apt to run from house to house and from street to street, so they are capable of carrying the effluvia or infectious streams of bodies infected even in their furs and hair. And therefore it was that, in the beginning of the infection, an order was published by the Lord Mayor, and by the magistrates, according to the advice of the physicians, that all the dogs and cats should be immediately killed, and an officer was appointed for the execution”. It is incredible; if their account is to be depended upon, what a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked of forty thousand dogs, and five times as many cats; few houses being without a cat, some having several, sometimes five or six in a house. All possible endeavours were used also to destroy the mice and rats, especially the latter, by laying ratsbane and other poisons for them, and a prodigious multitude of them were also destroyed." You should note that there is doubt about whether Defoe's account is entirely contemporary since it was published nearly fifty years after the event. Hope this helps?

<dd>There's no actual "doubt" as to whether Defoe's work was contemporary; it most definitely was NOT. For one thing, Defoe would have been about four years old when the Black Death reached London. Most literary historians are also agreed that his Journal was a work of fiction and presented as such; modern readers, however, sometimes assume it's fact, which can be tricky when they use it as a secondary source. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 22:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, our general policy is to omit articles from titles. In this case, however, the inclusion or omission of the definite article changes the meaning of the phrase: <b>"The Black Death"</b> refers to the historical epidemic and the period of European history characterized by it, whereas <b>"Black Death"</b> is simply a synonym for <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubonic_plague.html" title="Bubonic plague">bubonic plague</a>.

<dd>Black Death used properly always refers to this event, and not a disease. Indeed, if you read the page, you'll see that there is no agreement that the disease even <i>was</i> bubonic plague. And, as <i>The</i> Black Death is neither a title of a work, or an official name, it needs no article. From the convention: "If the definite or indefinite article article would be capitalized in running text, then include it at the beginning of the page name. Otherwise, do not include it at the beginning of the page name." We say <u>t</u>he Black Death. Besides, if your purpose in changing the title is to correct the meaning of the term, then you should have redirected just "Black Death" to <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubonic_plague.html" title="Bubonic plague">bubonic plague</a>, which is the meaning you assign it.

<dd>Is it even fixable? A graph like that needs a lot of support (a book even). I also dont think its accurate as it misses the Great Famine (I made a note to that effect). It also shows a steep upward climb after the back death, which is not what happened according to most demographers. I think the graph has a lot of problems, but is visually dramatic.

<dd>Right, I certainly agree with you there. Indeed, I went to the site it says it comes from and the numbers don't match up (the site has no numbers specific to 1351, for example). Although, if you do go to that website, <a href="http://www.hyw.com/books/history/Black_De.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hyw.com/books/history/Black_De.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, some kind of online book, the numbers for total European population seem to be mainstream. 1345 levels aren't reached again until just after 1500. If we used just those numbers, it would show the whole crisis of the fourteenth century in one drop, which is dramatic and accurate, if oversimplified. We could work with that, but I'd like numbers before and after the plague too, so it doesn't look like it lasted until 1400, then went straight up.

<dl>
<dd>My sense is that the Vienna plague is both less major (or just less well known) and less certain to be bubonic plague.

<p>I despise reverts, especially since you can't explain much reasoning in an edit summary, so let me just explain here. I don't think it's a great idea to have a specific number in the very first sentence, as the figure varies so widely among reliable estmates that prominently placing "34 million" unduly implies some kind authoritativeness where there is little. The previous just "one-third" worked well. The <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Death_ffa3.html#Depopulation" title="Black Death">depopulation</a> section exists to analyze the figure, and does it more justice. Incidentally, that section cites 25 million as the most common figure, which is what I have always thought it was (though I may have wrote that section, so, eh). i.e., Europe's population was about 75-80 million, 1/3 die, equals about 25 million, but these are just <i>very</i> rough guestimates, extrapolated from smaller data. I'm interested which reference 34 million comes from, especially as 3<i>4</i> and not a rounder figure like 3<i>5</i> implies some kind of exactitude. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:08, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted back to the 34 million because I think a number is important for a reader who has no idea of the base population of Europe at the time. Numbers project the reality of the massive death toll more than percentages. Historical numbers are always suspect, subject to debate, and estimates at best. I suspect the 34 million is a quote/reference in an early version of the article. However, it wouldn't hurt to try and come up with a list of estimates and refine our figure. We could put in a low to high range.</dd>
<dd>I will try and go through my library in the next couple of weeks and see what estimates are available. Why don't you guys do the same. I have a couple of relatively current books -- but modern estimates are always based on the primary documents. During my academic lifetime at least, opinions have swung widely --- from "they were all exaggerated" to accepting their accounts without question. Since English speakers more readily access English primary documents, many estimates are based on the English experience, which most historians agree was higher than 30 percent. Areas in Eastern Europe had so few plague accounts that their information is usually not included. Outside of Europe, Middle Eastern and Asian sources are even harder to deal with. All these things make the process a frustrating one. Please don't take my revert personally. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 03:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would suggest that fixing the entire population of Europe at "75-80 million" is not much more exact than the "34 million" in question. But, I would also agree that it's more palatable to say "1/3rd" of the population - but again, fixing approximately 1/3 implies comfort with two ideas - the total population number, and the death toll. If I pick up 5 textbooks and get more than one number for total population of Europe, then this entire argument is difficult to sustain. 25 million dead, 34 million dead... I think we can all agree there were not more than 125 million in Europe and not less than 50 million at the time. I'm curious how EXACT we can assume the record-keeping was for every village, hamlet and berg in medieval Europe...?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my argument isn't whether 25 million is more orthodox or accurate than 34 million; I'd suggest that sticking with 1/3 is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Also, it's not altogether true that fixing a number would be more impactful than simply leaving it as a 3rd. 25 million people dying in China is, by pure numbers, not as significant as 25 million people dying in Canada. Why? 25 million out of 1 billion is 2.5%. 25 million out of 30 million is 83%. In other words, the sheer magnitude of the death toll is that it wiped out a 3rd of the population. Anyone can extrapolate that to any relevant comparison in whatever country they are reading the article and get some economies of scale to appreciate the impact. Had the plague happened with today's population in China, we'd be looking at over 334 million deaths, equivalent to the entire population of the United States. 207.219.117.254 21:53, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

If, in aggregate, the number of people becoming infected is equal to or greater than the number of people already infected, a disease is considered spreading. If the opposite is true, the disease is dieing out. So if you get the disease, but don't infect anyone else, you are contributing to the end of the epidemic, regardless of anything else. This is why the number one most important factor in an epidemic is isolating sick individuals. Also the black death returned every generation for centuries in smaller less lethal flare-ups and mutations, it never really entirely disappeared (article discusses it). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 15:23, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know about the prairie dog control idea -- sounds like something government would do. But isolated populations of California rodents were infected with plague during the Third Pandemic outbreak. It hit San Francisco when infected rats, fleas and people arrived in port from areas of China and India. New York City faced a similar problem in their dock area. The SF city rodents evidently spread the disease to some rural areas, and it has since staked out a place in wilderness areas. However, plague outbreaks and human casulties have always been limited in the western US. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 21:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason why people today have not died is because they're STILL ALIVE! Everybody dies, but most people die at an old age such as 70-100 years. The reason why a deadly pandemic is significant is that it a lot more people dying than would ordinarily, and those people can be of any age!</p>

<p>I think it should be good to include in the article somewhere that the people who lived during the plague years never called it that. They had a lot of names and almost everyone include some synonyme for big or great. In England there is "Great pestilence" and and "Great mortality" and even "Unprecedented pestilence". In Germany "Pestilentia magna" or "Grosse sterfde" (Big death),, in france "La gran mortalitat", in Italy "Grande moria" and so on. As far as I know the name "Black death" in any language did not appear until at least about 200 years afterwards and then first in Sweden and Denmark. From there it spread to Germany and onwards through the continent. It doesn't appear in Great Britain until 1823. I dont want to change the name of the article but I do feel that the name by which it was originally known should be mentioned somewhere.

<dd>I think they mean "blood groups". There's a theory out there, and the only reference I've seen to it is in a book by (IIRC) Richard Gordon, that people with Type B blood are less attractive to fleas. If so, and if plague is spread by fleas, and if the Black Death was plague (as I think it almost certainly is), then people with Type B blood would be less likely to develop bubonic plague. However I have no current reliable source for this. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 22:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a Muslim I have strong objection to this statement: “The people of Mecca blamed the disease on non-believers entering the city, but it is more likely to have arrived with Muslim pilgrims from surrounding infected areas.”</p>
<p>Islam does not teach superstition and no desease whatsoever is caused by infidels or non-beleivers. Moreover non-muslims are not allowed to enter mecca(since the time of the prophet) so the question of plague spreading through non-beleivers does not arise. This statement is merely an accusation hurled at Islam. Please do not repeat this.</p>

<dd>It's not an accusation directed at Islam. It's an accusation directed at imperfect humans who did not perfectly understand the word of Allah.

<p>I think its inappropriate for this article to focus on European accounts and the European side of the pandemic. The page on <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubonic_Plague_2a31.html" title="Bubonic Plague">Bubonic Plague</a> does not go into great detail about the Black Death pandemic, and so directing people there for non-european accounts seems not the thing to do. The Black Death may be a European name, but it was a huge deal in asia as well - adding to the decline of the mongol empire. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 08:10, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article said in it that the mongols used dead infected bodies as a form of biological war fare. The problema with this is that the germ theory of diesaes was only discovered in 1840 by Vienna doctor Ignaz Semmelweis and even at the time he discovered it there were two problems. 1, it was still considered a theory, no one believed his claims, he died in a mental institution b/c all other doctors were convinced he was a psycho. 2, the germ theory was not even accepted in most european countries more or less anywhere else in the world until 1865. There is simply no way that the mongols could have been purposely infecting people. Part of the reason why the bubonic plauge spread so fast was b/c people were stealing from infected people or people who died of infection and were getting infected by that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.108.138.142_305a.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.108.138.142">74.108.138.142</a> (talk) 01:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>What people believe isn't a Counter-argument.</li>
<li>I don't understand the analogy with European immigrants infecting Native Americans. How does that prove that Europeans were killed by a disease transmitted by rats? Possible increased immunity in the survivors and their descendents would hold true for any infectious disease.</li>

<dd>I agree with this, the section doesn't seem to fit very well.

<p>The current includes the following under the religion heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Black Death led to cynicism toward religious officials who could not keep their promises of curing plague victims and banishing the disease. No one, the Church included, was able to cure or accurately explain the reasons for the plague outbreaks. One theory of transmission was that it spread through air, and was referred to as miasma, or 'bad air'. This increased doubt in the clergy's abilities. Extreme alienation with the Church culminated in either support for different religious groups such as the flagellants, which from their late 13th century beginnings grew tremendously during the opening years of the Black Death, or to an increase in interest for more secular alternatives to problems facing European society and an increase of secular politicians. The Black Death hit the monasteries very hard because of their close quarters with the sick, who had come to the monasteries seeking aid, so that there was a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. This resulted in a mass influx of new clergy members, most of whom did not share the life-long convictions and experiences of the veterans they replaced. This led to abuses by the clergy in years afterwards and a further deterioration of the position of the Church in the eyes of the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lack of sources aside, this section has some problems.</p>
<p>1. Much of the scholarship in the field seems to point towards a strengthening of popular religion in the wake of the plague, rather than the weakening that is currently described. Herlihy's _Black Death and the Transformation of the West_ describes a strengthening of popular piety and a corresponding change in naming trends towards religions rather than local names. Economic histories like Miskimin's two volumes on the Economic History of Renaissance Europe, record an increase in donations to the church. Even the influx of clergy members and the increase in groups such as the flagellants indicate that religious piety was growing, not weakening. Certainly clasics like Bossy's _Christianity and the West_ support the idea that the catholic church came out of the plague years stronger than ever and riding a wave of intensified public piety.</p>
<p>2. The miasma theory of transmission seems out of place in this section.</p>
<p>Funkbot 19:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are right that "popular piety" increased, but cynicism towards established religion and a turn away from the Church and its officials was part of that. People turned away from the church and towards <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_piety.html" title="Popular piety">popular piety</a> - this is mainstream in any text book. Popular piety and the Church are two different things. As for economic donations that was because the Church was selling indulgences and other things which further alienated people (see Martin Luther). The idea that the Church came out of the crises of the late middle ages <i>stronger</i> is unusual, with the Reformation the church literally broke apart, this was not a strong Church, it remains broken apart to this day. BTW I just created the popular piety article a week ago it needs a lot of work, I was very surprised no one had created it yet. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:18, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article previously read that the Black Death "was the most devastating pandemic in human history." I have altered this line to read "was ONE OF the most devastating pandemics". In fact, estimates for the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic are as high as 100 million deaths, and many estimates for the death rates of Small Pox and other Pandemics amongst post-Columbian Native Americans rate as high or higher. The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plague_of_Justinian_2c2d.html" title="Plague of Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> may have killed as many as 100 million people as well, and may or may not have been the same disease responsible for the Black Death (Justinian's Plague is supposedly regarded as being Bubonic Plague, which the Black Death may or may not have been... but regardless it was a separate outbreak, and a separate pandemic with an equal or higher number of mortalities). It is completely unnecessary, and unwarranted, to resort to superlatives in the introduction of this article, since it mutes the significant level of controversy surrounding mortality figures and the very high body counts of comparable pandemics throughout history. Let's not rank things without substantial and verifiable justification. Thelastemperor 00:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree that worldwide ranking is rather dubious given the uncertainty over historical figures. However it was the worst pandemic in Europe in terms of proportion of the population killed by countries by a long way. I think that this article used to say 'in Europe' but somehow the statement became globalised. --<a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJBellis_bd93.html" title="User:JBellis">JBellis</a> 18:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article is trying for global coverage, which it didn't at one time, so that's probably what happened. I'm ok with the more general "one of" in the lead, and more specific "worst in European" further down in the article somewhere (not sure if it does). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
