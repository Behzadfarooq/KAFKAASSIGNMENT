<p>In episode 54, Conan encounters a tall, built member of the organization named Tequilia, however, he is killed in an explosion before Conan can gain any information.</p>
<p>In episode 128, the Black Organization planned to have a billion yen heist. <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_%28Case_Closed%29_ae34.html" title="Gin (Case Closed)">Gin</a> and Vodka were the members that made a plan to rob 10 billion <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yen.html" title="Yen">yen</a>. Conan stops the two again from stealing the yens, who escaped. After the episode, the organization introduces a member named <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiho_Miyano_594f.html" title="Shiho Miyano">Shiho Miyano</a>, also known as Sherry, the creator of APTX-4869. After the organization killed <a href="../../../a/k/e/Akemi_Miyano_883c.html" title="Akemi Miyano">Akemi Miyano</a>, Shiho's older sister, the organization makes an imprisonment for Sherry. In order to escape, Sherry takes her poison, and her body <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniaturization.html" title="Miniaturization">shrinks</a>. The organization finds out that Sherry has betrayed them, and needed to be destroyed. Later, Sherry lives with Dr. Agasa under her alias <a href="../../../a/i/_/Ai_Haibara_abbb.html" title="Ai Haibara">Ai Haibara</a>.</p>
<p>In episode 176-178, Conan encounters Gin and Vodka again. Ai is kidnapped and confined to a wine cellar, but turns into an adult after the wine spills on her. Despite wearing glasses and janitor clothing, Gin and Vodka recognize her and shoot her repeatedly unil Conan appears. He shoots Gin with his needle, but Gin doesn't fal asleep. He tells Ai to jump into the chimmey, and Vodka shoots at him, but he gets away. Gin purposely shoots himself in the arm due to trying to stay awake. Inside, Pisco almost kills her, but Conan rescues her after Pisco accidentally causes a fire. Gin kills Pisco for failure before he's able to tell him the truth about Shiho. Worried that the organization is after her, Ai decides to leave the city.</p>
<p>In episodes 309-311, Conan manages to arrange contact with Vodka of the organization, and goes to confront him in a trap, however, Gin arrives and realizes it's a set up. He and Vodka leave before Conan is able to find out more information about the BO.</p>
<p>Aside from Gin and Vodka being the most reoccurring members, a female member introduced late into the series named Vermouth also starts to play a huge role in the series. She makes her first appearance in episodes 176-178, but her talents aren't revealed until episode 230. She disguises herself as a doctor named Araide and is one of the few characters that learns who Conan really is. In one episode she is saved by Ran and Shinichi from falling through a fire escape, and keeps his secret unknown from the rest possibly because of this reason. She disguises herself as two well-known actresses, Chris Vineyard and Sharon Vineyard. It is noted several times in the series that she is a master of disguise, who trained with Shinichi's mother in the past.</p>
<p>In episode 345, many identities are finally unveiled: Vermouth is revealed to be Araide, Chris Vineyard, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Vineyard_fed3.html" title="Sharon Vineyard">Sharon Vineyard</a>, and the silver-haired serial killer in Shinichi's New York Case; Jodie Saintemillion is revealed to be an undercover FBI agent working towards capturing Vermouth, who killed her father when she was younger; Akai Shuichi is confirmed to be an FBI agent, and one with great skill too--enough to make the boss of the Black Organization believe that he is their <i>Silver Bullet.</i> Near the end of the episode, it becomes clear that Vermouth's purpose was to seek and eliminate Sherry, but her attempts are thwarted by several people: Shinichi/Conan, Jodie Saintemillion, Akai Shuichi, and even Ran. When she becomes cornered, she takes Conan hostage and drives away into a forest. There, she makes a call to her boss (still nameless), and to her surprise, Conan was recording the entire conversation. In order to preserve the organization's secrecy, she sprays sleeping gas in the car, putting both herself and Conan to sleep. She claims that this would be a duel--whoever wakes up first will win. Vermouth does indeed wake up first, but does not kill Conan. Instead, she just crushes his recording device. Ultimately, the only clue Conan gained from this whole ordeal is the ringtone that the boss uses; this is mentioned in episode 425 as well, although its importance has not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>Although Vermouth often comes off as evil and malicious, her allegiance is actually rather ambiguous. She chooses to protect both Conan/Shinichi and Ran, most likely because they let her live back in the New York Case when she was disguised as the silver-haired serial killer. At the end of the episode, she could have very well killed Shinichi, but instead she lets him live and even drapes her coat over his sleeping body so he wouldn't get cold. It seems that she wishes for the Black Organization to be taken down as well--for she believes that Kudo Shinichi is their true <i>Silver Bullet.</i></p>
<p>In episode 425, the Black Organization introduces three new members, Chianti, Kir, and Korn, who first make their introduction in the 16th Opening episodes before their actual appearance in the series. Episode 425 is also the first to show the most BO members in one episode. Chianti and Korn are introduced in the very beginning of episode 425 as highly trained assassins that Gin recruits after seeing their sniping skills. Kir is first introduced to Conan and the others as a news reporter (Rena Mizunashi) and a friend of Yoko Okino's, however, she is revealed as a member of the black corps later on. After encountering FBI during her mission, Kir tries to flee, but gets knocked unconscious and crashes, resulting in her getting taken by the FBI agents. However, a spoiler in the 17th Opening shows her as part of Gin, Vodka, and Vermouth's group already foreshadowing that, despite her injuries, she may also start to play a huge role in the series. This speculation is also supported in the manga, where <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heiji_Hattori_9047.html" title="Heiji Hattori">Heiji Hattori</a> mentions she has been seen in Osaka before.</p>
<p>A mysterious boy named Eisuke with a link to the BO appears in episodes 429-430, and joins most of the following cases attempting to gain information on Rena Mizunashi's whereabouts. Conan updates Jodie on his actions after learning he may have a possible connection to her. It is unknowm if Eisuke is an actual member, however, according to Conan, he is being used by them.</p>
<p>In episodes 462-465, the BO reveals some infomrmation about Kir and Eisuke's father. Eisuke appears to be linked to the BO, as Conan notices similarities between him and Kir, and he also appears to be gaining info on the secret behind Kogoro's cases. In addition, Vermouth is revealed to be linked to another murder.</p>
<p>The Black Organization tends to kill anyone who stumbles upon their secret, however, as of now, the Black Organization's main purpose and goal still remains unknown. Currently, the detainment of the member Kir, as well as the Boss's ringtone, appear to be the only source of information Conan and the FBI can use to learn the true intentions behind the Black Organization.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Other Members:</b> In episode 425, the only new members to have appeared and lived are Kir, Chianti and Korn (other new members have usually died in the episode of their appearance, such as Tequilia, Pisco, Akemi, etc). In Opening 16, there are a few other members that are silouetted behind Gin, Vodka, and Vermouth. Only Chianti, Korn, and Kir are shown close-up later in this opening animation, and properly introduced in episode 425. Currently, a new member named Kusuda Rikumichi has been revealed, but died in the same volume of his appearance. A speculative member Andre Camel has appeared, but it is unknown if he's an actual member, as with the case with Eisuke Hondou.</p>
<p><b>Current Status:</b> Currently, the Black Organization is searching for Rena Mizunashi, and is speculated by Conan to be using Eisuke in oder to find her. As of volume 57, Conan believes the Black Orgnization may have finally located the hospital she's resting at, and he and the Jodie are currently on their way there to have her moved. In addition, Kir has finally awakened by the end of Chapter 596. In Chapter 597, Kir shows signs that she is a Great Actor, as she can even fool the docter by thinking that she is still asleep. Also Conan and Akai figures the Black Organization Nakama to be the fake patient Kusuda Rikumichi. After confronting him, Conan and Shuichi go after him in a car, but he commits suicide. In chapters 600-602, the BO has launched three accidents that have countless people running to the hospital. They began sending bombs to people's rooms, and eventually trick the FBI into going to Rena's room, thus, revealing her location.</p>
<p><b>Appearances:</b> Appearances consist of different members of the organization who are shown in each episode, and are not limited to flashbacks.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Manga To Anime:</b> The first season of Detective Conan, featured The Organization scarcely, due to the writers wanting to down play their presense.<a href="http://www.tv.com/case-closed/mystery-mastermind/episode/336019/trivia.html#notes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/case-closed/mystery-mastermind/episode/336019/trivia.html#notes" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Two of the episodes at least, were altered heavily in light of it:</p>
<p><b>Episode 5, The Shinkansen's Bomb Case:</b> The episode has Conan running into lookalikes of the men who druggged him. Volume 4 of the manga, however, it is the same guys. In fact, that story has him learning their code name (Gin/Vodka in the Japanese Version, Melkior and Kaspar in the English Version.)</p>
<p><b>Episode 13, The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case:</b> In the episodes end, Masami runs into the criminal in charge the recent murders. She survives a gunshot wound thanks to Conan. The manga version, which is in Volume 2, the masterminds are Gin and Vodka.</p>
<p>Masami is actually Akemi Miyano, and stole the yen to buy her sister out of the organization. Upon refusal to give the location Gin (who has an idea where it is) shoots her. Conan arrvies shortly to try helping Akemi. He gives her his real name, and before dying she tell Conan the location of the yen.</p>
<p>The anime had to do a similar story in Episode 128 <b>The Black Corps One Billion Yen Robbery Case</b> in order to repair the storyline.</p>

<li>Although <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermouth.html" title="Vermouth">Vermouth</a>'s true appearance is a young woman, confirmed by <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuichi_Akai_121c.html" title="Shuichi Akai">Shuichi Akai</a> in episode 345, it still does not explain why she does not appear to age--the very question that she never answered when Jodie confronted her about it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to the Organization only the "Silver Bullet" can defeat/kill them, Vermouth believes that Conan/Shinichi is their "Silver Bullet".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So far, the youngest member still in the Organization is revealed to be <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rena_Mizunashi_9b3f.html" title="Rena Mizunashi">Kir</a> at age 27. <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherry.html" title="Sherry">Sherry</a> is actually much younger, as her age was revealed to be 18, and her sister is in her early twenties. The oldest member was <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisco.html" title="Pisco">Pisco</a> (currently deceased). The oldest living member so far appears to be <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korn.html" title="Korn">Korn</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Episodes 462-465 will mark the first 4-part episode dealing with the BO without it being aired as a special.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the course of the series, almost every member had some kind of individual contact with Conan/Shinichi; <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">Gin</a> in the ep1 and ep178 when Conan shoots him with his needle while hiding, <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">Vodka</a> during the course of ep309-311, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermouth.html" title="Vermouth">Vermouth</a> in ep345, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kir.html" title="Kir">Kir</a> in ep425, <a href="../../../a/k/e/Akemi_Miyano_883c.html" title="Akemi Miyano">Akemi Miyano</a> in ep128, <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisco.html" title="Pisco">Pisco</a> in ep178, <a href="../../../t/e/q/Tequila.html" title="Tequila">Tequila</a> ep54, and Kusuda Rikumichi in Chapter 598(no anime appearance yet).</li>
