<p>I for one would like to see a stamp put on this article. I find its current contents notably biased and past renditions to likewise have problems. Obviously this is a politically charged issue that causes many to take sides instead of reporting facts. There is a desire by one group to protect practices despite obvious questions that should be raised and another group attempting to report practices and opinions as official positions and doctrine. Adjoining to either of these extremes and producing wikiarticles/edits along those lines is misleading. This is not a neutral article and there is too much conjecture. -- 206.196.172.2 12:16, 17 May 2006</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with User:206.196.172.2, and I would like to make the following recommendations:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia style guide states: "If possible, terms used to describe people should be given in such a way that they qualify other nouns. Thus, black people, not blacks; gay people, not gays; and so forth." Therefore, I take issue with the title of this article. I understand that it used be titled "Blacks and the priesthood (LDS)," but that is equally problematic. I recommend something like: Racial policies of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The following statement violates the neutral point of view NPOV)&#160;: "Some leaders of the LDS Church have disavowed certain past explanations as to why the priesthood ban was instituted by God, but the Church has never disavowed the teaching that the ban was, in fact, instituted by God. According to official statements and declarations of the LDS Church, God was the source of the priesthood ban for blacks." While this may be true, by placing this stement in the introcution, the author betrays his bias. An encyclepedic article should attempt to present the facts nuetrally without passing judgement. Recommend that the issue of diavowal be treated in a seperate section of the article rather than the lead section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would further recommend that the section headings follow a more chronological layout. By focusing on the history of the policy, it may be easier for authors and present the facts more nuetrally.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example:
<ul>
<li>Section 1: Racial policies of Jospeh Smith (1830-1844) This section might include Joseph's statements for abolishion and the example of Elijah Abel.</li>
<li>Section 2: Racial policies of Brigham Youn (1847-1877). This section should include the discussion of the curse of Cain. Someone might also contribute his views on Native Americans.</li>
<li>Section 3: Justifications of Jospeh F. Smith (1901-1918). This section would include the discussion of the curse of Ham.</li>
<li>Section 4: The Way to Perfection by Joseph Filding Smith (1970). This section would discuss the theory that people of Afican descent were somehow less valient than others in the pre-mortal life. This theory had roots farther back in history, but it achieved a quasi-offcial status upon the publication of The Way to Perfection which was often quoted by other leaders of the church.</li>
<li>Section 5: Policy modifications by David O. McKay (1951-1970). A white man of Africn descent received the priesthood, and in an official statement, President McKay admitted that the reasons for the ban were not fully known.</li>
<li>Section 6: Official Declaration 2 (1979).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This layout would also make it easier for other contributers to insert sections referring to the athletic boycotts at BYU in the 1960s, and the disavowal non-news item of the 1990s.</dd>

<dd>The problem of course is that this article is not about all racial policies. It is about a single racial policy. Or rather it isn't about policies for more than one race (or ethnicity). I think this issue is significant enough that it should not be grouped with other racial policies/issues. I should also mention that much of the POV 206.196.172.2 may have been referring to was taken out when I removed the copyright material last week. --<a href="../../../k/m/s/User%7EKmsiever_02b6.html" title="User:Kmsiever">Kmsiever</a> 22:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The title of the article is still in violation of the Wikipedia style guide: "If possible, terms used to describe people should be given in such a way that they qualify other nouns. Thus, black people, not blacks; gay people, not gays; and so forth." '<i>Blacks and Mormonism</i> is not acceptable. I wrote a paper in college titled <a href="http://www.geocities.com/solmes.geo/african_american_mormons.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/solmes.geo/african_american_mormons.html" rel="nofollow"><i>African American Mormons and the Evolution of Church Policy</i></a>. Maybe <i>Policies and doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regarding persons of African descent</i>. That's pretty long. How about: <i>Policies of the LDS Church regarding Africans</i>. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 06:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, the policies were not directed specifically at Africans; they were also directed at Jamaicans, Americans, Brazilians, English, Canadians, Australians. Anyone who was Black. I am not arguing in favour of the current title, only that I cannot think of another that works as well. In other words, I am not sure it is possible (to quote the style guide). --<a href="../../../k/m/s/User%7EKmsiever_02b6.html" title="User:Kmsiever">Kmsiever</a> 07:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's a flag at the top of the article requesting that the article be wikified. The tag has been there for more than a month now. Does anyone here know what it means exactly?

<p>I deleted the following paragraph because it does not seem relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As slaves in the new America began converting to Christianity, their Christian owners adopted interpretations of the Word of God that justified the practices of the time. State legislatures also took action. North Carolina made it illegal to teach slaves in 1740, Georgia in 1770, Missouri in 1817, Virginia in 1819, Mississippi in 1823, Louisiana in 1830, and Alabama in 1832. Other laws were enacted in Delaware and Florida to punish slaves for congregating. At the same time, several states prevented Negroes from working at jobs requiring a "knowledge of letters". Churches were giving in to the pressures of the law and the wrath of wealthy slave owners by backing away from actively proselytizing Negroes. Abolitionists and proslavery activists alike focused their respective arguments on the Bible as tensions mounted during the great religious revival in the south between 1829 and 1835. (James O. Buswell III, Slavery, Segregation, and Scripture , 1964, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. pp. 37-45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just don't see how giving the years that several states out-lawed the teaching of blacks has any impact on blacks and Mormonism. If there is a connection that I'm not seeing then the author needs to draw it more clearly.<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The following has been added to the begining of the article:
<blockquote>
<p>When Joseph Smith declared Jackson County to be the land of Zion and gathering place for the members the new church, it had been illegal to educate or proselytize blacks in Missouri since 1817 (James O. Buswell III, Slavery, Segregation, and Scripture , 1964, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. pp. 37-45) As it became known that Mormons had begun preaching to the local Native Americans, the suspicions of Missouri citizens were raised that the large numbers of voting Mormons would threaten their policies on people of color.</p>
</blockquote>
I remain unconvinced that (1) laws prohibiting the education of blacks, (2) the mission to preach to Native Americans, or (3) the Mormons voting power are relevent to this discussion.--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 19:40, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is really too long. I think one of the least painful things that should be trimmed out is Official Declaration 2. Of course it is a very important part of this topic, but it is not necessary to quote the entire text in this article, when it is so easy to link to at any one of several sources. -<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a></p>
<p><br />
Although more painful, I think another possible edit might be to remove the section titled "Revelation or policy." Certainly, the debate over whether the priesthood ban was a matter of revelation or a matter of policy is an important one, but the title of this article is Blacks and Mormonism, which suggests a social and historical discussion. The section about the debate between revelation or policy is really a theological discussion. I suggest this article be divided in two: Blacks and Mormonism will discuss the relationship between those two groups, and another article, perhaps titled: The Priesthood Ban, would discuss the myriad theological issues regarding this policy (or revelation).

I have deleted the following paragraphs for the reasons noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The church always allowed black membership in all its congregations. The priesthood ban typically applied to men of black African descent regardless of skin color (white Afrikaaners and Armenian Egyptians, for example, were not under this ban), although it occasionally applied to other races or lineages (including some Caucasians). Dark-skinned South <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Islanders_91a8.html" title="Pacific Islanders">Pacific Islanders</a> were ordained to the priesthood, for example, while light-skinned Africans were not. <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Islanders_91a8.html" title="Pacific Islanders">Native Americans</a> were always eligible for priesthood ordination, despite having dark skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement merely serves to define the nature of the priesthood ban, again. It should not be necessary to define the nature of the ban more than once in this article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A relatively modern Prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, taught that, after accepting the Gospel, dark-skinned people would gradually be made white, a process that would take place over a significant number of generations. It has been upheld by Mormon apologists as a meaningful relationship between "lighter skin" and "good character" and "God's approval" or "pure in spirit", and seeks to vindicate the racial belief that a lighter skinned individual inherently exhibits a better character or that their lighter skin is a reflection of God's blessing. After visiting a mission site in South America, he said in his <i>General Conference Report</i> of October, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> (quite a number of years before he became the president of the church), which was published in <i>Improvement Era</i>, December <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, pp 922-923:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw a striking contrast in the progress of the Indian people today.... The day of the Lamanites is nigh. For years they have been growing delightsome, and they are now becoming white and delightsome, as they were promised. In this picture of the twenty Lamanite missionaries, fifteen of the twenty were as light as Anglos, five were darker but equally delightsome. The children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation. At one meeting a father and mother and their sixteen-year-old daughter were present, the little member girl--sixteen--sitting between the dark father and mother, and it was evident she was several shades lighter than her parents--on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather... These young members of the Church are changing to whiteness and to delightsomeness. One white elder jokingly said that he and his companion were donating blood regularly to the hospital in the hope that the process might be accelerated.</p>
</blockquote>
Kimball's use of the phrase "white and delightsome" refers to a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> prophecy regarding the future status of the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamanite.html" title="Lamanite">Lamanite</a> people, generally accepted by Latter-day Saints as the ancestors of modern <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Indians_in_the_United_States_3f41.html" title="American Indians in the United States">American Indians</a>. It is unclear whether he meant for this change to apply to blacks or other groups. (For a Mormon apologetic examination of this issue, see the <a href="http://www.shields-research.org/42_Questions/ques03.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.shields-research.org/42_Questions/ques03.htm" rel="nofollow">SHIELDS</a> web site.)</blockquote>
<p>President Kimballs statements are very interesting, but the scope of this article is limited to Blacks and Mormonism. A seperate article on Native Americans and Mormonism would be very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other church leaders have stated that the priesthood would be given to blacks after the blood of Israel flowed in the veins of all peoples of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fact would be interesting if it were part of a real paragraph, but standing alone it is not. Generally, references to church leaders" should be avoided. I don't think it would be too difficult to find an actual quote to attribute to an actual leader. Bruce R. McConkie comes to mind for this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to his ex-Mormon grandson <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Benson_784c.html" title="Steve Benson">Steve Benson</a>, <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Taft_Benson_b946.html" title="Ezra Taft Benson">Ezra Taft Benson</a>, who succeeded Kimball as President of the Church, was a noted racist <a href="http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon409.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon409.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. However, while acting as President of the Church, he did not make a single remark that could be accurately construed as racist; on the contrary, while prophet he publicly affirmed his love for all of God's children, "of every color, creed and political persuasion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve Benson's opinion on his father's racial attitudes is really not relevant to this article. Ezra Taft Benson's racial attitudes might be relevant, but "nothing" is offered here, literally: "he did not make one single remark."</p>

<p>The article is currently 47K long. The article is also exclusively about <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> and its treatment of blacks. While the most widely known, it is not the only church in the LDS movement. There is nothing about the Community of Christ (formerly RLDS) which probably ordained blacks earlier. From the statements from Warren Jeffs (that were released to the public by a third party), I suspect that the FLDS church doesn't even ordain blacks now days. (Do they even have any black members?) I propose the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Early LDS movement (Before death of Joseph Smith, Jr.): includes information currently in those sections.</li>
<li>By denomination: (But find a better name) Explain briefly in this section about succession crisis (w/link to that article) and sects that resulted.
<ul>
<li>LDS Church: Since this is the largest part of the article (and will likely remain so), split this off in to its own article with a summary here.</li>
<li>Community of Christ</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What do others think about this structure? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 16:47, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would not favor a split of the article, but certainly believe the article could be greatly shortened. As I read the article there is a lot of redundancy. A great deal could be deleted. The LDS point to make is Blacks were initially ordained to the priesthood, Joseph was an abolitionist, and later blacks were not allowed to hold the priesthood and why, and then a statement when all worthy males were allowed to hold the priesthood. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this article will need to be split, but I don't think denominations will be the right way. I think seperate articles on history and theology might be a good idea, but first this article needs structure. Currently it meanders something awful, which has lead to a great deal of redundancy. My personal views on the topic have been greatly influenced by a book titled <i>Neither White Nor Black.</i> The structure of Chapter 3 is historical with emphasis on how the nature and justification of the priesthood ban changed over time. The book is out of print, but the full text is available online <a href="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I suggest the following structure:
<ul>
<li>Blacks and Joseph Smith</li>
<li>Blacks and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
<ul>
<li>Blacks and Brigham Young (includig discussion of the Curse of Cain)</li>
<li>Blacks and Joseph F. Smith (including discussion of the Curse of Ham)</li>
<li>Blacks and Joseph Fielding Smith (including discussion of the faithfulness in the pre mortal life)</li>
<li>Blacks and David O. McKay (including discussion of the Civil Rights Movement)</li>
<li>Blacks and Spencer W. Kimball (including discussion of Official Declaration 2)</li>

<p>I think the structure should generally be as suggested by <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a>, in that there is a separate section about Mormon theology and policy regarding Blacks during the life of Joseph Smith, followed by a per-denomination discussion. The LDS section, which will undoubtedly be the largest by far, might be split off as a separate article (with an abbreviated summary here), and it might follow the general outline suggested by <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a>. The split-off article could be called <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_997c.html" title="Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (which currently redirects here). <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 07:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I took a shot at summarizing the section on the LDS Church and starting a seperate article on the redirect page. I fear I was a little extreme, but the structure and content was so disjointed and meandering that I used an old college paper that I wrote on the subject. It's a good paper. I got an A, but I think the tone might be a little casual for an encyclopedia. That shouldn't be difficult to fix.
<dl>
<dd>I skimmed through your paper and I think it's a good starting-point. Is there any significant information from the old version that got lost in the process? <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 16:56, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think so. The other contributors seemed to be making essentially the same points, using different quotations for support and all going in different directions. Now that I think about it the section on internal dissenting voices does not make an appearence in the new article. Personally, I don't consider it relevant. Members of the Chruch cannot influence policy that way, but it does say something about how members felt about the restriction. I will work it back in. Another section on whether or not the priesthood restriction representeed a policy or a doctrine recives only a single sentence in the new article. Whoever contributed that section obviously felt strongly about it, but it seemed obvious to me that it was a theological discussion, perhaps unsuited to an encyclopedia. What do you think? --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 00:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The entire section entitled Dark skin as a curse is about verses in the Book of Mormon. I am not aware of anyone using verses from the Book of Mormon to justify the priesthood ban. Although it is interesting information, in the interest of brevity and clarity, I recommend that the entire section be struck.

<dd>I think the <i>Book of Mormon</i> cites are <i>relevant</i>, in that the book provides a foundation in Mormon theology for the idea that dark skin is a curse. However, citations to the <i>Book of Mormon</i> should be qualified, to make clear that the book does not reference people of African ancestry. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 07:48, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It seems that this articles only difference is the inclusion of splinter groups, which could be the meat of this article, and have a link to the main LDS article. I also think this and the LDS article should read like a history lesson. No judgments, no POV. Simply a history of blacks role in the church and church policy, with some explanation of why, but noting that the why is speculative as there is no official doctrine on the why. Start with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith_3f60.html" title="Joseph Smith">Joseph Smith</a>, and end with the baptism of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_Knight_a348.html" title="Gladys Knight">Gladys Knight</a>.

<dd>I would not favor a merger. I think splitting the page is the best way to respect the Latter-day Saint movement as a whole. I agree that there are really two ways to tackle the issue at hand. During the 1960s, LDS historians did a great deal of research and writing on this topic and a discussion of the policy is pretty much a straightforward review of historical events. That is what I had intended the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_997c.html" title="Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> to be; although it does also contain discussion of doctrine.
<ol>
<li>Discussions of the beliefs and doctrines supporting the policy are much slipperier, primarily because Mormon Doctrine is a slippery thing. The curse of Ham, the curse of Cain and the idea the blacks were less valiant in the pre mortal life were all taught by prophets and apostles of the Church at one time or another. Today we say that they were never official doctrine, but at the time, I'm not sure anyone was saying that, so I would support splitting the topic further to create a third page which discusses just the doctrines. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_81de.html" title="Blacks and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Blacks and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> is too long anyway. We still have a redirect page at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_the_Priesthood_%28LDS%29_1019.html" title="Blacks and the Priesthood (LDS)">Blacks and the Priesthood (LDS)</a>. Of course, such a page should link back to the other two pages, and they should link to it.</li>
<li>I agree that <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> is the right place to start, but <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_Knight_a348.html" title="Gladys Knight">Gladys Knight</a> is not the right place to end. I think the ordination of Helvecio Martins to the Second Quorum of the Seventy is the most logical place to end. Gladys Knight is more famous, but she does not hold the priesthood.</li>
<li>Finally, I also agree that the issue of baptism could and should be discussed earlier in the page. Perhaps by inserting the story of Jane Manning James. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 18:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

So far the ANON has said nothing that can be measured or corrected. She/he has stated an opinion that up to now is unsupported. Either meet the demands of policy or remove the tag. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:20, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here are some passages I think reflect what the initiator of this thread was talking about:
<ul>
<li><i>"Possible intermarriage wilth local tribes would explain both the heritable nature of the dark skin and the sudden change from civilized Hebrew society to a loin-cloth culture of idleness, 'full of mischief and subtlety'."</i> (This passage appears to treat BOM events as historical fact rather than explain the article's topic.)</li>
<li>The discussion of Smith's "people of Canaan" and their supposedly nonexistant relationship with to Canaanites seems contrived. Is there evidence that Smith meant a group <i>besides</i> the Canaanites? this may or may not be a true POV issue, but it certainly needs more context</li>
<li>The Civil War prophesy section barely mentions race (saying only that slaves will rise up against their masters) and mostly seems to be a place to say that Smith made a prophesy of coming war (which was also a quite common fear throughout the country at the time).</li>
<li>There is undue weight in the "Joseph Smith on the Bible and slavery" and "Abolistionists" sections. These should be <i>short</i> summaries, perhaps with links to the full text in Wikisource</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There's more, but I've taken a stab at at least <i>some</i> of it. -<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorlob_881a.html" title="User:Porlob">Porlob</a> 15:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I worked on the article today and though I think I have improved it by deleting unneeded material, improving grammar, and adding citations; I have come to the conclusion it is generally in keeping with NPOV policy, but it is a poorly written article. It really just is a collection of thoughts about blacks within Mormonism. There does not seem to be an "article" per se, just a list of statements.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that the article could be improved by writing a narrative supported by references, which are found in the current list. The question is how do we begin the rewrite without entering into disputes. I have found change very difficult to come by with groups of editors. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:12, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe that is what's wrong with it... By the way, good work on what you've done in the last day or so. I agree that the article could use a significant overhaul. A rewrite might take care of perceived POV and other issues. Other than the instances I noted above (some of which you've already taken to task), I don't have any specific suggestions). -<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorlob_881a.html" title="User:Porlob">Porlob</a> 14:03, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
