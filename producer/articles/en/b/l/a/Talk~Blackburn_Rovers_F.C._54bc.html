<p>I've been filling out the early history, but I'm a little bit concerned that I'm including too much detail. I figured it was a good idea to cover the early years well, certainly up until the team moved to Ewood.

<dd>~!~Just thought I'd make a note of the epic journey that occured between my recent edits: Just after moving the latin motto into the badge image caption in the article, my PC power supply (350W ATX) suddenly failed. Eeek! I had to dive into the loft and find an old machine to rob of its power supply. Sadly i am gay, during my little escapades with my parter darrell robertshaw (my close friend/gay lover)we seemed that to have a busted fan... it worked, but with no air flow its not a good idea to run it for any extended period of time. A bit of fan surgery later, and everything seems to be working (for the moment)... no reason to mention it, other than I'm feeling good. More on-topic, I'd like to add more detailed information about Ewood Park (on its own article of course) -- its construction and history... the architects etc etc, but there's not much info. I took a trip to the library, but couldn't find anything. Anyone know of a good source? <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> 11:07, 2005 May 27 (UTC)AND daryll robertshaw has been given the "Biggest gay" of britain award because of his campnus.</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for editing the Blackburn Rovers article. I've reverted some your changes and I thought I should let you know why. As I tried to explain in the edit summary, the introduction is supposed to serve as a summary of the entire article -- for readers who just want quick information -- as recommended in the Wikipedia style guide. I'm sure it can be improved though... so feel free to edit again bearing in mind its function. Thanks. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 19:06, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, I was concerned about the intro becoming a second history section which was happening with some other club articles, but now that I've re-read it I can see it more as a summary. I just made one minor change that isn't really summary information (League Cup score), and expanded upon it in the "new millenium" section. And I assure you it's not just because I'm a Spurs fan!&#160;;) - <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal_3bfe.html" title="User:Pal">Pal</a> 20:44, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted the edits by this IP because <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Douglas_6e47.html" title="Jonathan Douglas">Jonathan Douglas</a> does have an entry on Wikipedia, which mentions his association with BR. Jonathon Douglas does not. I don't know if the wikipedia article is wrong, but it made me suspicious, and so I reverted all four edits by 195.8.163.194 -- which included a couple of removed players -- pending some more checks. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 12:37, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this section is a bit dubious at best... but I've just removed some players from the section. They didn't have wikipedia entries (or had ones for other people with the same name). If anyone wants to add them back, could they please provide a source for them. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:58, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section has been aded to quite a bit recently. There have been no sources quoted for the entries, and besides that I really don't see what it's supposed to add to the article. There's also the difficult issue of what constitutes "famous". So I'm removing it. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 20:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I edited the links section, however given my potential bias (I am an admin of brfcs.com and co-founder of BRISA) I figured it was better to be upfront about this and get some peer review.</p>
<p>I added BRISA. BRISA was formed after the club disbanded the official supporters associations and to my knoweldge is the only supporters association recognised by the club (other than a couple of indendant travel clubs and the Disabled Supporters Association with still operates under the club's "official" banner).</p>
<p>I added BRFCS.COM. For many years this has been the most used supporters web site. It is also referenced in the discussion section of this page.</p>
<p>I reworded the RoverTalk link. The "Fans Forum" is a recognised focus group run by the club, so I reworded it "fans chat forum" to avoid it being mistaken for the official group.</p>
<p>I removed the link to the official message boards (as they are simply part of the official website, which is already linked).</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to editing on wikipedia, so I won't be offended if my changes are removed.</p>

<p>Well, in the trivia section of this article, it is stated that Blackburn beat Man United 18-0 in a pre-season friendly. Does anyone know exactly in what year this occured. I feel that it is best to include the year in which this happened for greater accuracy.

<dd>I've checked every section I can think of in the Mike Jackman Encyclopedia (probably the most authorative Rovers reference there is) and it makes no reference of this.

<p>You may have noticed that there's been a bit of a revert war over who are Rovers' main rivals.</p>
<p>For purposes of clarity Rovers' main rivals are in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Burnley</li>
<li>Bolton</li>
<li>possibly Man Utd, but also possibly Preston</li>
</ol>
<p>Accrington Stanley aren't a rival due to them - until this season at least - being a non-league side...</p>
<p>D-Notice 23:19, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I too seem to have become embroiled in this.... it's clearly vandalism, but very subtle and well... odd. also had to remove some rubbish about a 'best fanzine seller'</p>

<p>I found a survey which, I reluctantly say, indeed has 1. Burnley, 2. Bolton, 3. Man Utd. I personally disagree with this. Anyone who thinks MU are our rivals clearly hasn't moved on from the 90's. Historically, there is no doubt that PNE should occupy 3rd spot. I'm not sure what people would like to do. The survey was completed in 2003 and I suspect things may be different now, but it's the only source I can find so surely it has to be used. Here it is anyway: <a href="http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf</a> 80.189.230.94 04:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's just silliness from young kids who don't know the historic rivalry that Rovers and Burnley have had down the years. I just wish Burnley were good again&#160;:-( <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimokay_fcec.html" title="User:Jimokay">Jimokay</a> 23:52, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although i think he is a decent player, i do not think this guy deserves to be in "notable former or serving players" section. Maybe its just me but i would class 'notable' as a player who has atleast moderate fame with the fans or media. This guy is still young and does not really qualify for it, heck even Matt Derbyshire is more notable than sergio peter and he isnt listed!

<dd>The vadalism may be in part related to users affiliated with certain Rovers forums. I noticed that since I updated the links section in September the order has been changed (moving one site up the list) and one of the links has been slighty modified to an incorrect url (and incorrect desciption). Is there an easy way to spot when the changes were made without stepping through every revision&#160;? Anyway, locked to non-registered users gets my vote. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlamTilt_e0fb.html" title="User:SlamTilt">SlamTilt</a> 10:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
