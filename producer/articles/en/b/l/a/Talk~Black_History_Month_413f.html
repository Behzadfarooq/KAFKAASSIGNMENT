<p>Black History Month is celebrated&#160;? Perhaps someone can add to the article to qualify this statement. It may be celebrated, but by whom&#160;? Not many black British that I know have heard of it. The article at the moment has the distinct and misleading inference that celebration is widespread in the UK, whether amongst the British people at large, or considering black British people as a separate group. On either account, there is little widespread knowledge currently of this celebration.</p>

<p>less it can be proven that Woodson was not aware that February is the shortest month, I think this statement should be removed. —<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleminra_45b2.html" title="User:Fleminra">Fleminra</a> 04:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"February was chosen as Black History Month because the birthdays of the esteemed black abolitionist Frederick Douglass and the celebrated black poet Langston Hughes fall during that month. It's also the month the NAACP was founded. It just so happens that February is the shortest and one of the coldest months of the year." &lt;<a href="http://www.freemaninstitute.com/woodson.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.freemaninstitute.com/woodson.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freemaninstitute.com/woodson.htm</a>&gt; a google search turns up many references to it being an odd coincidence that February (shortest and coldest month), even going so far as to debunk conspiracy theories. —User:66.82.9.57 (aka User:66.82.9.33?)
<dl>
<dd>If you find a quote from Woodson that says "I did not realize that February was the shortest month," then I think the statement could stay. Otherwise, it would probably be more fair to say "Woodson either failed to realize that February is the shortest month of the year, or did realize it but decided that the month's length was less important than the fact that three important black-history anniversaries fall in February."</dd>
<dd>Can you elaborate on your argument above? I'm pretty sure I don't understand, but is it:
<ol>
<li>Three important events in black history occurred in February.</li>
<li>This outcome is an "odd" (i.e. improbable) coincidence.</li>
<li>An improbable outcome suggests the existance of unknown ("secret") factor(s), i.e. a conspiracy.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If this is where you're leading, what is the theoretical conspiracy and who are the conspirators? What evidence <i>supports</i> (not debunks) the theory? Your last statement seems to contradict my #3 above, which is what I'm confused about. Thanks.. —<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleminra_45b2.html" title="User:Fleminra">Fleminra</a> 19:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You must note that I am not the same one who added it the article, I was just looking around and saw that and decided to see if I could verify it. I do not believe that he literally failed to realize it, as whoever added that put, but I do think that it may be noteworthy to mention in that it is quite the coincidence, being how ironic it seems. With a quick search of the internet it is quickly evident that many do wonder why this month was chosen and it is often discussed whether the shortest month thing is a conspiracy or not (which, most likely, is not the case). So, I suppose what I am saying is that, he didn't necessarily fail to realize it as the author says, but, instead, the case is that it is just an unlucky coincidence. 204.38.166.4 19:28, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, this is silly to argue about. Black History Month didn't occur until the 1960s. According to <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmintro1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmintro1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmintro1.html</a>, Woodson chose the second week in February to be Black History Week back in 1926. This was apparently due to the birthdates of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. The site above lists a number of events that make it all the more appropriate to pack it all into 28 1/4 days (on average). So it's probably time to give up the conspiracy stuff. Woodson apparently thought a week was sufficient to draw attention to the richness of Black history. February is simply more appropriate than any other month for a lot better reasons than length.

<p>Am I the only person here who believe abraham lincoln was not black. Lincoln has very little to do with black history. I don't want to here he emancipateted the slaves because by the time Lincoln won the war the south had pretty much already abolished it or was pretty close to it. Also black history month is in Canada, I know that first hand <a href="http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=340&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" class="external free" title="http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=340&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=340&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0</a> How has Lincoln affected black history in Canada. Unless someone has some evidence to support these claims I think it should be disembowled from the article.</p>
<p>which claims? i'm pretty sure that this is about AMERICAN black history, and i'm pretty sure he did play an important role. and whether or not you believe this to be true, it doesn't matter, february was chosen, partly because of his birthday, so i'm pretty sure he is worth mentioning...</p>

<p>I don't even like Malcolm X but it is going on a limb calling him a militant. wiki defines a militant as a neutral term for soldiers who do not belong to an established military. I couldn't find any reference to X having or belonging to a military or engaging or ever encouraging any form of violence. That may need re-wording</p>

<p>The last paragraph in the first section sounds a little preachy to me. Maybe it would be better to say: "In the opinion of <i>Foo</i>, who is an expert, Black History Month exposes the harms…".

<p>Black history month is world wide, so technically the reason for choosing February as the month for black history month worldwide is irrelevant, Abraham Lincoln had nothing much to do with the initiation of Black history month in Britain. Does France Germany, Italy have a black history month, I don’t think they do and u notice that the social divides are more pronounced there than in our, I hate to use the word, multicultural Britain. Personally I have the opinion that is a bit divided, black history should be appreciated in all the cities and countries were it made an impact and it should be just as important as the roles of Asiatic, and other cultures. This would be more free thinking and radical than simply placating the masses with a month of GOOOOO black people. Essentially I think black history week/month was started with good intention but as in many cases the saying "the road to hell is paved with good intentions"</p>

<p>Is this man a historian, A culture icon, i dont think a actor (performer) should be used here. I mean how silly is the statment there is no white history month? It is a White country you dont need history for the dominant culture, history for them is 24/7. Yes there is issues with Black history month, like having a month to sum it up. But the childish statement about color and racism is "childish" human beings will always see difference pretending it isnt there as opposed to confronting it is just madness.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 12:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder why an African culture colonized by Whites would need to celebrate a culture they celebrate every single day, todayalmost every African nation has a European language as the official language. Today Every African nations leaders where the dress of europe. In African schools the history of Europe is taught everyday. thus they celebrate European history every day.
