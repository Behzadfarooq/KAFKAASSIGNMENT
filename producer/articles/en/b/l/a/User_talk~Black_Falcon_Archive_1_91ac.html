<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi, Black Falcon. I reverted some of the changes you have recently you made to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cristian_P%C3%A2rvulescu_a763.html" title="Cristian Pârvulescu">Cristian Pârvulescu</a>. Among them was your addition of diacritics in brackets for category inclusions - a letter with a diacritic will be placed at the end of the alphabetized category. (A word with the succession of letters "Pâ" will be placed after a "Pz" word. This is especially obvious with words that start with a diacritic, as they are placed at the end of the alphabet.) I consider this "rule" a bug in the system myself, as they could have simply write in a command for the system to view all letters with diacritics as their letter in categories; as it is, we have to work with it. Thanks for your attention and happy editing. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:59, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi Black Falcon. What's happening right now is that a few people are in a huff over Anti-Iranianism. The trick is maybe to do a reverse POV fork (the opposite of taking a neutral article and making a second one that pushes a POV.) Start an article from a stub on "Anti-Iranian sentiment" and keep it focused. Also another could be "Anti-Persian sentiment" and tied them together. There is much material available for such articles. The debate on the AfD is a bit of a distraction and a waste of time. My recent experience was that GabrielF nominated this article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Proposed_Israeli_Nuclear_First_Strike_on_Natanz_Facility_4f1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Proposed Israeli Nuclear First Strike on Natanz Facility">Proposed Israeli Nuclear First Strike on Natanz Facility</a> for deletion and the solution was just to expand the appropriate section in the boarder and more informative article: <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plans_for_strikes_against_the_Iranian_nuclear_program_c6aa.html" title="Plans for strikes against the Iranian nuclear program">Plans for strikes against the Iranian nuclear program</a>.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">The ideal solution is for someone who really understands the material to rewrite the article based on scholarly secondary sources about the topic, but of course that's not very likely to happen. The reason that I don't think withdrawing the AfD is a good idea is that I just don't see how the suggestions that you and others made can be implemented if there is a group of editors who think that the arguments that I and others have made amount to racism. I'll withdraw my nomination if the changes that you recommended on the AfD page are implemented, but I really don't see that happening. I'm not prepared to withdraw the AfD if someone can add an unencyclopedic list of everyone who has ever used the term "anti-Iranianism" and then prevent its removal. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Hi, thanks for the message. I think the material should be kept one way or another, if not in that article then in another. There is clearly a movement to restrain Iran's development, so the information is notable. Some users don't like this information because of political reasons, but WP is supposed to be cool and neutral. Anyway, another of my concern is that the article not just be about anti-Persianism, but take into account anti-Iranianism as a whole, because Persians are only one out of dozens of ethnic groups in the country, and all Iranians identify as "Iranians". Its like the United States, except we are not a modern civilisation and most groups are ethnically and historically related. No one would deny anti-Israel sentiments (against the state and its citizens) or anti-American sentiments (against the state and its citizens) or anti-France sentiments (against the state and its citizens) to cite three well known examples of anti-national sentiments, which are not just attacks against governments, but also the peoples of those lands. I am half-Kurd, and half-Arab for example, but when I have been attacked, they have attacked me as an Iranian, not because I am half-Kurdish or half-Arab. Those who have attacked me never even knew my ethnic background, they only knew about the Iranian part. Same is true of most countries like even France, which has many ethnic groups. But when a French citizen travels to United States, for example, and if he or she is ridiculed or taunted for being French (this has happened, of course), they are not being targeted because of their ethnicity necessarily, but because they are French nationality. Of course people are ignorant and assume all French are the same so they think they are also attacking the ethnicity. Just as with attacks against Iranians, they see us as all the same (typical Eurocentric, Orientalist view), so they attack us as one ethnic group. Just like when people attack "Middle Easterners" as "ragheads" and "camel jockeys" etc. (even including Greeks and Armenians and Indians and Pakistanis in this label!) they are assuming Arabs, Iranians, Turks, Armenians, Indians etc etc are all exactly the same. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 05:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">I do agree that there is a "movement to restrain Iran's development", but the problem with the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> article was that it made no distinction between this movement and anti-Persian or anti-Iranian sentiments. As regards your other point, I most certainly do think that both anti-Persian and anti-Iranian sentiments should be included in WP (ideally in separate articles, but if that is not feasible, then in one article for now). In the AfD I noted two instances of peaked anti-Iranian sentiment in the US: after the Islamic Revolution and during the second half of the Bush administration. However, Iranians were also targeted/discriminated against after 11 September 2001, despite the fact of their noninvolvement AND despite the fact that most Iranian nationals are not ethnic Arabs (then again, what can you expect when Bush himself once classified Pakistan as part of the Arab world). I think the new article should reflect this. If the AfD result is keep or if the nomination is withdrawn, I will propose an improvement effort (hopefully with the help of members of WikiProject:Iran as my knowledge beyond the modern era is very limited) and will myself try to find reliable sources on anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States in modern times (the sentiments exist, it's only a matter of finding appropriate sources). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Why should hostility toward the Persian and Iranian states and animosity toward the Persian and Iranian peoples be seperate? The two determine eachother's fates. Take 1953. If it were not for the CIA/UK <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ajax_0f22.html" title="Operation Ajax">Operation Ajax</a>, Iran's popularly elected Prime Minister would not be replaced by a dictator that became notorious for his <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savak.html" title="Savak">Savak</a> torture prisons, and the rise of the mullahs themselves. Another example is the US unilateral sanctions on Iran's government. It has been proven that such sanctions only affect Iran's people, not its government, and yet the U.S. insists it effects the government. I've seen how these sanctions make people's lives miserable. Yet another example is the financial, intelligence, and indirect military support of the U.S. offered to Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war. Saddam wouldnt have the capability to bomb civilian targets in Iranian cities (which I routinely saw with my own eyes, shops, houses bombed), if it were not for this support. The current govt of Iran may be an unpopular one, with many blunders and embarassing faults, but they are twined with the lives of the people.</font></p>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">True--the two are intertwined. However, animosity against the Persian and Iranian peoples requires some sort of negative emotional feeling, whereas hostility against Persia or Iran can simply be the product of political calculation. When a country occupies Iranian territory (e.g., Russia), how is that an indication of animosity toward the Iranian people rather than simple political self-interest? To classify it as such could be construed as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. In any case, it's not so much a matter of <i>me</i> meeting you half-way (I favor <i>keep</i>ing the article even as it is, but discussing possible changes on the talk page instead of the AfD), but rather of the AfD nomination not passing (or <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">User:GabrielF</a> withdrawing his nomination). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:40, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">(edit conflict) The SVG you created seems very close, but I can't really make an informed comment on how accurate it is (it seems to fit pretty well with <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/atlas_middle_east/saudi_arabia_division.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/atlas_middle_east/saudi_arabia_division.jpg" rel="nofollow">this 1993 provinces map</a> at the UofTexas library map collection).

<h2><font size="+1" color="yellow"><span class="mw-headline">Does "newsworthy" always mean "encyclopedic?"</span></font></h2>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Thanks for your thoughtful post about the proposed guideline. My concern is that we will have too many articles which are definitely news at the time they happen, as evidenced by the decision of newspaper editors and TV news show producers to present them. But they may be so commonplace that we would have articles about things which are a frequent part of daily life. The example was give of a fatal multipassenger car wreck in a small European country. It will definitely be presented in the 3 major newspapers and the 3 TV stations. Some would say, well, it still doesn't get in, because we require coverage on more than 1 day's events. So we have the accident reported on Feb 1, then the funeral on Feb. 4, with more coverage because one was a high school honor student (nonnotable but sympathetic). Then we have another when the hit and run driver is found and arrested. We hasve another round of stories when he is put ontrial and another when he is convicted. To go to a recent tragic missing white girls story, please tell me if there should be Wikipedia articles for Rachel Smith and Rachel Crites. The two girls, 16 and 18 went missing along with a car belonging to one around Jan 22, 2007 from Gaithersburg Maryland. On Jan 22, TV station NBC4 (Maryland?) ran a story "Police get leads from public. The <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> ran an independent story "Police reach out to 2 missing teenagers " on page PB2. On Jan 23, CBS TV channel 5 in Montgomery County Maryland ran a story derived in part from an Associated Press story, "Diary may hold clue." WJZ, CBS-TV Baltimore Maryland ran "Diary may hold clues." CBS TV station KCAL in Los Angeles, California ran a story originating from the Maryland TV station, giving the story coverage on at least both coasts. The Frederick News, Frederick Maryland ran an original story "Police search for missing teens." ABC-TV WJLA ran a story based on the Washington Post story. The Gazette-Net Maryland (print or net, not sure) ran an original story "Search for missing teens."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">On Jan 24, the Examiner.com Montgomery County Maryland ran an original story "Scope of search increases." The Maryland Gazette ran "Nationwide search launched for missing teens.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">On Jan 25, NBC4.com ran an original story "Center for Missing and Exploited Children searches for teens.”</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">On January 26, Cox.net a cable TV news channel, ran "Two missing Montgomery County girls gone a week."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">On Jan. 27, The Washington Post ran "Family member plead for a phone call. <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Most_Wanted_519b.html" title="America's Most Wanted">America's Most Wanted</a>, a network TV program which had earlier run a brief story on the two, ran a feature story.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">There was a gap, then on Feb. 2, Fox TV News ran "On the Record, a network program with Greta van Susteren, in which the story was covered extensively and the father of one was interviewed. The Herald Mail online of Hagerstown Maryland ran an original story "Missing girls might be in area." NBC-TV channel 25 of Hagerstown ran an original story "Police find car with two bodies," with no signs of foul play. Snopes.com, a respected website which is carried in numerous newspapers, ran "Rachel Smith and Rachel Crites" telling the sad story.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">On Feb 3, the Washington Post ran "Missing MD teen car found with two bodies" on page A1, indicating it is a major news story. The Associated Press sent out "Teens most likely dead from fumes." no suicide note, no pills, ignition on. But one girl had expressed a desire that they be buried together in her diary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">So this story had numerous original stories, not just reprints, written over numerous days, carried in papers in Maryland and adjoining states, and carried on 2 network TV programs, and carried in TV stations around the country This Shakespeare-quality tragedy seems to fully satisfy [[[WP:N], <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Are there other guidelines which could be used correctly against in in AFD, or would it be deleted on grounds “It just isn’t important enough a story?Does it satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? Compare to <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Wilbanks_a13c.html" title="Jennifer Wilbanks">Jennifer Wilbanks</a> who chose to run away and turned up safe. But Examiner.com, Washington D.C ran a story Jan 24 which said Montgomery County police (one county out of thousands in the U.S. had 1650 cases of runaways in 2006, and 811 remain open. Should we have 811 Wikipedia articles per county? Or only ones where two pretty teenage girls run way together in a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_white_woman_syndrome.html" title="Missing white woman syndrome">Missing white woman syndrome</a>. ( I can think of several similar cases in my medium size town) or only when they are found dead? Or is it a sad case for Wikinews? After doing the research and finding sources, I feel that I (or we) could write up a well sourced article on each girl or on the disappearance of both, and see if it survives AFD. It is a heart rending story for parents or friends of teenagers. But I'm not sure that this story or literally tens of thousands a year belong in an encyclopedia. I do not see new laws or any other change in society coming out of it. Can you find a reason for there not to be an article about this, or do you think I (or you) should write such an article? How many such cases of disappearances, crime victims, or even cute animal human interest stories get enough press coverage in enough independent sources over a long enough period to satisfy the filters you have listed and not get stories? Or is all news encyclopedic (not just Wikinewsworthy?) I really see the need for an additional filter to say, yes, it was widely covered for a couple of days or weeks, but it is not encyclopedic. A fat cat stuck in a doggy door may make national news on the day he is rescued, and then again when the owner installs a giant doggy door, because editors love to keep going back to an appealing story.

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">Thank you for your thought-out and detailed response. To answer your question: No, "newsworthiness" does not automatically translate into "encyclopedic"? Wikipedia should not have an article for every incident or person that makes the news. You are quite correct to note that my suggested criterion of "non-identical coverage in more than one reliable news source on multiple occasions" for the notability of news items would permit a great many articles which even I agree would be unencyclopedic (such as 811 separate articles about missing persons for each regional political subdivision in the world--county, province, etc.). However, I still believe that it is a necessary addition to this guideline <i>assuming it is adopted</i> (a part of me is still quite reluctant to embrace this new criterion despite my frustration at seeing unencyclopedic articles about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wolfgang_Sporn_2a57.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wolfgang Sporn">captains of non-notable naval vessels</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hector_band_b4f7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hector band">newly-established bands</a>, etc.).</font></dd>
<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">I believe the current criteria of the proposed guideline are much too strict and would justify the exclusion of articles like the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hurtgen_Forest_31f4.html" title="Battle of Hurtgen Forest">Battle of Hurtgen Forest</a>--a WWII battle that involved 200,000 soldiers and caused 45,000 casualties and yet had no great strategic importance--for years after its occurrence. Although WP's deletion process is imperfect, I think it works rather well. Unencyclopedic topics, no matter how well-sourced or NPOV will eventually be tagged for deletion and a final decision can be reached based on consensus. An article about a boy that is rescued from a well and then gets a dog is obviously not encyclopedic, and though it passes my criterion, that does not mean it is safe from deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> specifies the kind of articles that categorically do not belong, but it does not extend guaranteed protection over all others. In any case, simple "news reports" (even if they have multiple sources) fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#OR" title="WP:NOT">WP#NOT</a>.</font></dd>
<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">Another concern: the criterion of secondary (non-news) documentation, publication, and/or analysis (which is essentially what the entire policy is) is likely <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward certain countries that have a larger publication capacity. For example, you will find many detailed analyses of WWII battles (and even minor engagements) involving the US and UK, but far fewer on battles between the Third Reich and the USSR.</font></dd>
<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">I will note again that the deletion process, though imperfect, is quite good. Articles that are newsworthy but unencyclopedic will be identified, targeted, and eventually deleted (the 7th sentence on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> specifically excludes merely "newsworthy" articles). Given that "Notability is generally permanent", some news pieces may pop up as articles from time to time, but if long-term notability is not shown, they will be deleted. I believe we should trust consensus to do what is best for the encyclopedia. I would value your thoughts on the issues I have raised.

As most of the individuals on the list seem to be persons who were specifically targeted, and in light of some AfDs I've seen in the past few days, it may be appropriate to drop "and murders" from the title.

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">I made an edit to the article (standardising the appearance of the tables across the subsections). The "Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions" and "LTTE vs. Tamil militant groups" sections need to be removed or rewritten per the new title, but overall the article is looking good. I will try to work on the article over the next couple of days (mostly its organisation and sourcing). I noticed the discussion with Snowolfd4 and Iwazaki at the old talk page just a short while ago. The articles essentially convey the same information, but this is written under a more NPOV title and has potential for future expansion into a general analytical article about "Assassinations in the Sri Lankan civil war".
