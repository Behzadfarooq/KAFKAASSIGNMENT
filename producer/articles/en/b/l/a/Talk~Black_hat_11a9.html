<p>Not to intend to start this rant off on a blunt note, but I've never seen a Wikipedia article with more personal perspective, and just wrong information. I've been deeply submerged in the blackhat culture for the bulk of my life, and I can tell you for certain that the term "cracker" does not imply intent in any way. That's what white/gray/blackhat denote, and those are often exaggerated; blackhats aren't evil guys that break things for monetary gain, they are motivated by many things, the least of which is money. For one, knowledge, but usually they don't care about the consequences in obtaining it. A cracker is merely a type of hacker who uses his extensive knowledge of computers to circumvent protections. In fact, most crackers I know are motivated by improving security through learning more about a vulnerability and exploiting it. As much as I'd like to go through and fix all the things that I can show to be dead wrong, I'm afraid the many self-proclaimed "security experts" who have never even been to a blackhat conference would just revert this page back to its present fallacies.</p>
<p>Hacker is a general term for anyone who is computer savvy, and is a complement given amongst other computer experts usually with no connotation other than respect for one's skill. A cracker is a hacker with a specific class of abilities, note abilities, not intentions. Crackers can break protections. Within the class of cracker, there are subclasses, these are whitehat, grayhat, and blackhat. These terms carry intention. Blackhats generally don't care about legal restrictions on what they can and cannot crack, mostly because they quarrel with legality concerning technology, the internet, and intellectual rights. White hats on the other hand are the theoretical law-biding cracker, while gray hats stand in between. Here it becomes evident the similarity these terms have with political parties, and along with that an explanation for the debates that constantly follow.</p>
<p>I've seen so many long, repetitive debates and papers squabbling over the ambiguity of these terms, but in the actual hacker community, message boards, forums, and conferences, there is hardly a debate. Everyone tends to understand with a small degree of variation the simple explanation in my previous paragraph.</p>
<p>With that being said, why does "cracker" redirect to "black hat"? They are not synonymous.</p>

<p>This seems to be a modern alternative definition of the term Cracker. An expression derived from the term "to crack", usually meaning the process of circumventing copy protection in software and games. Most pirate groups still call themselves "crackers". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.128.61.214 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.128.61.214_efbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.128.61.214">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>I agree. In the '80s the cracking scene was game swappers and protection-breakers, and it partially evolved into the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a>: it was not about malicious "hacking" of networked computers. 86.131.101.243 22:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems that people think that "hacker" means "black hat", while there are a good number of hackers who do not do anything maliciously, they mearly use their skills to test their own network. Hacking is getting something to do what it was not intended for, and this is not necessarily bad. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sphinx1364 (<a href="../../../s/p/h/User_talk%7ESphinx1364_170f.html" title="User talk:Sphinx1364">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sphinx1364_3c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sphinx1364">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Defining today's black hat has not been easy, because even in hacking there are few terms that can be simplified. There are two types of hackers--ethical and unethical. Ethical hackers work on tasks which are provided to him legally or under certain rules and regulations, and unethical hackers work on tasks that are illegal.</p>
<p>A black hat, who is also known as an unethical hacker, breaks the privacy of any individual, steals data and defaces information, which might includes vast data destruction, information stealing, privacy breaking, and online theft. There are a few like Takshak Hack of India, Silver Lords of Pakistan, and The Hack Boyz of Tabriez, who are defacing government sites of eachother's countries, as part of an 'online war'.</p>

<p>The article states that Black Hat "probably comes from the opposite of Red Hat Wizards." I'm sure that's inaccurate, as Black Hat is opposite White Hat, which most likely is coined from the mid 20th century westerns on TV (where 'good guys' wore white hats, criminals wore black). I'm going to change it to this, as I don't see how Red Hat applies here. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPandemic_0a8a.html" title="User:Pandemic">Pandemic</a> 05:43, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've gone ahead and redacted them from this Wikipedia article. They are both covered elsewhere on Wikipedia, and neither of them has any obvious criminal conviction in relation to computer crime. To the contrary, their involvement in computer hacking extends primarily to the publication of magazines and/or newsletters relating to this topic. This is a protected, non-criminal activity.</p>
<p>While Neidorf was charged at one point, his case was dismissed before going to trial.</p>

<p><b>AGAINST</b> - White/Grey/Black Hat are have defined and distinict meanings. Having them on seperate pages are very usefull for helping people understand the difference. I suggest having each "hat" page separate, each containing an link to <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker_%28computer_security%29.html" title="Hacker (computer security)">Hacker (computer security)</a> and the other two "hats". <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker_%28computer_security%29.html" title="Hacker (computer security)">Hacker (computer security)</a> should then be cleaned up - focus on the general definition of hacker, and not explain everything else.

<dd>Righto, but since we already have <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">Hacker</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker_%28computer_security%29.html" title="Hacker (computer security)">Hacker (computer security)</a> it seems silly to have <i>three</i> -- count 'em, 3 -- more pages of arbitrary hat distinction. It creates an artificial distinction where it's unclear whether one actually exists, and the concept of "hats" can be (and to some extent is) covered in the main articles. I'm not convinced the various hat variation pages would survive an AfD, for that matter. <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 08:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is the distinction artificial? Please give examples. They're all quite distinct in their meanings, and sit at different levels of generalness.

<dd>Examples? What of? In any event, they're unduly specific, and seek to create a needless distinction by alleging that people who do (x) are (y).

<p><b>MERGE</b> - It makes sense to merge it with Hacker(Computer_Security) since that topic is more biased on useing the term 'Hacker' to signify a person who breaks/enters a computer network. It uses the term Black Hat to signify a person who maliciously breaks into a network, inspite of the fact that a black hat's skills could range beyond that. I say either merge black hat into it (since it leads a person to think that black hats _only_ break into networks with malicious intent) or remove Hacker(Computer_Security) altogether. I'm leaning more toward removeing Hacker(C_S) since it needs some signifcant work before it can be of any value and black hat could simply be cleaned up to clarify black hats more accurately, but i don't think that will be happening anytime soon. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPandemic_0a8a.html" title="User:Pandemic">Pandemic</a> 15:03, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the origins of the phrase 'black hat', something I've been interested in for a while. I had assumed it was a recent coinage, but then I was reading Thomas Hauser's biography of Muhammad Ali, where it talks about the assumption before the Sonny Liston fight that Liston was a 'black hat' and Ali a 'white hat'. Looking into it a little further, the OED (under the headword 'hat') says 'black hat (Australian slang): a newly arrived immigrant.' Does anyone else know anything about the history of this phrase, or how it came to be used in hackerdom? I've been meaning to look it up in the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, but I haven't gotten around to it.</p>

"White hat" and "black hat" is intended to show one group as "good" as opposed to the other, being "evil" respectivly. This was coined from early American Televison westerns. Since the broadcast was black and white only, the evil character would wear a black cowboy hat and the good character a white one for easy distinction. Since then the use of "black and white hats" have been applied to various groups, probably none more than hacking though. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPandemic_0a8a.html" title="User:Pandemic">Pandemic</a> 14:43, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the following comment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Side note- the terms <b>White Hat</b>, <b>Grey Hat</b>, and <b>Black Hat</b> were taken from the <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_vs._Spy_6068.html" title="Spy vs. Spy">Spy vs. Spy</a> comic strips in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Magazine_2675.html" title="Mad Magazine">Mad Magazine</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>...largely because my understanding is that the classic TV explanation is more plausible than a specific sourcing to MAD, prevalent though the latter's influence may be on computer culture. The Black Hat/White Hat distinction is pretty well understood throughout US culture to mean "Bad Guy/Good Guy", and the "Grey" would follow naturally to anyone familiar with the phrase "grey area", espeically to any computer programmer who has had to deal with color-encoding. <tt><a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbb3w_fbee.html" title="User:Abb3w">Abb3w</a> 16:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</tt></p>

<p>I provided some external links and was accused of spam even though they fell well within the guidelines. For some reason or another the current entry for 'Black hat' alludes only to crackers and hackers. There is another meaning for 'Black hat' in the context of search engine marketing. For example an exact search for "black hat seo" in Google provides <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22black+hat+seo%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22black+hat+seo%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">271,000 references</a>. Compare this with an exact search for "black hat hacker" which provides only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22black+hat+hacker%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22black+hat+hacker%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">33,700 references</a>. There are similar examples for "white hat".</p>
<p>Why do you choose to completely exclude the more popular meaning of these two terms? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.16.146.38_0f54.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.16.146.38">86.16.146.38</a> (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.16.146.38.html" title="User talk:86.16.146.38">talk</a>) 18:06, 26 December 2006</small></p>

<dd>The more popular term? SEO aspect of the black/white/grey hat issue is barely off the ground. Frankly, hardly anyone save <i>SEO'ers</i> know this category. Black, white and grey hatting has been around for <i>years.</i> Go into almost any computer related forum and irc channel and drop either and people will automatically think that you are referring to hacking. But I do agree that the term is emerging in SEO, however there isn't enough to write seperate articles about. Sections were given to it in the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">SEO</a> article and a section also in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_hat.html" title="Grey hat">grey hat</a> article.

<p>I do visit lots of computer related forums and you are mistaken. Most of the black hat talk is about SEO. In the distant past you may have been correct in your assumption but things have moved on, even blackhatseo.com was registered over four years ago. You can carry on ignoring it, it's not my problem but please don't display your prejudice by incorrectly referring to the link I suggested as spam.</p>
