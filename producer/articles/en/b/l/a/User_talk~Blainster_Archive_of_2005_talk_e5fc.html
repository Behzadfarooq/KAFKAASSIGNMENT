<p>hi (and welcome back, sort of) — I think it would be better to use the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> to give pronunciations (in the case of Achaea, however, the pronunciation will depend on your Greek, anyway;). Just a detail, though.

<dd><i>clarifying the sound to everyday English speakers.</i> — you are right, this is the common position of the "anti-IPA" faction. I didn't want to suggest that it was WP policy to use IPA. The dispute is ongoing&#160;;o) I don't think you would have to use the more obscure IPA symbols for English, though. Anyway, in the case of Achaea, your pronunciation hints are unambiguous, I guess. I still wonder how much the variants "Achaea" vs. "Achaia" are really affecting pronunciation, and are not just orthographic variants. No problem. I didn't want to lecture you, I just thought I'd draw your attention to IPA in the hope that you would like it&#160;:) [[User:Dbachmann|<a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> (<small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">T</a></small>) ]] 20:53, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or, as some call us, the 'Brighamites'&lt;g&gt;. I like your comments but it would make things easier for me if you would put them on the talk page. I've moved them there.</p>
<p>Regarding your statement about Brigham Young and the Lorenzo Snow quote "As man is...", this is possibly the most controversial doctrine taught and believed by LDS. Brigham Young did make some statements about this but Lorenzo Snow was actually paraphrasing a doctrine taught by Joseph Smith in his "King Follett" sermon - "God himself was Once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!"

<p>Thanks for the clean up of my biblical archaeolgy entry. I have to disagree with you though on using "sensation" instead of "sensationalized" excavation of Ur. At first Woolley could not raise money for his project, then after brilliantly bringing up the name of the biblical patriarch, Abraham, the money came flowing in. And it still works!! Wow!! Too bad about William James and the mental medium.Leonora Piper. James was way out of his league. Nice essay in Martin Gardner's book "Are Universes Thicker than Blackberries?". And [scientists?] are still saying we can talk to the dead?!! My biggest gripe with science and religion is the Bible is rarely identified as a collection of books from pre-scientific peoples in the ancient world, as seen through their eyes and time. This is quite deceiving. Thanks again, Charlie 11 Apr 2005</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fundamentalism and Catholicism</span></h2>
<p>I have not changed back the statement concerning traditionalist catholics and protestant fundamentalists (the latter of which I belong), and I object to the notion of being identified with the views of Mel Gibson. I agree that the changes I made were redundant, but I do believe that the statement that my view (known as Fundamentalism by ourselves), and Traditional Catholics (who eschew the designation) show not be confused or identified with each other.</p>

<p>So far you are the only person on Vfd who "gets it". (Other then me.) I expected opposition, but I expected people to be more open minded then this.</p>
<p>"I can see this one is going down.... Rest assured it will be resurrected in an acceptable form in the future." True words. It's unfortunate that it can't keep it's current title. I think the double entendre adds shock value and amusement but doesn't detract from the purpose of the article. In fact, it creates interest. It's just more fun to research great <i>boners</i> in history. It's a shame most people don't have a sense of humor.</p>

Thanks for helping out. The Edsel is a good addition. I had forgotten aobut that. Definitely a major public embarrassment for Ford. I wonder what possessed them to release an ugly, overpriced car in the first place.</p>
<p>With so many people contributing to the page, it's just stupid that it's even on vfd. Clearly there are a substantial group of people who think that the article should be here.</p>
<p>Oh, and the "keeps" may be less then 50% on the vfd page, but they are greater then the 1/3 support needed to block deletion by consensus.... Or at least, that's how the deletion process is <i>supposed</i> to work, according to what I've read. Now it's time to "wait and see", I guess.</p>

<p>Hello. I noticed that your "edit summary" on changing the entry for Bertrand Russell referred to "A. J. Ayers" not "Ayer." (used to read Ayer and C.I. Lewis in college). I don't know how to edit an edit summary or I'd fix it, and, surely, it is minor - but just a heads up. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 16:36, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Ayer was relatively easy; C.I. Lewis' "Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation" was a large and pithy book. The Tesla item is kind of funny, but a bit sad. I did try to make one as a boy, but my father got me uninsulated wire. Later, as my late wife was an artist, I got exposed to kind of far-out people and one or two mentioned Kirlian photography. I guess it is a fun pastime, but I thnk one does not find out anything about the inherent energy or aura of the object you hit with high frequency, high voltage, as some followers believe. Well, lately my (relatively new) wife has introduced me to a family in Memphis (TN, not Egypt) (the latter is, I believe, now deserted), the husband being an MD doing acupuncture. Well, he is also far-out and wanted me to help him with Kirlian photography (of humans, not dead leaves or seeds or whatever). I thought Tesla coils were relatively harmless on account of the skin effect, and that Kirlian photography used Tesla coils. According to Wikipedia experts who corrected my entries, neither is true. Maybe a small Tesla coil is OK to touch, but a larger one is not, and a lot of what is used in Kirlian photography is said to be flyback transformers, which operate at much lower frequency (so the current will penetrate your body too much). I had anyway declined to help this "innovative" acupuncturist, and when I had that Wiki correspondence on the two kinds of exciters I warned him about shocks; he is not pursuing Kirlian photography on patients, I believe.

But on the other hand, might the exact text of what he said not be important, given that part of it deals with his loss of control and that the comment has been cited on the RfC page proper? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 16:41, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a link to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Porter_%28author%29_c265.html" title="Bill Porter (author)">Bill Porter (author)</a>, which needs an article - want to do it?? (I had to use the (author) format as there's already another <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Porter_afed.html" title="Bill Porter">Bill Porter</a> occupying that page . . . which will also need a disambig note adding) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 09:34, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks; I'm afraid I know nothing about him either. I've changed the link at Tao Te Ching to [[Bill Porter (author)|Red Pine]] (Bill Porter) so people don't end up needlessly at the pine. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 10:27, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for clearing that up--the original article was quite confusing. I had assumed that the disambig page just went to the album by the Police--it never occurred to me that there might be two different philosophical works with the same title. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 18:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I've noticed that you sometimes prefer to use html markup, instead of wiki markup, for blockquote indentation. Is this following a style recommendation that I missed, somewhere? — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 22:23, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, hey and hello! A preliminary reply is over on my talk page. However, I'm still in the middle of working on this "World Music" article and related things so it will take me some time yet to bring it all together. It involves working across multiple pages of music artists in relation to the World Music page. --<a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayland_27b1.html" title="User:Wayland">wayland</a> 12:04, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry for deleting that link. It was added by an anonymous user, and was malformed. First I fixed it, then I thought it was spam. If you say it's good, that is sufficient for me. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJehochman_26e5.html" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> 08:27, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"Tappan is now a part of the Weedeater division of Electrolux." Do you have a source for this? I think the website is misleading, since Weedeater is the Outdoor Products Group and Frigidaire is part of the Indoor Products Group, and Tappan is obviously an indoor appliance maker. Electrolux seems to be phasing this brand out, but it is still around. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidLevinson_6300.html" title="User:DavidLevinson">dml</a> 03:19, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nice rewrite of the Christian Parallels section of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_ad70.html" title="The Chronicles of Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>. I did a fairly heavey rewrite of that section not too long ago, but didn't clean it up in a way that really satisfied me. I think you kept the main ideas intact while remove the somewhat condescending attitude that I couldn't quite bring myself to remove. <a href="../../../l/s/o/User%7ELsommerer_a332.html" title="User:Lsommerer">Lsommerer</a> 03:24, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blainster, I updated some of the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_McCanney_f393.html" title="James McCanney">James McCanney</a> page a little while ago, and by chance did a search for Kolbrin which took me to the page you had just created. I figure the Kolbrin is most likely another creation of McCanney, no proof, and I may be wrong. Regardless of who wrote it, I figure it’s a prime candidate for deletion on the grounds of it being a hoax. I figured I would run this by you before I nominated it though.

<p>Hey, upon reading it again, scratch what I said, lets keep the page. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 04:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
