<li>Following <i>extensive</i> research and a series of cost-benefit considerations, the article is confirmed as a a probable liability. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Image%7EWink.png_a692.html" class="image" title="Image:Wink.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/9/9a/Wink.png" alt="Image:Wink.png" width="22" height="22" longdesc="../../../w/i/n/Image%7EWink.png_a692.html" /></a> After looking at the article and possible ways to expand it (and make it more informative), I really don't know whether it's worth the trouble. The category already does a fairly good job. I will give it a try tomorrow by actually editing the article (so far I've just been looking through candidate articles) and if it's still problematic, I will re-prod.

<p>See, there's something that really wasn't acknowledged, that the only reason anyone can say "it's not a guide!" is because is can't be a guide. There's no one to guide, and no one can guide them yet, as it's unreleased. But when all of the other MP mini-game lists are about telling how to play them, what is to be expected? There's not been a precedence to put mini-game lists on Wikipedia, and I'm sure that it surviving has more to do with people liking the article more than feeling it adheres to policy and guidelines. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I nominated all of the MP minigame lists for deletion on February 28 for that very reason: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a game guide. However, I had failed to notice that the previous AfD discussion had closed only 27 hours earlier, so I withdrew my nomination. I intend to wait a month or two (until April, at least, or even May), and the renominate all the articles for deletion. I simply removed the prod because it is not a case of uncontroversial deletion (having already survived AfD once). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi Black Falcon, I first noticed your work in AFD. Excellent work writing articles, saving worthwhile articles, sourcing articles, merging articles, and general insightful contributions. Have an award! I would like to nominate you for adminship!

I have seen your valuable improvements to articles at AFDâ€“most recently <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Pizza_4b2a.html" title="Extreme Pizza">Extreme Pizza</a>â€“and am honored that you would consider nominating me for adminship. I <i>am</i> interested, but am concerned the timing may be off. For personal reasons, I will be spending significantly less time at Wikipedia in the second half of March than I have in the past month (I <i>do</i> plan on a full comeback in April). I would like to become an admin eventually, but do not feel comfortable requesting adminship shortly before taking a Wikibreak. I would be flattered if you would still consider nominating me sometime after my full return. My sincere thanks for your acknowledgement and show of trust.

<dd>Two of the best things about Wikipedia, in my opinion, are the anonymity it affords and the existence of records of all actions and statements. I prefer for now to keep all Wikipedia-related communication on Wikipedia and am generally wary of communication that is not freely available to be read by other editors. As regards the list of actors, I intend to investigate whether the information present can be used as the basis for a new "List of German actors" that: (1) is sourced; (2) includes only notable actors; and (3) includes information that cannot be efficiently presented in a category. I think most or all information relevant to that endeavour can be found online or in available print sources. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:20, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As a possible future admin, I continue to implore you put an e-mail address in your preferences. Everyone else, and definitely every admin, does it, so its questionable why this admin candidate consistently refuses too. There is a save correspondence feature in most e-mail services. Again, it will make much more sense why I'm asking for this the sooner you decide to make the email. Lets say it has more to do with administrative details than anything else. Please reconsider. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 17:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reason behind my reluctance to provide an e-mail address was transparency of communication. Also, please note that I am not yet an admin candidate and would certainly provide an e-mail if/when I sought adminship. However, in following <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, I have created an account and saved it to my preferences. I hope you were not offended by my initial reluctance to give an e-mail address; I still feel it is best to keep WP-related communication on WP, but if you insist on an account, I will assume you have good reason(s) for doing so.

<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a>, this is a bit late but I'd just like to query your contestation of the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} for <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_feminism.html" title="Pop feminism">Pop feminism</a>. I originally tagged the page as <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">original research</a> because of its complete lack of references. I say this for the simple reason that 5 of the references (numbers 2-6) are not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> or published on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (the 5th reference is also broken) - the fact that there is 1 newspaper article about pop feminism doesn't mean it deserves its <i>own</i> article. As I have posted on the talk page there are some throw-away references made to pop feminism but I can't say that there is either a definition or clarification of the term in any academic source that I've come across. When the article itself says: "<i>There is no proof pop feminism is an actual feminist philosophy; it seems to be an observed phenomenon in society or the media</i>" it is correct. I am anxious to do something about this article whether expand, merge or delete - its current state is a mess. What are your views on the article?--<a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECailil_97aa.html" title="User:Cailil">Cailil</a> 12:40, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>After a more detailed investigation of the available sources, I found my initial assessment of "following a review of available sources, I believe there is enough material to expand the article" to be incorrect. I don't think that the article can stand on its own. I don't think a merge to <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> is necessary: as you state, the article's "current state is a mess". A simple redirect to <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> would probably be enough. I will do so now, but please revert me if you feel it should remain a while longer or that another outcome would be more appropriate. I will also attempt to incorporate the CBC source into the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> article; it's a good source for a few sentences, but does not justify a separate article, as you've noted.

<p>To respond to your concerns:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) I was suspicious, actually highly suspicious, in the unreferenced/sourced manner in which the articles had been added. The fact that most of them only linked to a list of romance authors also left me less than convinced they were nothing more than SPAM bios.</dd>
<dd>2) The incorrect edit summary was a mistake. I'd like to say it'll never happen again, but I know thats probably not true.</dd>
<dd>3) Sadly enough, just adding a tag that an article needed references and more explanation of notability very rarely leads to cleanup in that regard. Something like a third of articles I've sent for an AfD after dealing with defensive article creators removing cleanup tags repeatedly immediately get cleaned up and sourced due to the proceedings. I'm glad that you intend to source the rest of the articles.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for removing the PROD tags, I checked through my edit history and you and GroggyDice have removed all of them. As you might have guessed, I'm a deletionist, and I think I still view these authors as failing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, as they fail to assert their notability through 'secondary sources that are reliable, distinct, and independent of the subject'.

<p>The user seems to be more interested in ranting and making vague legal threats than finding reliable sources for his articles. If you think that Roger J. Geronimo is notable, I will not object if you remove the prod tag (although I would greatly appreciate if the sources were standardized since Hartal seems to only use the hard to reach caches for reasons I don't understand). Similar comments apply to the currently under AfD Rochelle Holt. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am actually unconvinced whether Roger J. Geronimo meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (my search for additional sources was largely fruitless). I simply de-prodded and re-prodded the article in order to make the author aware of the issue and hopefully prompt him to provide additional sources to establish notability. If such sources are not forthcoming, I am not opposed to the article's deletion. I believe the situation with Rochelle Holt is different as she seems to be notable despite her affiliation with CPU and the poor state of the article (somewhat improved since the AFD).</dd>
<dd>I really don't know what to make of Hartal's comments on his talk page. His comment about the deletion of articles about notable persons related to CPU (including an Icelandic Minister, a NYT bestselling author, and a former Prime Minister) initially concerned me. However, there is no record of a "John Sigurdsson" or "Barbara De Angelis" article being deleted and the article for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> still exists.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I have commented at the AFD and made some changes to the article. Also, per you request, I have standardised the references in both articles. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see now what Hartal meant -- that the names were removed from the "notable alumni" section of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pacific_University_e3cf.html" title="Columbia Pacific University">Columbia Pacific University</a>. Well, this was certainly appropriate for Wilson (honorary fellows don't count as alumni as far as I know). Even if the other two <i>do</i> belong in the section, Hartal's way of going about it is not particularly constructive. Rather than delving into legal issues, I would suggest that he take the matter to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> if he feels there have been inappropriate actions on the part of other editors--although his actions would come under scrutiny too. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the note. That title, I think, will work better. Still, I'm not sure it holds up to Wikipedia's standards, but that can change - so I'm going with a "weak keep or merge" vote due to ambiguity (here, I'm focusing also on something like <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>, as these people are notable amongst practicioners of homeopathy), but thinking that the article might not stand on its own and be better if it were merged into the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> article itself - but hedging a bet that it can live on its own. =^^= --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. The reason I moved the article (aside from the incorrect transliteration - Chazan is the German version of her name) was for consistency. For example, another MK, <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehiel_Hazan_e34f.html" title="Yehiel Hazan">Yehiel Hazan</a>, has the same name, but spelt differently (starting with an "H") on the Knesset website. There are plenty more examples (Haim vs Chaim etc), but unfortunately people take "official" Israeli translations as read, despite the fact there is no consistency (I believe there are some pages on the website where you can find more than two names spelt in different ways (one I know of which discusses presidents, talks about Chaim Weizmann, Haim Herzog and Ezer Weizman!)), and therefore Google searches to determine the "correct" spelling are effectively meaningless. I hope this is convincing enough not to move it back as I have recently started fixing mis-transliterations of Hebrew words/names (Qiryat -&gt; Kiryat etc.) <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumber_57_ae98.html" title="User:Number 57">Number 57</a> 09:26, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a second look at the article on Digital Strategy. I've been working on making edits based on guidance from <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> and he felt it might be worthwhile for someone else to take a look. I've updated all the references (where possible) to link directly to their online sources and included page numbers (again where relevent). In addition, there are two other references which were removed as either COI or violating WP:SOURCE - self published and was wondering on what your take was now that the links have been added to the articles directly.

<dd>I actually did end up merging it with <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a>. My answer to your point about non-annotated lists -- if the list has a specific heading, no further explanation is likely to be necessary. Imagine, for instance, a section "Pigs as major characters in fiction." I don't think we'd need much in the individual items in terms of annotation. It might be better to have items like "Wilbur in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte%27s_Web_35c9.html" title="Charlotte's Web">Charlotte's Web</a>" rather than simply "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte%27s_Web_35c9.html" title="Charlotte's Web">Charlotte's Web</a>", but that's a well-controlled form of limited annotation. But I do agree that a real miscellaneous info section could never be covered well as a plain list. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, OK. So it's just a matter of specifying a narrow scope for the list. I looked at the talk page discussion <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c53e.html#Merge_suggestion" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid trivia sections in articles">here</a> and agree with you that a merge of the two is not yet appropriate (although the two should reference each other). The worst trivia sections and articles are being deleted in AFD or otherwise. However, a number of the better ones that sourced and narrow in scope are being kept or merged. To merge the essay into the guideline would constitute a change in the guideline that may not be supported by consensus. I noted previously that I <i>may</i> support turning it into a guideline, but that was if it gained consensus support. I don't think that has happened yet (though it may be worth starting a discussion on the matter). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You edited a criterion in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> down to "multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject." removing the part about "independent of each other." So consider the case that I want to write about something which happenened say in 1880 through 1900 and the only online source I have for those years is the New York Times. If I find say 12 articles about the subject in that one source, they are independent of the subject but not of each other. Is that the making of an adequately referenced article? This leaves it for others to add references from books or from other publications of the period. Could someone argue legitimately that it should be deleted for lack of multiple references "independent of each other?" They could have before your edit but not after. This is not a hypothetical case, because I have relied on that one source for the reason stated. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not believe we should require the type of independence of sources that you noted. I would say that 12 articles on a subject <i>do</i> serve as adequate referencing, even if all 12 are from the NYT. The type of independence you've outlined is essentially related to a "conflict of interest". Judging the independence of sources <i>from each other</i> is a difficult, subjective, and (in my view) unnecessary endeavour. Are two books by separate authors published by the same publisher independent? Are two news outlets who share an individual on their board of directors independent? Are separate ministries/departments of a government independent? We can say with reasonable certainty whether a given source is independent from its subject. We cannot (and in my opinion <i>should</i> not) do the same for the independence of sources from each other. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Since you seem to be have been online a few minutes ago, I figured I'd leave a message to you before doing anything else.

<dd>Thanks for your answer. I have no idea where to put it and I don't know if the people working on the WikiProject Film would <b>want</b> it. As I said, as far as I'm concerned it (a) belongs in the main space and (b) the only overhaul it needs is additional names (if there are any). At a stage in the progress of Wikipedia where every single album of some unknown pop group has its own entry certainly every single German actor and actress deserves one. Personally, I always favour and enjoy the red links because they clearly show at a glance what work there still is to be done. In other words, I would have preferred the list to remain exactly as and where it was. As this is impossible, I really have no idea what to do now. I'll keep an eye on future developments.

<p>Just to let you know that an Afd that you previously voted on, Maximilian Roos, was relisted due to some of the contributors sockpuppeting. I have revoted along with my original opinion. Laughhead 14:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Afd was closed as delete - do you think that was the correct decision? One vote was struck that came from an IP user with &gt;300 edits, another that had many edits but from a while ago. Does the remaining 3-2 demonstrate consensus? I'm not a regular wikipedia user so would be interested to know your opinion.Laughhead 16:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I should tell you, firstly, that I am not an administrator, but a regular editor. However, I spent quite a bit of time at AFD and so will give you my honest analysis of the discussion and closure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of numbers, I count 3 deletes and 3 keeps (excluding EbayVP, Cashandhoes, and yourself--no offense--for having too few edits outside the subject). One of the issues raised against the article was that much of its notability rested in the references posted on unibooks (magazine scans). As the scans seem to be unaffiliated with unibooks, I think that their consideration as unreliable was mistaken. However, that is not to say that notability, <i>as defined <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">here</a></i>, could not have been reasonably contested due to a lack of provided sources that. Perhaps a result of 'no consensus' would have been more appropriate, but then again, 'no consensus' discussions where only a few editors participate are usually left to admin discretion (not per policy as far as I'm aware, but in practice).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you wish, you may list the discussion at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>, specifically bringing up the issue of the scans on unibooks and the mistake of discounting the recommendation of the one IP user with 300+ edits. If you <i>do</i> take it to DRV, you should only address the closing of the discussion and/or bring up new sources of information--DRV should not consist merely of a restatement of arguments in the AFD. Before doing so, however, keep in mind that AFD is not just a head-count (arguments are supposed to matter more) and also that the closure as delete may well have been within the admin's discretion. I don't want to unnecessarily discourage you from pursuing the matter, but I also don't want to unnecessarily encourage you. I hope my comments aid you in making a decision as to how to proceed.

<p>Thanks for actually showing an interest in the article, rather than just in deleting the pop-culture "list" page, and thanks for adding the reference. I was the one who left the short summarry in the origianl article when I forked the material off, olong with the VC-25 article. I didn't actually write the summary, just edited it down some. Had I been aware of the stir the simple act of spinning off the notable pop culture list (we really do delete the non-notable items in WP:AIR, contary to the opinions of the supporters of the AFD), I might have reconsidered. I actually thought other parts of Wikipedia abided by the same courtesies we at WP:AIR are expected to follow. How stupid of me. Can you believe I really thought if someone objected to the article, notable listings or not, that they would post a note on the talk page, or at least browse the history to try to contact the editors who created or worked on the list, rather than go straight to the AFD process? And here I thought "Assume Good Faith" applied to everyone! I didn't know people who didn't like so-called cruft lists were exempt from that.</p>
<p>However, you have showed me courtesy, even though you don't support seem to supprot the article, and are making an effort to help the original article. THanks again for showing me not everyone on Wiki is like these guys, that people here can still be courteous to others not in their little circle. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 04:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the article survived the AfD - no consensus. Do you have any specifice suggestions for me on where to go from here? I'm not opposed to merging the content back in to the main AF1 article, but I do feel it is too long in its current form. I believe the items there are notable, or at least were considered notable by more than one editor in the past, so I respected that even if I thought the item should not be there personally. If we do leave the itmes where they are, what suggestions do you have for improving it further?

<p>Then why are claims from the Taliban etc not represented? I have already given examples of this. Why the double standard?<a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubuman_6aa0.html" title="User:Pubuman">Pubuman</a> 05:24, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no double standard. A "double-standard" requires that editors working on Sri Lanka-related topics also actively work on Afghanistan-related articles. This is not the case. Additionally, I looked at the <a href="../../../o/e/f/OEF_482f.html" title="OEF">OEF</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Afghanistan_%282001%E2%80%93present%29_53f3.html" title="War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)">War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)</a> articles, and they seem to be mostly descriptive (i.e., they contain few "claims" by one side or the other). Where relevant, however, some statements by the Taliban are included (e.g., "the Taliban rejected this ultimatum, stating there was no evidence in their possession linking bin Laden to the September 11 attacks").</dd>
<dd>The lesser representation of Taliban claims may be due to a number of factors: irrelevance of such claims to the scope of the article, the lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS"><i>reliable</i> sources</a> to document such claims, and/or lack of editorial interest in adding and incorporating this information. Whatever the reason, the perceived existence of problems with one group of articles is not a reason to allow the same problem in other articles. When an issue is disputed, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia policy</a> requires that the claims of all major sides be presented. Statements that do not present controversial claims as fact, but rather appropriately attribute them (e.g., "according to the LTTE") are neutral. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:26, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, Wikipedia is an encyclopaedic entity, therefore there should be consistency throughout all its articles. Therefore a double standard does not require the same editors to be working on both articles. That is simply wrong. And further I was talking of all terrorist groups, not just the Taliban or Al-Qaeda. I have no problem with adding both sides of the story so to speak. But what I have a problem with editors using the official LTTE websites, or websites that are clearly of LTTE origin as reliable sources. The Taliban consistently claimed they had nothing to do with Al-Qaeda and September 11th attacks, however that has not been stated. Nor are the numbers civillian deaths that were claimed by the Taliban. This is with very good reason. And that reason being there is no independently verifiable stats to support their claims. All there is is the claims made on their official websites etc. The GOSL claims are only published after they have been verified and rightly so. However with the LTTE claims their official website is enough? What difference is their between the official sources of the islamic terrorist groups and the LTTE? It should not matter what either side claims, what should be presented are the verifiable facts, and that isnt happening because a a particular few editors insist on propaganda and biased material. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubuman_6aa0.html" title="User:Pubuman">Pubuman</a> 09:27, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, there <i>should</i> be consistency, but a claim of a "double standard" implies the existence of a deliberate conspiracy by editors to note LTTE claims and withold others, which is false. You write, "The Taliban consistently claimed they had nothing to do with Al-Qaeda and September 11th attacks, however that has not been stated." Well, per NPOV, it should be stated. You write, "Nor are the numbers civillian deaths that were claimed by the Taliban". Where relevant, those numbers should be presented as well. They should be presented not as facts but as what they really are: disputed claims. You write, "GOSL claims are only published after they have been verified", but it is well recognised that GOSL frequently overestimates LTTE casualties in battle, just as the LTTE overestimates GOSL casualties.<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070325/wl_asia_afp/srilankaunrest;_ylt=Atf6IitFl5LfTR5yyFIFmPABxg8F" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070325/wl_asia_afp/srilankaunrest;_ylt=Atf6IitFl5LfTR5yyFIFmPABxg8F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> You are right in arguing that "what should be presented are the verifiable facts". Claims by one or another side are not facts; but the existence of such claims <i>is</i> fact. It is a verifiable fact that the Taliban deny any connection with the September 11 attacks. Even though the claims themselves may be false, the existence of such claims is a verifiable fact. Finally, as to your last sentence, I would like to encourage you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of editors in the absence of clear evidence to contrary. Those who note LTTE claims are merely adhering to the NPOV policy. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 16:59, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>That's my point exactly, the numbers given by the government aren't presented until they are given by neutral sources (i.e BBC) where as the official LTTE websites are used as sources for the LTTE claims, do you not understand that fundamental difference? <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubuman_6aa0.html" title="User:Pubuman">Pubuman</a> 15:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But please understand the other fundamental difference: the numbers given by BBC are presented as <i>fact</i>, whereas the numbers given by LTTE are presented as <i>claims</i>. The LTTE website is reliable as a source for its own claims. A statement like, "The airstrike killed 10 people (BBC). The LTTE claimed the dead were schoolchildren." is perfectly acceptable. So is, "The airstrike killed 10 people (BBC) who, according to the GOSL, were new recruits to the LTTE. The LTTE denied the claim and identified the dead as schoolchildren." Note that the LTTE claim is <i>not</i> presented as fact, nor is the GOSL claim. Both are presented as what they are: claims. The only thing that is presented as fact is: the airstrike killed 10 people. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 16:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your requirement for a "double standard" is simply wrong, A double standard is when two different standards are used to judge the validity or quality of something. Your def does not really even make sense. But lets leave that there and discuss the important issue here, and not symantics. But my point is there is no place for such claims on an encylcopedia. Regardless of where it comes from. Why should an encyclopedia present claims? And if the sources used are the LTTE website then that is still unreliable for reporting facts. So is the GOSL websites (just as an example) but it seems to me that this isn't a source that is really used so it's not really relevant.<a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubuman_6aa0.html" title="User:Pubuman">Pubuman</a> 08:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that is your point, then your point is counter to one of our most fundamental policies: <i>All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.</i> (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>)</dd>
<dd>Why should an encyclopedia present claims? Because sometimes we can't be sure of the truth! Because claims by different groups are an important aspect of politics! Yes, the LTTE website is not reliable for reporting facts, but I wrote above that it "is reliable as a source for its own <i>claims</i>". Not facts, but claims. If the LTTE website says that the LTTE supports X, then we can take that as reliable. "According to the LTTE, the Sri Lankan government engages in human rights violations." That is a fact. Does the GOSL engage in HR violations? Maybe, maybe not. But it is a fact that the LTTE claims the GOSL does. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok fair enough, but shouldn't we rely on fact as much as possible? And only use these claims as you say when we arent fully aware of the facts? It is my view that claims are over represtented on these articles, not just by the LTTE, but claims as a whole (i.e. GOSL and LTTE)<a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubuman_6aa0.html" title="User:Pubuman">Pubuman</a> 03:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree. Facts are neutral; claims are not. Ideally, we would use only facts and would not have to constantly append sentences with "according to the LTTE/GOSL". Unfortunately, especially when dealing with political conflicts, facts are often hard to come by. In such cases, where there is a dispute over facts, we have to resort to claims. And, in order to remain neutral, we have to present the claims of all major sides. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done two things. First, I changed all the section headings into subsection headings. These are still linkable (see, for example, <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideshow_Cinema_2b3d.html#Ruth_Shane" title="Sideshow Cinema">Sideshow Cinema#Ruth Shane</a>), so there is no need to repair links on other pages. The only exceptions are Edward Eck and Steven Mullahoo because I changed the (sub)section titles from "Ed Eck" and "Steve Mullahoo", respectively. My second change was to format almost all of the "External links" as references per &lt;ref&gt;Reference&lt;/ref&gt;. This also shortened the article without causing any loss of information. It is possible to remove or alter the table of contents. To specify its removal, simply type __NOTOC__ before the first section or subsection heading.

It does seem that at least one person is offended by the very nomination (on second thought I may have misread this user, but still); I hope I can balance that by offering my observation that you've kept everything quite honest and fair. <span style="white-space: nowrap">â€” <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> â€” 04:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for voting in my RfA. I've decided to withdraw my acceptance because of real <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> concerns. I will try again later when I've proven to myself and others that my anger will no longer interfere with my abilities as a Wikipedia editor. Thanks again, and I'll see you around here shortly.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 04:41, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
