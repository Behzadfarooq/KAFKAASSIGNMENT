<p>Black Canary is noted for her "Canary Cry" – a high powered, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_weaponry.html" title="Sonic weaponry">ultrasonic scream</a> with the ability to shatter objects and incapacitate villains. However, depending on the era, the Canary obtained the talent in a different manner. Black Canary's regular occupation is that of a self-employed <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florist.html" title="Florist">florist</a>, and is best known for her trademark <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishnet_%28material%29.html" title="Fishnet (material)">fishnet</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stocking.html" title="Stocking">stockings</a>.</p>
<p>Black Canary was among the first generation of superheroes, and a member of its all-star group the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">Justice Society of America</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the character's history was rewritten to make her two entities: Dinah Drake Lance, who took part in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books_1c51.html" title="Golden Age of Comic Books">Golden Age</a> adventures and married Gotham City detective Larry Lance, and their daughter Dinah Laurel Lance, who appeared in the modern stories. This history was further <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> after <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>.</p>
<p>Dinah Laurel Lance grew up idolizing her mother's superhero friends and (initially against mother's wishes) took up her mother’s crime-fighting mantle at age 19. She joins the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> soon after its formation. Dinah Laurel conducts espionage, counter-terrorism, and rescue missions with <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28comics%29_dc53.html" title="Birds of Prey (comics)">a group of female vigilantes</a>, and is also a longtime partner/romantic interest of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a> <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Queen_4d4a.html" title="Oliver Queen">Oliver Queen</a>.</p>
<p>Dinah Lance appears briefly in the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> adaptations of <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28TV_series%29_a205.html" title="Birds of Prey (TV series)">Birds of Prey</a></i>, and the Black Canary appears in a number of episodes of <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League</a>.</i></p>
<p>The combination of the Black Canary's courage, fearlessness, and fighting prowess, with her sex appeal (accentuated by the fishnet stockings), has resulted in her also being referred to as "The Blonde Bombshell".</p>

<p>Black Canary first appeared in <i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_Comics_bbd2.html" title="Flash Comics">Flash Comics</a></i> #86 in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, as a supporting character in the <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Thunder_d74b.html" title="Johnny Thunder">Johnny Thunder</a></i> series. Initially, she seems to be a villainess; Johnny is instantly infatuated with her and is reproached for this by his Thunderbolt. However, she is in fact infiltrating a criminal gang, a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_operandi.html" title="Modus operandi">modus operandi</a> she would follow throughout her career.</p>
<p>Black Canary proved to be popular enough that in <i>Flash Comics</i> #92, she was given her own anthology feature, <i>Black Canary</i>, replacing the <i>Johnny Thunder</i> feature. The new series fleshed out Black Canary's backstory; in her real identity, Dinah Drake is a black-haired florist whose romantic interest was Larry Lance, a detective on the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_Police_Department_c62a.html" title="Gotham City Police Department">Gotham City Police Department</a>. Her costume includes a blond wig, fishnet stockings, pirate boots, bustier, and an unbuttoned jacket. Initially, she also wears a domino mask, though this is soon jettisoned.</p>
<p>Black Canary soon joins the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">Justice Society of America</a>, but ceased being published along with the rest of the team by the early 1950s.</p>

<p>Black Canary is revived along with the other <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_comic_books_2a54.html" title="Golden Age of comic books">Golden Age</a> characters during the 1960s, and was shown as existing on the parallel world of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29_d45a.html#Earth-Two" title="Multiverse (DC Comics)">Earth-Two</a> (the home of DC's Golden Age versions of its characters). It is also revealed that Dinah has married Larry Lance during the 1950s. Dinah also took part in various annual team-ups between the Justice Society and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29_d45a.html#Earth-One" title="Multiverse (DC Comics)">Earth-One's</a> <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League of America</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> JLA-JSA team-up against the rogue living star-creature Aquarius, Larry Lance is killed while trying to save Dinah's life from an attack. Out of grief, Canary decides to move to Earth-One to create a fresh start. The Black Canary also joined the Justice League. Sometime afterwards, she begins dating her JLA colleague <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a>, and discovered that she had somehow (possibly due to exposure to radiation) gained the ultrasonic scream later dubbed the Canary Cry.</p>
<p>In <i>Justice League of America</i> #219 and #220, it is revealed that this Black Canary is actually the <b>daughter</b> of the original Black Canary and her husband. Born in the 1950s, the infant is cursed by the Justice Society foe the <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28DC_Comics%29_586d.html" title="Wizard (DC Comics)">Wizard</a> with the "gift" of a devastating yet uncontrollable Canary Cry. Dinah asked her old friend <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Thunder_d74b.html" title="Johnny Thunder">Johnny Thunder</a> to summon his Thunderbolt in hopes of a cure but it was to no avail. Instead, the Thunderbolt keeps the child in suspended animation (but aging all the while) in his native Thunderbolt dimension, until, the Lances hope, a way to cure or control her power could be found. Seeing his friends in pain, the Thunderbolt decides to erase all memory of the child, letting everyone think she has died. After the battle with Aquarius, Dinah realizes she was dying from the radiation she was exposed to during the battle with the star creature. She discussed possible solutions with the Thunderbolt and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> of Earth-1. The three arranged to transfer Dinah's memories into the body of her now-adult daughter, still held in suspended animation, while not letting Dinah believe anything unusual had happened to her. (This <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcon</a> was written to deal with the fact that Dinah was originally much older than her romantic counterpart, Green Arrow, as well as the rest of the Justice League characters.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canary_8568.html" title="Edit section: Modern Age history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Age history</span></h2>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retroactive continuity change</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Black Canary became two distinct characters, mother and daughter, named <b>Dinah Drake Lance</b> and <b>Dinah Laurel Lance</b>. Dinah Laurel would become the current Black Canary.</p>
<p>In post-<i>Crisis</i> continuity, <i>Secret Origins</i> #50 revealed that the first Dinah had been trained by her father, Detective Richard Drake, and intended to follow in his footsteps on the Gotham City police. She was turned down by the force, however, and her disillusioned father (unable to use his connections to change the decision) died of heart failure shortly thereafter. Dinah was determined to honor his memory and fight crime and corruption by whatever method possible. This led to her debut as a costumed vigilante; she would use her inheritance to open a florist shop as her day job.</p>
<p>The elder Dinah married her beau, private eye Larry Lance (still maintaining her florist business). In a Times Past-style story in <i>Birds of Prey</i>, Lance was an acquaintance of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Gordon_351d.html" title="Jim Gordon">Jim Gordon</a>, father to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Gordon_c354.html" title="Barbara Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a>. A few years later, their daughter, named Dinah Laurel Lance, was born. (In Birds of Prey #66, which is a flashback to a cold case investigated – but never solved – by the elder Dinah, Laurel was the name of a librarian that Dinah consulted during the case and later befriended.)</p>
<p>Growing up, Dinah Laurel was surrounded by her mother's friends in the disbanded JSA and looked to them as uncles and aunts. Dinah wished to become a costumed heroine like her mother before her. However, instead of encouraging the younger Dinah, her mother forbade it, thinking the world had grown into a darker, more dangerous place than when she herself fought crime, too dangerous for the younger Dinah to succeed.</p>
<p>However, Dinah Laurel had her own "Canary Cry" – in this version, the result of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metahuman.html#the_metagene" title="Metahuman">metagene</a> not present in either parent – which (unlike the Silver Age Black Canary) she is fully able to control.</p>
<p>With this weapon, the younger Dinah next sought out numerous fighters to help her hone her skills, including former JSA member <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildcat_%28comics%29.html" title="Wildcat (comics)">Wildcat</a>. Years of training and intense dedication paid off, and Dinah took on her mother's mantle, even though it was against the elder Dinah's wishes at first. She took an active role in the 'Silver Age' of heroes, operating, like her mother before her, out of Gotham, while maintaining a day job in the family florist business.</p>
<p>In an early issue of <i>Birds of Prey</i>, writer <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Dixon_4fa3.html" title="Chuck Dixon">Chuck Dixon</a> established that Dinah had married at a very young age briefly before divorcing. Her ex-husband showed up in a storyline needing her help (<i>Birds of Prey: Wolves</i>), but actually wanted her to rejoin him after he had stolen funds from the mob. This early marriage and ex-husband have never been referred to since this one issue.</p>
<p>Until 2006, the Dinah Laurel was depicted as a founding member of the post-<i>Crisis</i> Justice League, retroactively replacing <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Woman_0ea1.html" title="Wonder Woman">Wonder Woman</a> in all Silver Age appearances with the team. However, the changes wrought on the DC universe by <i>Infinite Crisis</i> have established that she actually joined the team soon after it was formed (with Wonder Woman a founding member).</p>
<p>Shortly into the League's history she met <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a> (Oliver Queen). While Dinah couldn't stand him at first, they later became romantically involved despite the difference in their ages (in the Modern Age Oliver is substantially <b>older</b> than Dinah, the reverse of the earlier characters). Dinah remained a member of the League for roughly six years, including a brief stint with <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_International_7cf8.html" title="Justice League International">Justice League International</a> (JLI), of which she was a founding member. It was during that time her mother died due to radiation poisoning she experienced during an earlier battle with the villain Aquarius. Her mother's death affected Dinah deeply, and led her to accept that her time in the JLA was over.</p>
<p>She moved to Seattle with Green Arrow after the breakup of the Justice League, and would open her own florist shop, named "Sherwood Florist" (the name is a play on <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherwood_Forest_072f.html" title="Sherwood Forest">Sherwood Forest</a>, the domain of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>, who Green Arrow (in costume) somewhat resembles).</p>

<p>The move to Seattle with Green Arrow would result in a string of bad luck for the Black Canary.</p>
<p>During this period, she took part in a failed operation to bust a drug ring. Kidnapped, Black Canary was tortured (despite popular belief, she was not raped according to series writer <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Grell_4e0c.html" title="Mike Grell">Mike Grell</a>) before being rescued by Green Arrow. The physical and mental effects of this experience were severe: Dinah's vocal cords were mutilated, resulting in the loss of her Canary Cry; she also lost her ability to have children (<i>Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters</i>). <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template_talk%7EComic_book_reference_3187.html" title="Template talk:Comic book reference"><i>issue&#160;#&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> She required extensive counselling after this experience, as did Oliver Queen.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, she and Green Arrow would have major conflicts in their relationship. Among other things, she would learn that Green Arrow fathered a son, Robert, with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shado.html" title="Shado">Shado</a> (though Shado had drugged him beforehand), as well as taking money from the business (<i>Black Canary</i> #1). The relationship would end when Dinah walked in on Green Arrow kissing her florist shop assistant, Marianne.</p>
<p>Yet even more bad luck would hit when Sherwood Florist was destroyed, leaving Dinah with no means of paying the debt collectors who were now calling.</p>
<p>The worst blows of all would come when she learned from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connor_Hawke_fa15.html" title="Connor Hawke">Connor Hawke</a> that Oliver was killed (<i>Green Arrow</i> #101), and that Connor was yet another of his offspring.</p>
<p>Though Black Canary would continue to fight crime off and on (at some point Black Canary became a pen pal of the youthful hero known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ray_b687.html" title="The Ray">The Ray</a>, who had a crush on her, and she participated in some of his adventures, even having a brief romance) <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template_talk%7EComic_book_reference_3187.html" title="Template talk:Comic book reference"><i>issue&#160;#&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, the effects of her misfortunes were taking their toll.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canary_8568.html" title="Edit section: Oracle and the Birds of Prey">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Oracle and the Birds of Prey</span></h3>
<p>Finally, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Gordon_c354.html" title="Barbara Gordon">Oracle</a> asked Black Canary to become an operative for her.</p>
<p>Black Canary took to this role with great satisfaction (making one major change in her wardrobe by abandoning the blonde wig, instead choosing to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peroxide.html" title="Peroxide">bleach</a> her hair blonde), although in the beginning there were a number of disagreements between the two. Eventually, the two would meet (<i>Birds of Prey</i> #29) and become best friends, both having a common background – both lost their original abilities and entered a period of depression, yet managed to overcome.</p>
<p>In <i>Birds of Prey</i> #7, Oracle would provide Dinah an electronic version of the Canary Cry. Later, in <i>Birds of Prey</i> #34, Black Canary (who was dating a mysterious European named "Raymond", who Oracle guessed – correctly – was actually supervillain <a href="../../../r/a/27/Ra%27s_Al_Ghul_afc4.html" title="Ra's Al Ghul">Ra's Al Ghul</a>) was seriously wounded and then was immersed in a <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarus_Pit_a97b.html" title="Lazarus Pit">Lazarus Pit</a>. <i>Birds of Prey</i> #35 shows that the Pit restored her metahuman Canary Cry (as well as the ability to have children — this had been impaired several years earlier; the recovery is implied but not explicitly stated in the issue).</p>
<p>For a brief period of time Black Canary was a member of the newest incarnation of the JSA. In fact, she is one of the few heroes in the DC Universe to hold memberships in both the JSA and the JLA.</p>
<p>Working with Oracle, Black Canary cultivated a covert team of female operatives in the series <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28comic%29_7891.html" title="Birds of Prey (comic)">Birds of Prey</a></i> whose members include <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntress_%28comics%29.html" title="Huntress (comics)">Huntress</a>, <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy_%28comics%29.html" title="Gypsy (comics)">Gypsy</a>, and Zinda Blake (the original <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Blackhawk_8c3a.html" title="Lady Blackhawk">Lady Blackhawk</a>). In Issue #64, Oracle would show Black Canary an empty retail building, which would later house a reopened Sherwood Florist.</p>
<p>Since they were both trained by the same <i><a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensei.html" title="Sensei">sensei</a></i>, Black Canary has fostered a friendship of sorts with <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Shiva_db48.html" title="Lady Shiva">Lady Shiva</a>. Shiva, impressed by Black Canary's formidable martial arts prowess, offered to provide her with further training. Black Canary turned down the offer, thinking it would compromise her morality. Still, they kept an ongoing correspondence, with Shiva conveying recommendations to assist Canary in honing her skills.</p>
<p>In comics, Black Canary had her own four issue mini series titled <i>New Wings</i> as well as a twelve issue ongoing series, both written by <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Byam_36ad.html" title="Sarah Byam">Sarah Byam</a>.</p>

Following the "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_Later_fa46.html" title="One Year Later">One Year Later</a>" jump, Dinah trades life experiences with <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Shiva_db48.html" title="Lady Shiva">Lady Shiva</a> in hopes of softening the warrior, undertaking a harsh training regimen in an unidentified Vietnamese <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidonville.html" title="Bidonville">bidonville</a>, or shantytown. The regimen replicates Shiva's early life and training; Shiva, meanwhile, assumes Dinah's role in Oracle's group and demands that her associates call her the "Jade Canary".</p>
<p>When Dinah realizes following Lady Shiva's path will require her to fundamentally change who she is as a person, she ends the training and returns to the United States. She brings with her a little girl, Sin, who also had begun the harsh grooming process to be Lady Shiva's successor (Birds of Prey #95; the now resurrected Oliver Queen uses his connections to allow Sin to immigrate into the country). Dinah hopes to balance her duties as a superhero with the responsibilities of being a surrogate mother/sister to the child.</p>
<p>In <i>Birds of Prey</i> #99 Dinah informs Oracle that she is quitting the team, deciding instead to devote all her time to raising Sin. Issue #100 shows that Dinah and Sin are moving away from Metropolis; their final destination is not stated but hinted that it may be <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_City_%28comics%29_4b19.html" title="Star City (comics)">Star City</a> as Dinah tells Sin (jokingly) she can rip Ollie's beard out if he isn't nice to her.</p>

<p>Black Canary is best known for her "Canary Cry" – a high-pitched, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_weaponry.html" title="Sonic weaponry">ultrasonic scream</a> which enables her to shatter objects and incapacitate villains. (The ability was lost in the <i>Green Arrow</i> series, but was restored in the <i>Birds of Prey</i> series.)</p>

<p>In addition to the Canary Cry, she is proficient in the martial arts and an expert motorcycle rider. Notwithstanding her often heated arguments with Oracle, she serves as a peacemaker between the sometimes disagreeing team members and other superhero groups, as well as trying to instill a sense of humanity within some of them (most notably Huntress, who is quite prone to use of excessive force).</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> in the <i>Birds of Prey</i> series is Black Canary's lack of proficiency with computers (and very little interest in them). She is the polar opposite of team leader Oracle (who is a computer genius). The very first page of <i>Birds of Prey</i> #1 features Dinah's desire to have a distasteful item removed from her presence – the next page shows the object of her dislike to be a desktop computer.</p>

In her only appearance, her "canary cry" is portrayed as being activated by whistling, rather than screaming. This version of Black Canary appears to be killed off at the end of the episode, though the writers left her fate ambiguous in order to allow a possible return later. When <i>Birds of Prey</i> was first announced, the producers indicated that the teenaged Dinah Redmond would be a re-imagined Black Canary (with early publicity material referring to her directly by that name), but outcry from fans led to the character being modified. In fact, the character was repeatedly modified with changes in name, history, and powers as writers struggled to define her during the short-lived series.<br clear="all" /></p>

Later, in <i>The Cat and the Canary</i>, she stars as a fearsome physical fighter (as well as sporting her sonic cry). She was vexed because her old mentor, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildcat_%28comics%29.html" title="Wildcat (comics)">Wildcat</a>, had been obsessively engaging in underground fighting tournaments, and she convinced the smitten Green Arrow to help her convince Wildcat to return to the League.
