<p><b>Blair Robert Hartland</b> (born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">22 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch.html" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury%2C_New_Zealand_22ed.html" title="Canterbury, New Zealand">Canterbury</a>) is a former <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricketer.html" title="Cricketer">cricketer</a> who played nine <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Tests</a> and 16 <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_international.html" title="One-day international">one-day internationals</a> for <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_b7ed.html" title="New Zealand cricket team">New Zealand</a>. He also played 11 seasons of domestic cricket for <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury_cricket_team.html" title="Canterbury cricket team">Canterbury</a>, playing 83 <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_class_cricket.html" title="First class cricket">first class</a> and 68 <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_A_cricket_933c.html" title="List A cricket">List A</a> games in total. He was a specialist batsman, who usually opened the innings and bowled a total of three overs in his senior career.</p>
<p>Hartland was marked out as a talent early on, and aged 19 he was picked for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Under-19_cricket_team_bda6.html" title="New Zealand Under-19 cricket team">New Zealand Young Cricketers</a>, who toured <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985-86_New_Zealand_cricket_season_e74a.html" title="1985-86 New Zealand cricket season">1985–86</a>. The following season he made his first class debut, playing one game for Canterbury in a drawn domestic game. He made 59 runs for once out, retiring injured in the second innings, and did not return in that season. He also played two seasons of second XI cricket for <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club_66b6.html" title="Northamptonshire County Cricket Club">Northamptonshire</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_English_cricket_season_abfe.html" title="1987 English cricket season">1987</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_English_cricket_season_ba3a.html" title="1988 English cricket season">1988</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988-89_New_Zealand_cricket_season_1d59.html" title="1988-89 New Zealand cricket season">1988–89</a> Hartland hit his maiden first class century, in his fourteenth match.</p>
<p>Hartland became a regular fixture in the Canterbury first-class team after that, playing 10 of 11 games in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990-91_New_Zealand_cricket_season_b99d.html" title="1990-91 New Zealand cricket season">1990–91 season</a>, for example. The following season, he was picked as an opening batsman for New Zealand Emerging Players (similar to the current <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_A_cricket_team_1231.html" title="New Zealand A cricket team">New Zealand A team</a>) against a touring <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_cricket_team.html" title="England cricket team">England XI</a>. Though Hartland faced 36 balls in his two innings, he only made one run for twice out, but that didn't prevent the New Zealand selectors from selecting him for the first Test at his native <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch.html" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a> two weeks later, as New Zealand sought a replacement for the defensive opener <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Franklin_4024.html" title="Trevor Franklin">Trevor Franklin</a> who had opened on tour of Sri Lanka a year earlier <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1990-91/SL_IN_NZ/SL_NZ_T3_01-05MAR1991.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1990-91/SL_IN_NZ/SL_NZ_T3_01-05MAR1991.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>However, Hartland's debut did not yield a good result for New Zealand. England were put in to bat, made 580 for nine <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_and_forfeiture.html" title="Declaration and forfeiture">declared</a>, before <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_bowling.html" title="Spin bowling">spin bowler</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Tufnell_fd4c.html" title="Phil Tufnell">Phil Tufnell</a> took eleven wickets in the match, including Hartland twice, for 22 in the first innings and then 45 in the second when stumps were drawn on day four. Hartland watched as Tufnell added a further six victims in the second innings, and England secured a victory by an innings and four runs <a href="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/55/55357.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/55/55357.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Hartland was retained for the second Test, however, and recorded a pair of <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_%28cricket%29.html" title="Duck (cricket)">ducks</a> as New Zealand went down by 168 runs – before scoring 2 in New Zealand's first innings of the third Test where the team made 432 for 9 declared after a stand of 241 between <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wright_%28cricketer%29_958b.html" title="John Wright (cricketer)">John Wright</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jones_%28cricketer%29_9f94.html" title="Andrew Jones (cricketer)">Andrew Jones</a>.</p>
<p>Hartland had still not passed fifty in six Test innings, but was still taken on tours of <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwean_cricket_team.html" title="Zimbabwean cricket team">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_e5c9.html" title="Sri Lankan cricket team">Sri Lanka</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992-93_New_Zealand_cricket_season_762c.html" title="1992-93 New Zealand cricket season">1992–93</a>, and though he did not play a Test against Zimbabwe (with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Greatbatch_23b1.html" title="Mark Greatbatch">Mark Greatbatch</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Latham_29ac.html" title="Rod Latham">Rod Latham</a> preferred as openers), he played his first ODI on that tour, scoring five runs from number three in the batting order as New Zealand won by four wickets. Greatbatch and Latham were dropped for Sri Lanka, however, and Hartland was back as opener together with Wright; after he was out to Duleep Liyanage for 3 in the first innings, and Sri Lanka had declared 39 runs ahead with five sessions remaining, Hartland batted for four hours in an opening stand worth 110 with Wright, making his maiden Test fifty. New Zealand batted out the match, making 195 for 5 the second innings in a drawn game <a href="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/56/56647.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/56/56647.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>That was enough for Hartland to be picked for the second Test a week later, where he made the second highest score of New Zealand's innings. However, that was only 21, as New Zealand fell from 57 for 0 to 102 all out; following on, Hartland made 21 again as New Zealand made 361, but Sri Lanka took a nine-wicket win and the series by 1–0. Hartland also played two of the three ODIs in the series, recording his maiden ODI fifty, but New Zealand still lost both matches and the series 0–2.</p>
<p>Hartland also played New Zealand's next Test <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/NZ/SERIES/ALL.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/NZ/SERIES/ALL.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, a home match against <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_cricket_team.html" title="Pakistani cricket team">Pakistan</a>, but after he once again failed to pass 50 and made 9 in a second-innings chase of 127 to win, where New Zealand were bowled out for 93 by <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasim_Akram_38ed.html" title="Wasim Akram">Wasim Akram</a> (five for 45) and <a href="../../../w/a/q/Waqar_Younis_1827.html" title="Waqar Younis">Waqar Younis</a> (five for 22) <a href="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/56/56777.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/56/56777.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> he was dropped and did not play international matches for over a year. When he did return, it was once again against Pakistan, scoring 13 runs in two innings in a five-wicket win for New Zealand. He continued to feature in the New Zealand side for the remainder of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993-94_New_Zealand_cricket_season_ddd0.html" title="1993-94 New Zealand cricket season">1993–94 season</a>, making 68 <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_out.html" title="Not out">not out</a> in a successful chase of 146 in a one-day international against Pakistan, but otherwise not passing 25 in one Test and seven one-day internationals.</p>
<p>Hartland was, however, picked for New Zealand's tour of England in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_English_cricket_season_0916.html" title="1994 English cricket season">1994</a>; he played nine matches against first-class sides of the country, but only one Test, his last. Hartland made 6 and 22 in an innings defeat <a href="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/58/58946.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/58/58946.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and was replaced by <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Pocock_cf2e.html" title="Blair Pocock">Blair Pocock</a> in the next match <a href="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/59/59027.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/59/59027.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. He played a further five ODIs during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994-95_New_Zealand_cricket_season_40a2.html" title="1994-95 New Zealand cricket season">1994–95 season</a>, but after five scores below 50 he was dropped after the Mandela Trophy. He played a further two seasons for Canterbury before retiring.</p>
