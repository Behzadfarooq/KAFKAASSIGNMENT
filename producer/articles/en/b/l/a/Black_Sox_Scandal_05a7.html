<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_Scandal_05a7.html" title="Edit section: The Fix">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Fix</span></h2>
<p>The plan was thought up by local gamblers, but rumor has it that New York gangster <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Rothstein_b415.html" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a> supplied the major connections needed. The money was supplied by <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abe_Attell_144f.html" title="Abe Attell">Abe Attell</a>, former featherweight boxing champion, who accepted the offer even though he didn't have the $80,000 that the White Sox wanted. The conspiracy was the brainchild of White Sox first baseman <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chick_Gandil_7e7d.html" title="Chick Gandil">Arnold "Chick" Gandil</a> and Joseph "Sport" Sullivan, who was a professional gambler of Gandil's acquaintance.</p>
<p>Gandil enlisted seven of his teammates, motivated by a mixture of greed and a dislike of penurious club owner <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Comiskey_3d1e.html" title="Charles Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>, to implement the fix. Starting pitchers <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cicotte_4bed.html" title="Eddie Cicotte">Eddie Cicotte</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/f/Lefty_Williams_58fb.html" title="Lefty Williams">Claude "Lefty" Williams</a>, outfielders <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson_4194.html" title="Shoeless Joe Jackson">"Shoeless" Joe Jackson</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Felsch_4973.html" title="Happy Felsch">Oscar "Happy" Felsch</a>, and infielder <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swede_Risberg_9c66.html" title="Swede Risberg">Charles "Swede" Risberg</a> were all involved. <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Weaver_5f17.html" title="Buck Weaver">Buck Weaver</a> was also asked to participate, but refused; he was later banned with the others for knowing of the fix but not reporting it. Utility infielder <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_McMullin_e48c.html" title="Fred McMullin">Fred McMullin</a> was not initially approached, but got word of the fix and threatened to report the others unless he was in on the payoff. Sullivan and his two associates <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Burns_9a74.html" title="Bill Burns">Bill Burns</a> and Billy Maharg, somewhat out of their depth, approached Rothstein to provide the money for the players, who were promised a total of $100,000.</p>
<p>Stories of the "Black Sox" scandal have usually included Comiskey in its gallery of subsidiary villains, focusing in particular on his intentions regarding a clause in Cicotte's contract that would have paid Cicotte an additional $10,000 bonus for winning 30 games. According to Eliot Asinof's account of the events, <i><a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Men_Out_374c.html" title="Eight Men Out">Eight Men Out</a></i>, Cicotte was "rested" for the season's final two weeks after reaching his 29th win, presumably to deny him the bonus. However, the record is murkier. Cicotte won his 29th game on September 19, had an ineffective start on September 24, and was pulled after a few innings in a tuneup on the season's final day, September 28 (the World Series beginning 3 days later). Reportedly, Cicotte agreed to the fix on the same day he won his 29th game, before he could have known of any efforts to deny his chance to win his 30th.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_Scandal_05a7.html" title="Edit section: The Series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Series</span></h2>
<p>Even before the Series started on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, there were rumors amongst the gambling community that things were not square, and the influx of money being bet on Cincinnati caused the odds against them to fall rapidly. These rumors also reached the press box where a number of correspondents, including Hugh Fullerton of the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Herald_and_Examiner_243d.html" title="Chicago Herald and Examiner">Chicago Herald and Examiner</a></i> and the ex-player and manager <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Mathewson_bb80.html" title="Christy Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, resolved to compare notes on any plays and players that they felt were questionable. Despite the rampant rumors, the gamblers continued to wager heavily against the White Sox and arranged to have the players signal their willingness to go through with the fix. On the second pitch of the Series, Eddie Cicotte struck Cincinnati leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back. The fix would go ahead as planned. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether or not Jackson was in the conspiracy remains controversial. Jackson himself maintained that he was innocent, especially in his last words, which were "I'm about to face the greatest umpire of all, and He knows I am innocent." He had a .375 batting average, threw out five baserunners, and handled thirty chances in the outfield with no errors during that series. However, he batted far worse in the five games that the White Sox lost, totaling only one <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">RBI</a>, from a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> in game 8, when the Reds had a large lead and the series was all but over. Jackson — generally considered a strong defensive player — was unable to prevent a critical two-run triple to left during the series, though, on another occasion, he also threw a runner out at the plate. Most damningly, Jackson took $5000 from the gamblers. After the series was over, he tried to give the money back on multiple occasions, but by that time the damage had been done. Possibly, if he had not been illiterate, he would have never fallen into the scandal.</p>
<p>One play in particular has been subjected to much scrutiny. In the fifth inning of game 4, with a Cincinnati player on second, Jackson fielded a single hit to left field and threw home. Eyewitness accounts say that the throw would have resulted in an out had pitcher <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cicotte_4bed.html" title="Eddie Cicotte">Eddie Cicotte</a>, one of the leaders of the fix, not interfered.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The run scored and the White Sox lost the game 2-0. James C. Hamilton, the official scorer of the 1919 World Series, later testified under oath in a civil trial between Jackson and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Comiskey_3d1e.html" title="Charles Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a> that the throw was honest and that Cicotte jumped up and knocked it down for an error.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chick_Gandil_7e7d.html" title="Chick Gandil">Chick Gandil</a>, another leader of the fix, later admitted to yelling at Cicotte to intercept the throw.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Cicotte, whose guilt is undisputed, made three errors in that fifth inning alone.</p>
<p>Another argument, presented in the book <i><a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Men_Out_374c.html" title="Eight Men Out">Eight Men Out</a></i>, is that because Jackson was illiterate, he had little awareness of the seriousness of the plot, and thus he consented to it only when Risberg threatened him and his family. Jackson accepted money in the fix and, on the advice of his lawyers, pleaded guilty in the ensuing trial.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_Scandal_05a7.html" title="Edit section: Fallout">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fallout</span></h2>
<p>The rumors dogged the club throughout the 1920 season, as the White Sox battled the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> for the AL <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennant.html" title="Pennant">pennant</a> that year, and stories of corruption touched players on other clubs as well. At last, in September 1920, a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> was convened to investigate.</p>
<p>During the investigation two players, Cicotte and Jackson, confessed. Comiskey suspended the seven White Sox still in the majors (Gandil had left the team and was playing semi-pro ball). This move decimated the team, and the remnants finished second, two games behind Cleveland. Prior to the trial, key evidence went missing from the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cook_County%2C_Illinois_bf0c.html" title="Cook County, Illinois">Cook County</a> Courthouse, including the signed confessions of Cicotte and Jackson, who subsequently recanted their confessions. The players were acquitted. Some years later, the missing confessions reappeared in the possession of Comiskey's lawyer.</p>
<p>However, the majors were not so forgiving. The damage to the sport's reputation led the owners to appoint <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_judge.html" title="Federal judge">Federal Judge</a> <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis_737d.html" title="Kenesaw Mountain Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> as the first <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner_of_Baseball_2c4b.html" title="Commissioner of Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a>. The day after the players were acquitted, Landis issued his own verdict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the verdict of juries, no player who throws a ball game, no player who undertakes or promises to throw a ball game, no player who sits in confidence with a bunch of crooked players and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this statement, all eight implicated White Sox were banned from Major League Baseball for life, as were two other players believed to be involved. The White Sox would not win another World Series until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_World_Series_dd89.html" title="2005 World Series">2005</a>.</p>

<li><b><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson_4194.html" title="Shoeless Joe Jackson">"Shoeless" Joe Jackson</a></b>. The star outfielder, one of the best hitters in the game, confessed to accepting money from the gamblers. (The story told by Hugh Fullerton of a tearful young boy standing on the courthouse steps, calling out "Say it ain't so, Joe!" is almost certainly <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocryphal.html" title="Apocryphal">apocryphal</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) He later recanted his confession and protested his innocence to no effect until his death in 1951.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Weaver_5f17.html" title="Buck Weaver">George "Buck" Weaver</a></b>, third baseman. Weaver attended the initial meetings, and while he did not go in on the fix, he knew about it. Landis banished him on this basis, stating "Men associating with crooks and gamblers could expect no leniency." On January 13, 1922 Buck unsuccessfully applied for reinstatement. Like Jackson, Weaver continued to protest his innocence to successive Baseball Commissioners to no effect. He died in 1956.</li>

<p>Although many believe the Black Sox name to be related to the dark and corrupt nature of the conspiracy, the term "Black Sox" may already have existed before the fix. There is a story that the name "Black Sox" derived from parsimonious owner <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Comiskey_3d1e.html" title="Charles Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>'s refusal to pay for the players' uniforms to be laundered, instead insisting that the players themselves pay for the cleaning.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> As the story goes, the players refused and subsequent games saw the White Sox play in progressively filthier uniforms as dust, sweat and grime collected on the white, woolen uniforms until they took on a much darker shade.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Eliot Asinof in his book <i>8 Men Out</i> makes no such connection, referring early on to filthy uniforms but referring to the term "Black Sox" only in connection with the scandal.</p>

<p>Eliot Asinof's book, <i>Eight Men Out</i>, is the best-known history of the scandal. Director <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sayles_6d88.html" title="John Sayles">John Sayles</a>' film <i><a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Men_Out_374c.html" title="Eight Men Out">Eight Men Out</a></i>, based on Asinof's book, is a dramatization of the scandal, focusing largely on Buck Weaver as the one banned player who did not take any money. It stars <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cusack_773f.html" title="John Cusack">John Cusack</a> as Weaver. <a href="../../../w/2E/p/W.P._Kinsella_9fbc.html" title="W.P. Kinsella">W.P.

The novel was adapted into the hit film <i><a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_of_Dreams_07d1.html" title="Field of Dreams">Field of Dreams</a></i>. Also, in <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Scott_Fitzgerald_ccfe.html" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>'s novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>, a minor character named Meyer Wolfsheim was said to have helped in the Black Sox scandal, though this is purely fictional. In explanatory notes accompanying the novel's 75th anniversary edition, editor Matthew J. Bruccoli describes the character as being directly based on Rothstein.</p>
<p>Also, in Francis Ford Coppola's film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_Part_II_7ee4.html" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>, the fictional Jewish gangster <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hyman_Roth_f133.html" title="Hyman Roth">Hyman Roth</a> alludes to the scandal when he says, "I've loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919."</p>
