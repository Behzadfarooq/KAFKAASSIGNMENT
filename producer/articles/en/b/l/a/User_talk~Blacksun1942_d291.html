<dd>Let me quote what you actually wrote: "uninformed decision-making by GROSSLY incompetent people who lack professionalism". In which world is this not a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>? Certainly I consider it one, and I fail to see how you could possibly read Wikipedia's personal attack policy and honestly say this is not covered. This is deeply personal, since you are discussing the particular admins who deleted the article you are so anxious to retain. Simply avoiding naming them does not make the attack any less personal. You seem to be an intelligent guy, so I expect this point is not lost on you. Your claim that the Wikipedia guidelines were not followed in the deletion of Angry Nintendo Nerds is simply false. Have you actually read the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> discussion?</dd>
<dd>Your point about there being other bad articles is well made, but far from a good reason to allow the ANN article. Are you seriously arguing that we should allow all bad articles if there is even one? That's not going to improve the quality of Wikipedia at all. There are over a 1.5 million articles and around 1000 admins. It takes a while to get through all the crap. How about instead of complaining about the poor articles, you help out and propose some for deletion (as I just did for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dildo_Song_02fe.html" title="The Dildo Song">The Dildo Song</a>).</dd>
<dd>Finally, just as a matter of practicality, do you sincerely believe that insulting, repeatedly, the only people who can get your article restored is the likely to be the most productive way to persuade them of the merits of your argument? Maybe you do, but I'm telling you, I'm now feeling in a particularly incompetent mood and cannot figure out how I might have helped you. Sorry us admins are all so dumb. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 01:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The link to the AfD is right there on the Talk:Angry_Nintendo_Nerd page that you posted to. I know this because I posted it there. Take another look. The discussion is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angry_Nintendo_Nerd_9ec0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angry Nintendo Nerd">here</a>. I'm amazed that you felt it appropriate to throw around accusations and personal attacks without researching the facts first. You seem to be under the impression that admins are somehow in a different position from all other editors. Fundamentally we're not. We aren't paid for our activities any more than you are (your expectations of "professionalism" are odd). Nor do we have a special mission. We just have a few extra tools. While its true that we are the only ones who can carry out the technical task of deleting an article, we rarely make the decision to do so: that's the community's privilege either via AfD discussions or by setting the policies we enforce. Which is exactly what happened here. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:10, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And you misunderstand mine. Its not the responsibility of <i>just</i> the admins to identify articles for deletion; every editor on Wikipedia can and should help with this task. More importantly, the fact that a low quality article hasn't been deleted yet does <b>not</b> necessarily mean that it is endorsed by admins or anyone else. You say these articles are "are allowed to be posted and remain up" implying every article is manually inspected before being posted. This simply isn't true. When you see these articles, it usually just means no-one has noticed it yet. Again, there are literally thousands of new articles being created each day; some slip through the net. Instead of complaining about all these low quality articles out there, do something about it. I have, what have you done to help clean up Wikipedia? <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:26, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "professionalism": I am an editor, just the same as you. Being an admin indeed has an expectation of professionalism, but only in exactly the same way as it is expected of all editors. You complain that I have a lack of professionalism, but I'm not the one throwing around personal attacks and making unfounded accusations without making even the most basic effort to ascertain the facts. Are you sure you want to get into a debate about who is "unprofessional"? <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for the message about re-opening was because the original closure of the AfD was contested. The AfD was then re-opened for further discussion and closed a day or so later with a consensus to delete. The discussion is now closed and the article was deleted, per policy. The reason it was protected was because the same article that the community had decided to delete was then recreated twice in rapid succession.</dd>
<dd>If you wish to re-open the debate on the article, you can request a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> as it mentions on the protection notice. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:36, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. You modified timeline section of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kim_20f8.html" title="James Kim">James Kim</a> article, changing sentence "after 6 days surviving in the car" to "after 7 days surviving in the car. Since Kims were surviving in the car since Nov 26th (Sunday) 2am and James left on Dec 2nd (Saturday) 7:45 am, it means that he left after 6 days and 6 hours of surviving in the car, which is not after 7 days but after 6 days. You can say is <i>on seventh day of surviving in the car</i> but not <b>after</b> 7 days. Please make correction, since I already did it in the past and you rolled it back, and I don't want to do this editing loop endlessly. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/g/r/User%7ERgrof_83bd.html" title="User:Rgrof">Roman</a> 16:44, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
