	    <p>Regarding the discussion of technical analysis predictions, for what it is worth, I very well do remember two analysts, independent of each other, in August 1987, publicly and specifically calling a market top and advising a soon-to-be bear market. I also remember very well during that August, September, and October the classic bubble behavior of investors and the media trumpeting the raging Dow, not unlike and very smilar to late 1999 and early 2000.</p>
<p>Also, the term "crash" is (perhaps unfortunately) defined as a percentage drop---but without market context. In the big picture, ignoring percentage drop, Black Monday and the market drop of October 1987 was really only a cyclical bear market in the context of the secular bull market that started in March 1982 and ended in March 2000. Black Monday was really an excellent buying opportunity for mid-term and long-term investors and those investors who understood the principle of long valuation waves. A "crash" of more than 20% following a bubble AT THE END of a secular bull market AT THE END of a long valuation wave is devastating, e.g., March 2000 to March 2003. A "crash" of more than 20% DURING a secular bull market DURING a long valuation wave is when stocks are on sale, which was true of October 1987.</p>

<p>The article says: <i>"Many have noted that no major news or events occurred prior to the Monday of the crash, the decline seeming to have come from nowhere."</i> But what about the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Storm_of_1987_be78.html" title="Great Storm of 1987">Great Storm of 1987</a>, three days earlier? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward_42f0.html" title="User:Edward">Edward</a> 23:38, 2005 May 16 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Few of the traders could get to work on Friday morning and those that did were unable to trade normally because of problems with the computers, trades had to be made by phone. But then again, this was just London, the crash started elsewhere. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward_42f0.html" title="User:Edward">Edward</a> 23:31, 2005 May 17 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't think an isolated storm in Great Britain couldn't have caused a worldwide crash that hit countries as far away as Australia and Japan. Large storms don't have huge effects on stock markets. The typhoon that hit South East Asia last year is an example - world stock markets hardly budged. Commodities did, but not stocks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The storm may not have caused the world wide crash, however the the reaction of stock brokers to the storm must have had an impact There were other factors which explain why the world economy was fragile at the time, however the crash needed an event to trigger it and there has never been a convincing smoking gun. The typhoon in South East Asia had no impact on major financial institutions so how could it affect the world economy. In fact these days trading can continue seemlessly even if two important buildings in the heart of Ne York are physically destroyed. This was not the case in 1987. The City of London still relied heavily of face to face contact. They did not have lap top computers and they still used the papers they held in the filing cabinets. The storm struck the worst place, from an economic perspective, possible in England - London. It also struck on the worst possible day, Friday, which prevented traders from closing their positions for 3 days. By the time they got to work on Monday it was too late.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The City of London should not be underestimated, it is still very much a major player in the world economy, it is the ancestral home of the "invisible" world economy. It IS the British economy, the City of London is ecomomically bigger by far than the rest of the country; by a long long way. For historical reasons London and New York are particulary close, and there have been many occasions when panic in one market has had a knock on affect on the other market. If the markets in London and New York sneaze then the markets of Australia and Japan will catch a cold, every time.</p>
<p>There most definitely were traders at the time who privately blamed the mess they got into on the storm, as anyone old enough to remember should be able to testify.</p>
<p>-New York and Tokyo were the major markets of the time, don't see how a small storm in the UK could cause a crash. I'd be pretty surprised if many Japanese or New York brokers were even aware of London markets being closed. In general natural disasters don't move stock markets - the floods in the US the summer of 2005 were much more disasterous than the London storm but didn't cause stock markets much grief. Lope</p>
<dl>
<dd>Until the London theory has proof in the form of an academic paper or something else as notable, it contradicts the no original research policy at wikipedia and should probably be removed. Does anyone know where this theory can be referenced? - Aug 3 2006</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My father's stock broker used the excuse that the storm of 1987 prevented him from going to work on Friday 16th October, and as a result he had not been able to close his positions ahead of the crash on the following Monday. Of course one stock broker does not cause a crash, but it does suggest because of the storm the London markets may have been vulnerable at the time. I am not suggesting that the panic selling in other markets round the world was a reaction to the London storm per se, but maybe a reaction to the reaction of London Stock brokers. However this is a genuine story that was given to my father within days of the crash, and not something made up years later by a non-academic, or for that matter an academic. Unfortunately I have nothing in writing from the stock broker, but I think it would be a pity to remove this from wikipedia. - Nov 2006.</dd>

<p>The link at the end, which leads to a story about a VAX machine getting into trouble, might be erroneous. I suggest this because I've seen the story before without the line at the very end linking it to Black Monday (in fact, I always thought the event too place significantly prior to 1987). While it's possible that somebody might add this last line to add dramatic emphasis to the story, it's unlikely that it would be cut out by somebody - it's forms a punchline to the story. Therefore I think the link between this VAX story and Black Monday is probably incorrect.</p>

<p>I'd like to see a graph of the New Zealand sharemarket during this period. It crashed badly, and stayed crashed for years afterwards. The crash caused the collapse of a number of high profile investment companies and affected other parts of the economy, including house prices I think.

<p>"In fact it was not the largest one-day percentage decline in recorded stock market history. That occured on December 12, 1914, when the DJIA fell 24.39%."</p>
<p>This is somewhat correct however there was no trading between 7/30/1914 and 12/14/1914 due to WWI. Due to this lapse in time 1987 is considered to largest single day decline.</p>

<p>I'd like to move this to 1987 Stock market crash (but I am unsure of the ideal capitalisation (not a pun)) which is a bit more meaningful and more likely to be what a user would search for.

<p>I had just entered the brokerage business in October 1987, and one area I would like to see explored is the fallout from the crash. I remember hearing about individuals and firms who suffered staggering losses. Some of the fallout may be esoteric to such areas as restrictions on selling short put options, but there are probably other more significant reactions that can be reported on. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertknyc_49d5.html" title="User:Robertknyc">Robertknyc</a> 02:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"In late August some observers warned that technical analysis indicated the market was now in a cyclical "bear" mode.[verification needed]" I'd like to see verification of this. Technical analysis is hardly universally accepted as accurate. It would be frankly astounding if it predicted a stock market crash like this. --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValwen_fc82.html" title="User:Valwen">Valwen</a> 06:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with this. I don't remember, at the time, a chorus of analysts, technical or otherwise, saying in late August that the market was in a cyclical bear mode. The S&amp;P and Dow topped on August 25 and had barely begun to pull back into month's end, so it makes no sense that a consensus of technicians would pronounce "in late August" that a cyclical bear market had begun. As of August 31 there was a pullback lasting just a week, and there were no major broken uptrend lines, etc. It probably makes sense to eliminate this line, or, unlikely, provide documentation of the assertion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertknyc_49d5.html" title="User:Robertknyc">Robertknyc</a> 16:41, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly all claims by technical analysts have to be documented with references by reliable media. There is one technical analyst who I more-or-less believe on this point with a possible reference on investopedia, but looking in detail the reference relies only on his own say-so. This is of course <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Prechter_34ac.html" title="Robert Prechter">Robert Prechter</a> who verifiably claims to have called the run-up (Predicting 3600 on the Dow on the Jan. 5 cover of Barron's). He also had an opinion piece on <b>Oct. 20 1987</b> with a correction on <b>Oct. 21</b> in the Wall Street Journal, that seems to say the DOW is going straight down the tubes, this is only the beginning (and I've been saying this for a while). It's the (and I've been saying this for a while) as I remember it, that was the cause of the newspaper correction, and the source of much of Prechter's bad PR. But if he hadn't said this - at least to his own subscribers (and not the public, like his up forecasts) - then it would certainly take large cojones to say it in the WSJ on Oct.20, 1987. So I actually believe him on this, but on not much else.</dd>
<dd>By the way, as a warning, anything that I say about Prechter may be called into question by Robert Folsom, who works for Prechter and is involved with me in a dispute about the editing of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Prechter_34ac.html" title="Robert Prechter">Robert Prechter</a>.</dd>

<p>Shouldt the actual decline on october 19 be told in the article?</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p>"The Dow lost 22.6% of its value or $500 billion dollars on October 19 1987".</p>
<p>A bit "strange" that one cant read this number from the current article, only comparisons.</p>
