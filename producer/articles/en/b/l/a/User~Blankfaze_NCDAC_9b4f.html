<p>NCdave has edited the article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a> more or less for a few weeks now, and has since taken the side of Terri's parents. He has edited in defiance of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, inserting his point of view into the article and then relentlessly reiterating his point of view on the talk page, despite consensus that his edits do not conform to the NPOV policy. He has, since the earliest manifestations of the talk page, made personal attacks, factually inaccurate statements to support his POV, and many other breaches of etiqutte. Coupled with his relentless reiteration, other users lash out at him, which leads me to believe that is part of his intention.</p>

<li>NCdave: "Removed this outrageous POV sentence, which was inserted by JnB987: "These actions, however, have been dismissed by a court-ordered doctor as reflexes and the family has been accused of exaggerating them for their own exploitation." What "court-ordered doctor," who is accusing, and what does "for [the family's] own exploitation" even mean? Exploit is a transitive verb: who is alleged to have been exploited, and how?" in the same breath as complaining about User:JnB987's POV, utters this: "Her family loves her, unconditionally, and they are trying to protect her from being murdered. If JnB987 thinks that is "exploitation," then I feel very sorry for him." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> Additionally, for somebody who constantly attempts to add anything ever mentioned in an affidavit "As a matter of public record", NCdave here attempts to obfuscate the fact that a "court-ordered doctor" did not, in any readable way of JnB987's statemen, make such an assertion; it was made in the motion for a guardian ad litem submitted to the court. Follows up with: "Terri's family has doctors who say that her condition could improve substantially with rehabilitative care; when arguing for a big medical malpractice settlement, to cover the cost of that care, Michael agreed. But now that he stands to inherit the money when she dies, he refuses to permit her to receive that rehabilitative care that the money was supposed to pay for. THAT is exploitation!"</li>
<li>NCdave: "Changed: However, her family disputes that, saying that while they were not present during the conversations she had with her husband, Terri is a devout Roman Catholic whom they believe would not wish to violate the Church's teachings on euthanasia and suicide by intentionally starving or dehydrating herself to death.

It was only several years later, after Terri received more than $1 million in legal settlements to cover the cost of her long term care and rehabilitation, that Michael first claimed to remember conversations in which Terri expressed a wish to die rather than live in the condition in which she now finds herself. If she dies, Michael will inherit whatever remains of that money. The accuracy of that paragraph is undisputed, and important for understanding the case." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> Why is one instance of a conversation that may have never happened "waffle words" while another is "important for understanding the case"?</li>
<li>NCdave: ""Michael could legally cede guardianship to Terri's parents, but refuses to do so, claiming he is doing what is best for her. Her parents want to bring her home; they maintain that, with therapy, their daughter can be helped." There's no disputing the accuracy of that sentence, and it is necessary to answer the obvious question of where SHOULD she be, if not in hospice." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10562037&amp;oldid=10538944" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> Why should she be there?

<li>"As for the PVS/not in a coma claim, can we just settle the impossible argument we're having by saying "The Court has repeatedly found that Terri is in a PVS, a finding her family still disputes." -JnB987" NCdave: "So, JNB987, you would like to mention a series of court rulings that were so transparently dishonest, and so outrageous to basic decency, and so infuriating to the public at large, that a special session of the legislature -- called solely for the purpose of reversing the court's misbehavior -- passed a special law just to protect this poor woman from the abuse of those courts -- and your "neutral" way of summarizing that astonishing indictment of those rulings is to say, "a finding her family still disputes"? You are outrageous! The only NPOV way to handle the argument over whether she is or is not in a PVS is to contrast the medical definition to her actual symptoms, and let the reader decide who's right. Deleting those simple facts does NOT make the article NPOV, it makes it incomplete. However, as you say, it is true that the courts have ruled that she is in a PVS (so far, anyhow), so I've added that fact to the (de-vandalized) article, for completeness. <a href="../../../n/c/d/User%7ENCdave_c886.html" title="User:NCdave">NCdave</a> 06:34, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>.

<li>Another personal attack: "I can see that you don't like facts, JnB987, but they are stubborn things, and they just won't go away because there are too many of them for your taste." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" rel="nofollow">[50]</a></li>
<li>Another personal attack: "What utter, rediculous nonsense. Exploitation is the use of another person for SELFISH purposes. Terri's family is doing NOTHING for their own benefit. They have sacrificed extraordinarily, with NEVER a hope for gain for themselves. They are doing it ALL from love for their daughter/sister. They ask only to be allowed to care for her. Have you never loved anyone like that? Do you truly not understand that kind of love at all?" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10580845&amp;oldid=10580804" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></li>
<li>Continued and fairly grievous personal attack, and attempting to characterize the beliefs of Terri Schiavo, which are still speculated upon: "Of COURSE it is possible to know Terri's stance on an issue on which the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are crystal clear. There is no dispute over the fact that Terri is a devout Roman Catholic Christian. But you don't know what the word "devout" MEANS, do you? Her stance is obedience, because she is a devout Catholic, and devotion to Christ requires obedience. Read that last sentence twice. Christ said, <i>"If you love me, you will obey what I command."</i> -John 14:15. So there literally can be NO DOUBT what she would say her views are on such a matter, if she could express them. I can see that you would not understand that.

<li>"The fact is that those videotapes and photographs of Terri convey the Truth about her condition.

<li>"Your argument is with the facts, not with me, Tcassedy. The FACT is that when Michael Schiavo had Terri's feeding tube removed last time, HE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROHIBITED HER FAMILY FROM FEEDING HER BY MOUTH. His purpose was simply to starve and deyhdrate her to death (a particularly nasty death, BTW). The statement that he seeks her death by starvation is indisputable.

<li>"It was awarded for Terri's <i>care and rehabilitation</i> but Michael refused to allow it to be used for that purpose. He has refused to allow ANY rehabilitative therapy for her, AT ALL. He wouldn't even pay for proper dental care for her -- and, as a result, she has lost five teeth due to dental neglect, while in his "care"[sic]. Instead of spending the money as it was intended to be spent, for HER, he spent much of the money on himself, and much more of it to fight to have her killed, presumably so that he could inherit the remainder. Terri's family are the ones who've sacrificed. They have NO financial motive for this fight, unlike her estranged husband." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10599289&amp;oldid=10597288" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=10599289&amp;oldid=10597288" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> This is again a made up fact and unnecessary characterization for the sake of POV. Michael Schiavo, in cooperation with the Schindlers, tried aggressive, experimental, and radical rehabilitation therapy on Terri. And as stated above, the Schindlers had an equal financial stake as Michael. If Michael divorced, they inherited Terri's estate upon her death. If Michael remarried, he inherited the estate. The speculate that solely one and not the other is attempting to inject POV and is disruptive.</li>

<li>Resolving the dispute with NCdave has gone from simply assuming good faith and correcting him to what <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">User:FuelWagon</a> has summarised as a game of "Whack-a-Mole" logic. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 11:54, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerri_Schiavo_fd37.html" title="Talk:Terri Schiavo">Talk:Terri Schiavo</a> page can pretty much be summed up as "NCdave vs. the rest of the editors".

<li>NCdave holds his beliefs of the Terri Schiavo situation as "truth" and generally demands that contributers prove his version of truth to be wrong (guilty until proven innocent). When any particular "truth" is shown to be wrong or unsubstantiated, he often jumps to a completely different "truth" on a completely unrelated topic (logical whack-a-mole). He seems incapable of sticking to reporting the history of facts and instead wishes only to jump to his conconclusion that Michael was a wife beater and murdered his wife to silence her and get her malpractice money, and that there is a grand conspiracy of doctors, judges, nursing home staff, police, and others who are all in on this conspiracy to murder Terri. Overall, his "guilty until proven innocent" attitude and his logical whack-a-mole approach often occurs as trolling or baiting. Dealing with his stuff definitely takes up a lot of everyone else's time, because he basically demands that you engage him or he'll take your silence to mean you agree with him. It's a "I get to hold this as true unless you prove me wrong" kind of attitude. In comparison, there are other people who have made major contributions to the article (Professor Ninja and Viriditas for example) whom I've interacted with almost not at all because they're focused on contributing to the article, they understand the difference between the facts of history and their interpretations, and they generally don't demand that other contributers engage with them. I don't have to spend time explaining to them (Professor Ninja, Viridita, et al) logical fallacies, or that the burden of proof is on the person making the assertion, or the difference between innocent till proven guilty and guilty until proven innocent, or the difference between quoting a newspaper and quoting a blog. I think NCdave holds his beliefs sincerely, but his approach that basically demands that others engage with him occurs as trolling or baiting. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 15:29, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must withdraw my support from this RFC. The additions by Professor Ninja and Astanhope have effectively turned this into a witch-hunt against those holding differing views, even those who are good editors. I do believe that action should be taken against NCdave, and I still support the original RFC.

<li>Pretty much everyone above has stated the problem. NCdave constantly put POV in the Terry Schiavo article, then flamed anyone who reverted him. He's worse than a troll, because at least trolls don't honestly believe what they're doing is good for wikipedia. He got TCOL blocked (luckily only for a few minutes) for reverting his POV-filled edits four times, but only because TCOL threatened to report NCdave for 3RR violation. The guy's most likely not going to change his behavior no matter how much dialogue there is. I would have helped start the RfC myself if not for the personal attack I made on him. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngryParsley_f0b2.html" title="User:AngryParsley">AngryParsley</a> 22:35, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is more than a shame. NCDave has made some valuable contributions. Unfortunately only roughly half of those contributions are un-biased. The other half are hearsay, inflammatory, or simply ignore the facts. In some instances the talk page has been used to make veiled accusations of murder. In others speculation as to motive (on both sides) has been put forth as fact. On a personal note I think it’s horrible that such a young vital woman as Terri Shaivo suffered so much for so long. But I find it equally horrible that her wishes were completely ignored for as long as they were. All for the purpose of promoting another person's agenda. Right to life or right to death issues should be personal, private, and arrived at &amp; executed with dignity and respect. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbean_391f.html" title="User:Wjbean">Wjbean</a> 19:29, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Agreed. Several of NCdave's edits have been helpful. However his documented personal attacks, provocation, insinuation, and psychic hotline attitude towards Michael Schiavo's motives are not excusable. He has provoked <i>many</i> users into responding (myself included), not the other way around as Patsw contends. Any attempt to point out to NCdave (or Patsw, but that's another story) that his logic and insinuation works both ways has resulted in FuelWagon's brilliant term, the "whack-a-mole" logic game. The pejoratives, insinuation, and paranoia increase dramatically on the talk page and article history whenever NCdave is present. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 22:58, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: A witchhunt implies a total lack of evidence. I do not see a total lack of evidence. What I do see is a disturbing amount of evidence of repeated, constant behaviour. That he has engaged in that much questionable behaviour does not mean we are persecuting him. That he has engaged in that much questionable behaviour <i>does</i> mean it needs to be dealt with, and with immediacy. I don't care if NCdave gets a stern talking to and comes back fresh, ready to cooperate. Frankly if he was willing to do that, I'd be overjoyed. It's better to get people to apologize than to get them hateful of you. If you care to demonstrate a witch hunt, I'd be more than receptive, as it is claiming looking for evidence everywhere is quite different from <i>finding</i> evidence everywhere. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 18:04, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I thought, perhaps, that after Schiavo died that NCDave would fade away and let the rest of us who seem to be able to work together productively stick to the facts. I was wrong. It is as if he has some incredible personal stake in his side of this story. NPOV shouldn't be this hard. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 13:44, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have actively watched the Terri Schiavo <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerri_Schiavo_fd37.html" title="Talk:Terri Schiavo">talk page</a> (even more so than the article itself) since it started and there have been users for and against various issues. But <a href="../../../n/c/d/User%7ENCdave_c886.html" title="User:NCdave">NCdave</a> takes the cake. He has continuously tried to insert his POV and attempted (quite successfully) to engage debate on matters irrelevent to the article. He has edited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11354308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11354308" rel="nofollow">wikiquette</a> to support his arguments and has only "contributed" to articles related to Terri (and some to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial-birth_abortion.html" title="Partial-birth abortion">partial-birth abortion</a>). But the most damning fact is he cannot be reasoned. No amount of truth will sway his opinion and he keeps disrupting the project to have it his way. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikreykja_795a.html" title="User talk:Vikreykja">→</a><i><a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikreykja_0ecb.html" title="User:Vikreykja">Vik&#160;Reykja</a></i> 15:35, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I too have been watching the T. Schiavo talk page far more than the actual article (in order to see how the debates over the issues have been framed and argued). However, NCDave is notorious for the endless repetition of a few pat catch-phrases from a specific point of view. The attempts to point out the inaccuracies, illogic, misrepresentation of his "argument" are unsuccessful and it only sets off another dead-end round of tangential (at best) argument. The endless focusing on the minutiae bogs down persons with a genuine interest in producing a neutral, clear article.<a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMia-Cle_7091.html" title="User:Mia-Cle">Mia-Cle</a> 17:01, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Like several others, I have mostly watched the Terri Schiavo article and talk page, and while he was not the worst one there, his intransigence and unwillingness to compromise made him a disruptive editor. In addition, his behaviour on the Talk page was trollish - he raised the same arguments repeatedly and insisted that other editors disprove the points he raised. The length to which he went made the talk page difficult to follow. His alteration of Wikipedia:Wikiquette to support his arguments could be dismissed as a misunderstanding of how Wikipedia works, but the fact that he continued to do this after having this explained showed him to be a disruptive editor. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:46, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Like the others in this section, I have only made minor edits to the Terri Schiavo page. However, I was curious to see the edit history and talk page. Consistently in both, NCdave has overwhelmingly resorted to belligerence and vague insinuation(against both Wikipedians and players in the underlying topic), while adding essentially zero meaningful content or clarification on any matter. He has done so in great volume. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 21:16, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>This is a summary written by the user whose conduct is disputed, or by other users who think that the dispute is unjustified and that the above summary is biased or incomplete.</i></p>
<p><b>NCdave is being railroaded.</b></p>
<p><b>The Terri Schiavo article is <i>not</i> unbiased, and the POV tag should be left in place. Perhaps indefinitely.</b> NCdave has frequently attempted to place the tag, but it is always instantly removed. The tag is an embarrassment to the article, but so be it. The article is largely controlled by a clique. Browsing the history shows a small number of editors are extremely active, constantly making changes, removing information they personally characterize as irrelevant, quickly reverting contributions, and even removing links to unbiased source documents when they do not like the sites. Slanted paraphrases are sometimes substituted for source material. There appears an attitude that the courts create the facts, rather than merely make final, formal decisions for action based on their interpretion of facts. Reality is that facts themselves never go away, and always remain for further consideration. The pots are calling the kettles black. The problem comes from the large number of pots here.</p>
<p>NCdave has not been abusive or made personal attacks. He presents arguments and information that would seem worthy of inclusion in an unbiased article. There is nothing wrong with his arguing his points on the discussion page, that's what it is for. Certainly that is more polite than the wholesale revisions and reversions other editors do in the article itself. In fact, recent history shows that NCdave has been one of the least active editors, which may reveal his discouragement and which makes this attack on him appear biased.</p>
<p>As long as a few editors, even transient visitors, feel that the article has a disputed point of view the tag should stay. Everyone's reward is when the article is unbiased enough to suit all, then the tag goes away. NCdave deserves more respect.</p>

<p>It's evident on its face by comparing any balanced account of the story of Terri Schiavo that appears in a professionally edited source such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, etc. that this article is full of bias in favor of the petitions of Michael Schiavo and since he prevailed in court, the findings of Judge George Greer. It fundamentally is not fair to the Schindler family's side. To which some might reply <i>And that's a good thing.</i> Because of a small editing cabal and in particular their seemingly inexhaustible supply of time to judge, add, and delete as if it were their own property. NCdave's efforts and my own are challenged, nitpicked, and deleted. The intimidation is sometimes subtle and sometimes not, like when another editor gloats at the amount of text they have deleted and mocking the idea that one could challenge the neutrality of the article with the POV tag. It's bait and I'm not taking it. NCdave took the bait and returned some of these personal attacks and the result is this page. It's the utter predictability of the deletions and the hostility of the cabal and their failure to be frank about their criteria for deleting material. Some of the biggest deleters are not <i>ever</i> explaining their actions on the talk page. Who is blowing the wikiwhistle on that abuse?</p>
<p>Thinking of presenting some fact the presents balance in the Schindler's account of events? Face the gatekeepers: Where's the URL? Is that relevant? That's bloat. You can't use primary text, you have to use <i>the faithful paraphrase</i> oops, so sorry, the article just became too long with your last edit, and so on. But none of the these tests get applied to material supporting the Michael Schiavo version of events. NCdave is reacting to an incredible and intense level of provocation. Let everyone who's applied more than 10 edits per day for 10 days take a wikivacation. It's become an unhealthy obsession. What's being produced line by line is spin showing Michael Schiavo's version of events (i.e. the phony Neutral Point of View) and <i>basically useless</i> for understanding why public interest in this case was so great or how anyone could ever come to doubt the motives of Michael Schiavo and marginalizing the Schindler?s and perhaps that is the intended result. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 02:42, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The only way to make a NPOV article about a controversial topic is to include factual information supporting all the POVs. If information that is cited by adherents to one POV as supportive of their POV is systematically deleted from the article, then the article becomes biased.

Several of those here who support killing Terri take the opposite approach: they just DELETE the information that is inconsistent with their bias. NCdave 12:32, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

I'm considering redoing the evidence list completely by going through every single one of dave's diffs from his contributor page and finding disputed behaviour. It's lengthy because he does provide good edits or typo/spelling fixes, only about 1/3 of his edits are seriously objectionable on any level.

In the above comment I noted the evidence that Terri had been battered, and <b>I agreed with Fox1 that describing a Schindler doctor as "world renowned" reflected POV, and told him (Fox1) I had deleted that phrase from the article, because it was POV-biased in favor of the Schindler family. Do you object to <u><i>that?</i></u></b></dd>

<dd>Actually, I do believe that that language originated with you, in one of your edits. If you didn't type it, I'm pretty sure you copy'n'pasted it. I could be wrong, I'd have to check. Regardless of that, you're also (this is extremely typical of you) glossing over what you did wrong and trying to play the victim. You accused other editors of supporting killing Terri and therefore deleting "compelling" evidence (that didn't pass muster in several courts which applied the most rigorous burden of proof available in civil cases). Your defence of that behaviour? Well, you agreed with Fox1 that "world renowned" (language I'm pretty sure you added) could go. Whoopee. So what if I shot the 7-11 clerk? I paid for the Slushie. My advice, dave, is when you're making a defence of your actions, do not take the same approach as you did on the talk and article pages. You've deleted my comments on this page (as you did to Rhobite on the talk pages) and you're beginning to skate dangerously close to both your outright lies and your attempt at deflecting the subject. You're essentially up for a type of review <i>because</i> of these tactics, you'll do yourself no good repeating them ad nauseum. I <i>know</i> you are not that stupid. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 14:26, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not at all. I've been extremely careful in going through the diffs from both the T:TS and your contributions page and selecting evidence of disputable behaviour. If it didn't pass the muster, it didn't go in. In fact, I made a point of always attempting to assume good faith on your part if the evidence could be found questionable as to whether or not it was actually disputable behaviour; if I felt there was suffient assumption of good faith, I wouldn't include it (despite my knee jerk telling me otherwise). There are probably duplicate instances in there; those you can remove (I'll be checking, so don't cheat). In fact I think I'm just going to go through your submissions page completely, and reconstruct the evidence entirely, to remove any possibility of duplicate complaints. I've also been not really conforming to a single standard; I've occasionally cited two seperate instances in the same edit as two pieces of evidence (for the sake of thoroughness, much as a man who robs a store and shoots the owner gets two seperate indictments); and for the sake of brevity (when I realised the sheer amount of behaviour you've displayed) began to just toss up multiple summaries for single edits cited as a single piece. I think we'll need to come to a consensus as to what the basic format for this should be (unless there already is one to which I am not aware.) I assure you that none of that is <i>made up</i>. Furthermore, most of those edits (the gross majority) are mine; they do not directly pertain to me, however, they do remain evidence of your disputed behaviour. Other users have added evidence, they are in the minority. Do your research before you spout off. You will note that not only do I not include your good edits, I openly acknowledge them (in toto) on this page; for example, your contributions to the Partial Birth Abortion page were for the most part POV, however you were 100% indisputably correct in saying the summary that was then provided by Planned Parenthood was <i>not</i> the same as what is known as Partial Birth Abortion, and you were 100% indisputably correct in demanding that it be changed. <i>That does not mitigate your other behaviour</i>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 12:55, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>This is a summary written by users not directly involved with the dispute but who would like to add an outside view of the dispute.</i></p>
<p>A certain amount of baggage in the form of personal opinion is to be expected on the talk page of an article on a controversial subject. NCdave's comments went beyond this and he used the talk page as a pulpit from which to denounce Michael Schiavo and others involved in the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not know whether what I will have to say would be considered "outside view," or what. I personally have not observed enough of NCdave's behavior to draw a conclusion (I've tried to just busy myself with working to better the article), but based on the reactions he gets, I have my suspicions. What I want to say is that there is a valid point that this article is not NPOV. For example, rather than stating that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, the article should state something along the lines of, "The majority of medical practicioners agreed Terri Schiavo was in a Persistent Vegetative State, but the Schindlers produced medical experts that disputed that finding." That is simple, textbook NPOV. Unfortunately, NCdave wants the article to state definitively that Schiavo was NOT in a PVS. That is not NPOV. But neither is stating definitively that Schiavo WAS in a PVS. There are far too many people trying to decide the merits of the case and draw conclusions in the article, when Wikipedia should do nothing of the sort. Whenever anyone tries to NPOV-ize to make the article a little less damning toward the Schindler POV (which is a major POV reported all over the media, but minimized here), excuses are immediately thrown out about "article bloat," and other things <b>that appear to only matter when it is a pro-Schiavo supporter editing the article</b>. (When a piece of evidence supports the Michael Schiavo side, it is inserted without question; when a piece of evidence supports the Schindler side, suddenly we have to dig deep into its qualifications.) There is a clear double standard being applied by most of the article editors. I think the problem is that there has been too much high-strung editing (and reverting). <i>The fact that some user might have failed to understand NPOV and necessitated emergency measures against that one user in order to protect the article is not an excuse for stooping to that user's level.</i> I hope that we can move on and work to truly make this article NPOV.</li>

<li><a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 17:30, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC) The article mentions many events and viewpoints in various sections, but each section, in most instances, then concludes firmly on the Michael Schiavo side (as might be expected, since that became the majority side), and in such a way as to be outright dismissive of the Schindler family side. It therefore reads as a sort of propaganda tract in which pro-Schindler material is brought up merely to be refuted; and as such, Dave's insistence on the disputed/POV tag is quite reasonable.</li>

<dd>(regarding: "there is a bit of a pro-Michael Schiavo bias") Probably, but when I started working on it, the article was very general, not very specific, and had sections that were sometimes blatant pro-Michael, and other sections that were blatant pro-Schindler. I just recently refactored a section that had told about the Valentine's Day fight completely based on quotes from the Schindlers. completely POV. I just replaced it with text from a court report, which is more NPOV. I started a timeline article. The names of all the doctors who examined and diagnosed Terri weren't even all listed. I even added in Dr. Cheshire because of NCdave's complaints. But when I quoted Cheshires background from a newspaper, NCdave took it as an attack on all christianity. There were sections that spoke of 33 physicians who said Terri was not PVS and could benefit from therapy. But once I dug into it, I found out that these doctors had never examined Terri and had based their comments off of video made by the parents. That information wasn't even mentioned in teh article. Totally skews the diagnosis to the Schindler pov. So, if it's slightly pro-michael now, that's way better than when it was severely pro-schindler in some spots and severely pro-michael in other spots. It is an incremental approach. There's probably still stuff that is pro-michael, and probably stuff that's pro-schindler, and it all needs to be cleaned out. The thing of it is that NCdave hasn't actually done one iota of work to contribute to that effort. His edits generally take more time to respond to and clean up than he puts into them, which means he occurs as an obstruction to the article. All he does now is put the NPOV and ACCURACY tags in the article, without mentioning anything in the discussion page that would fix it, and throw wild accusations around on the discussion page about murder and conspiracies. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 01:09, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: This summary contains several falsehoods. This edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11496590" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terri_Schiavo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11496590" rel="nofollow">[150]</a> (one of mine), for example, shows that we aren't all POV flag bearers for Michael Schiavo. Simply because NCdave advances a pro-Schindler POV does not mean that anybody who opposes that is anti-Schindler or pro-Michael Schiavo. That is a hugely false dichotomy. The fact of the matter is that the majority (probably 99%) of the vandalism to the article is from distinctly pro-Schindler vandals. There is simply nobody involved advancing that the Schindlers <i>absolutely</i> stood to profit by Terri's death (even though they did, it is insinuation that doesn't belong, same as the insinuation of profit as Michael's motive), etc. That there is a large majority in the middle ground opposed by virtually nobody to one side and to an extremely vocal minority on the other side does not imply that therefore the middle ground is actually between the majority and the vocal minority. Additionally, Jdavidb advances a <strike>huge</strike> <i><b>potential</b></i> bias when he refers to us as "anti-Terri" both on this page's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_NCdave_406d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/NCdave">talk page</a> (originally this page prior to refactoring) and on <a href="http://www.blogsforterri.com/archives/2005/04/wikipedia_has_n.php" class="external text" title="http://www.blogsforterri.com/archives/2005/04/wikipedia_has_n.php" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia has a negative slant on Terri Schiavo</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 00:59, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I applaud your effort to show that Jdavidb's position above isn't perfect, though I wish you'd cited more edits (I know there were several instances where I reverted something that smelled of pov on the other side), but I'm dissapointed that you speak badily of Jdavidb overall, because as far as I can tell he really does understand what it takes to be a good editor and has been a great example of good-faith. Please see what I wrote on <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProfessor_Ninja_9b9c.html#Jdavidb" title="User talk:Professor Ninja">your talk page</a> --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 02:18, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Redacted. I leave it as potential bias, you're right in that Jdavidb has been reasonable. I still contend that he at least reveals somewhat of a bias.
