<p>When he came to London at the age of 7, Blade quickly felt the effects of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Revolution_81d3.html" title="Iranian Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>: his family back home could no longer send money out of the country to support him. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He remained in London, schooled in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackheath%2C_London_1e79.html" title="Blackheath, London">Blackheath</a>, and spent the summer holiday in <a href="../../../h/o/v/Hove.html" title="Hove">Hove</a> with his brother and cousins who were studying there. <a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Blade started out as a break dancer and graffiti artist, going under the name Electron, before he was given his more familiar name by a friend. The friend was later killed whilst painting graffiti on the underground, and Blade kept the name he'd been given for the rest of his career as a mark of respect. <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/markbandblade/blade.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/markbandblade/blade.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> His first contact with hip hop came in 1979, when he began to write down the lyrics of the songs he heard and performed them back at his school. It was the release of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildstyle.html" title="Wildstyle">Wildstyle</a> film, however, that made him release the extent of the influence hip hop could have, and made him determined to be a part of the lifestyle. <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In 1986, he moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Cross_0653.html" title="New Cross">New Cross</a> and being unable to afford furniture or much of a social life, he spent a lot of his time at home, writing lyrics and perfecting his style. It was during this time, that he wrote the track that became <i>Lyrical Maniac</i> <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_%28rapper%29.html" title="Edit section: Underground career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Underground career</span></h2>
<p>Blade's first moves into the music industry came when he first recorded the now seminal <i>Lyrical Maniac</i> in 1988. His initial efforts to sell the single did not meet with success: out of 300 of the original copies pressed, Blade didn't manage a single sale. In the end, he had to return the records to the manufacturer, claiming that they were faulty and keeping only 10 copies for himself. These copies were given to close friends, including his DJ, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardnoise.html#Son_of_Noise" title="Hardnoise">Renegade</a>. <a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Taking his own copy around local record shops, Blade attempted to get some advance orders before re-pressing more copies. However, when he visited Cavern Records in Lewisham he discovered that the owners were keen to start their own label, and wanted to use the single to kick start it. Blade agreed, and <i>Lyrical Maniac</i> eventually came out on Raw Bass records in 1989. <a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Following this, rather than sign to any of the major UK hip hop <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record labels</a> Blade began to record, promote and release his own material through his own 691 Influential label - often by stopping potential customers in the street, playing them the song on his walkman and selling them a copy from his bag. <a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> A string of 12 inches followed, each becoming an underground hit - songs like <i>Rough It Up</i>, <i>Mind of an Ordinary Citizen</i> and <i>You Better Go For Yours</i> made Blade a name on the UK hip hop scene without the resources and publicity that a major label could provide. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, Blade released the <i>Survival of the Hardest Working EP</i> (691 Influential) via mail order as an experiment in new ways of distributing his material. The experiment was a success, and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> the double album <i>The Lion Goes From Strength To Strength (No Compromise)</i> (691 Influential) was released - funded partly by fans of Blade's music paying for their copies of the album in advance, in exchange for an exclusive 12 inch <i>Clear the Way</i> (691 Influential). Needing 200/300 preorders to have enough money to record and cut the record, Blade received 2000/3000. <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>The recording of the album was a difficult time personally for Blade - his father died whilst visiting from Iran, and his girlfriend became pregnant with his son, but Blade managed to record the whole album in 16 days, writing his lyrics on the bus on the way to the studio. It is still highly regarded by fans to this day. <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index1.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Following the release of the album, however, Blade had a period away from recording, concentrating on bringing up his son and getting over his father's death. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_%28rapper%29.html" title="Edit section: Collaborations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Collaborations</span></h2>
<p>Blade is one of British hip hop's most respected artists, and is often invited to guest on tracks by other artists such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Herbaliser_3ac0.html" title="The Herbaliser">The Herbaliser</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_RZA_975e.html" title="The RZA">The RZA</a>, but in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> a team up with producer Mark B to record the <i>Hitmen For Hire EP</i> (Jazz Fudge)) led to one of the most high profile albums of Blade's career. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>'s <i>The Unknown</i> (Word Play) was a big hit, and a rerecorded version of the first single <i>You Don't See The Signs</i> (Word Play) made it into the Top 20 in the UK charts. The re-recording was done with the help of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Nicholas_a957.html" title="Grant Nicholas">Grant Nicholas</a>, frontman of the British rock band <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeder_%28band%29.html" title="Feeder (band)">Feeder</a>. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the collaboration, Blade wasn't signed to the label as the record was seen as Mark B's (who was signed) project that Blade was simply a guest artist on. However, as Mark B and Blade started to achieve a measure of success, Blade was quickly signed up: the duo spent most of 2000 and 2001 touring the country to promote the record, even supporting <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> on his 2001 tour. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> However, the album had always been intended as a side project for both artists, and despite its success they went their separate ways to continue their solo careers. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>When Virgin decided to close Word Play down, Blade found himself moved to Virgin and almost immediately in conflict with the label<a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Blade</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Basically eventually ended up having disputes with Virgin about my material, you know they wanted me to do things I didn’t necessarily feel were right, and I thought to be honest that if I’d gone the way they wanted my career would have been dead before it started, so eventually it got to a point where I asked to leave."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, the success of the <i>Ya Don't See The Signs</i> remix that eventually led to the end of Blade's time with Virgin: the label became more insistent that Blade record all rock tunes for his album, something which he felt would kill his career. <a href="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brightonhiphop.com/articles/article.php?id=20" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> Instead, Blade returned to his roots as an independent artist.</p>

<p>Following the split, Blade returned to producing and distributing his own music under the 691 Influential label, helped by his <a href="http://www.blade691.com" class="external text" title="http://www.blade691.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> he released the album <i>Storms Are Brewing</i>, which was hit by problems when the distribution company went bankrupt, owing Blade money and leaving him without a distribution deal for the album. This inevitably had an impact on the album's performance, although the album was well received by those who could get copies. <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/blade/index2.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>A new album was released in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, produced by Baby J - who also produced some of the songs on <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinnyman.html" title="Skinnyman">Skinnyman</a>'s <i>Council Estate of Mind</i> album. The album, <i>Guerilla Tactics</i> (2006), is available direct from Blade's website, and has also received positive support from the media and public. The album came about following a meeting with Baby J, who admitted to being a fan of Blade's work and offered him and instrumental track to rap over. The one track blossomed into a whole album, which was launched at a massive event in February 2006: the launch party featured sets by Blade as well as other big names in the modern UK hip hop scene such as <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Life_Cypher_3b8e.html" title="Phi Life Cypher">Phi Life Cypher</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehst.html" title="Jehst">Jehst</a>. A promotion tour quickly followed. <a href="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blade691.com/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p><i>Guerilla Tactics</i> has subsequently become the final Blade album for the foreseeable future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Rest assured Blade will continue to make music, just without the unpredictability and lies of the music industry hanging over his head. Basically, he wishes to make music but strictly for the love of it without any material interest. If at any point this changes, you will find out first right here, but for now music for love it is . . . for now, I just really need some time to myself and away from an unpredictable industry I have no respect for and never have."</p>
