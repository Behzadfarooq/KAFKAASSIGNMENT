<p>You cannot just dump material from the James Twining site here. As likely as not, Twining got his information from Wikipedia earlier (it's not like he's into citing his sources). Regarding non-political use in modern Odinism, provide a reference for that. Odinic Rite is a neopagan organization that leans to the extreme right and has clear fascist overtones. It cannot be disputed that the symbol is in use in "Odinism", however, its use seems to be restricted to those factions that hold obvious sympathy for Nazi mysticism. Show us an example of use by a neopagan organization that clearly distances itself from racist or fascist currents. Otherwise, we'll just have to say that the symbol remains in use among the extreme right, both inside and outside of neopagan circles. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 11:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If this is in reference to my previous notions, I will state that I agree with you regarding the Odinic Rite, at least in imagery. However, usage of the symbol by artists I added to this is generally apolitical as these artists generally take no political stance. As for the James Twining thing, I assume you're referring to someone else. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodofox_6b7d.html" title="User:Bloodofox">:bloodofox:</a> 12:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>yes, I was addressing <a href="../../../f/k/0/User%7EFK0071a_867f.html" title="User:FK0071a">FK0071a</a> (<a href="../../../f/k/0/User_talk%7EFK0071a_f9ed.html" title="User talk:FK0071a">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FK0071a_2632.html" title="Special:Contributions/FK0071a">contribs</a>), check recent history. The symbol's use in popular culture is a consequence of its Nazi aura, that's what makes it interesting. The symbol has no signification for historical paganism, and while it is perfectly understandable that neopagan groups want to reclaim actual historical symbols from their Nazi connotations, such as the runes, this doesn't apply here at all. Neopagans that are just into historical polytheism and do not care about Nazi occultism and von Listian mysticism have no stakes here at all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 12:48, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>FK, can you <i>stop</i> adding the geocities "Irminenschaft" link as "reference"? This is a confused writeup by confused mysticists, and nothing like a serious source. They do <i>quote</i> reasonable sources, and we can take such quotes from them, but it remains some random geocities page found on the internets. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 09:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem, but I think you are wrong to basically call anyone that writes something on a subject like this that isn't a "scholer" and doesn't want to pay for a website a "confused mysticist". I think they are in a better position to understand the esoteric significance rather than a so called 'scholar'. You're too bright for that Dab. For example, that article is far better esoterically than anything Goodrick-Clarke has written. They are in a better position for this interpretation. Clarke, biographically, is better (not sure if that makes sense, I hope so). <a href="../../../f/k/0/User%7EFK0071a_867f.html" title="User:FK0071a">FK0071a</a> 09:33, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the article may have some qualities, but any article concluded with "hail the völk!" leaves a shoddy impression (indicating the author not only doesn't know German, but was too lazy to consult a dictionary, and doesn't even try to hide his fascist affinities). We can treat the article as a "primary source", that is, a contemporary mysticist's outlook, but we cannot treat it as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 09:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be surprised, but I agree fully with what you say on the article. However, I do not agree with calling someone facist simply because they are proud of their people and heritage. That's akin to calling someone a Nazi today simpley because they have an affinity for their own people. Seems that every other culture is allowed to do this, even encouraged to do this, other than Europeans.Shint - very open that it is for their own people and is a religion born of the blood but they are not referred to as Nazi's or Facists. Dab, I agree with what you say and think you are extremily intelligent with the way to redo think I enter, I greatly appreciate this and respect that you take opinions on board, it's great to see but remarks like that from you surprise me. <a href="../../../f/k/0/User%7EFK0071a_867f.html" title="User:FK0071a">FK0071a</a> 10:16, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>you may, likewise, be surprised, but I agree, too. being "proud of one's heritage" in the sense of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> is nothing bad per se. But there is a reason we have separate articles on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_nationalism.html" title="Ethnic nationalism">ethnic nationalism</a> (in the German case, <a href="../../../v/%C3%B6/l/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement.html" title="Völkisch movement">völkisch movement</a>). Or, in the context of neopaganism (you don't need to be pagan to be a patriot), "militant racist" vs. "folkish" (nationalist or supremacist) vs. "tribalist" ("ethnic") vs. "eclectic" (syncretic), see also <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_neopaganism.html#Factions" title="Germanic neopaganism">Germanic_neopaganism#Factions</a>. There is no reason to even talk about Armanen runes or the Black Sun if you are merely proud of your Germanic or German heritage, because the concepts are a the creation of occultist authors and not part of any "heritage". Even from the pov of a "folkish" position verging on supremacism, there is no reason to even look at von List. Usage of the "Black Sun" is really the <i>shibboleth</i> that separates the militant racist and crackpot occultist currents from the merely "ethnic" or "tribalist" ones. Any Geramanic heathen that cares two cents about consciously distancing themselves from Nazi ideology need only dump von-Listian cruft like the Black Sun into the dustbin, without needing to compromise about honouring their actual historical heritage. Since there still <i>are</i> strong Neo-Nazi and fascist undercurrents in the Germanic neopagan scene, right now in AD <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, it is not superfluous to do this, and a simple show of good faith. You do not need to hysterically declare your clean slate in every other paragraph, like some German gropus still feel compelled to do (the German scene is not healthy in this respect in my opinion, but they are at least in part growing out of it), but in my oponion any honourable neopagan group can put at least a short disclaimer "fascists not welcome" on their website. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 10:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I expected more from you than to bandy around a word like fascist Dab. The OR constantly strives to keep politics out of the organisation and even expelled a group of people who were attempting to make it more political. We have members who have a wide range of political views which the OR will not interfere with. We work with many governmental and NGO's in many area. Do you think they would deal with a fascist group? You should take more care with your words and consider the consequences that such labels could have on a group. It may have escaped your notice that the OR uses the EGF, not Armanen runes, there is no mention of von List on the OR site, no Black Sun and in fact the symbol has only rarely been used as decoration for articles/books etc and not for many years afaik. Why should we state "fascists not welcome"? What about communists? How about liberals? They are all political viewpoints and the OR states that it is NOT a political group and a members political views are their own, in fact the political affiliations, if any, of our members is usually completely unknown. We believe in individual freedoms and the right for people to make their own choices and accept the consequences of those. Not a very fascist position.--<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHengest_2b5d.html" title="User:Hengest">Hengest</a> 19:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tim, is it because this article seems to link the image too closely with that of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a> and you don't like your company, Black Sun Rising <a href="http://www.blacksunrising.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blacksunrising.net/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, being associated with it? If that is the reason I perfectly understand and agree why you have made this edit. However, maybe if this is the case you can contribute to the article providing information as to the fact that it <i>"may also be used in occult currents of <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinism.html" title="Odinism">Odinism</a> without necessarily implying involvement with Nazism."</i> ?

<dd>Removed name of company co-owner and his religious group affiliation as it is completely irrelevant. BSR is not owned by one person and is not an OR business. Also removed references to publications as they contain images of archaeological finds and not the black sun of this article, save for a couple of instances. Are you going to list every instance of the sunwheel or fylfot or individual runes in OR publications?

<dd>this article being on the "occult symbol" itself, and not just on its role in Nazi mysticism, it would be perfectly fair to mention any notable publication that features the symbol. What was removed was't that terribly notable however, and I do not have an opinion here. It will not do to repeat the "non-racist non political" mantra every time <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinic_Rite_ba67.html" title="Odinic Rite">Odinic Rite</a> is mentioned; the group is clearly folkish and as such far from politically neutral. It also stands to reason that <i>by</i> employing a symbol that is notable for the Nazis' interest in it, and <i>not</i> as a historical pagan symbol, they <i>do</i> put themselves in a Nazi mysticist context (that is, the authors of the individual publications; their affiliation to a larger group is, as Hengest notes, irrelevant as long as they do not appear as spokesperson for the group). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 12:08, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The symbol of the "black sun" that is shown in the article is not conform with the floor-mosaic in the north-tower of Wewelsburg castle:</p>

<dd>Thank You! Here is a possible explanation, why the ornament is called "black sun" at all: The room of the hall of pillars itself (where the ornament takes place) is normally closed for visitors but you can watch inside the room from outside through a gate. From the other side of the room lots of light shines through the windows and reflects on the marmoreal floor. On the photos I personally took from the ornament, it appears black, because of the bad visibility conditions. That COULD be an answer, why the ornament in general is called the "black sun".

I think the information given further in the article stresses this: "The motif (of the ornament) is reproduced from bronze brooches (Zierfibeln) from the 7th century."

<p>The german pronounciation of Wewelsburg "Vay-Vuls-Burg" is wrong. The second "e" of the word "WewElsburg" is pronounced the same as the first "e" of the word "WEwelsburg". In common parlance the second "e" is swallowed so that a realistic pronounciation sounds more like "Vay-Vls-Burg".</p>

<dd>In the TV-interview he explicitly states that there was a golden disk in the middle of the Wewelsburg-ornament. He talks about the Wewelsburg-ornament and not about any brooch. I personally have doubts about all those postwar mystic theories about a black "anti-sun". (Why is the ornament green and not black?) The institute "Ancestral Heritage" (Ahnenerbe) was seeking for a germanic primordial religion and they had the opinion that - if such a religion really ever existed - in this religion a sun-cult was an important matter. When you see the Wewelsburg as the religious center of the SS (and what they did was trying to revive old pagan cults) in my opinion they simply placed a sun-symbolism as ornament at this central point of this building. A golden disc in its middle would affirm this. As far as I know the Wewelsburg was looted shortly before the end of the war. This could be an answer to your last question. I think the film of Sünner is good investigated and IS a reliable source. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.133.45.237_8e43.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.133.45.237">84.133.45.237</a> (talk) 18:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<p>Yes, the documentary is an ancellent source for information and he gives academic references for all of the stuff in it. But, he does NOT give any evidence for the gold disk theory, no matter how reasonable it may or may not seem, this is speculation. As for the SS, it was primarily Himmler and his closest comrades that wanted to revive (but also mix and match) cult worship - this is not exactly a revival of "old pagan cults" but "bits and bobs" (I do not know what that would be in German). Yes, the SS and Himmler did a deal for archaeology and interest in Germanic traditions but also a great deal of disaster. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_C_Prenic_012e.html" title="User:Robert C Prenic">The Most Honourably Great Sir Dr. Robert C Prenic the 3rd, all Adademic Degrees.</a> 22:23, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
