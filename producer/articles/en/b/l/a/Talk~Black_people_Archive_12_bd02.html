<p>OKay one person agrees with me. Does Ezeu and Fill agree that this article be divided into 2 separate articles black people (ethnicity) and black people (generic)? That way the editors who feel strongly that only African ancestry people are black can work on the black people (ethnicity) article, and those who feel strongly that Australian aboriginals and other dark skinned people are black can work on the black people (generic) article. That way both sides wont be competing to monopolize the same article. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">Gottoupload</a> 02:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not care what you call the new articles. However, one should try to reduce confusion if possible, so adding the (ethnicity) and (generic) qualifiers is fairly reasonable I would think. Maybe someone will have a better idea for names. The ethnic one I like more than the generic one, to be honest. One could imagine black people (race) or "Groups called black people" I suppose. None of them grab me as much as Black people (ethnicity). One could have "black ethnic group" or or "Black Ethnic Groups" or Black people (US) and Black people (Australia) (pointed at Aborgines maybe), for example. I have no really strong feelings except that I like Black people (ethnicity) most.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 03:38, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What exactly is "Black people (ethnicity)"? Black people are not an ethnic group. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_British_b172.html" title="Black British">Black British</a> people are an ethnic group. <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> are a different ethnic group. Both of these groups are of recent African descent, but thhey are ethnically very disimilar. Indeed West Indian culture and society (ethnicity) is not at all like African American culture and society, and both are very different to modern African cultures and societies, which themselves are far from homogeneous. If "Black people (ethnicity)" is supposed to include all Black people of recent African descent then it cannot be given the label (ethnicity). Who would we include in a "Black people (ethnicity)" article? Who would we include in a "Black people (generic)" article? I'm asking because I do not understand what the distinction is supposed to be. I do not think there is such a thing as an ethnic group called "Black people". This does not mean that one doesn't exist of course, just because I don't think it exists doesn't mean that it doesn't, so I'm not looking for a fight, just clarification. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 06:55, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not completely clear what the editor has in mind either, but I think any reasonable division is worthwhile trying, given the level of confusion and fighting. My understanding is that the motivation is to use Black people (ethnic) to refer to African Americans and west Africans together, possibly with others of recent West African ancestry. This might sound flimsy to me and you, but if the editors can make a coherent case that this is a reasonable subcategory and a coherent ethnic group, then let them try. There certainly seem to be a few here on the talk pages who are frantic to redefine black people to mean that, and who want to reject all other meanings of the phrase "black people". This article would then mainly be about people who call themselves black or who have been called black. I have long advocated multiple overlapping pages so that the full range of what it means to be black or of African origin can be explored. So if they want to try, I say let them. It might fail, but why not try?--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 13:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i'm not against the idea. I would call the article something else though, it's certainly not an ethnic group. There is already an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a> article, and as I pointed out there are <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_British_b172.html" title="Black British">Black British</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> articles si I don't know what would be included in this article. I would call it something like "Black people (African perspective)" or something like that, I'm open to suggestions, but the ethnic label is just wrong as far as I can see. On the whole it's not a bad idea, except that it doesn't really resolve the problem, and it makes little sense to me. It would be better just to include both POVs in this article, have a section about "Black people defined as recent African descent" and another section called something like "Black people as a generic label". I think having two broad sections giving both POVs would fit the NPOV policy better. I think it is important to include both POVs for neutrality, and the attempt to strictly define the article in terms of exclusively recent African origin is a clear breach of the NPOV policy. It is simply incorrect to claimt that the more generic meaning does not exist, we have enough definitions to prove that both points of view are valid. But I'm not going to stand int he way of a split if there is a consensus for one. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 13:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure the title is appropriate either. And I think that the generic article, which this would presumably become, would have to have short summary sections or at least a sentence describing the more restricted meaning, with a direction to the more extended article. Part of the reason to have a suite of articles is that this is a huge topic. There is no way it can be accommodated adequately in a single article, which I have been saying for several months now. For example, see my list above (which is probably just a tiny fraction of what exists or could exist). --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 13:27, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't quite understand. So the South Asians noticed that their natives had dark skin and called them aeta (which supposedly means black). Then centuries later, African diasporas people noticed that they had dark skin and called themselves black. We're talking about 2 separate groups who coincentally were called by the same name because they coincedentally looked similar. But is this a rational to lump them into the same article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why the 2 defintions must be separated</span></h2>
<p>The word Indian has 2 meanings: Defintion 1: Someone from India. Definition 2: A native American. These are 2 totally separate ethnic groups and they deserve separate articles. Does anyone think it would make any sense to put Indians from India and Native American Indians into one article? So why put the 2 definitions of black people into one article. One definition is for people of recent African origina (an ethnic racial definition), the other definition is for any dark skinned person (a generic descriptive definition). These 2 definitions are conceptually distinct and used in totally different contexts. The fact that the aeta may derive from a word that means black in tagalog has nothing to do with African diasporas ethnicity adopting the term black in the 1960s. It's just a coincedence that both groups have dark skin and were called black. It's absurd to try to merge totally different ethnic groups into one article as if we're discussing a single unified concept __<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:54, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see no sense. Indian used for a Native of the Americas had a totally distinct meaning from Indian meaning "a person from India". This is very different from the use of "black" as a racial label. No one has ever proposed a "pan Indian" identity in the way that various activists propose an interntional Black identity. There was never a notion of "indian" conciousness that united the two. There was never a racialist model that merged Americans and indians as a single "indian race". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 17:42, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yellow Chinese? Usually people say Han Chinese to distinguish them from the many minority groups that are also citizens of the Peoples Republic of China. There are Chinese nationals (Uighurs in particular) who have light skins and even blue eyes. One of my teachers attended a government function in which members of all nationality groups were assembled (this was some time before the end of World War II I believe) and reported with amusement that some of the Han Chinese attendees could not understand what the "foreigners" were doing in the conference. Such a recognition of the complex family histories (in the case of the "blue eyed foreigners" going back to Turkik groups) is not racist. It just recognizes genetic complexity (and often it is involved with cultural complexity too). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 23:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the soln like Han Chinese is simple. If you talk about Han Chinese for Chinese then you cant talk about Black African, you can say Somali African or Afar African, or Amhara African. I didnt call u racist, far from it, u just dont know better. big difference. racist language doesnt mean u r racist. I called people Eskimos i didnt know it was wrong. There needs to be logic behind reason. U cant have people called black and exclude another group which is also called black, because we rep a world view. Now i believe most of these issues can be solved be debate and logic. We r not suppose to all agree but add the diversity of opinions to the discussion. American Africans or African in America, or African Americans might want to "copyright" black, then say that what they want. and offer their view in the article. But i have to put down my foot at these strange terms, because many use it dont make it correct, a few years back Negro was used, today it is offensive, so is black African. it doesn’t match the trend anywhere else in the world. brown Indians, no Punjabi Indians, Silet Bengalis, popularity doesnt bring justification, just like the N-word. should we use it just because J-lo does? shes popular.lets be progressive how do you think societies evolve?--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 00:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Halaqah. If we go with what is popular at the moment we go with emotions. If we want to start someplace it is better to start with a clear discussion of what <b>is</b> first, and then when we get that as clear as we can we can ask what various people <b>call</b> these groups. We have a great new opportunity since for the first time we begin to get a picture of how the members of his huge family of man are actually related. So for Africa it would make sense to me to look at the ancient San as the core population, see how it has evolved down to the modern San, see how, along the way, side shoots developed that produced <i>klados</i> that evolved to fit into other environments (darker skins for higher UV, probably would be one). It may be that some groups that are genetically quite closely related don't get along well together and like to be called by different names. It may be that some groups have taken over the language of another group and maybe even the culture and so appear to fit in with some populations that are genetically rather more remote from them. But at least we would have something that can be carried down to empirical observations. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 03:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I think there is a need to organize these topics. The more I look into this, the more I realize we have a huge number of related articles, and a huge amount of material on this page that was deleted. I would propose that we use some of the energy that is being wasted in arguing and deleting material here to clean up this article and the others. Lots of the related articles need more work. This article can be one of the "overview" articles. I propose that this article be focused on "who is black?" and have links or connections to other articles, such as African American and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_related_to_Black_and_African_people_3e4a.html" title="List of topics related to Black and African people">List of topics related to Black and African people</a>.

<dd>I never saw the movie, but I think the point may have been to put white people in the position of the despised minority for once just to let them see what they would feel like. Steven Barnes has done a fine job of that in a two-volume set of "alternate history" science fiction novels, <i>Lion's Blood</i> and <i>Zulu Heart</i>. In his book Caesar gets tangled up in Africa, Africa takes over the leadership of the world, Europe declines, Africa colonizes the New World, and a far-seeing African Muslim starts to see beyond the blinders of his society, the society that has enslaved whites. There was a famous experiment, done in Iowa if I remember correctly, in which a grade school teacher divided her class into the privileged brown-eyed kids and the dastardly blue-eyed rotters, let the brown-eyed white kids lord it over the blue-eyed kids for a period of time and then switched roles. She demonstrated that the ones who had first been discriminated against were much kinder to the "lower class" when they got on top than those who simply started in that position without any real understanding of what it felt like to be the abused party. Since moving to "the south" in the U.S. I've had near-violent confrontations with four different white men (one with a guy who let his German Shepherds roam to keep the "riff-raff" off his grass), but nothing but good will from the African-Americans (and I started out in life with almost white hair so there has never been any doubt about which group I fit into on the basis of "marker traits."). So I think the basic psychological observation is doubly proven, and maybe movies like <i>Planet of the Apes</i> can have a positive effect. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 04:39, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>his article refers to black as a racial or ethnic term defined by African origin ethnicity.

<dd>Of course halaqh. The problem is, there are MANY African Americans on this site and visiting this article. There are more of them than anyone else probably. And as you can tell, they are often <b>REALLY</b> angry about something or other. Usually that the rest of the world is not ready to go along with them. They feel they have the right to do what they want. They have earned it because they are Americans and their ancestors were slaves. So if you object, they claim you are racist. It is a common and understandable tactic. Looking at this page, I say we have two main camps. The inclusive camp and the restricted camp. Most but not all African Americans fall in the restricted camp. So maybe we can solve this by giving them their own page. And keeping this page as an inclusive article.

<p>It is also unfair to lump African Americans together and asign to them a certain perspective. There have certainly been several African Americans here that have had a broad view.

I do not want some AA showing up again extremely upset since they have a different definition of "black" and insist that all other definitions be stomped out. We have seen <b>way</b> too many people here who want to declare that <b>everyone else's definition of black is crap</b> and that <b>there is no disagreement since I have declared it to be true by fiat</b>. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 16:00, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">British census</span></h2>
<p>Here's a summary of results for "Other" groups, like "White Other" and "Black Other".<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/nojournal/other_ethnicgroups.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/nojournal/other_ethnicgroups.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It's clear that anyone who self describes as Black can include themselves in this category. Indeed although most people who describe themselves as "Black Other" are of recent African descent, it is clear that people from Oceanea or Asia can identify here if they so wish. Indeed on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_British_d404.html" title="White British">White British</a> article it clearly states that self identity is the requirement. There is no coercion in the UK, indeed we don't think in terms of "race" so much as "ethnicity", the census does not collect data on race, neither does it narrowly define what group any person may fit into. Usually there is a space for people to indicate their identity as they see fit. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 13:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

i say again ethnicity is Bengali, Somali, Ethiopian, Amhara, Gurage, Sindi, this is ethnicity, Black is not an ethnic group, its just a broad label for a collection of ethnic groups. Is it me or am i making sense. That British things is a constant battle ground. see www.ligali.org and even the report which came out of the mayors office, the Mayor of London, cant remember it but it was a diversity study. They uses the term Asian and African, and replaced the usage of the word black.black is very dated and many people have issues with it, it is just the media have power and final voice, the whole issue with black lowercase, i mean it makes no sense, so why lowercase, because so stupid tradition in chicago says so, is that a reason in 2007 for something which makes no sense? the world needs to move forward man--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 14:18, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would also agree with this. However, most African Americans and other Africans that have been gone from Africa for many generations do not know their ancestral ethnicity. So they invent one. And you see it in the USA. "Black" culture. Jazz. Hip hop. Rap. Gangstas. Pimpin'. Ebonics. Etc. And they are told over and over to be proud. There is a "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_History_Month_8597.html" title="Black History Month">Black History Month</a>" celebrated every year. The US government has a "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Caucus_56cd.html" title="Black Caucus">Black Caucus</a>". You will not easily get African American blacks to give this label up since it is everywhere around them, embedded in the culture and the government. And Americans in general are completely ignorant of the world outside of the US. A large fraction of the US population cannot even find the US on a map of the world, according to some studies. So they do not know what black means in the rest of the world nor do they care since they are Americans and the attitude in the US comes from being told over and over that the US is the best country and no other contries matter. So is it surprising what they think about "black"? In the US, "Black" is a label of pride. "Black" is a term used to intimidate others, often. "Black" is used as a powerful political weapon, a phrase used to get your own way. Because the US civil rights movement flowered when "black" was the preferred term in the US (not negro, not colored, not Afro American, not African American), the word "black" has an almost mythic quality in the US. If you in Africa object, it is irrelevant almost because Africa has this mythic quality that has nothing to do with reality. With the mess that African Americans have made of Liberia for instance. In some ways, I suspect African Americans do not care what Africans think, because they are primitive and poor. And they probably believe all that they need to do is enlighten the Africans so they can be like African Americans, wearing their grills and pimpin'. "Yo yo in da house wha up mo fo?

<dd>Who are you and what do you want to say? I think that there are plenty of problems with African American culture, and American culture, but a lot of good things too. I do not believe any group is all good or all bad. That is too simplistic.

<dd>Maybe because he does not resort to insult. I remember the last time I was in the US, I heard a news report about some new drug, which might help to "save the lives of thousands of Americans". I remember thinking how odd it was to report the news in this way. In Britain the BBC would never say "this new drug could save the lives of thousands of Britons" it would just say "this new drug could save thousands of lives". I don't think the report <i>meant</i> to imply that non-American lives were worthless, it just seemed to take for granted that only Americans were worth mentioning. Whenever I am in the US, I do find the particular US obsession with race to ber very bizarre, along with the unrelenting obsession with how wonderful the US is. This strange need to endless tell themselves how great they are started to seem pathological after a while - as though there was a need for enmdless reassurance. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 16:55, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have noticed this and mentioned it on this page.***NOTE: NOT ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS DO THIS. BUT SOME SURE DO.*** I live in a neighborhood that is about 70% African American. If I talk about Europe, they OFTEN assume that it is also about 70% African American. If I talk about Canada, they assume it is also about 70% African American. If there are Mexicans immigrants here, they assume that Mexico has black-white racial problems like the US does. If you mention Japan or China or India, the first thing African Americans want to know about is the problem between the blacks and whites in China or Japan or India. It is the prism through which they view the entire world. If there is a new drug treatment found that will mainly work with caucasians and not so well for Africans, they charge racism. If there are only 42 members of the US Congress out of 435, they assume it is because of racism. Not that there are only 9-13% African Americans in the country as a whole. They think that there should be 300 or so African Americans in Congress, so it should be more like what they see in their own neighborhood. I do not fault them because they do not know. But to argue against them is hopeless because they are sure you are lying to them because you are racist. Even if you are another minority. They see the world as black and white, not as a palette of colors. ***NOTE: NOT ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS DO THIS.

<dd>Halaqah you are definitely correct. African Americans have had the short end of the stick and are jailed at much higher rates than other groups, and are much more poorly educated than other groups. Do you know that the average African American in my area (a huge population of a few million) reads at about a grade 3 level? So....I do not say there are not reasons for this, and good reasons.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lead paragraph</span></h2>
<p>Currently, the lead paragraph says that "Black people" is a "strange term", which it arguably isn't, so I've edited that out. Furthermore, as evident in the discussions above, the lead paragraph should in a neutral way explain (or at least mention) the ambiguities and disparities regarding the term "black people" – and which is the reason for the disputes on this page and elsewhere. My edit of the lead paragraph (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=92967095&amp;oldid=92878586|see" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people&amp;diff=92967095&amp;oldid=92878586|see" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) is an attempt to reflect the discussion on this page. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 18:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Timelist said in his edit summary that we agreed to create two separate articles. The issue has been discussed, but there is obviously no consensus to create separate articles. The consensus, as far as I can deduce, is that creating separate articles may quell the dispute, but it would not adress or clear the issue of POV, and furthermore it would be an abdication to systemic bias.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 19:50, 8 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

So then, what is a "black person"?</p>
<ul>
<li>someone with dark skin?</li>
<li>someone of African Ancestry&#160;?</li>
<li>someone with dark skin and african Ancestry?</li>
<li>someone with dark skin and African Ancestry from a certain part of Africa?</li>
<li>someone with African Ancestry of a certain part of Africa?</li>
<li>someone with recent african Ancestry only? How recent?</li>
<li>someone with dark skin? how dark?</li>
<li>someone who self identifies as black?</li>
<li>someone with dark skin who self identifies as black?</li>
<li>someone other groups call black?</li>
<li>someone who has been called black by others?</li>
</ul>
<p>And on and on and on. <b>THERE IS NO UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF A BLACK PERSON</b>. I live in the US. I am sitting in a library in a "white" area. I guarantee that if right now, through that door over there a full-blooded, dark skinned Aborigine walked in, everyone in this library, Caucasian American and African American would call them black. NO QUESTION. Not even a moment's hesitation. And I know from talking to them and reading the literature, that in Australia, they refer to themselves as "black fellas". But according to many on this page, and according to the way that the article is written sometimes, there is no way that this person is black and in fact we would all know it immediately when we looked at this Aborigine. I dispute that quite vigorously. Why are there elements here who want to insist that there is no disagreement? <b>WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT?</b> What evidence for the nonexistence of disagreement do you have? Since I have been reading this page for the last <b>FIVE MONTHS</b> there has been nothing but disagreement from Africans, African Americans, Black Europeans, Caucasians, Asians, South Asians, etc. How can you imply there is no disgreement? What are your reasons? Why try to stomp out disagreement?

<dd>We should'nt constantly need to shout out loud that "black people" is a term that is not, and will never be defined to the acceptance of everyone. That is quite obvious (constantly writing it out in capitals and boldface is tedious). We merely need to state in the article the fact that there are differing views. What some people do not understand is; that one leans towards one viewpoint shouldn't necessarily mean that one refutes or abhorres other opinions. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 20:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize if my repetition of this statement over and over in large capital letters and bold lettering is tedious. But I am trying to make a point. I am glad Ezeu at least agrees with me that this statement is fairly obvious. Which I think it is, from anyone who has read these pages carefully. I think that some people would like to avoid this "inconvenient truth". Now given that there is disagreement, the best we can hope for is to have an article that reflects this. People arguing for their own personal definition or viewpoint will never convince the others. It will never make the fact of disagreement disappear.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 20:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally, one potential partial resolution is to make a collection of black and African people articles that reflects the disagreements and differing definitions that exist. Take a look at the list I started at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_related_to_Black_and_African_people_3e4a.html" title="List of topics related to Black and African people">List of topics related to Black and African people</a>. If you look at <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> and all its list of topics associated with it, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Africanism_0097.html" title="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanism</a> and all the list of topics associated with it, and all the related topics that are associated with each of these articles, it is clear that we have literally HUNDREDS upon hundreds of articles about Black and African people. They are not well organized and cross-linked etc. Some articles are in bad shape. Some are stubs. Some need editing. Some new articles need to be written. But given that African Americans are so prominent on Wikipedia and the internet, I would argue that for that subset of African Americans that want to define black people in an African American way, there should be no problem with allowing them to have a separate article, say Black people (US meaning) or something comparable. Then the history of the use of the phrase "black people" in an African American context can be fully explored and described. And this article can be reserved for a more general viewpoint. An alternative is to turn this page into a disambiguation page, and move the present article to Who is a black person? or Black people (global meaning) or Meaning of the term "black people" or something similar. That way the short name "black people" that everyone wants to fight about would be available to none, and used for disambiguation. This is more a Solomon-type solution: "cut the baby in half".--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 20:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
