<p>These are some thoughts I've had as I read this and related entries here. Yes, I'm thinking about editing this a bit myself. I have the facts, but I want to get references together.</p>
<p>There is room for more in this entry. Some thoughts on that subject:</p>
<p>1) The article on "forge" is pretty good and covers much the same ground. That should be linked at least. Should give some thought to where the information is better put and how much detail.</p>
<p>2) The entry would be improved with more historical information and more bibliographical information.</p>
<p>3)There should be some connection to basic tools and techniques. Again this could be addressed by connecting to "forge".</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that blacksmith/blacksmithing should be a separate section as it refers to the trade and tradesperson involved. "forge" seems to refer more to the particular tool/equipment and the processes involved.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of moving some journal entries from the last several Summers of reenactments and smithing into a Wikibook. From that I want to link to several entries here. Both this one and some in Metalwork. For those who might be interested the link to that book is:</p>

<p>It is, admittedly, rougher than I care for, but it's a start.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that as I pass the links to other smiths I know that this will get more input.</p>
<p>My hope for the Wikibook is that it is a point of entry into these other articles and vice versa. It's intent is to be as hands-on as I can make an e-book.</p>
<p>Some of that hinges on the weather getting warm so I can make some pictures of what is going on in the book. Until the ground thaws I'll work on the words and pages.</p>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and 'be bold' and fix some information on this page I believe to be inaccurate. But I don't happen to have an authoritative source at hand, so I won't object if someone elects to roll back my changes, provided there is justification.</p>
<p>1)Traditional japanese samurai swords were for use primarily against unarmored opponents; were used in slashing and draw-cut techniques that do not jar the steel overmuch: were forged using (often) very poor japanese steels which led to the folding techniques; were not usually tempered in the same manner as western weapons.</p>
<p>2)Blaksmiths use all sorts of blowtorches, not just oxyacetylene (my teacher uses oxy-propane, for example). I'm making this ref less specific.</p>
<p>3)While its true that low-carbon wrought iron is easier to forge weld than mild steel or carbon steel, all are readily forge-weldable (I have done it myself, as a beginner).</p>
<p>Overall I'd like to see expansion of this article with more in-depth information about various techniques. --<a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELeperflesh_e32b.html" title="User:Leperflesh">Leperflesh</a> 20:32, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I like how this has been fleshed out. I've added a few sections on techniques and tools. I didn't have my dictionary handy so my apologies in advance for typos, formatting and any other faux pas.</p>
<p>I tried to avoid duplicating some of the tool entries. I'm sure there are a number of links to more information that should be in there but I figured the additions made sense in this article and better to get them in while I had the time than to take the time to make them pretty. Apologies for any offense. I'll make an effort in the next couple of weeks to check some of my teaching materials to find better definitions and descriptions of the basic operations and such.</p>
<p>Part of me wants this to have a ton more pictures ... and then I start wondering if that's too much for one article. I'm open to pushing some of what I added out into sub articles if that would be more appropriate.</p>

<dd>Erraunt -- I think these are excellent additions. One thing I questioned was whether there should be so much description of the types of welding other than forge welding, since these aren't traditional blacksmithing techniques. I think maybe a brief mention of the fact that modern blacksmiths sometimes use modern welding techniques, with a link to <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welding.html" title="Welding">Welding</a>, would be better. I think more pictures would be great. A lot of things would be much clearer with a good picture, like a selection of hammers, maybe an illustration of upsetting, all kinds of things. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 12:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KarlBunker -- agree completely. Got busy writing and kind of just kept going and so we have the MIG and TIG. My main goal was to get what in the local guild we call the "basic operations" into the article. I think they're important and I'm trying to find a middle ground between a meaningless listing and a how-to. There is tons more that could be done both with this article and the rest of the metalworking project. Unfortunately I don't have the time I'd like. But I was looking at it last night and going "not quite enough". <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErraunt_13dd.html" title="User:Erraunt">Erraunt</a> 15:04, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did some more editing this morning and need to do more.</p>
<p>For the record I debated on expanding the basic processes as there is a "Forge" article which does discuss forging. However that article describes what I would call "commercial forging" as in a manufacturing process. I think, at least for now, in "Blacksmith" it's appropriate to talk about the processes of forging as accomplished with the basic hand tools traditionally associated with the blacksmith. OK, maybe I'm taking advantage of the organic nature of Wiki and putting it here until time and opinion develop and it becomes more evident where these should best be. I place some value on getting the information in and findable over trying to find the *perfect* location for the information.</p>
<p>Right now in the back of my mind is a debate on if the basic operations should be offloaded, eventually, to individual articles with much more detail. I don't know how necessary or appropriate that would be and my current thinking is to just get this clean and tight and down the way when more illustrations are available a separate article might be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Tools needs work next I think. There are articles on the particular tools in other sections. Illustrations again are an issue. Had I time and Photoshop running or my scanner up I'd just sketch or photograph and upload.</p>
<p>Is it time to put more of a focus to this article? Would it be appropriate to say in the beginning that this article will focus on "traditional" blacksmithing and leave more modern and production methods to other articles?</p>
<p>This brings to mind that the history of the craft section could, appropriately, be expanded. Thoughts? Opinions? Brickbats? <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErraunt_13dd.html" title="User:Erraunt">Erraunt</a> 18:00, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re. <i>It should be noted that none of the four basic forging operations remove stock.</i> Punching can remove stock. (I remember some book talking about the great amusement old-time blacksmiths would find in watching a barefoot apprentice who has stepped on the hot billet of metal knocked out by a punch.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>I don't think any more detail is needed on the basic operations, and I suspect that offloading them to individual articles would bring objections that such articles are "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" (part of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.)</dd>
<dd>I don't think it's necessary to say that the article focuses on "traditional" blacksmithing. I think people perceive blacksmithing as being inherently a "traditional" craft.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and "pien" is an accepted alternate spelling, though personally I like "peen" much better.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 18:22, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re. <i>It should be noted that none of the four basic forging operations remove stock.</i> Punching can remove stock. (I remember some book talking about the great amusement old-time blacksmiths would find in watching a barefoot apprentice who has stepped on the hot billet of metal knocked out by a punch.&#160;:: Re. the forgoing ... you know I thought about putting "at most a negligible amount of stock" in there.&#160;:) Yes, when punching there is, typically, a small disk that pops loose at the very end, occasionally a slug if you use another method. Most of the stock when punching is pushed away widening and lengthening the stock at that point. Strictly speaking, yes, there is *some* stock removed in punching operations. Usually most of the stock is pushed out of the way. Different from drilling where the stock is cut out of the hole removing material.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I know you aren't arguing the point, but thought I'd let you know.</p>
<p>And I'm trying to figure out how to say this without sounding like I'm bragging or putting someone in their place, but while I'm not what I would consider a professional blacksmith, I do smith and have for over 6 years steadily, I teach occasionally at the local Guild of Metalsmiths and elsewhere, and I demonstrate regularly. And I've made stuff and sold it which, I guess, technically, makes me a professional.</p>
<p>So I know what happens when you put a punch through a piece of steel (and I don't wear opentopped boots!)</p>
<p>That said: challenge me on anything I write. I'm fallible, and while maybe "more expert", I will not claim to be "an expert". I don't know the backgrounds of other contributors, but figured since I know I've had hands on experience with this stuff and have read a few of the "classics" on the subject that I would try to bring my direct experience into these articles as much as I can. (Which is some of why the forge welding section shifted to descriptive rather than technically detailed.)</p>
<p>On "peen", I like the other spelling too, but having used both "pien" and "pein" and not remembering which way it is or if the "i" before "e" rule applied I opted for "peen" because it's simpler.</p>
<p>Remember, us blacksmith types are about efficiency.&#160;;)</p>
<p>I'll leave the operations as they are. Not to toot my own horn, but I feel they do something for the article. You know it's a fairly focused thing. I bet we could put just a little more flesh on the bones and a bit of polish and it could be one of those "more complete" kinds of articles. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErraunt_13dd.html" title="User:Erraunt">Erraunt</a> 02:06, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appreciate the editing you did the last few days. I may have some technical issues with some of what you removed.

<p>I made the following change today back toward the orignial writing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example to fashion a cross peen hammer head a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face, the handle hole would be punched and drifted, the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge, and the face would be dressed by upsetting.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know how to put it better. At the end of making a hammer head, the face is "dressed" roughly smoothed and usually given a slight dome or convex surface. It does not get wider. To get it noticably wider would take so much upsetting as to distort the peen and the eye and it would be a *lot* of work. "Upsetting" is the process that is happening at this point. It isn't as overt as the upsetting you do on a rod end for fashion a rivet head, but it's still upsetting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this was an attempt to get across that these processes don't necessarily happen in isolation. A smith doesn't go "first we draw, like *this*, then take another heat and upset like *this*". It happens on the fly. If I'm working out a chisel blade I'm hammering along to draw it out over the horn and I see it getting a little spread at one point so in a heartbeat I have it on the face and up on edge, give it a few raps to bring it into line, a quick check and back to the horn for more drawing before I loose the heat.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm tilting windmills, but it's this kind of thing that would illustrate a blacksmith's work and how it differs from other kinds of metalwork that are more "manufacturing" and "factory" work. Hope this makes sense. 128.101.114.146 21:07, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can someone confirm whether the following is true? I'd heard that in ancient times, blacksmiths were often hobbled (intentially crippled) by their villages to ensure they did not leave. The reason for this was that they were so valuable to a community that their departure meant economic/technological doom for a community.</p>
<p>I had also heard that this is the reason why Hephaeseus (sp?) is shown as crippled in the greek myths. Any references on this? If this is true I think it would be an excellent addition to this article since it deomonstrates how incredibly important blacksmiths were to communities.

<dd>That was my plan. I am new to wikipedia, so I go off on long howto tangents. Thanks for the categories.<a href="../../../f/c/i/User%7EFciron_7f09.html" title="User:Fciron">Fciron</a> 05:15, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the page does have substantial info on blacksmithing, the context is... well... unusual, let's say. I'm not sure this is an appropriate link? --<a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELeperflesh_e32b.html" title="User:Leperflesh">Leperflesh</a> 21:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I concur. This (P.A. Blacksmith) page should not be linked from here. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_Gadarn_2814.html" title="User:Hu Gadarn">Hu Gadarn</a> 23:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Although the context is odd, it explains why some people are interested in blacksmithing. I don't have any problems with the blacksmithing part of the article, even though the theology is suspect. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 23:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
